let your light so shine before men  bernard gilpin  portrait of bernard gilpin  the life of bernard gilpin  by william gilpin m a of queens college oxford  the second edition  london inted for john and james rivington in st pauls churchyard  mdccliii  the life of bernard gilpin section i bernard gilpin was born in the year      about the middle of the reign of henry the eighth his forefathers had been seated at kentmirehall in westmoreland from the time of king john in whose reign this estate had been given by a baron of kendal to richard gilpin as a reward for services thought very considerable carleton bishop of chichester who wrote the life of bernard gilpin mentions this richard as a person eminent in his time both in a civil and military capacity and gives us a story told indeed with a fabulous air of his killing a wild boar which terribly infested those parts from this gentleman the estate of kentmire descended to the father of bernard edwin gilpin who became prematurely possessed of it by the death of an elder brother killed at the battle of bosworth in the cause most probably of richard the third whose gallant behavior and very popular government a few years before in scotland had established him greatly in the esteem of the northern counties  edwin gilpin had several children of which bernard was one of the youngest an unhappy circumstance in that age which giving little encouragement to the liberal arts and less to commerce restrained the genius and industry of younger brothers no way indeed was commonly open to their fortunes but the church or the camp the inconvenience however was less to mr gilpin than to others for that way was open to which his disposition most led him from his earliest youth he was inclined to a contemplative life thoughtful reserved and serious perhaps no one ever had a greater share of constitutional virtue or through every part of life endeavored more to improve it  the bishop of chichester has preserved a story of him in his infancy which will show how early he could discern not only the immorality but the indecorum of an action  a begging friar came on a saturday evening to his fathers house where according to the custom of those times he was received in a very hospitable manner the plenty set before him was a temptation too strong for his virtue of which it seems he had not sufficient even to save appearances the next morning however he ordered the bell to toll and from the pulpit expressed himself with great vehemence against the debauchery of the times and particularly against drunkenness mr gilpin who was then a child upon his mothers knee seemed for some time exceedingly affected with the friers discourse and at length with the utmost indignation cried out he wondered how that man could preach against drunkenness when he himself had been drunk only the night before  instances of this kind soon discovered the seriousness of his disposition and gave his parents an early presage of his future piety  his first years were spent at a public school where agreeably to the compliment which history generally pays such as afterward become eminent we are told he soon distinguished himself  from school he was removed to oxford where it was judged learning was most encouraged though indeed both the universities were in that age greatly overrun with ignorance and superstition effects of the slavish opinions then prevailing in religion and what study was encouraged was confined to perplexed systems of logic and the subtilties of school divinity so that the best education of those times was only calculated for very slender improvements in real learning  at the age however of sixteen mr gilpin was entered upon the foundation at queens college in oxford where we are informed his industry was very great and easily reaped what knowledge the soil produced  erasmus about this time drew the attention of the learned world with a noble freedom he shook off the prejudices of his education boldly attacked the reigning superstitions of popery and exposed the lazy and illiterate churchmen of those days such a behavior could not but procure him many enemies and occasioned objections to whatever he could write at oxford particularly he was far from being in general esteem our young student had however too much of the true spirit of a scholar to take any thing upon trust or to be prejudiced against an author from popular exceptions without listening therefore to what was said he took erasmus into his hands and quickly discovered in him a treasure of real learning which he had in vain sought after in the writings then most in esteem  but as he had now determined to apply himself to divinity he made the scriptures his chief study and set himself with great industry upon gaining a thorough knowledge of the greek and hebrew languages in the study of which he was much assisted by mr neal a fellow of newcollege and afterward professor of hebrew in oxford  he had not been long in the university before he was taken notice of he was looked upon as a young man of good parts and considerable learning and they who were not so well qualified to judge in either of these points admired and loved him for a remarkable sweetness in his disposition and unaffected sincerity in his manners at the usual term he took the degree of master of arts and about the same time was elected fellow of his college  the reformed doctrines had hitherto made no progress in england and as mr gilpin had been bred up in the romish church he still continued a member of it but though in appearance he was not dissatified with popery yet it is not improbable that at this time he had his suspicions of it the writings of erasmus had put him upon freer inquiries than were common in those days he had the discretion however to keep to himself whatever doubts they might have raised in him and before he said any thing which might shake the faith of others he determined to establish his own  he had not been long settled in his fellowship before a very public testimony was given to the reputation he had acquired  cardinal wolsey was now at the head of the affairs of england a minister who notwithstanding his many vices would sometimes entertain a noble design he saw the corrupt state of monkery in the nation was scandalized at it and began to think of some method to check its progress the monastic revenues he was convinced might easily be applied to better uses particularly in raising the credit of the two universities he was resolved therefore to make a trial and with this view obtained bulls for the supression of several monasteries being thus enabled to carry on his design he laid the foundation of christchurch college in oxford and about this time finished it but his care extending farther than a mere endowment he had his agents in many of the universities in europe to procure him men of eminence whom he might transplant thither and copies of the best books then extant for he designed that his college should be the means of the restoration of learning in england mr gilpins character was then so great that he was one of the first in oxford to whom the cardinals agents applied he accepted their proposal and removed to christchurch  here he continued his former studies from the nature of which and the ingenuity and honesty of his disposition it is highly probable he would in time have been led by his own reasonings to that discovery of truth he aimed at but providence rewarded a pious endeavor by throwing in his way the means of an earlier attainment of it  king henry the eighth was now dead and his young successor began in earnest to support that cause which his father had only so far encouraged as it contributed to replenish an exhausted exchequer and break a yoke which sat uneasy upon him under this princes patronage peter martyr went to oxford where he read divinitylectures in a strain to which the university had been hitherto little accustomed he began with the corporal presence the refutation of which error as it was one of the earliest of popery he thought would much shock the credit of the romish church this was looked upon as an open declaration of war the bigoted were immediately in flame if these novelties prevailed the peace of the church was at an end  nothing but confusion must ensue  religion was utterly ruined while this was the popular clamor the heads of the popish party began to rouse from an indolence they had long indulged and to set about a more formidable opposition the chief of them were chedsey morgan and tresham men not unlearned for the times but whose bigotry at least kept pace with their learning  the history of this religious war is foreign to our purpose we are no otherwise concerned in it than as it relates to mr gilpin his credit in the university was then it seems so considerable that we find the popish party very solicitous to engage him to side publicly with them and the most pressing applications were accordingly made but they found his zeal of a much cooler temper than their own he was not indeed satisfied with the reformers having wanted hitherto the opportunities of acquainting himself with their arguments but on the other hand he had never been a bigoted papist and had it seems lately discovered through a dispute he had been engaged in with dr hooper afterward bishop of worcester that several of the romish doctrines were not so well supported by scripture as was commonly imagined while his mind was in so unsettled a condition he thought himself but ill qualified to espouse either side publicly his inclination rather led him to stand by an unprejudiced observer and to embrace truth whether he found her among protestants or papists such importunity was however used with him that at length he yielded which was matter of no small triumph to his party and he appeared the next day against peter martyr  entering thus into a controversy against his inclination he determined however to make it as useful to himself as he could by bringing his old opinions to the test he hoped at least he might discover whether it was only the stamp of antiquity upon them or their own intrinsic worth that gave them that value at which they had been hitherto rated he resolved therefore to lay aside as much as possible the temper of a caviller and to place truth before him as the sole object of his pursuit from which he was determined to be drawn aside neither by prejudice nor by novelty  but he soon found his adversarys arguments too strong for him they came authorized from the holy writings in so forcible a manner that he could not but acknowledge them of a nature quite different from the wiredrawn proofs and strained interpretations of scripture in which he had hitherto acquiesced we need not therefore wonder if the disputation was soon over mr gilpin had nothing of that pride of heart through which men often defend suspected opinions but gave up his cause with that grace which always attends sincerity he owned publicly that he could not maintain it and determined to enter into no more controversies till he had gained the full information he was in pursuit of  this ingenuous regard for truth was shown in the more advantageous light by the bigotry of his fellowdisputants whose inflamed zeal and fierceness of temper discovered little of the scholar and less of the christian in his conduct appeared an honest desire of information only in theirs the pride of opposition struggling against conviction  peter martyr took notice of this difference of behavior and would frequently say that as for chedsey morgan and the rest of those hotheaded zealots he could not in truth be much concerned about them but mr gilpin seemed a man of such uprightness of intention and so much sincerity both in his words and actions that it went to his heart to see him still involved in prejudice and error the rest he thought were only a trifling light sort of men led into an opposition more by vain glory and a desire to distinguish themselves than through any better motives but mr gilpins ingenuity of behavior and irreproachable life left room for no such suspicion with regard to him and he could not but own he considered his espousing any cause as a very great credit to it he would often likewise tell his friends it was the subject of his daily prayers that god would be pleased at length to touch the heart of this pious papist with the knowledge of true religion  and he prayed not in vain for mr gilpin from this time became every day more reconciled to the reformers  having been thus staggered by his adversarys arguments the first step he took after he had implored the divine assistance was to recollect and carefully commit to paper the substance of what had passed in this controversy and of those points in which he had been hardest pressed he resolved to enter into a stricter examination  but before he could reconcile himself to this work many distracting scruples arose in his mind though he could not but discover something questionable in many of his old opinions yet when he considered they were still deeply rooted in the minds of almost the whole nation embraced by the greatest part of europe and had been through many centuries supported by the authority of princes and councils he thought great deference was due to so awful a majority and could not without much perplexity think of making his own private judgment a test of the public faith his suspicions however forced him at length upon an examination though with a design it is probable to confirm rather than confute his old opinions but he soon found that an impossible task the more he considered the tenets of popery the less defensible they appeared if he tried them by reason he found them utterly unable to stand that proof and if he endeavored to reconcile them with scripture he could not but observe by what unnatural interpretations it was only to be effected  he endeavored likewise to acquaint himself with the history of popery that he might discover in what age its several questioned doctrines first appeared from this search into antiquity he observed that none of them obtained in the earlier and purer ages of the christian church but were all the inventions of later times when ignorance and credulity prevailed and gave sufficient opportunity for designing men to establish any creed that suited them  seven sacraments he found had never been heard of before the time of peter lombard which was above eleven hundred years after christ  the denial of the cup to the laity appeared plainly a doctrine intended in corrupt times to give a mysterious superiority to the clergy no traces of it could be found till near a thousand years after the sacrament was first instituted  the doctrine of transubstantiation took its rise indeed sooner but not however till the eighth century at which time also the notion of the lords supper being a propitiatory sacrifice was first heard of  very late also appeared the doctrine of an actions being morally good without any regard to the intention of the doer commonly called the doctrine of the opus operatum it seemed plainly intended for no other end but to enrich its teachers  thus into whatever part of popery he examined he found great abuses the true simplicity and spirit of christianity were gone totally lost in mere human inventions but what he first began to object to in the popish creed and was most disgusted at were indulgences prayers before images and disallowing the public use of the scripture  the rites and ceremonies of the romish church pleased him as little as its doctrines many of them appeared trifling many of them ridiculous and not a few plainly impious that affected ostentation and theatrical pomp which accompanied them all seemed a strange deviation from the simplicity of apostolic times and had he could not but observe the worst influence upon the people as it led them from the practice of virtue to put their trust in outward performances  they who have been bred up in a purer religion may perhaps wonder that a man of so much sense and learning and especially of so much honesty and sincerity needed so long a course of reasoning to discover errors of so gross a kind but if his conduct may not be accounted for by prejudice it was however such as will always be expected from a fair mind in the same circumstances the matter under his consideration was of the last importance it required therefore the utmost caution his good sense led him early to doubt yet considering what an established creed his doubts opposed his humility made those very doubts suspected he knew not indeed how to proceed he was distracted by a thousand scruples the fault might be in himself  or it might be in his religion  papist and protesant could not both be in the right  either might be in the wrong  yet each had something to say that was plausible he hoped however that a merciful god would regard the difficulties he had to struggle with and exact nothing from him beyond his power  every thing in his power he was determined to do agreeably to this resolution he went on with the examination of religious matters omitting nothing that could contribute to his due information  while he was engaged in this work an event happened which greatly advanced it by giving the last shock to his prejudices in favor of popery  europe had now been so long distracted by religious dissensions that it was universally thought necessary to summon a general council which might deliberate on the best expedients to remove them this prevailing desire was listened to very heedlesly at rome a scrutiny into religious matters was an alarming thing to every true papist the consequence was easily foreseen and the prudent pope was very unwilling to have the pool stirred lest it should become too evident how much it wanted cleansing but discontent and clamor running high and nothing appearing likely to appease the universal murmur but a council one was at length convened at trent the pope had now recourse to an aftergame since he could not avoid this dreaded council he contrived however to manage the members of it with such address that his power far from being shaken by them was in fact only the more confirmed instead of repairing what was decayed their only care was to prop the old ruin as it stood but among all the measures then taken in support of ecclesiastical tyranny the compleatest was a bold decree that the traditions of the church should be esteemed of equal authority with the scriptures themselves  a determination of so extraordinary a nature was received with astonishment by all wellwishers to religion the opportunity the reformers every where cried out is now lost since traditions are equalled with scripture and these traditions are in the hands of the conclave it cannot be doubted whose sense they will always speak the romanists have now a fund of authority for all their extravagancies alas instead of stopping the breach they have now so far widened it as to destroy all hope of its ever closing again  mr gilpin among the rest took great offense at these proceedings some time after the publication of the council of trent mr lever falling into conversation with mr gilpin among other questions asked him what he thought of that council mr gilpin answered he thought nothing could be of more disservice to religion for many things which were before left indifferent were now rendered binding i remember said he bishop tunstal often told me that he thought innocent the third acted very weakly when he made transubstantiation an article of faith for before his time the opinions of men were at liberty as to that point and what the bishop said of transubstantiation may equally be said of all parts of popery since the publication of the council of trent the times of our forefathers therefore however ignorant they may be thought were certainly much happier than the present times of popery for the papists have now altered what little was left of the institutions of the primitive church by placing the rule of faith in traditions they have done what was never thought of before many opinions likewise which men were before at liberty to hold with regard to justification and the sacraments are not now tolerated these are the things which obliged other churches to dissent from the church of rome and hence the council of trent must answer for all that confusion which has since ensued bishop carletons life of bernard gilpin    hitherto notwithstanding his objections to popery there was something in an established church which he knew not how to get over the word schism greatly perplexed him nor could he easily persuade himself of the lawfulness of a separation from the church of rome corrupt as she was in other respects while she professed to draw her rule of faith from the scriptures but when he found by the publication of the council of trent that she had carried her authority to such an height of arrogance as to set up her own unwritten word against the scriptures a word which he would often humorously say was in no degree comparable to the word of an honest man it was high time he thought for all sincere christians to take the alarm the designs of the papists were now too plain and if they meant well to religion they meant it in such a manner that a good conscience could not comply with them for himself he was obliged to conclude from this direct opposition of their own authority to the authority of scripture that their sole view was to establish their declining power nor could he otherwise consider popery than as a perplexed system of priestcraft superstition and bigotry a religion converted into a trade and used only as a cloak for the tyranny and avarice of its professors in a word he thought it now sufficiently evident that the church of rome was plainly antichristian while he was distracted with these things the rule of faith changed by the council of trent astonished him for he observed that not only the ancient divines but even the modern ones lombard scotus and aquinas all confessed that the rule of faith was solely to be drawn from scripture whereas he found according to the council of trent that it might as well be drawn from human traditions and when he understood that these traditions were only peevish and perverse interpretations of scripture invented by the bishops of rome and thrust in among the decretal epistles and that even these decretal epistles themselves were mere forgeries as had been often proved by learned men and was acknowledged even by the papists he began to doubt especially when he observed the great confusion arisen in the church whether the pope might not be that antichrist foretold by scripture and the papish church plainly antichristian for what is exalting a mans self and opposing himself against all that is called god so that in the temple of god he sits as god carrying himself as if he were god if the popes calling himself the head of the universal church its lord its monarch and setting up his own word against the word of god be not so for he whose word is as gods word is himself as god and carries himself as if he were so when antichrist shall come if there be another antichrist is it possible for him to use christ and the scriptures more blasphemously than the pope has done  here mr gilpin demurred in doubt what to think for who could have thought the pope was antichrist who durst have said such a thing before luther  thus therefore he argued with himself if the pope be antichrist i see not only a rational but a necessary cause for secession if he be not i cannot approve such a step it is not lawful to separate from the church but to separate from the church of antichrist is not only commanded but threatenings are denounced upon those who continue in it thus the heavenly voice speaks rev xviii go out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and receive not of her plagues  here therefore he stopped for except the pope were manifestly proved to be antichrist he could net allow the lawfulness of a separation and therefore he endeavored by reading meditation and prayer to satisfy himself in this point he observed that the passage in which antichrist is described   thessalonians ii   he who now keeps possession shall keep until he be entirely routed out was interpreted by most of the ancient fathers tertullian jerome ambrose austin chrysostom cyril and others as meant of the roman empire which being then in possession should continue so till antichrist should come and entirely dispossess it he observed also that what is said in the same place that christ shall not come again till there be a departure first was likewise fulfilled it was fulfilled first in the departure of the papists from primitive simplicity and secondly in the departure of the reformed churches from the church of rome  mr gilpin would often say that the protestants could give no solid reason for their secession except that the pope is antichrist and he understood the passage above mentioned rev xviii   as a strict command in that case to secede so that no third conclusion could be drawn either the pope was antichrist or the church was not to be forsaken  and now the event which is the surest interpreter of prophecies has made all things clear to us we have seen many ages ago that kingdom taken away which ruled over all in the time of the apostles and in its room an ecclesiastical kingdom established such an one as had never been heard of before in the church of christ we have seen an amazing departure in the church of rome from the purity and simplicity of primitive times we have seen and daily do see a departure of other churches from her  these reflections induced mr gilpin to become a member of that church which he thought was most conformable to the word of god the church of rome kept the rule of faith entire till it was changed by the council of trent from that time he thought it a point of duty to forsake her communion that the true church thus called out might follow the word of god for this separation seemed an appointed state of the church thus abraham was called out of ur the children of israel out of egypt and the jews out of babylon all these things appeared to have been brought about by the immediate direction and wonderful hand of providence he saw therefore a necessity for seceding and that the apostatical church must be forsaken  yet he did not pursue his measures impetuously but with calmness and circumspection bishop carletons life of bernard gilpin    and that as such there was an absolute necessity laid upon every true believer to forsake her communion  such were the cautious steps mr gilpin took before he declared himself a protestant so difficult a matter it is to get over strong religious prejudices and to overcome the unhappy effects of a wrong education  his more than ordinary candor and sincerity through the whole of this affair met with much applause and gained him great esteem many years afterward the earls of bedford and leicester having heard there was something very uncommon in his manner of proceeding upon this occasion wanted to be more acquainted with the circumstances of it and for that purpose applied to mr george gilpin bernards brother who was upon terms of great intimacy with those two noblemen and then in london accordingly this gentleman taking the opportunity of a visit to his friends in the north persuaded his brother to give him in writing an exact account of the progress of his change from the romish religion  mr gilpins letter upon this occasion is still extant as it will give a truer idea of his ingenuity and caution in this affair than any narrative can and as it has besides a noble strain of piety to recommend it i will here transcribe the greatest part of it it was written indeed many years after the time now treated of and touches upon several facts not yet taken notice of but its reference to the present subject makes this the properest place for laying it before the reader  you require me to write in a long discourse the manner of my conversion from superstition to the light of the gospel which i think you know was not in a few years as time and health will permit i will hide nothing from you confessing my own shame and yet hoping with the apostle i have obtained mercy because i did it ignorantly  in king edwards time i was brought to dispute against some assertions of peter martyr although i have ever been given to eschew so far as i might controversies and disputations being but a young student and finding my groundwork not so sure as i supposed i went first to the bishop of durham cuthbert tunstall  who told me that innocent the third was much overseen to make transubstantiation an article of faith he found great fault with the pope for indulgencies and other things  after i went to dr redman in whom i had great trust for the fame of his virtue and learning he told me the communionbook was very godly and agreeable to the gospel these things made me to muse  afterward one of the fellows of the queens college told me he heard dr chedsey say among his friends the protestants must yield to us in granting the presence of christ in the sacrament and we must yield to them in the opinion of transubstantiation so shall we accord  dr weston made a long sermon in defense of the communion in both kinds  mr morgan told me that mr ware a man most famous both for life and learning had told him before his death that the chief sacrifice of the church of god was the sacrifice of thanksgiving this was his answer when i desired to know what might be said for the sacrifice of the mass  the best learned bishops likewise of this realm at that time withstood the supremacy of the pope both with words and writing  mr harding coming newly from italy in a long and notable sermon did so lively set forth and paint in their colors the friars and unlearned bishops assembled at trent in council that he much diminished in me and many others the confidence we had in general councils  all these things and many more gave me occasion to search both the scriptures and ancient fathers whereby i began to see many great abuses and some enormities used and maintained in popery and to like well of sundry reformations on the other side  afterward in three years space i saw so much gross idolatry at paris antwerp and other places that made me to mislike more and more the popish doctrines especially because the learned men disallowed image worship in their schools and suffered it so grossly in their churches  as i could with small knowledge i examined the mass the greatest fault i then found was too much reverence and gross worshipping of the gaping people because i believed not transubstantiation likewise my conscience was grieved at the receiving of the priest alone yet at length i said mass a few times as closely as i could  i reasoned with certain that were learned of my acquaintance why there was no reformation of these gross enormities about images relics pilgrimages buying mass and trentals with many other things which in king edwards time the catholics so called did not only grant to be far amiss but also promised that the church should be reformed if ever the authority came into their hands again when i asked when this reformation was to begin in hope whereof i was the more willing to return from paris i was answered we may not grant to to the ignorant people that any of these things has been amiss if we do they will strait infer other things may be amiss as well as these and still go further and further  this grieved me and made me seek for quietness in gods word no where else i could find any stay  after this in two or three sermons at newcastle i began to utter my conscience more plainly when thirteen or fourteen articles were drawn up against me and sent to the bishop here my adversaries of the clergy whom i had sore offended by speaking against their pluralities had that which they looked for they caused the bishop to call me in their presence and examine me touching the sacrament the bishop showed favor so far i trust as he durst urging me nothing with transubstantiation but only with the real presence which i granted and so was delivered at that time for the real presence i was not then resolved but took it to be a mystery above my capacity yet my conscience was somewhat wounded for granting before them in plain words the thing whereof i stood in doubt  after queen marys death i began to utter my mind more plainly before i must needs confess my weakness ignorance and fear of enemies had somewhat restrained me  thus in process of time i grew to be stronger and stronger yet many grievous temptations and doubts have i had which many nights have bereaved me of sleep  my nature has evermore fled controversy so much as i could my delight and desire has been to preach christ and our salvation by him in simplicity and truth and to comfort myself with the sweet promises of the gospel and in prayer  i have been always scrupulous and troubled either in subscribing or swearing to any thing beside the scriptures and articles of our belief because the scripture ought ever to have a preeminence above mans writings  i remember when i went for orders to the bishop of oxford his chaplain ministered an oath to allow all such ordinances as were set forth or should be set forth in time to come which oath when we considered better of it what it was to swear to things to come we knew not what it troubled not only me but nine or ten more with me men of much better learning than i was i for my part resolved after that to swear to no writing but with exception as it agreed with the word of god  what trouble i had when the oath was ministered by the bishops for the book of articles agreed upon in      and      i have opened for quietness and discharge of my conscience in another writing  and certainly since i took this order to open my faults in writing in another letter he thus speaks i never had doubts in religion in all my life nor ever dissembled in all my life or committed any fault which so far as i thought it might edify or do good to others and so far as my remembrance served i could not well find in my heart to confess before all the world    not pausing who knew them so it might edify myself or others i have found great ease and quietness of conscience and am daily more edified comforted and confirmed in reading the scriptures and this i praise god for that when i was most troubled and weakest of all my faith in gods mercy was so strong that if i should then have departed this life i had and have a sure trust that none of these doubts would have hindered my salvation i hold fast one sentence of st paul i have obtained mercy in that i did it in ignorance and another of job if the lord put me to death yet will i trust in him  yet have i prayed gods mercy many times for all these offenses infirmities and ignorances and so i will do still so long as i have to live in this world  section ii we left mr gilpin at christchurch college in oxford now fully convinced of the errors of popery  an academic life affording him most leisure for study was the life he was most inclined to he had too just a sense of the duty of a clergyman to be unacquainted with the qualifications requisite for its discharge and too mean an opinion of himself to think he was yet master of them he thought more learning was necessary in that controversial age than he had yet acquired and his chief argument with his friends who were continually soliciting him to leave the university was that he was not yet enough instructed in religion himself to be a teacher of it to others it was an arduous task he said especially at that time and protestantism could not suffer more than by the rawness and inexperience of its teachers  these thoughts continued him at oxford till the thirtyfifth year of his age about that time the vicarage of norton in the diocese of durham falling vacant his friends who had interest to obtain it for him renewed their solicitations and at length prevailed upon him to accept it while i was thus busied i was drawn by certain friends to accept a benefice being very unwilling thereunto if i offended god in taking such a charge before i was better learned and better resolved in religion i cry god mercy and i doubt not but i have found mercy in his sight extract of a letter from bernard gilpin to his brother    accordingly a presentation passed in his favor which bears date among king edwards grants november       before he went to reside he was appointed to preach before the king who was then at greenwich strype in his annals seems to intimate that mr gilpin was at that time famous for his preaching in the north and that it was upon this account he was called upon to preach at court but there is little authority for this he does not seem to have been yet a preacher at all at least of any note it is rather probable the only reason of his being sent to upon this occasion was that he might give a public testimony of his being well inclined to the reformation for the heads of the protestant party were at this time very scrupulous in the disposal of livings it was then ordered says heylin in his church history that none should be presented unto any benefice in the donation of the crown till he had first preached before the king and thereby passed his judgment and approbation  the reigning vice of that age as its historians inform us was avarice or more properly rapine the following passage from one of bishop latimers courtsermons will show how much things were altered in a very few years my father says he was a yeoman and had no land of his own only he had a farm of three or four pounds by the year at the utmost and hereupon he tilled so much as kept half a dozen men he had a walk for an hundred sheep and my mother milked thirty kine he was able and did find the king an harness with himself and his horse i remember myself to have buckled on my fathers harness when he went to blackheathfield he kept his son at school till he went to the university and maintained him there he married his daughters with five pounds or twenty nobles apiece he kept hospitality with his neighbors and some alms he gave to the poor and all this he did out of the said farm  whereas he that has the said farm now i am informed pays sixteen pounds by the year or more and is not able to do any thing for his prince for himself or for his children or give a cup of drink to the poor  the covetousness of the gentry appeared by oppressing the poorer sort by enclosures thereby taking away the lands where they had used and their forefathers to feed their cattle which was such an oppression that it caused a rebellion in the year       another way they had of oppressing their inferiors was by means of the law for when they whom they had wronged were forced to sue them they threatened the judges or bribed them that they commonly favored the rich or delaying the causes of the poor made their charges more than they could bear oftentimes they went home with tears after having waited long at court their causes unheard latimer was never without poor suitors that came to him to speak to the great men that their matters might be heard complaining to him at what great costs and charges they had laid to their undoing insomuch as being at the archbishop of canterburys house where he used often to reside he had no time so much as to look on his book as he told the king in a sermon these oppressions were partly occasioned by the kings great officers who did use to commit the hearing and examination of causes to their servants  for the judges some of them at least were very corrupt latimer would often in his sermons complain of them and would give them many a jirk once he said if a judge should ask him the way to hell he would show him this way first let him be a covetous man then let him take bribes and lastly pervert judgment if there were such a judge in england now he wished we might have his skin hanged up it were a goodly sight the sign of the judges skin and should be lots wife to all judges that follow after  the curates were both ignorant and scandalous for their ill lives the people in many places with held their tithes from them and the reason they gave was because their curates some were ignorant and some were idle and took little pains and care in their cures and many were so intolerably lazy and wicked that the parishioners often brought information against them to the bishops nay to the council strypes memorials of king edward vi    at court all things were venal employments honors favors of every kind in the room of law and justice gross bribery and wrong were common in trade grievous extortions and frauds every where and every way the poor were vexed but in the country this rapacity was most observed where the oppressions exercised were so intolerable that the preceding year had seen great heats and murmurings among the people and some counties even in arms  of these things the preachers most in earnest spoke with great freedom particularly bishop latimer who was the cato of that age among others mr gilpin thought it became him to take notice of evils so much complained of accordingly he made the avarice of the times his subject upon the present occasion resolving with an honest freedom to censure corruption in whatever rank of men he observed it  he began first with the clergy he was sorry he said to observe among them such a manifest neglect of their function to get benefices not to take care of them was their endeavor half of them were pluralists or nonresidents and such could never fulfill their charge he was shocked he said to hear them quote human laws against gods word  if such laws did exist they were the remains of popery and the king would do well to repeal them  while mens consciences would permit them to hold as many livings as they could get and discharge none it was impossible the gospel could have any success in england  from the clergy he turned to the court and observing the king was absent he was obliged to introduce that part of his sermon which he had designed for him by saying it grieved him to see those absent who for examples sake ought particularly to have been present he had heard other preachers likewise remark that it was common for them to be absent business might perhaps be their excuse but he could not believe that serving god would ever hinder business if he could he said he would make them hear in their chambers but however he would speak to their seats not doubting but what he said would be carried to them  you said he great prince are appointed by god to be the governor of this land let me then here call upon you in behalf of your people it is in your power to redress them and if you do not the neglect must be accounted for take away dispensations for pluralities and nonresidence oblige every pastor to hold but one benefice and as far as you can make every one do his duty your graces eye to look through your realm would do more good than a thousand preachers the land is full of idle pastors and how can it be otherwise when the nobility and patrons of livings put in just who will allow them to take out most profit it would be good if your grace would send out surveyors to see how benefices are bestowed it is no wonder that your people are continually rising up in rebellions when they have no instructors to teach them their duty  a reformation there is as much ignorance superstition and idolatry as ever which as far as i can foresee will remain for benefices are every where so plundered and robbed by patrons that in a little time no body will bring up their children to the church it is amazing to see how the universities are diminished within these few years  and i must tell your grace that all this is owing to you for taking no more notice of these things for my part i will do my duty i will tell your grace what abuses prevail and pray to god that he will direct your heart to amend them  he next addressed himself to the magistrates and gentry they all he told them received their honors their power and their authority from god who expected they would make a proper use of such gifts and would certainly call them to an account for the abuse of them but he saw so much ambitious striving for them at court that he was afraid they did not all consider them in their true light he observed that the spirit of avarice was got among them  that the country cried out against their extortions  and that when the poor came to seek for justice in london the great men would not see them  their servants must first be bribed oh with what glad hearts and clear consciences said he might noblemen go to rest after having spent the day in hearing the complaints of the poor and redressing their wrongs for want of that they were obliged to seek their right among lawyers who quickly devoured every thing that was left them  thousands every term were obliged to go back worse than they came  let me then said he call upon you who are magistrates and put you in mind that if the people are debtors to you for obedience you are debtors to them for protection if you deny this they must suffer but god will assuredly espouse their cause against you  and now if we search for the root of all these evils what is it but avarice this it is that makes the bad nobleman the bad magistrate the bad pastor and the bad lawyer  having thus freely addressed his audience he concluded his sermon with an hearty exhortation that all would consider these things and that such as found themselves faulty would amend their lives  thus this pious man began his ministry such was the sense he had of that plainness and sincerity which became it as he thought nothing his interest but what was also his duty hope or fear never swayed him he considered himself in some degree chargeable with those vices which he knew were prevailing and failed to rebuke  a freedom of this nature the times however allowed for how little soever there might be of the reality of virtue there was certainly much of the profession of it public deference at least was paid to it  mr gilpins plainness therefore was very well taken and recommended him to the notice of many persons of the first rank particularly to sir francis russel and sir robert dudley afterward earls of bedford and leicester who from that time professed a great regard for him and when in power were always ready to patronize him  these two noblemen were both great patrons of virtue and letters but with very different views as they were indeed very different men  bedford appeared at court with all the advantages of birth his father the first earl of that name was one of the greatest men of his age eminent for unspotted honesty and superior talents in war and peace his son pursued his steps and though he wanted his fathers great abilities he was however a very wise and honest man and acted afterward a considerable part in settling the reformation under elizabeth to whose court he was a very great ornament he was a friend to merit from the real love he bore to virtue  leicester however accomplished in many respects was one of the greatest villains of his time copying the examples of his father and grandfather his grandfather was edmund dudley the infamous minister of henry the sevenths avarice who with empson his associate harassed the people for many years with all sorts of oppression he was executed in the beginning of henry the eighth  his father was created duke of northumberland by edward the sixth and was a signal instance of lawless ambition and the ruinous consequences that often attend it having sacrificed the good protector to his jealousy procured the settlement of the crown in his own family and contrived as many authors write the kings death he saw in a moment all his designs crushed himself and his adherents ruined even by these very contrivances he was executed in the first of queen mary    he was thoroughly practiced in every species of dishonesty yet such a master of dissimulation that he could act even the worst part plausibly he courted good men for the credit of their acquaintance  such were mr gilpins chief patrons  voluntary patrons whom no application on his part engaged he received their offered friendship with humility and gratitude never intending to put it to a trial this backwardness proceeded not from any sullen notion of independence but from an utter aversion to all solicitation for church preferment the lord bedfords interest indeed he scrupled not to solicit occasionally for his friends but he never once asked that i can find though much courted to it any favor of the earl of leicester  mr gilpin is said likewise at this time to have been taken notice of by secretary cecil afterward lord burleigh who obtained for him a general license for preaching in granting these licenses great caution was then used none but men of approved worth could apply for them with success upon looking over king edwards grants it does not appear there were more than two or three and twenty thus licenced during that kings reign among these were the bishops jewel grindal and coverdale  while mr gilpin was at london he frequently visited cuthbert tunstal bishop of durham who was his uncle and had always expressed a great regard for him it is probable indeed his parents intended him a churchman with a view to his being advanced by this prelate but the bishop was at this time in no capacity to serve him he was disgraced and in the tower  during the reign of henry the eighth tunstal had lived in great credit at court was esteemed a man of abilities a good scholar and an able statesman his sovereign knew his worth advanced him to the sea of durham employed him much at home and abroad and at his death left him during the minority one of the regents of the kingdom but in the succeeding reign his interest lessened he was not altogether satisfied with the changes daily made in religion and though he was enough inclined to give up some of the grosser tenets of popery yet in general he favored it and was always in great esteem with the romish party this occasioned their making him privy to some treasonable designs which in his cautious way he neither concurred in nor betrayed the plot miscarried the bishop was indeed suspected but nothing appeared some time afterward when the duke of somersets papers were seized an unlucky letter was found which fully detected him he was called immediately before the council tried by a special commission found guilty deprived and committed  mr gilpin having now stayed as long in london as his business required repaired to his parish and immediately entered upon the dudes of it he failed not as occasion required to use the kings license in other parts of the country but his own parish he considered as the place where his chief care was due here he made it his principal endeavor to inculcate moral virtue and to dissuade from those vices which he observed most prevalent he seldom handled controverted points being afraid lest endeavoring to instruct he might only mislead for however resolved he was against popery he yet saw not the protestant cause in its full strength and was still scarcely settled in some of his religious opinions hence by degrees a diffidence of himself arose which gave him great uneasiness he thought he had engaged too soon in his office  that he could not sufficiently discharge it  that he should not rest in giving his hearers only moral instructions  that overspread as the country was with popish doctrines he did ill to pretend to be a teacher of religion if he were unable to oppose such errors  these thoughts made every day a greater impression upon him at length quite unhappy he wrote bishop tunstal an account of his situation the bishop who was the farthest of any man from a bigot and liked him not the worse for his freedom of inquiry told him as he was so uneasy it was his advice he should think of nothing till he had fixed his religion and that in his opinion he could not do better than put his parish into the hands of some person in whom he could confide and spend a year or two in germany france and holland by which means he might have an opportunity of conversing with some of the most eminent professors on both sides of the question he acquainted him likewise that his going abroad at this time would do him also a considerable service for during his confinement he had written two or three books particularly one upon the lords supper which he had a desire to publish and as this could not be done so conveniently at home he would be glad to have it done under his inspection at paris  this letter gave mr gilpin much satisfaction it just proposed his own wish a conference with some of the learned men abroad was what his heart had long been set on only he had one objection to the scheme he was afraid it might prove too expensive  as to that the bishop wrote his living would do something toward his maintenance and deficiences he would supply  but this did not remove the difficulty mr gilpins notions of the pastoral care were so strict that he thought no excuse could justify nonresidence for so considerable a time as he intended to be abroad he could not therefore think of supporting himself with any part of the income of his living however abroad he was determined to go and resolved if he staid the shorter time to rely only upon his own frugal management of the little money he had and to leave the rest to the bishops generosity  having resigned his living therefore in favor of a person with whose abilities and inclinations to discharge the duties of it he was well acquainted he set out for london to receive his last orders from the bishop and to embark  the account of his resignation got to town before him and gave the bishop anxious for his nephews thriving in the world great concern here are your friends says he endeavoring to provide for you and you are taking every method to frustrate their endeavors but be warned by these courses depend upon it you will bring yourself presently to a morsel of bread mr gilpin begged the bishop would attribute what he had done to a scrupulous conscience which really would not permit him to act otherwise conscience replied the bishop why you might have had a dispensation will any dispensation answered mr gilpin restrain the tempter from endeavoring in my absence to corrupt the people committed to my care bishop latimer speaking of a clergyman of those times who was made controller of the mint expresses himself much in the same manner is this a meet office says he for a priest who has cure of souls i would ask one question i would fain know who controls the devil at home in his parish while he controls the mint if the apostle might not leave his office of preaching to be a deacon shall one leave it for minting i cannot tell you but the saying is that since priests have been minters money has been worse    alas i fear it would be but an ill excuse for the harm done my flock if i should say when god shall call me to an account for my stewardship that i was absent by dispensation this reply put the bishop a little out of humor but his disgust was soon over and this instance of mr gilpins sincerity raised him still higher in his uncles esteem the bishop would frequently however chide him as mr gilpin afterward would tell his friends for these qualms of conscience and would be often reminding him that if he did not look better to his interest he would certainly die a beggar  the bishop putting into his hands the books he had written gave him his last instructions and parted with him in very good humor so he took the first opportunity of embarking for holland  section iii upon his landing he went immediately to mechlin to visit his brother george who was at that time pursuing his studies there  this visit was probably upon a religious account for george though a man of virtue and learning seems to have been a zealous papist what influence his brother bernard had over him does not appear we meet with him however soon afterward a warm advocate for the reformation to forward which he translated from the dutch into english a very keen satyr against popery entitled the beehive of the roman church upon elizabeths accession he applied himself to state affairs for which indeed he was now preparing himself at mechlin where the civil law was much studied the earl of bedford brought him to court where he was soon taken notice of by the queen to whom he so well recommended himself by his dexterity in business that she made great use of him in her negotiations with the states of holland and kept him many years with a public character in that country where he was in great esteem for his abilities and integrity we meet with his name sometimes in the accounts of those transactions motley particularly speaking of same affairs then in agitation makes honorable mention of him the hanstowns says he procured in an imperial edict that the english merchants associated in embden and other places should be adjudged monopolists which was done by suderman a great civilian there was there at that time for the queen as nimble a man as suderman and he had the chancellor of embden to second him yet they could not stop the edict but gilpin played his cards so well that he prevailed the imperial ban should not be published till after the diet and that in the mean time his imperial majesty should send an ambassador to england to advertise the queen of the edict  mr gilpin having staid a few weeks with his brother at mechlin went afterward to louvain where he resolved to settle for some time he made frequent excursions to antwerp ghent brussels and other places in the low countries where he would spend a few weeks among those of any reputation whether papists or protestants but he made louvain his place of residence for which city he always expressed a more than common affection and indeed it was a most agreeable and commodious retreat for a scholar enjoying all the advantages of situation and affording the best opportunities for study  louvain is one of the chief towns in brabant it had formerly been the center of a very considerable woollen trade more than four thousand looms were daily at work in it each of which employed near forty people but its trade declining it grew more beautiful as it became less populous elegant houses were built and spacious walks laid oat within the walls of the town the river dyle which flowed through the midst of it affording the inhabitants many opportunities of showing their taste upon an eminence at one end stands the castle a venerable old building rising out of the midst of a vineyard its battlements are much frequented for the sake of the noble prospect they command over a country the most agreeably diversified with every thing that can make an extensive landscape beautiful here a stately palace there a lonely monastry rivers lawns woods till the eye is lost in a boundless plain blending itself with the horrizon the elegance of this situation made louvain the seat of politeness hither the men of taste and leisure from all parts repaired where instead of the noise and hurry of trade so common in the towns of flanders they enjoyed a calm retreat and the agreeable interchange of solitude and company but what endeared louvain most to a scholar was the noble seminary there established john the fourth duke of brabant with a view to keep up the credit of one of his chief towns upon the decay of the woollen manufacture politically founded a university in it which soon became one of the most considerable in europe it consists of many colleges in each of which philosophy was taught by two professors who read two hours each morning the scholars had the rest of the day to commit to writing what they heard  at the time mr gilpin was at louvain it was one of the chief places for students in divinity some of the most eminent divines on both sides of the question resided there and the most important topics of religion were discussed with great freedom  mr gilpins first business here was to get himself introduced to those of any reputation for learning to whom his own address and seize were no mean recommendation and supplied the place of a long acquaintance he was present at all public readings and disputations he committed every thing material to writing all his opinions he reexamined proposed his doubts in private to his friends and in every respect made the best use of his time  he now began to have juster notions of the doctrine of the reformed he saw things in a clearer and a stronger light and felt a satisfaction in the change he had made to which he had hitherto been a stranger  while he was thus pursuing his studies he and all the protestants in those parts were suddenly alarmed with melancholy news from england  king edwards death  the lady janes fall  and queen marys accession whose bigotry was well known and in whom the signs of a persecuting spirit already appeared  this bad news came however attended with one agreeable circumstance an account of bishop tunstals release from the tower and reestablishment in his bishopric  soon afterward mr gilpin received a letter from his brother george entreating him to come immediately to mechlin for he had an affair of consequence to communicate to him which absolutely required an interview when he came thither he found his brother had received a letter from the bishop informing him that he had found a benefice of considerable value vacant in his diocese which he wished he could persuade his brother bernard to accept imagining he might by this time have got over his former scruples  george knew he had a difficult province to manage but determined however to try his influence he begged his brother therefore to consider that he could not stay so long abroad for want of money as he might probably choose  that he had already offended the bishop  and that a second refusal might occasion an entire breach with him  that if it did not yet the bishop was now an old man  such benefices were not every day to be had  and after the bishops death he was not likely to meet with a friend who would thus press him to accept a living but nothing would do bernard continued unmoved and gave one answer to all his brothers arguments that his conscience would not suffer him to comply george answered he might have his living as well taken care of as if himself were there besides says he you have a bishop approving and advising the step i recommend what would you desire more if a bishops judgment said bernard was to be the rule of my actions i should comply but as i am to stand or fall by my own the case is different in short george was obliged to desist and bernard returned to lonvain heartily vexed that he had lost so much time upon so trifling an occasion he thought it however his duty to give the bishop his reasons for not accepting his kind offer which he did in the following letter  right honorable and my singular good master my duty remembered in most humble manner pleases it your honor to be informed that of late my brother wrote to me that in any wise i must meet him at mechlin for he must debate with me urgent affairs such as could not be dispatched by writing when we met i perceived it was nothing else but to see if he could persuade me to take a benefice and to continue in study at the university which if i had known to be the cause of his sending for me i should not have needed to interrupt my study to meet him for i have so long debated that matter with learned men especially with the holy prophets and most ancient and godly writers since christs time that i trust so long as i have to live never to burden my conscience with having a benefice and lying from it my brother said that your lordship had written to him that you would gladly bestow one on me and that your lordship thought and so did other of my friends of which he was one that i was much too scrupulous in that point whereunto i always say if i be too scrupulous as i cannot think that i am the matter is such that i had rather my conscience were therein a great deal too strait than a little too large for i am seriously persuaded that i shall never offend god by refusing to have a benefice and lie from it so long as i judge not evil of others which i trust i shall not but rather pray god daily that all who have cures may discharge their office in his sight as may tend most to his glory and the profit of his church he replied against me that your lordship would give me no benefice but what you would see discharged in my absence as well or better than i could discharge it myself whereunto i answered that i would be sorry if i thought not there were many thousands in england more able to discharge a cure than i find myself and therefore i desire they may both take the cure and the profit also that they may be able to feed the body and the soul both as i think all pastors are bounden as for me i can never persuade myself to take the profit and let another take the pains for if he should teach and preach as faithfully as ever st austin did yet should i not think myself discharged and if i should strain my conscience herein and strive with it to remain here or in any other university with such a condition the unquietness of my conscience would not suffer me to profit in study at all  i am here at this present i thank god very well placed for study among a company of learned men joining to the friars minors having free access at all times to a notable library among the friars men both well learned and studious i have entered acquaintance with diverse of the best learned in the town and for my part was never more desirous to learn in all my life than at this present wherefore i am bold knowing your lordships singular good will toward me to open my mind thus rudely and plainly unto your goodness most humbly beseeching you to suffer me to live without charge that i may study quietly  and whereas i know well your lordship is careful how i should live if god should call your lordship being now aged i desire you let not that care trouble you for if i had no other shift i could get a lectureship i know shortly either in this university or at least in some abbey hereby where i should not lose my time and this kind of life if god be pleased i desire before any benefice and thus i pray christ always to have your lordship in his blessed keeping by your lordships humble scholar and chaplain  bernard gilpin louvain nov          the bishop was not offended at this letter the unaffected piety of it disarmed all resentment and led him rather to admire a behavior in which the motives of conscience showed themselves so superior to those of interest which of our modern gaping rooks exclaims the bishop of chichester could endeavor with more industry to obtain a benefice than this man did to avoid one  mr gilpin having got over this troublesome affair for solicitations of this kind gave him of all things the most trouble continued some time longer at louvain daily improving in religious knowledge his own opinions he kept to himself industriously endeavoring to make himself acquainted with the opinions of others and the arguments upon which they were grounded  while he stayed in the low countries he was greatly affected with the melancholy sight of crowds of his dejected countrymen arriving daily in those parts from the bloody scene then acting in england these unhappy exiles however soon recovered their spirits and dispersing into various towns cheerfully applied themselves each as his profession led to gain an honest livelihood the meaner fort exercised their crafts the learned taught schools read lectures and corrected presses at basil particularly where the ingenious operinus was then carrying printing to great perfection their commendable endeavors to make themselves not quite a burden to those who entertained them were suitably rewarded the several towns of germany and holland finding their advantage in these strangers showed them all imaginable civility many private persons likewise contributed to their aid but above all others the generous duke of wirtemburgh distinguished himself in their favor whose bounty to the english at strasburgh and franckfort should never pass unremembered where these things are mentioned nor was mr gilpin a little pleased to find that however unable he was personally to assist them his large acquaintance in the country furnished him with the means of being useful to many of them by very serviceable recommendations  mr gilpin had been now two years in flanders and had made himself perfect master of the controversy as it was there handled he left louvain therefore and took a journey to paris  passing through a forest in his way thither he was attacked by highwaymen from whom being very well mounted he escaped to a cottage by the roadside the rogues pursued him to the house and declared they would pull it down or set it on fire if he did not immediately come out the family was in great constermation in vain did mr gilpin represent that these were only idle threatenings  that on so public a road they durst not meddle with the house  and that they would presently be gone all availed nothing to quiet therefore the disturbance he had occasioned he went out and gave the rogues his money  when he got to paris the first thing he set about was printing the bishop of durhams book this prelate as has been observed was a very moderate man no favourer of protestantism yet no friend to some of the grosser tenets of the romish church particularly to its extravagant doctrine of the sacrament of the lords supper and this book which showed the moderation of its author gave much offense to all the more zealous papists and drew many severe reproaches upon mr gilpin who was generally supposed to have corrupted the bishops work of what was said his friends gave him notice particularly francis wickliff who desired if the charge was unjust that he would purge himself of it mr gilpin told him that was easily done and opening a desk see here says he a letter from my lord of durham himself in which he thanks me for my care and fidelity in this business  while mr gilpin staid at paris he lodged with vascosan an eminent printer  to whom he had been recommended by his friends in the netherlands this learned man showed him great regard did him many friendly offices and introduced him to the most considerable men in that city  here popery became quite his aversion he saw more of its superstition and craft than he had yet seen the former among the people the latter among the priests who scrupled not to avow how little truth was their concern he would frequently ask whether such and such bad consequences might not arise from such and such doctrines but he was always answered that was not to be regarded  the church could not subsist without them  and little inconveniences must be bore with  at paris he found his old acquaintance mr neal of newcollege who always favored popery and was now become a bigot to it mr gilpin often expressed to him the concern he had upon this account and approved his friendship by the earnest desire he showed to make him see his errors but neal was not of a temper to be wrought upon  as an instance of popish sophistry and prejudice mr gilpin would sometimes relate a conversation about image worship which he once had with this neal at paris he was observing to him the great absurdity of the romanists in condemning idolatry and yet countenancing such an use of images as must necessarily draw the people into it for his part he said he knew not how a christain could allow himself in kneeling to an image and asked neal whether in his conscience he did not think it the idolatry forbidden in the second commandment neal was for distinguishing between an idol and an image the images of saints he said were not idols and therefore the reverence paid to them could not be idolatry mr gilpin observed that in the second commandment there was no mention made of an idol the prohibition was bow not down to the likeness of any created thing and what is it said he that makes an idol the workman makes the resemblance of a human creature the image thus made is no idol it is worship that makes it one hence the apostle says an idol is nothing  a mere creature of the imagination the distinction therefore between latria and doulia is to no purpose it is made void by the express words thou shall not bow down unto them the very posture of adoration he observed was forbidden and that at least the romanists every where practiced  to all this neal had only one general answer you may say just what you please but these things are established by the church and cannot be altered  this was the same neal who was afterward chaplain to bishop bonner and distinguished himself by being sole voucher of the very improbable and silly story of the nagshead consecration  mr gilpin having spent three years abroad was now fully satisfied in all his more considerable scruples he wanted no farther conviction of the bad tendency of popery he saw the necessity of some reformation and began to think every day more favorably of the present one the doctrine of the corporal presence indeed he had not yet fully considered but he looked upon it as a mystery which it rather became him to acquiesce in than examine the principal end of his going abroad being thus answered he was desirous of returning home  the marian persecution was still raging his friends therefore with great earnestness dissuaded him from his design they represented the danger he would be in at this juncture in england  pressed him to wait for happier times  and suggested that it was little less than madness to think of going to a place from whence all of his sentiments were endeavoring to withdraw themselves  bat it is most probable that his purpose to return at this time was in pursuance of the bishop of durhams advice who finding the infirmities of age increase upon him and believing his nephew totally unqualified to advance himself in life might be desirous of providing for him before his death and hoped that his power in that remote part of the kingdom would be a sufficient protection for him against his enemies it is however certain that he came into england during the heat of the persecution  section iv upon his arrival in england he went immediately to the bishop of durham who was then in his diocese here this humane prelate kept himself withdrawn during most of that violent reign to avoid having any hand in measures which he abhorred  when he left london upon his release from the tower he was straightly charged with the entire extirpation of heresy in his diocese and was given to understand that severity would be the only allowed test of his zeal these instructions he received in the spirit they were given loudly threatening that heretics should no where find a warmer reception than at durham and it was thought indeed the protestants would hardly meet with much favor from him as they had shown him so little but nothing was further from his intention than persecution insomuch that his was almost the only diocese where the poor protestants enjoyed any repose when most of the other bishops sent in large accounts of their services to religion very lame ones came from durham they were filled with high encomiums of the orthodoxy of the diocese interspersed here and there with the trial of an heretic but either the depositions against him were not sufficiently proved or there were great hopes of his recantation  no mention however was made of any burnings the following story of his lenity we have from mr fox a person had been accused to him of heresy whom he had slightly examined and dismissed his chancellor thinking him too favorable pressed for a further examination the bishop answered we have hitherto lived peaceably among our neighbors let us continue so and not bring this mans blood upon us a behavior of this kind was but ill relished by the zealous council and the bishop laid deservedly under the calumny of being not actuated by true romish principles  such was the state of the diocese of durham when mr gilpin came there the bishop received him with great friendship and within a very little time gave him the archdeaconry of durham to which the rectory of easington was annexed it is probable that if mr gilpin came home by the bishops advice this preferment was then vacant or soon expected to be so  upon removing to his parish he found it in great disorder with a firm resolution therefore of doing what good he could in it he set himself in earnest to reprove vice publicly and privately to encourage virtue and to explain the nature of true religion with a freedom by no means suited to those dangerous times  very material objections were then made to the clergy of those parts the reformation which advanced but slowly in england had made least progress in the north the ecclesiastics there wanted not a popish reign to authorize their superstition but this was their best side their manners were scandalous the pastoral care was totally neglected and it is hard to say whether vice or ignorance was more remarkable in them  all over england indeed the church was very ill supplied with ministers as for the inferior clergy says fuller the best that could be gotten were placed in pastoral charges alas tolerability was eminency in that age a rush candle seemed a torch where no brighter light was ever seen before surely preaching now ran very low if it be true what i read that mr tavernour of watereaton in oxfordshire high sheriff of the county came in pure charity not ostentation and gave the scholars a sermon in st marys with his gold chain about his neck and his sword by his side nor can we imagine that the high sheriff himself contributed much to advance the art of preaching if we may judge of his oratory by a specimen of it still preserved arriving says he at the mount of st mary in the stony stage where i now stand i have brought you some fine biskets baked in the oven of charity and carefully conserved for the chickens of the church the sparrows of the spirit and the sweet swallows of salvation     we may judge likewise of the state of learning at that time among the clergy from the accounts still preserved of some archidiaconal visitations latine verba aliquot intelligit non sententiam latin utcunque intelligit latin pauca intelligit were the expressions generally made use of to characterize them in this particular  how much in the north especially the pastoral care was neglected we may judge from an account given us of the clergy of those parts by a bishop of durham in a letter still preserved to an archbishop of canterbury  it is lamentable says he to see how negligently they say any service and how seldom your cures are all except rachdale as far out of order as any of the country whalley has as ill a vicar as the worst the bishop of man lives here at ease and as merry as pope joan the bishop of chester has compounded with my lord of york for his visitation and gathers up the money by his servants but never a word spoken of any visitation or reformation and that he says he does out of friendship because he will not trouble the country nor put them to charge in calling them together bishop latimer relates a story of a bishop of this kind which is worth transcribing i heard of a bishop says he that went on a visitation and as it was the custom when the bishop should be rung into the town the great bells clapper was fallen down so that he could not be rung in there was a mighty matter made of this and the chief of the parish were much blamed for it at the visitation and the bishop was somewhat quick with them and signified that he was much offended they excused themselves as well as they could but one among them wiser than the rest comes up to the bishop why my lord says he does your lordship make so great a matter of the bell that lacks a clapper here is a bell says he and pointed to the pulpit which has lacked a clapper these twenty years  i warrant you this bishop was an unpreaching prelate he could find fault with the bell that wanted a clapper to ring him into the town but he could not find any fault with the parson that preached not at his benefice bishop latimers sixth sermon before the king     this corruption among his brethren gave mr gilpin great concern the insatiable covetousness to use his own words joined with the pride carnal liberty and other vices which reign at this time in all estates but especially among us priests who ought to be the salt of the earth breaks me many a sleep he determined therefore to do all in his power to effect a reformation or if that were impossible to protest however against what he could not alter he considered that one of his offices obliged him to take the same care of the manners of the clergy as the other did of those of the laity and as he never received an office without a design of doing his duty in it he resolved to behave as an archdeacon ought  accordingly he took every opportunity of reproving the enormities he remarked the more ingenuous of the inferior clergy he endeavored to bring by gentler methods to their duty the obstinate he would rebuke with all authority and as he feared none in the cause of religion no mans family or fortune could exempt him from his notice at visitations particularly and where ever his audience was chiefly clerical he would express himself against every thing he observed amiss with a zeal which might have been thought affected in one of a less approved sincerity  it was an opinion of his that nonresidence and pluralities were the principal sources of corruption among churchmen we need not wonder therefore if we find him inveighing against them with the greatest earnestness it must be owned indeed they were at that time shamefully in use it was no uncommon thing for a clergyman in those days to hold three and sometimes four livings together mr stripe mentions one person who held five his name was blage he was a bachelor in divinity and held at one time st dunstans in the west whiston in yorkshire and doncaster in the same county rugby in warwickshire and barnet in middlesex these enormities for such he esteemed them went to the heart of the pious archdeacon and were the constant subjects of his reproof sometimes he would show how wrong they were in themselves as absolutely contrary to the design of endowments at other times how injurious to the rest of the order while three parts out of four of the clergy in his manner of speaking were picking what they could get off a common the rest were growing wanton with stallfeeding but his great argument against them was the prejudice they did religion it was reasonable he said to think a parish would be better taken care of by the priest who received the whole income than by the curate who received only a very small part and would it might easily be imagined too often proportion his pains to his allowance besides he thought one mans engrossing what in all reason belonged to two perhaps three or four agreed very ill with the simple manners and sequestered life of a minister of christ and gave an example which tended more to the discredit of religion than all the preaching in the world to its advancement  with equal freedom he likewise censured their private vices frequently drawing the character of a bad clergyman and dwelling upon such irregularities as he knew gave most offense in the ecclesiastics of those parts  the prudent bishop observing the forwardness of his zeal failed not to furnish him with cautions in abundance often reminding him how prudently he ought to behave where with all his prudence he should scarce avoid giving offense  and his enemies he said could never want a handle against him while popery reigned with so much severity  but such representations of danger had no effect upon him the common maxims indeed of worldly prudence he knew were against him but the examples he found in scripture of holy men who with equal freedom opposed vice and in times as dangerous wrought strongly with him if his endeavors were at all serviceable to religion if they only set some bounds to vice he thought it criminal to check them through any motives of fear it was his opinion that when an employment was accepted it should be accepted in all its parts he thought nothing was a greater breach of trust or more destructive of common good than to consider public offices only as private emoluments  it is however a little surprising that the bishop of durham who knew the world so well should not foresee how much he must necessarily expose his nephew to the popish party by placing him in such a station he knew he could not temporize and he must know that without temporizing he would soon be most obnoxious to those in power with whose persecuting principles he was well acquainted had he provided for him in a way which had no connection with the clergy it is probable he might have avoided those dangers in which we shall immediately find him for his free reproofs soon roused the ecclesiastics of those parts against him and put them upon every method in their power to remove so inconvenient an enquirer it was presently the popular clamor that he was an enemy to the church  a scandalizer of the clergy  a preacher of damnable doctrines  and that religion must suffer from the heresies he was daily broaching if they spared him any longer after i entered upon the parsonage of easington says he in a letter to his brother and began to preach i soon procured me many mighty and grievous adversaries for that i preached against pluralities and nonresidence some said all that preached that doctrine became heretics soon after others found great fault for that i preached repentance and salvation by christ and did not make whole sermons as they did about transubstantiation purgatory holy water images prayers to saints and such like  thus in short he had raised a flame which nothing but his blood could quench many articles were drawn up against him and he was accused in form before the bishop of durham  this prosecution was managed chiefly by one dunstal a priest in those parts who had always distinguished himself as the archdeacons implacable enemy and as it was imagined the bishops very great regard for mr gilpin might probably obstruct their designs this person had been long employed by the party to work underhand and prejudice the bishop against him  happy was it for him that the prelate had as much discernment as humanity he was practiced in the world he knew what men and times would bear and easily found a method to protect his friend without endangering himself  when the cause came before him he was extremely sorry to hear that a person he had so great a regard for should be accused of heresy  that indeed himself had not been without some suspicion of his leaning a little that way  but he had still been in hopes there was nothing in his opinions of any dangerous consequence to religion  he should however be fairly examined and if he appeared to be guilty he should find a very severe judge in the bishop of durham  by this artful address the bishop got the management of the affair into his own hands and taking care to press his accused friend in points only in which he knew him able to bear  him off innocent and dismissed the cause telling the accusers he was afraid they had been too forward in their zeal for religion  and that heresy was such a crime as no man ought to be charged with but upon the strongest proof  the malice of his enemies could not however rest his character at least was in their power for they had great influence upon the populace of which they failed not to make the worst use by infusing into those who were open to hasty impressions such sentiments as they knew most likely to inflame them several of his papers yet remaining show what candid interpreters they were of words and actions which could possibly be wrested to any bad meaning one letter particularly in which with great mildness he endeavors to free himself from the slanders of some of his enemies who had reported him to have affirmed it was as lawful to have two wives as two livings he remembered indeed he had once been asked whether of the two was worse and that he had carelessly answered he thought them both bad but to extend this to his affirming they were both equally bad was perverting his meaning he thought in a very disingenuous manner  the great fatigue mr gilpin thus underwent in doing his duty in the double capacity of an archdeacon and a rector of a parish and a very great fatigue it was in the conscientious manner in which he did it he found at length too much for him his strength was indeed unequal to it exhausted by so long an opposition to the strong tide which ran against him  he acquainted the bishop therefore that he must resign either his archdeaconry or his parish  that he would with the greatest readiness do his duty in which soever his lordship thought him best qualified for but he was not able to do it in both  have i not repeatedly told you said the bishop that you will die a beggar depend upon it you will if you suffer your conscience to raise such unreasonable scruples the archdeaconry and the living cannot be separated the income of the former is not a support without that of the latter i found them united and am determined to leave them so  in consequence of the bishops refusal to let him keep either of them single he most probably resigned them both for i find him about this time without any office in the church  during his being thus unemployed he lived with the bishop as one of his chaplains  but even in this situation he found the malice of his enemies still pursuing him the defeat they had received did not prevent their seeking every opportunity of attacking him again he avoided them as much as possible and they on the other hand contrived to meet him as frequently as they could urging him continually upon some controverted point of religion in contradiction often to the most obvious rules of decency and good manners  the bishop of chichester gives us the particulars of one of these disputes which he says he had often heard his kinsman anthony carleton speak of who at that time lived in the bishop of durhams family  some of the bishops chaplains getting about him in their accustomed manner one of them asked him his opinion of the writings of luther mr gilpin answered he had never read them that his method had always been to study the scriptures and the fathers expositions of them but for the writings of modern divines he was not so well acquainted with them one of them in a sneering manner commended that as a right way of proceeding and added that if all men could but be persuaded to be of mr gilpins opinion to have the same veneration for antiquity that he had the peace of the church would no longer be disturbed with any of these novel teachers but suppose said mr gilpin these novel teachers as you call them have the sense of antiquity on their side what shall we say then shall the ancient doctrine be rejected because of the novel teacher this not satisfying them they began to urge him farther pray said one of them what are your thoughts about the real presence mr gilpin answered that he really knew nothing of weight to object against it but he thought it too mysterious a subject to bear a dispute but do you believe transubstantiation i believe every thing contained in the word of god but do you believe as the church believes pray said mr gilpin is the catholic faith unchangeable undoubtedly it is but the church did not always hold transubstantiation an article of faith when did it not hold it so before the time of peter lombard who first introduced it and even since his time it has undergone an alteration pray tell me is not the bread in the sacrament converted into both the body and blood of christ undoubtedly it is but said mr gilpin smiling peter lombard himself did not believe that for in the eleventh chapter of his fourth book i very well remember he says expressly there is no transubstantiation but of bread into flesh and wine into blood and now i beg you will tell me how you reconcile these things with the unchangeableness of the catholic faith the chaplains had nothing to answer for the words of lombard indeed plainly denied that in the transubstantiated bread there could be any blood mr gilpin observing their confusion went on it appears then that transubstantiation was never heard of in the church before the time of peter lombard a man might have been a good catholic without acknowledging that doctrine till then afterward for a long time the only meaning of it was a conversion of the bread into flesh and the wine into blood and thus it remained till thomas aquinas introduced his notion of concomitancy at which time this doctrine underwent another change both flesh and blood were then it seems contained really and substantially in the bread alone  alas alas i am afraid these are the novel opinions that have got in amongst us the catholic faith we are both agreed is unchangeable the bishop was sitting before the fire in the fame chamber where this conversation happened and leaning back in his chair overheard it when it was over he got up and turning to his chaplains said to them with some emotion come come leave him leave him i find he has more learning than all of you put together  from mr gilpins behavior upon this occasion his zeal appears to have been tempered with a good deal of prudence indeed it never rose so high as to become dangerous to him but when he thought his duty absolutely required it in general he was very cautious and well guarded against the captious questions of such as were continually lying in wait to entrap him  how long mr gilpin remained unbeneficed does not appear it could not however be very long because the rectory of houghtonlespring fell vacant before easington and the archdeaconry were disposed of and the bishop in a jocular way made him an offer of all the three but that offer it was not likely he would listen to he thanked the bishop however and accepted houghton  this rectory was indeed of considerable value but the duty of it was proportionably laborious it was so extensive that it contained no less than fourteen villages and having been as much neglected in that dark age as the cures in the north then ordinarily were popery had produced its full growth of superstition in it scarce any traces indeed of true christianity were left nay what little religion remained was even popery itself corrupted all its idle ceremonies were here carried higher than you would perhaps any where else find them and were more considered as the essentials of religion how entirely this barbarous people were excluded from all means of better information appears from hence that in that part of the kingdom through the designed neglect of bishops and justices of the peace king edwards proclamations for a change of worship had not even been heard of at the time of that princes death  such was the condition of the parish of houghton when it was committed to mr gilpins care a waste so miserably uncultivated that the greatest industry seemed but sufficient to bring it into any kind of order and the greatest resolution only to make the attempt but when the good of mankind was concerned this true minister of the gospel had resolution enough to attempt whatever industry could accomplish he was grieved to see ignorance and vice so lamentably prevail but he did not despair he implored the assistance of god and his sincere endeavors met with it the people crowded about him and heard him with attention perceiving him a teacher of a different kind from those to whom they had hitherto been accustomed  upon his taking possession of houghton it was some mortification to him that he could not immediately reside his parsonagehouse was gone entirely to decay and some time was required to make it habitable part of it was fitted up as soon as possible for his reception but he continued improving and enlarging it till it became suitable to his hospitable temper a proper habitation for a man who never intended to keep what he had to himself his house says the bishop of chichester was like a bishops palace superior indeed to most bishops houses with respect both to the largeness of the building and the elegance of the situation  soon after this late instance of the bishops favor to him another opportunity offered by which this generous patron hoped still further to improve his fortune a stall in the cathedral of durham was vacant which he urged mr gilpin in the most friendly manner to accept telling him there lay not the same objection to this as to the archdeaconry  that it was quite a sine cure  and that he could have no reasonable pretense for refusing it but mr gilpin resolving not to accept it told the bishop that by his bounty he had already more wealth than he was afraid he could give a good account of he begged therefore he might not have an additional charge but that his lordship would rather bestow this preferment on one by whom it was more wanted the bishop knew by long experience it was in vain to press him to what he did not approve so there was no more said of the prebend  though he lived now retired and gave no offense to the clergy their malice however still pursued him they observed with indignation the strong contrast between his life and theirs his care and labor were a standing satyr upon their negligence and sloth and it was the language of their hearts by so living thou reproachest us in a word they were determined if possible to extinguish a light which showed them to such disadvantage  but they had not the easiest part to manage the country favored him the bishop was his friend and no good man his enemy besides the mask of religion must needs be kept on and they found mr gilpins zeal not so intemperate as might be wished however what malice could do was not wanting every engine was set at work and base emissaries employed in all parts to seek out matter for an accusation of him of all this mr gilpin was sensible and behaved as cautiously as he thought consistent with his duty indeed more cautiously than he could afterward approve for in his future life he would often tax his behavior at this time with weakness and cowardice see page  0   but had his caution been greater against such vigilant enemies it had probably been still ineffectual the eyes of numbers were constantly upon him and scarce an action of his life escaped them of this malicious industry we have the following instance  a woman in the pangs of childbed imploring gods assistance was rebuked by those around her for not rather praying to the virgin mary alarmed by her danger and greatly desirous of knowing whether god or the virgin was more likely to assist her she begged the great preacher lately come from abroad might be sent for she was sure he would come and could tell her what she should do mr gilpin told her he durst not persuade her to call upon the virgin mary but in praying to god she might be sure she did right  that there were many express commands in scripture for it  and that god would certainly hear them who prayed earnestly to him mr gilpin spoke the more freely as he thought what he said was not likely to be carried abroad but he was afterward surprised to find it had not escaped the vigilance of his enemies who failed not to make the worst use of it  by so unwearied an industry such a number of articles were in a short time got together as it was eagerly imagined could not but crush him he was soon therefore formally accused and brought once more before the bishop of durham how the bishop behaved at this time we are not particularly informed but no man knew better how to act upon an emergency it is probable he would vary his management but it is certain mr gilpin was acquitted  the malice of his enemies succeeded however in part for the bishops favor to him from this time visibly declined though it is questionable whether he really felt the indifference he expressed or he thought it advisable thus far to temporize hoping to deduct the sum of his own from the ill will of others it is rather probable however that his indifference was not affected for the bishop was a very prudent man and when he found that his kinsmans piety carried he thought in many instances to a strange extreme began to involve himself in inconveniences and suspicions which it had been his principal care throughout his life to avoid it is not unlikely that he might judge his friendship had led him too far from his own prudential maxims of behavior and that he might resolve to endanger his quiet no longer for the sake of a man whose obstinacy was insuperable about easter i was accused again before the bishop in many articles both from york and durham but these could take no farther hold against me than only to make the bishop to blot me out of his testament and to make the vulgar people speak evil of me for losing the disposal of the bishops goods i thought i was well unburthened and for the peoples favor to the end i might more edify in preaching otherwise i did not covet it i trusted time through gods goodness would bring it again extract of a letter from bernard gilpin to his brother    this was not less than mr gilpin expected nor more than he was well provided for he acknowledged his great obligations to the bishop was sorry to see him disgusted and would have given up any thing to have him satisfied except his conscience but a good conscience he was assured was his best friend and was resolved not to part with it for any friend upon earth  his enemies in the mean time were not thus silenced though they had been defeated a second time they were only the more spirited up by that additional rancour which generally attends the baffled designs of the malicious convinced however they now were how impossible it was to work up the bishop of durhams zeal to the height they wished and began to suspect he was either less orthodox himself or at least too much mr gilpins friend to have any hand in his condemnation they thought indeed if it could have been so brought about it would have given them least trouble and most satisfaction to have had him burnt at durham but as that could not be well effected they were determined to try whether it could not be done elsewhere thirtytwo articles were accordingly drawn up against him in the strongest manner and laid before bishop bonner of london  here they went the right way to work bonner was just the reverse of tunstal formed by nature for an inquisitor and the properest agent their malice could have employed the fierce zealot at once took fire extolled their laudable concern for religion and promised that the heretic should be at a stake in a fortnight  mr gilpins friends in london trembled for his safety and instantly dispatched a message  that he had not a moment to lose  the messenger did not surprise him he had long been preparing himself to suffer for the truth and he now determined not to decline it it was in some sort he thought denying his faith to be backward in giving the best testimony to it if it was proper he should be delivered he persuaded himself that god would take his own method to deliver him he was indeed in a great meafure weaned from the world daily more convinced of its vanity and more confirmed in his resolutions of considering it merely as a state preparatory to eternity and as it was the principal business of his life to promote religion if he could better effect this by his death it was his wish to die  he received the account therefore with great composure and immediately after called up william airay a favorite domestic who had long served him as his almoner and steward and laying his hand upon his shoulder at length says he they have prevailed against me  i am accused to the bishop of london from whom there will be no escaping  god forgive their malice and grant me strength to undergo the trial he then ordered his servant to provide a long garment for him in which he might go decently to the stake and desired it might be got ready with all expedition for i know not says he how soon i may have occasion for it  as soon as this garment was provided it is said he used to put it on every day till the bishops messengers apprehended him  his friends in the mean time failed not to interpose earnestly beseeching him while he had yet an opportunity to provided for his safety but he begged them not to press him longer upon that subject should he even attempt it he said he believed it would hardly be in his power to escape for he questioned not but all his motions were very narrowly observed  besides he would ask how they could imagine he would prefer the miserable life of an exile before the joyful death of a martyr be assured says he i should never have thrown myself voluntarily into the hands of my enemies but i am fully determined to persevere in doing my duty and shall take no measures to avoid them  in a few days the messengers apprehended him and put an end to these solicitations  in his way to london it is said he broke his leg which put a stop for some time to his journey the presons in whose custoday he was took occasion thence maliciously to retort upon him an observation he would frequently make that nothing happens to us but what is intended for our good asking him whether he thought his broken leg was so intended he answered meekly he made no question but it was and indeed so it proved in the strictest sense for before he was able to travel queen mary died and he was set at liberty  whatever truth there may be in this relation thus much however is certain the account of the queens death met him upon the road and put a stop to any farther prosecution  section v mr gilpin thus providentially rescued from his enemies returned to houghton through crowds of people expressing the utmost joy and blessing god for his deliverance  elizabeths accession freed him now from all restraints and allowed him the liberty he had long wished for of speaking his mind plainly to his parishioners though nobody but himself thought the reserve he had hitherto used at all faulty  it was now his friend the bishop of durhams turn to suffer he and some other bishops refusing the oath of supremacy were deprived and committed to the tower but this severity soon relaxed to the bishop of durham especially the government showed as much lenity as was thought consistent with the reformation then carrying on he was recommended to the care of the archbishop of canterbury with whom he spent in great tranquillity the short remainder of a very long life  this prelate had seen as great a variety of fortune as most men he had lived in difficult and in easy times he had known both protestants and papists in power and yet from all parties and in all revolutions of government he had found favor the truth is he was well versed in the arts of temporizing and possessed a large share of that complying philosophy which taking offense at nothing can adapt itself to all things when harry the eighth began to innovate the bishop of durham had no scruples when his son went farther still the bishop was quiet and owed indeed his confinement at the close of that reign to his desire of continuing so again when queen mary reversed what they had done with this too the bishop was satisfied and forgot all his sormer professions thus much however may justly be said of him that upon all occasions and where no secular ends were in view he showed himself a man of great moderation and whether in his heart he was more papist or protestant to arbitrary proceedings however in either persuasion he was wholly averse thus he thought things were carried too far on one side in king edwards time and too far on the other in queen marys with both reigns he was therefore dissatisfied though he was too great a lover of his ease to oppose them but as his days shortened his ambition decreased his conscience grew more tender and what he had done for king harry and king edward he refused to do again for queen elizabeth though the bishop of salisbury is of opinion he was not withheld by any scruples but such as a sense of decency raised from complying with that princess he was very old and thought it looked better to undergo the same fate with his brethren than to be still changing see burnets history of the reformation  and this is the rather probable because many historians say the late reign had given him a great disgust to popery and that he would often own to archbishop parker he began to think every day more favorably of the reformers  in private life his manners were very commendable he had an absolute command over himself a temper which no accident could discompose great humanity and great good nature in learning few of his contemporaries were equal to him none more ready to patronize it of the offices of friendship he was a strict observer and was not only a favourer but a zealous encourager of good men in a word where he was not immediately under the influence of courtmaxims he gave the example of a true christian bishop  mr gilpin though deprived of the assistance of this great prelate soon experienced however that worth like his could never be left friendless his merit raised him friends wherever he was known and though his piety was such that he never proposed reputation as the end of his actions yet perhaps few of his profession stood at this time higher in the public esteem he was respected say the bishop of chichester not only by the more eminent churchmen but by those of the first rank in the nation  when the popish bishops were deprived and many sees by that means vacant mr gilpins friends at court particularly the earl of bedford thought it a good opportunity to use their interest in his favor he was recommended accordingly to the queen as a proper person for one of the void bishoprics upon which as he was a northcountry man she nominated him to that of carlisle and the earl took immediate care that a conge d elire with her majestys recommendation of him should be sent down to the dean and chapter of that see  mr gilpin who knew nothing of what was going forward in his favor was greatly surprised at this unexpected honor yet could not by any means persuade himself to accept it he sent a messenger therefore with a letter to the earl expressing his great obligations to her majesty and his lordship for their favorable sentiments of him  but begged they would excuse his accepting their intended kindness  they had really thought of placing him in a station which he did not merit  he must therefore remove from himself a burden to which he who was best acquainted with his own weakness knew himself unequal  in the mean time he would not fail to do his utmost for the service of religion in an inferior employment  the earl upon the receipt of this letter went immediately to dr sandys bishop of worcester who was then in london as this prelate was intimately acquainted with mr gilpin and as the bishop of chichester says nearly related to him the earl supposed he could not be without his influence over him and therefore earnestly desired he would endeavor to persuade his friend to think less meanly of himself the bishop readily undertook the office and wrote the following letter to mr gilpin the original is lost but the bisnop of chichester has preserved a latin translation of it from which this is taken   my much respected kinsman regarding not so much your private interest as the interest of religion i did what i could that the bishopric of carlisle might be secured to you and the just character i gave of you to the queen has i doubt not had some weight with her majesty in her promoting of you to that see which not to mention the honor of it will enable you to be of the utmost service to the church of christ  i am not ignorant how much rather you choose a private station but if you consider the condition of the church at this time you cannot i think with a good conscience refuse this burden especially as it is in a part of the kingdom where no man is thought fitter than yourself to be of service to religion wherefore i charge you before god and as you will answer to him that laying all excuses aside you refuse not to assist your country and do what service you can to the church of god  in the mean time i can inform you that by the queens favor you will have the bishopric just in the condition in which dr oglethorpe left it nothing shall be taken from it as has been from some others  wherefore exhorting and beseeching you to be obedient to gods call herein and not to neglect the duty of your function i commend both you and this whole business to the divine providence your kinsman and brother  edwin worcester london april      0  this letter notwithstanding the pressing manner in which it is written was without effect mr gilpin returned his thanks but as for the bishopric he was determined and he thought for very good reasons not to accept it nor could all the persuasions of his friends alter this resolution had he they asked him any scruple of conscience about it  in one sense he had the case says he is truly this if any other bishopric besides carlisle had been offered to me i possibly might have accepted it but in that diocese i have so many friends and acquaintance of whom i have not the best opinion that i must either connive at many irregularities or draw upon myself so much hatred that i should be less able to do good there than any one else  mr gilpin thus persisting in his refusal the bishopric was was at length given to dr best a man by no means undeserving of it  this prelate soon found he had entered upon a very disagreeable and vexatious office his cathedral was filled with an illiterate set of men who had been formerly monks for as camden tells us the greater part of the popish priests thought it would turn to better account to renounce the popes authority and swear allegiance to the queen were it for no other end than the exclusion of protestants out of their churches and the relief of such of their own party who had been displaced this they judged a piece of discretion highly meritorious and hoped the pope would be so good as dispense with their oath on such an occasion the diocese of carlisle was much in this situation and indeed the people there were as strongly inclined to the superstitions of popery as the priests this disposition of the country whetted by the prelates rigid opposition who was not a man the most happily qualified to manage unruly tempers began to show itself in very violent effects the whole diocese was soon in a flame and the bishop after two years residence was obliged to repair to london and make a formal complaint to his superiors  this vexation which the popish party was likely to give to any one placed in the sea of carlisle is imagined by the author of archbishop grindals life to be a principal reason why mr gilpin refused it but this would have been as good a reason for his refusing the rectory of houghton or any other employment in the church for popery prevailed universally over the country and he could be placed no where in the north without experiencing a toilsome opposition to the bigotry and prejudices of it but his own ease and convenience were never motives of the least weight with him when any service to mankind could be balanced against them  the accounts given us by bishop nicholson and dr heylin of mr gilpins behavior upon this occasion are still more disingenuous they both ascribe it chiefly to lucrative motives the in his historical library former intimates that the good man knew what he was about when he refused to part with the rectory of houghton for the bishopric of carlisle the in his church history latter supposes that all his scruples would have vanished might he have had the old temporalities undiminished both these writers seem to have been very little acquainted with mr gilpins character in which disinterestedness bore so principal a part it will hereafter appear that he considered his income in no other light than that of a fund to be managed for the common good the bishops insinuation therefore is contradicted by every action of mr gilpins life and as for dr heylins it is most notoriously false for the bishopric was offered to him with the old temporalities undiminished   there were not wanting some who attributed his refusal of the bishopric to unfavourable sentiments of episcopacy but neither for this was there any good foundation he was indeed far from being a bigot to that or any other form of church government esteeming a good life which might be led under any of them the best evidence of a christian yet he seems to have thought most favorably of the episcopal form as will appear afterward when notice is taken of the endeavors of the dissenters to draw him to their party  the year after his refusal of the bishopric of carlisle an offer of another kind was made him  the provostship of queenscollege in oxford becoming vacant soon after elizabeths accession and the fellows who were strongly see the bishop of worcesters letter p  0  tached to popery being about to choose a person inclined the same way the queen with their visitor the archbishop of york interposed and insisted upon their electing dr francis the fellows were much out of humor at this proceeding and the affair made some noise in the university where the popish party was very strong at length however the queens recommendation took effect but though the fellows had thus chosen the person recommended to them yet their behavior was so undutiful toward him that he was soon weary of his office and in less than a year began to think of resigning it mr gilpin was the person he turned his thoughts on for a successor apprehending that such a change would not be unpleasing to the fellows and very agreeable to the queen he made him an offer therefore of resigning in his favor but not succeeding the first time he wrote again begging at least that he would recommend to him some proper person and assuring him with what readiness he would acquiesce in his choice his second letter is still preserved  after my hearty commendations meaning to leave the place which i occupy in the queenscollege at oxford and being desirous to prefer some honest learned godly and eligible person to that office i thought good yet once again to offer the provostship thereof unto you which if it please you to accept i shall be glad upon the sight of your letters written to that end to move the fellows whom i know do mean you marvelously well but and if you propose not to encumber yourself with so small a portion in unquietness so may i justly call it i shall wait your advice upon whom i may confer the same whom you think meet and eligible thereunto and i shall be ready to follow your advice upon the receiving of your letters wherewith i pray you speedily to certify me by yours to command  thomas francis oxford dec          how mr gilpin answered this letter does not appear nor whether he recommended a successor to the dissatisfied provost this only is certain that he refused the offer himself  thus having had in his option almost every kind of preferment which an ecclesiastic is capable of holding he sat down with one living which gratified the utmost of his desires  for he found it afforded him as many opportunities of doing good as he was able to make use of  soon after elizabeths accession a general visitation was held an assembly of divines among whom were parker grindal and sandys having finished a body of injunctions and articles commissions were issued out impowering proper persons to enforce them the oath of supremacy was to be tendered to the clergy and a subscription imposed when the visitors came to durham mr gilpin was sent to and requested to preach before the clergy there against the popes supremacy to this he had no objection but he did not like the thoughts of subscribing having some doubts with regard to one or more of the articles his curate having not these scruples he hoped that his subscription might satisfy the visitors but he was mistaken for the next day when the clergy were assembled to subscribe as an instance of respect mr gilpin was first called upon the emergency allowed him no time for reflection he just considered with himself that upon the whole these alterations in religion were certainly right  that he doubted only in a few immaterial points  and that if he should refuse it might be a means to keep others back he then took up the pen and with some hesitation at length subscribed afterward retiring he sent a letter to the visitors acquainting them in what sense he subscribed the articles which they accepted very favorably  the great ignorance which at this time prevailed over the nation afforded a melancholy prospect to all who had the interest of religion at heart to it was owing that gross superstition which kept reformation every where so long at a stand a superstition which was like to continue for all the channels through which knowledge could flow were choked up there were few schools in the nation and these as ill supplied as they were endowed the universities were in the hands of bigots collecting their strength to defend absurdities neglecting all good learning at cambridge indeed some advances in useful literature were made sir john cheke roger ascham sir john cheke was fellow of st johns and afterward tutor to edward the sixth in queen marys time he fled into germany but by a trick was brought home and recanted to save his life a great example says lloyd in his stateworthies of parts and ingenuity of frailty and infirmity of repentance and piety  roger ascham was fellow of the same college and professor of oratory in the university afterward tutor and secretary to queen elizabeth he was a man of great learning honesty and indiscretion    and a few others having boldly struck out a new path through that wilderness of false science which involved them but they were yet lazily followed  the very bad consequences which could not but be feared from this extreme ignorance turned the endeavors of all wellwishers to the progress of true religion upon the most probable methods to remove it the queen herself was greatly interested in this cause and earnestly recommended it to the care of her council her court was the seat of learning as well as the school of politeness here the scholar was had in equal esteem with the statesman and soldier and here all parts of literature found their respective patrons who began to vie with each other in their endeavors to root out false science as they had already done false religion  no good work ever went forward which mr gilpin did not promote as far as he was able in this he joined to the utmost of his abilities  as was commonly indeed thought beyond them his manner of living was the most affluent and generous his hospitality made daily a large demand upon him and his bounty and charities a much larger his acquaintance therefore could not but wonder to find him amidst such great expenses entertaining the design of building and endowing a grammar school a design however which his very exact economy soon enabled him to accomplish  the effects of his endowment were very quickly seen his school was no sooner opened than it began to flourish and to afford the agreeable prospect of a succeeding generation rising above the ignorance and errors of their forefathers  that such might be its effects no care on his part was wanting he not only placed able masters in his school whom he procured from oxford but himself likewise constantly inspected it and that encouragement might quicken the application of his boys he always took particular notice of the most forward he would call them his own schplars and would send for them often into his study and there instruct them himself  one method used by him to fill his school was a little singular whenever he met a poor boy upon the road he would make trial of his capacity by a few questions and if he found it such as pleased him he would provide for his education  nor did his care end here from his school he sent several to the universities where he maintained them wholly at his own expense to others who were in circumstances to do something for themselves he would give the farther assistance they needed by which means he induced many parents to allow their children a liberal education who otherwise would not have done it for all ambition of that kind was extinguished while the church was in possession of its immense wealth the universities were always full but when this was taken away it soon appeared that the muses unportioned had in those days very few charms their habitations were no longer crowded with a train of admirers in king edwards reign bishop latymer calculated that even in that shortspace of time since the alienation of the church lands the two universities were diminished by above ten thousand persons a number almost incredible  nor did mr gilpin think it enough to afford the means only of an academical education to these young people but endeavored with the utmost care to make it as beneficial to them as he could he still considered himself as their proper guardian and seemed to think himself bound to the public for their being made useful members of it as far as ever it lay in his power to make them so with this view he held a punctual correspondence with their tutors and made the youths themselves likewise frequently write to him and give him an account of their studies several of their letters chiesly preserved by having something of mr gilpins written upon their backs still remain and show in how great veneration he was held among them an extract from one of these letters is worth preserving it contains a curious account of that remarkable sickness in oxford which succeeded the black assize as it was afterward called the original is in latin  the terrible distemper among us of which you have undoubtedly heard has made it indeed a dreadful time to us during the first six days there died ninetyfive seventy of whom were scholars this is not conjecture but appears from the mayors list the infection does not confine itself to the town but begins to spread in the country where if our accounts are true it has carried off numbers of people amongst them poor mr roberts those who are seized with it are in the utmost torment their bowels are burnt up they call earnestly for drink they cannot bear the touch of clothes they entreat the standers by to throw cold water upon them sometimes they are quite mad rise upon their keepers run naked out of houses and often endeavor to put an end to their lives  the physicians are confounded declaring they have met with nothing similar either in their reading or practice yet many of them give this distemper a name though they have done nothing to show they are at all acquainted with its nature the greater part of them i am told have how left the town either out of fear for themselves or conscious that they can do no good  this dreadful distemper is now generally attributed to some jail insection brought into court at the assizes for it is remarkable that the first infected were those only who had been there  few women or old men have died  god be thanked the rage of this pestilence is now much abated it is still among us in some degree but its effects appear every day weaker   so solicitous indeed was he about them knowing the many temptations to which their age and situation exposed them that once every other year he generally made a journey to the universities to inspect their behavior  nor was this uncommon care unrewarded few of his scholars miscarried many of them says the bishop of chichester became great ornaments to the church and very exemplary irstances of piety  among those of any note who were educated by him i find these three particularly mentioned henry ayray george carleton and hugh broughton  henry ayray became afterward provost of queenscollege in oxford where he was in great esteem for his abilities and exemplary life  george carleton was a man of worth and learning and very deservedly promoted to the sea of chichester it might have been added that he was much caressed and employed by james i but the favors of that undistinguishing monarch reflected no great honor upon the objects of them  hugh broughton was indeed famous in his time and as a man of letters esteemed by many but in every other light despicable he was a remarkable instance of the danger of learning without common sense during the younger part of his life he confined himself to a college library where his trifling genius engaged him chiefly in rabbinical learning in which indeed he made a notable progress thus accomplished he came abroad with an opinion of himself equalled only by his sovereign contempt for others as he wanted that modest diffidence which is the natural guard of a person unacquainted with the world he soon involved himself in difficulties london was the scene where he first exposed himself here for some time he paid a servile court to the vulgar in the capacity of a popular preacher but afterward giving a freer scope to his vanity he set up a conventicle where assuming the air of an original he treated the opinions of the times and all who maintained them with an insufferable insolence and scurrility disappointed of his expected preferment and thoroughly mortified that his merit had been so long disregarded he withdrew into germany thither he carried his old temper attacking jews in synagogues and papists in masshouses but he was soon glad to return into england where having lived out all his credit and become the jest even of the stage see the alchymist of ben johnson act   sc   and act   sc    the fox act   sc    he died  a standing monument of the folly of applying learning to the purposes of vanity rather than the moral ends of life the following elegy upon mr broughtons death written in the year      i met with accidentally the reader will not be displeased with it as it is a very beautiful composition and serves likewise to illustrate mr broughtons character for though meant as an encomium it is rather a satyr upon him for employing himself in matters of mere curiosity in the most trifling studies which belonged to his profession  a comely dame in sorrows garments dressed where chrystalsliding thames does gently creep with her soft palm did beat her ivory breast and rent her yellow locks her rosy cheek she in a flood of briny tears did steep rachel she

babels king did in a troubled slumber once behold like huge goliath slain by davids sling whose dreadful head and curled locks were gold with breasts and mighty arms of silver mould whose swelling belly and large sides were brass whose legs were iron feet of mingled mass of which one part was clay the other iron was what meant the lion plumed in eagles wings what meant the bear that in his horrid jaw three ribs of some devoured carcass brings what meant the leopard which belshazzar saw with dreadful mouth and with a murdering paw and what that alldevouring horned beast with iron teeth and with his horrid crest all this and much besides by broughton was expressed it was he that branched messiahs sacred stem in curious knots and traced his earthly race from princely adam to the noble sem so down to him that held coniahs place and from his son to mary full of grace a heavenly maid a blessed virginwife who highly favored gave the precious life the ransom of a world from sin and

yon celestial bowers and reigns triumphant with a choir of heavenly powers    but to return while mr gilpin was engaged in settling his school he was for some time interrupted by a rebellion which broke out in the north the popish party which had given so much disturbance to elizabeths reign made at this time a fresh effort two factious spirits the earls of westmorland and northumberland inflamed by the seditious whispers of a romish emissary were drawn from their allegiance the watchful ministry soon suspected them and the queen with her usual foresight appointing a short day for their appearance at court obliged them yet unprepared to take arms  mr gilpin had observed the fire gathering before the flame barst out and knowing what zealots would soon approach him he thought it prudent to withdraw having given proper advice therefore to his masters and scholars he took the opportunity to make a journey to oxford  the rebels in the mean time publish their manifesto and appear in arms displaying in their banners a chalice and the five wounds of christ and enthusiastically brandishing a cross before them in this order they march to bernardcastle which surrenders to them they next surprise durham where they burn all the bibles they can find and have mass said publicly in the cathedral the country around felt their rage many of them ravaged as far as houghton here they found much booty the harvest was just over the barns were full the grounds well stocked with fatted cattle every thing became their prey and what was designed to spread a winters gladness through a country was in a moment wasted by these ravagers  but themselves soon felt the consternation they occasioned the approach of the earl of sussex with a numerous army was now confirmed every rumor brought him nearer their fears proportionally increase they mutiny throw down their arms and disperse the country being generally loyal many were taken and imprisoned at durham and newcastle where sir george bows was commissioned to try them  here mr gilpin had an opportunity of showing his humanity sir george had received personal ill treatment from them and the clamours of a plundered country demanded the utmost legal severity and indeed the utmost legal severity was exercised to the great indignation of all who were not wholly bent on revenge this induced mr gilpin to interpose he represented to the marshal the true state of the country that in general the people were well affected but being extremely ignorant many of them had been seduced by idle stories which the rebels had propagated making them believe they took up arms for the queens service persuaded by what he said or paying a deference to his character the marshal grew more mild and showed instances of mercy not expected from him  about this time mr gilpin lost one of the most intimate friends he ever had dr pilkington bishop of durham a man much admired for his learning but more esteemed for the integrity of his life he was bred at cambridge where he was many years master of st johns college here he was first taken notice of for a freedom of speech which drew upon him queen marys resentment but he had the good fortune to escape the inquisition of those times in the succeeding reign he recommended himself by an exposition of the book of haggai or rather by an ingenious application of it to the reformation in religion then designing he was afterward introduced to the queen and being found a man of true moderation the reforming temper then looked for and of abilities not unequal to the charge he was promoted to the sea of durham having taken upon him this trust he made it the endeavor of his life to fulfill it he withdrew himself immediately from all state avocations and court dependencies in which indeed he had never been much involved and applied himself wholly to the duties of his function promoting religion rather by his own example than by the use of proper discipline in which he was thought too remiss  at durham he became acquainted with mr gilpin their minds intent on the same pursuits easily blended it was a pure friendship in which interest had no share for the one had nothing to ask the other had nothing to receive when business did not require their being separate they were generally together as often at mr gilpins as at the bishops at these meetings they consulted many pious designs induced by mr gilpins example the bishop founded a school at the place of his nativity in lancashire the statutes of which he brought to his friend to revise and correct  section vi mr gilpins blameless life his reputation in the world his piety his learning and that uncommon regard for truth which he had always discovered made it the desire of persons of all religious persuasions to get him of their party and have their cause credited by his authority  the dissenters made early proposals to him the reformation had scarce obtained a legal settlement under elizabeth when that party appeared its origin was this  the english protestants whom the marian persecution had driven from home flying in great bodies into germany and switzerland settled at frankfort strasburgh arrow zuric and geneva of all these places frankfort afforded them the kindest reception here by the favor of the magistracy they obtained the joint use of a church with the distressed protestants of france to whom likewise frankfort at that time afforded protection these were chiefly calvinists religious prejudices between both parties were however here laid aside their circumstances as fellowexiles in a foreign land and fellow sufferers in a common cause inspired them with mutual tenderness in one great animosity all others subsided and protestant and papist became the only distinction in a word the english thinking their own church now dissolved having no material objections and being the lesser body for the sake of peace and convenience receded from their liturgy and conformed to the french some authors indeed mention this as an imposed condition be it however as it will the coalition was no sooner known than it gave the highest offense to many of the english settled in other parts it was scandalous they exclaimed to show so little regard to an establishment which was formed with so much wisdom was so well calculated for all the ends of religion and for which their poor brethren in england were at that time laying down their lives the truth of the case was the argument had been before moved and this was only the rekindling of that flame which john a lasco had formerly raised john a lasco was a native of poland from whence being driven on the account of his religion he retired into england where by the favor of edward the sixth he was allowed to open a church for the use of those of his own persuasion but he made only a bad use of this indulgence interfering very impertinently in the ecclesiastical controversies then on foot    an opposition so very unseasonable produced as such oppositions generally do the worst effects besides the scandal it every where gave it engaged the frankfort english in a formal defense of their proceedings and their passions being excited they began at length to maintain on principle what they at first espoused only for convenience accordingly when they came home they revived the dispute with bitterness enough and became then as unreasonable in molesting as they had before been unreasonably molested subtle men will never be wanting who have their sinister ends to serve by partyquarrels thus some ambitious spirits among the dissenters wanting to make themselves considerable blew up the flame with great vehemence it was as good they exclaimed not to begin a reformation as not to go through with it  the church of england was not half reformed  its doctrines indeed were tolerable but its ceremonies and government were popish and unchristian  it was in vain to boast of having thrown off the romish yoke abroad while the nation groaned under a lordly hierarchy at home  and for themselves as they had been sufferers in the cause of religion they thought it was but right they should be consulted about the settlement of it this imprudent language was a melancholy presage to all who had real christianity at heart it was answered that things were now legally settled  that whatever could give just offense to the scrupulous had been it was thought removed  that if they could not conform a quiet nonconformity would be tolerated  and that the many inconveniences attending even that change which was absolutely necessary made it very disagreeable to think of another which was not so the lord burleigh endeavored to convince them how impossible it was in things of this nature to give universal satisfaction by showing them that even among themselves they could not agree upon the terms of an accommodation and sir francis walsingham proposed to them from the queen that the three things in the established church to which they most objected should be abolished but they answered lostily in the language of moses that not an hoof should be left behind this irreconcilable temper gave great offense not only to the churchmen but to the more serious of their own persuasion the government from this time slighting them they appealed to the people and by the popular artifice of decrying authority they soon became considerable  such were the beginnings of those dissentions which our prudent forefathers entailed on their posterity  the dissenters having thus formed their party among the people endeavored to strengthen it by soliciting every where the most creditable persons in favor of it very early applications as was observed were made to mr gilpin his refusal of the bishopric of carlisle had given them favorable sentiments of him and great hopes that in his heart he had no dislike to their cause but they soon found their mistake he was wholly dissatisfied with their proceedings religious disputes were in his opinion of such dreadful consequence that he always thought when true christianity under any form of church government was once established in a country that form ought not to be altered unless blameable in some very material points the reformation he said was just essentials were there concerned but at present he saw no ground for dissatisfaction the church of england he thought gave no reasonable offense some things there might be in it which had been perhaps as well avoided it is probable he here means particularly the use of vestments which gave a good deal of offense at that time  bishop burnet speaking of some letters he saw at zuriek between bullinger and some of the reformed bishops has the following paragraph which it will not be improper to quote at length as it gives us a good idea of those times  most of these letters contain only the general news but some were more important and relate to the disputes then on foot concerning the habits of the clergy which gave the first beginnings to our unhappy divisions and by the letters of which i read the originals it appears that the bishops preserved their ancient habits rather in compliance with the queens inclinations than out of any liking they had to them so far were they from liking them that they plainly expressed their dislike of them jewel in a letter bearing date the  th of feb      wishes that the vestments together with all the other remains of popery might be thrown both out of their churches and out of the minds of the people and laments the queens fixednese to them so that she would suffer no change to be made  and in january the same year sandys writes to the same purpose contenditur de vestibus papisticis utendis ve non utendis dabit deus his quoque finem disputes are now on foot concerning the popish vestments whether they should be used or not but god will put an end to these things  horn bishop of winchester went further for in a letter dated july         he writes of the act concerning the habits with great regret and expresses some hopes that it might be repealed next session of parliament if the popish party did not hinder it and he seems to stand in doubt whether he should conform himself to it or not upon which he desires bullingers advice and in many letters writ on that subject it is asserted that both cranmer and ridley intended to procure an act for abolishing the habits and that they only defended their lawfulness but not their fitness and therefore they blamed private persons that refused to obey the laws  grindal in a letter dated the   th of august      writes that all the bishops who had been beyond the sea had at their return dealt with the queen to let the matter of the habits fall but she was so prepossessed that though they had all endeavored to divert her from prosecuting that matter she continued still inflexible this had made them resolve to submit to the laws and to wait for a fit opportunity to reverse them he laments the ill effects of the opposition that some had made to them which had extremely irritated the queens spirit so that she was now much more heated in those matters than formerly he also thanks bullinger for the letter he had writ justifying the lawful use of the habits which he says had done great service  cox bishop of ely in one of his letters laments the aversion that they found in the parliament to all the propositions that were made for the reformation of abuses  jewel in a letter dated the   d of may      writes that the queen refused to be called head of the church and adds that that title could not justly be given to any mortal it being due only to christ and that such titles had been so much abused by antichrist that they ought not to be any longer continued  on all these passages i will make no reflections here for i set them down only to show what was the sense of our chief churchmen at that time concerning those matters which have since engaged us in such warm and angry disputes and this may be no inconsiderable instruction to one that intends to write the history of that time dr burnets travels let    but to disturb the peace of a nation for such trifles he thought was quite unchristian  and indeed what appeared to him chiefly blameable in the dissenters was that heat of temper with which they propagated their opinions and treated those who differed from them neither episcopal nor presbyterian government nor caps nor furplices nor any external things were matters with him half so interesting as peace and charity among christians and this was his constant topic in all his occasional conversations with that party  such however was the opinion they entertained of him that notwithstanding these casual intimations of his dislike to them they still persisted in their endeavors to gain him to their side the chief of them failed not to set before him what they had to say of most weight against the established discipline and a person of esteemed abilities among them came on purpose from cambridge to discourse with him upon the best form of ecclesiastical government but this agent did his cause little credit with no great learning he had an insupportable vanity and seemed to take it for granted that himself and calvin were the two greatest men in the world his discourse had nothing of argument in it an indecent invective against episcopacy was the sum of it he was so full of himself that mr gilpin thought it to no purpose to reason with him and therefore avoided whatever could lead them into a dispute  some time after mr gilpin heard that his late visitant had reported him to have affirmed speaking about the primitive times that the virtues of the moderns were not equal even to the infirmities of the fathers he said indeed he remembered some such thing coming from him but not in the serious manner in which it was represented his adversary had been decrying the fathers greatly declaring there were men in this age much their superiors plainly intimating whom he principally intended such arrogance mr gilpin said he was desirous to mortify and meant it of such moderns as him when he asserted that their virtues were not equal to the infirmities of the fathers  the success the dissenters had met with in their private applications encouraged them to try what farther might be had by a public attack on the national church their great champion was dr cartwright who wrote with much bitterness against it his book was immediately dispersed over the nation received by the party with loud acclamations and every where considered by them as unanswerable  very soon after it was published it was zealously put into mr gilpins hands the gentleman who sent it one dr birch a warm friend to the principles advanced in it desired he would read it over carefully and communicate to him his remarks but very impatient for them he sent a messenger before mr gilpin had read the book half through he returned it however with the following lines which show his opinion of church government in general  multa quidem legi sed plura legenda reliqui posthac cum dabitur copia cuncta legam optant ut careat maculis ecclesia cunctis praesens vita negat vita futura dabit your volume half perused with cautious pains for future leisure what is left remains zealous you will the church with ardor vain free from each fault and clear from every stain perfection suits not with a state below that bliss alone a future can bestow t d    though mr gilpin was thus greatly dissatisfied with the disorderly zeal which the more violent of the dissenters expressed attended as he observed it was with such fatal consequences he confined however his dislike to their errors to their persons he bore not the least ill will nay one of the most intimate friends he ever had was mr lever a minister of their persuasion and a sufferer in their cause  this gentleman had been head of a college in cambridge and afterward prebendary of durham and master of sherbornhospital he was a man of good parts considerable learning and very exemplary piety and had been esteemed in king edwards time an eminent and bold preacher during the succeeding confusion he settled at arrow in switzerland where he was teacher to a congregation of english exiles here he became a favourer of calvins opinions and at his return home was considered as one of the principal of the dissenting party the very great indiscretions already mentioned of a few violent men soon made that whole party obnoxious to the government to which nothing perhaps more contributed than the seditious application of that doctrine to elizabeth which had been formerly propagated against female government by knox and goodman in the reign of her sister this was touching that jealous queen in a most sensible part and induced her perhaps too rigorously though she was really ill used to press uniformity  among others mr lever suffered he was convened before the archbishop of york and deprived of his ecclesiastical preferment many of the cooler churchmen thought him hardly dealt with as he was really a moderate man and not forward in opposing the received opinions  mr gilpin was among those who pitied his treatment nor did he scruple to express his usual regard for him though it was not a thing the most agreeable to his superibrs but he had too much honor to sacrifice friendship to popular prejudice and thought that they who agreed in essentials should not be estranged from each other for their different sentiments on points of less importance  as mr gilpin was thus solicited on one hand by the dissenters so was he on the other by the papists it had long been a mortification to all the wellmeaning of that persuasion that so good a man had left their communion and no methods were left untried to bring him back but his change had been a work of too much caution to be repented of so that all their endeavors proved as it was easy to suppose they would ineffectual  a letter of his written upon an occasion of this kind may here not improperly be inserted to show how well satisfied he was at this time with having left the church of rome and how unlikely it was that he should ever again become a member of it i wish i could give this letter in its original simplicity but the manuscript is so mutilated that it is impossible to transcribe a fair copy from it the bishop of chichester however has given a latin translation of it from which i shall take as much of it as is worth preserving it was writ in answer to a long letter from one mr gelthorpe a relation of mr gilpin who being a warm papist himself was very uneasy that his kinsman and friend should be a protestant he failed not therefore to suggest to him what he could think of in favor of popery and of the danger of apostatizing concluding his letter thus   now i beseech you remember what god has called you to and beware of passionate doings i know you have suffered under great slanders and evil reports yet you may by gods grace bridle all affections and be an upright man the port of you is great at london and in all other places so that in my opinion you shall in these days even shortly either do much good leaning to the truth or else which i pray god turn away from us you shall do as much evil to the church as ever arius did   to this letter the following was mr gilpins answer  i received your letter when i had very little time to answer it as the bearer can inform you i did not care however to send him back without some return though in the latter part of your letter you say enough to tempt me to do so for what encouragement have i to write when you tell me you are predetermined not to be persuaded it could not but damp the prophets zeal when he cried out hear the word of the lord to be answered by a stubborn people we will not hear  but let us leave events to god who can soften the heart of man and give sense to the deaf adder which shuts her ears  you look back you say upon past ages but how far if you would carry your view as high as christ and his apostles nay only as high as the primitive times and examine them without prejudice you could not but see a strange alteration of things and acknowledge that a thousand errors and absurdities have crept into the church while men slept  it grieves me to hear you talk of your concern for the suppression of abbeys and monasteries numbers even of your own communion have confessed that it was impossible for them to stand any longer they were grown up into such monstrous sanctuaries for all kinds of vice that their cry no doubt like that of sodom ascended into the ears of god besides consider what pests they were to all good learning and religion how they preyed upon all the rectories in the kingdom amassing to themselves for the support of their vices that wealth which was meant by pious founders for the maintenance of industrious clergymen  he that comes to god you say must believe without doubt but i would have you consider that religious faith can have no foundation but the word of god he whose creed is founded upon bulls indulgences and such trumpery can have no true faith all these things will vanish where the word of god has efficacy  you say you cannot see any thing in the romish church contrary to the gospel i should think if you looked narrowly into it you might see the gospel entirely rejected and in its room legends traditions and a thousand other absurdities introduced  but this is an extensive subject and i have little leisure some other time prpbably i may write more largely upon these points may god in the mean time open your eyes to see the abominations of the city upon seven hills rev    consult st jerome upon this passage  you use the phrase if you should now begin to drink of another cup whereas you never drank of any cup at all how can you defend i would gladly know this single corruption or reconcile it with that express command of christ drink ye all of this i am sure if you can defend it it was more than any of your learned doctors at louvain could do as i myself can witness  as to our being called heretics and avoided by you we are extremely indifferent we appeal from your uncharitable censures to almighty god and say with st paul we little esteem to be judged of you it is the lord who judges us  but you say it is dangerous to hear us so said the persecutors of st stephen and stopped their ears so likewise amaziah behaved to the prophet amos david likewise speaks of such men comparing them to the deaf adder which stops her ears and we have instances of the same kind of bigotry in the writings of the evangelists where we often read of men whose minds the god of this world has blinded  as for the terrible threatenings of your bishop we are under no apprehension from them they are calculated only for the nursery erasmus properly calls them bruta fulmina if the pope and his cardinals who curse us with so much bitterness were like peter and paul if they discovered that fervent charity that extensive benevolence and noble zeal in their masters cause which distinguished those apostles then were there some reason to dread their censures but alas they have changed the humility of peter into the pride of lucifer the labors and poverty of apostles into the sloth and luxury of eastern monarchs  i am far from thinking there is no difference between consubstantiality and transubstantiation the former undoubtedly has many texts of scripture for its support the latter certainly none nay it has so confounded many of its most zealous assertors scotus occam biel and others that it is plain how perplexed they are to get over the many difficulties that arise from it indeed scotus thought as bishop tunstal would ingenuously confess that the church had better make use of some less labored exposition of those words in scripture and the good bishop himself likewise though he would have men speak reverently of the sacrament as the primitive church did yet always said that transubstantiation might well have been let alone as to what mr chedsey said that the catholics would do well to give way in the article of transubstantiation i cannot say i heard him speak the words myself but i had them from a person who did  i am far from agreeing with you that the lives of so many vicious popes should be passed over in silence if the vices of churchmen should thus be concealed i know not how you will defend christ for rebuking the pharisees who were the holy fathers of those times or the prophet isaiah who is for having good and evil distinguished and denounces a curse upon those who call him holy that is not holy or st bernard likewise who scruples not to call some wicked priests in his time the ministers of antichrist such examples may excuse us  five sacraments you say are rejected by us you mistake we use them still as the scripture authorizes nay even to the name of sacrament we have no objection only suffer us to give our own explanation of it i find washing of feet and many other things of the same kind are called sacraments by some old writers but the fathers and some of the best of the schoolmen are of opinion that only baptism and the lords supper can properly be called sacraments  i am surprised to hear you establish on a few easy passages in st paul the several ridiculous ceremonies of the mass surely you cannot be ignorant that most of them were invented long afterward by the bishops of rome  how much you observe st paul upon other occasions is evident from your strange abuse of the institution of bread and wine there it signifies nothing what the apostle says tradition is the better authority  you tell me you can prove the use of prayers for the dead from scripture i know you mean the book of maccabees but our church follows the opinion of the fathers in saying that these books are profitable for manners but not to be used in establishing doctrines  st austin you say doubts whether there be not a purgatory and so because he doubts it the church of rome has established it as an article of faith now i think if she had reasoned right from the saints doubts she should at least have left it indifferent faith you know st james says ought not to waver the bishop of rochester who was a diligent searcher into antiquity says that among the ancients there is little or no mention made of purgatory for myself i am apt to think it was first introduced by that grand popish traffic of indulgencies  as to what you say about the invocation of saints st austin you know himself exhorts his readers not to ground their faith upon his writings but on the scriptures and indeed i think there is nothing in the whole word of god more plainly declared to us than this that god alone must be the object of our adoration how shall they call on him says st paul in whom they have not believed if we believe in one god only why should we pray to any more the popish distinction between invocation and advocation is poor sophistry as we are told we must pray only to one god so we read likewise of only one advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous  you say you believe in the communion of saints and infer that no communion with them can subsist unless we pray to them but our church understands quite another thing by the communion of saints for the word saint is a common scripture epithet for a good christian nor does it once signify in either testament as far as i can remember a departed soul nay sometimes the words are very express as in the sixteenth psalm to the saints which be on earth if any man ever had a communion with the saints in heaven surely david had it but he never speaks of any communion with which he was acquainted but with the saints on earth  and thus likewise st john speaks what we have seen and known that declare we unto you that you may have fellowship or communion with us and that our communion may be with god and with his son jesus christ   john i   all the members of the church of christ have communion among themselves which communion consists chiefly in mutual prayers and preaching secondly the church of christ has communion with the father and the son or with the father through the son that such communion as this exists we have good authority but none at all for a belief in a communion with departed souls these as i observed before are never in scripture called saints but generally described by some such periphrasis as the congregation of the firstborn in heaven or the spirits of just men made perfect in the next world probably with these likewise we may have communion but they who expect it in this must either bring scripture for what they say or come under our saviors censure in vain do ye worship me teaching for doctrines the traditions of men matt xv    indeed by the custom of late ages departed souls are called saints but i hope i need not inform you that the holy scripture is a more proper directory than the custom of any age  but it is needless to dispute upon this point because even the most zealous defenders of it acknowledge it to be a thing indifferent whether we pray immediately to god or through the mediation of saints and if it be a thing indifferent sure a wise man knows what to do who does not expect purer water at the fountainhead than at the little streams that run from it  as for what you say about images and fasting the proper use of which latter god forbid that i should say any thing against together with your arguments in favor of relics and exorcisms i could without any sort of difficulty reply to them but at this time you really must excuse me it is not an apology of course when i assure you that i am now extremely busy you will the more easily believe me when i tell you that i am at present without a curate and that i am likewise a good deal out of order and hardly able to undergo the necessary fatigues of my office  as to your not choosing to come to houghton on a sunday for fear of offending my people to say the truth except you will come to church which i think you might do very well i should not much desire to see you on that day for country people are strangely given to copy a bad example and will unlearn more in a day than they have been learning for a month  you must excuse my freedom you know my heart and how gladly i would have it to say of those whom thou gave me have i lost none but on any other day or if you will come on sunday night and stay a week with me i shall be glad to see you we may then talk over these things with more freedom and though as i observed before the latter part of your letter gives me no great encouragement yet i will endeavor to have a better hope of you than you have of yourself st paul in the early part of his life was fully persuaded that he should die a pharisee and an enemy to the cross of christ but there was a reserve of mercy in store for him and through gods grace his heart became so changed that he suffered persecution himself for that name which it had been before his ambition to persecute  may the great god of heaven make you an object of the same mercy and by the spirit of knowledge lead your mind into all truth i am etc  bernard gilpin   section vii the public generally sees us in disguise the case is we ordinarily pay a greater deference to the worlds opinion than to our own consciences hence a mans real merit is very improperly estimated from the more exposed part of his behavior  the passages of mr gilpins life already collected are chiefly of a public nature if we may thus call any action of a life so private to place his merit therefore in its truest light it will be necessary to accompany him in his retirement and take a view of his ordinary behavior from which all restraint was taken off hence we shall have the fullest proof of what he truly was upon what principles he acted and that the virtue he practiced was not the effect of any deference to the worlds opinion but of inward conviction and a sincere desire to act agreeably to the will of his creator  when he first took upon him the care of a parish he laid it down as a maxim to do all the good in his power there and indeed his whole conduct was only one strait line drawn to this point  he set himself to consider how he might best perform the charge entrusted to him the pastoral care he saw was much neglected the greater part of the clergy he could not but observe were scandalously negligent of it accepting livings only with secular views and even they who seemed desirous of being accounted serious in the discharge of their ministry too often he thought considered it in a light widely different from its true one some he observed made it consist in asserting the rights of the church and the dignity of their function others in a strenuous opposition to the prevailing sectaries and a zealous attachment to the established church government a third sort in examining the speculative points and mystical parts of religion none of them in the mean time considering either in what the true dignity of the ministerial character consisted or the only end for which church government was at all established or the practical influence which can alone make speculative points worth our attention  all this he observed with concern observed resolving to pursue a different path and to follow the laudable example of those few who made the pastoral care to consist in a strenuous endeavor to amend the lives of those they were concerned with and to promote their truest happiness both here and hereafter  the strange disorder of that part of the country where his lot fell has already been observed the extreme of ignorance and of course of superstition was its characteristic the great care of parker archbishop of canterbury his frequent and strict visitations his severe inquiries into the ministry of the clergy and manners of the laity had made a very visible alteration for the better in the southern parts of england but in the north reformation went on but sluggishly the indolent archbishop of york slept over his province in what great disorder the good bishop grindal found it upon his translation thither in the year    0 appears from his episcopal injunctions among which are these very extraordinary ones that no pedlar should be admitted to sell his wares in the churchporch in time of service  that parishclerks should be able to read  that no lords of misrule or summer lords and ladies or any disguised persons morricedancers or others should come irreverently into the church or play any unseemly parts with scoffs jests wanton gestures or ribald talk in the time of divine service  from these things we may conceive the state of the parish of houghton when mr gilpin came there one would imagine it was in this part of the country where bishop latimer was traveling when he gives us the following account  i sent word overnight to a town that i would preach there in the morning because it was a holy day when i came to the church where i thought i should have found a great company the door was fast locked i tarried half an hour at last one of the parish comes to me and says sir this is a busy day with us we cannot hear you it is robin hoods day the parish is gone abroad to gather for robin hood i pray you hinder them not so i was fain to give place to robin hood sermon vi before the king     amidst such ignorance to introduce a knowledge of religion was a laborious work as difficult as a first plantation of the gospel there was the same building to raise and as much rubbish to clear away for no prejudices could be stronger and more alien to christianity than those he had to oppose  he set out with making it his endeavor to gain the affection of his parishioners many of his papers show how material a point he considered this to succeed in it however he used no servile compliances he would have his means good as well as his end his behavior was free without levity obliging without meanness insinuating without art he condescended to the weak bore with the passionate complied with the scrupulous in a truly apostolic manner he became all things to all men by these means he gained mightily upon his neighbors and convinced them how heartily he was their friend  to this humanity and courtesy he added an unwearied application to the duties of his function he was not satisfied with the advice he gave in public but used to instruct in private and brought his parishioners to come to him with their doubts and difficulties he had a most engaging manner toward those whom he thought welldisposed nay his very reproof was so conducted that it seldom gave offense the becoming gentleness with which it was urged made it always appear the effect of friendship thus laying himself out in admonishing the vicious and encouraging the wellintentioned in a few years he made a greater change in his neighborhood than could well have been imagined  a remarkable instance what reformation a single man may effect when he has it earnestly at heart  but his hopes were not so much in the present generation as in the succeeding it was an easier task he found to prevent vice than to correct it to form the young to virtue than to amend the bad habits of the old he laid out much of his time therefore in an endeavor to improve the minds of the younger part of his parish nor did he only take notice of those within his school but in general extended his care through the whole place suffering none to grow up in an ignorance of their duty but pressing it as the wisest part to mix religion with their labor and amidst the cares of this life to have a constant eye upon the next  nor did he omit whatever besides might be of service to his parishioners  he was very affiduous in preventing all lawsuits among them his hall is said to have been often thronged with people who came to him about their differences he was not indeed much acquainted with law but he could decide equitably and that satisfied nor could his sovereigns commission have given him more weight than his own character gave him  he had a just concern for all under affliction and was a much readier visitant at the house of mourning than at that of feasting he had conversed so much in the world that he knew how to apply himself to the most different tempers and his large fund of reading and experience always furnished something that would properly affect them hence he was considered as a good angel by all in distress  when the infirmities of age came upon him and he grew less able to endure exercise it was his custom to write letters of consolation to such as were in affliction the following letter of this kind the reader may perhaps think worth his perusal  after my most due commendations i beseech you gentle mrs carr diligently to call to mind how mercifully god has dealt with you in many respects he has given you a gentleman of worship to be your husband one that i know loves you dearly as a christian man should love his wife and by him god has blessed you with a goodly family of children which both you and your husband must take to be the favorable and free gift of god  but good mrs carr you must understand that both that gift of god and all others and we ourselves are in his hands he takes what he will whom he will and when he will and whomsoever he takes in youth or in age we must fully persuade ourselves that he orders all things for the best we may not murmur or think much at any of his doings but must learn to speak from our hearts the petition of the lords prayer thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven it is unto this holy obedience that st peter calls all christians saying humble yourselves under the mighty hand of god  this godly submiffion did cause the holy patriarch job when it pleased god to take from him not only one but all his children seven brethren and sisters upon one day never to grieve himself with what god had done but meekly to say the lord gave and the lord has taken away blessed be the name of the lord  and here i would have you good mrs carr to consider how small cause you have to mourn or fall into a deep sorrow in comparison of the holy patriarch god has taken from you only one young daughter and has left you a goodly family of children which i trust with good education will prove a blessed comfort to you  this example of job and other examples in holy scripture being written as the apostle says for our admonition i must needs declare you to be worthy of great blame if you continue any space in such great sorrow and heaviness as i hear you take for your young daughter st peter says that christ jesus suffered for us most cruel torments and last of all a most cruel death to leave us an example that all that believe in him should follow his blessed steps that is to bear his cross to be armed with all patience whenever we lose any thing that we love in this world and the same apostle says seeing christ has suffered for us in his body all you that are christians must be armed with the same thought  furthermore the scripture says that unto us it is given not only to believe in christ but also to suffer for his sake and st paul in the  th to the romans has a most comfortable sentence to all that will learn to suffer with him and a most fearful sentence to all those that refuse to suffer with him and to bear his cross the spirit says he bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs heirs of god and fellowheirs with christ it follows if so be that we suffer together with him that we may also be glorified with him and st paul in the first chapter of the second to the corinthians says to all the faithful as ye are companions of those things which christ has suffered so shall ye be companions of his consolations  all these things considered i doubt not good mr carr but that you will arm yourself with patience and bear christs cross learning to suffer for his sake and that were it a greater loss than you have god be praised as yet sustained  let your faith overcome your sorrow st paul writing to the thessalonians concerning the dead who he says have but fallen asleep forbids them not to mourn but utterly forbids them to mourn like gentiles and infidels who have no hope in christ and the wise man ecclus xxii does exhort us to mourn over the dead so it be but for a little space weep says he for the dead but only for a little time because they are gone to their rest so you see there is an unreasonable mourning of them that want faith and there is also a temperate and lawful mourning of them that have a steadfast belief in christ and his promises which st john says overcomes all the temptations that is the troubles of the world i trust verily good mrs carr that your mourning being temperate will show itself to be a faithful not a faithless mourning which latter i pray almighty god to keep from you  but i fear to be tedious i trust one day i shall be able to come unto you myself in the mean space and evermore i shall pray that the god of all consolation may comfort you in all your troubles your loving friend in christ  bernard gilpin houghton may             he used to interpose likewise in all acts of oppression and his authority was such that it generally put a stop to them  a person against whom the country at that time exclaimed very much was one mr barns a near relation if not a brother of dr barns bishop of durham who raised him through some inferior posts to the chancellorship of his diocese this man though at the head of an ecclesiastical court would have been a scandal to the meanest office he was indeed the tyrant of the country considering his power only as the means of gratifying his vicious inclinations among which as avarice bore a ruling part oppression was its natural effect between this man and mr gilpin there was a perpetual opposition for many years the latter endeavoring always to counteract the former and to be the redresser of those injuries of which he was the author several traces of these contests still remain among mr gilpins papers from which it appears what a constant check upon his designs mr barns found him though he was never treated by him with any bitterness but always in a mild and even affectionate manner it will be but a very few years mr gilpin tells him concluding a letter written in favor of three orphans whom mr barns had defrauded of their patrimony before you and i must give up our great accounts i pray god give us both the grace to have them in a constant readiness and may you take what i have written in as friendly a manner as it is meant my daily prayers are made for you to almighty god whom i beseech evermore to preserve you by being thus at all times ready to espouse the cause of the injured he showed not only humanity but resolution likewise without which our concern for the distresses of others will often go but a very little way toward their relief for as compassion is only instinct consulting in its operations perhaps our own relief chiefly of course he who is governed by no steadier principle will desert the benevolent part when fatigue or danger throw difficulties in his way but he who can exert resolution in the cause of the oppressed is a friend indeed he is influenced by a fixed principle the effect of rational consideration this enables him to overcome the suggestions of fear and selfishness which prompt most men like the timorous herd to shun the unfortunate the humane part mr gilpin acted no doubt often exposed him to inconveniences but he made little account of them justly reflecting that upon the whole what was right was best  thus he lived in his parish careful only to discharge his duty no fatigue or difficulty could excuse him to himself for the omission of any part of it the moral improvement of his people was his principal endeavor and the success of this endeavor his principal happiness  notwithstanding however all this painful industry and the large scope it had in so extended a parish he thought the sphere of his benevolence yet too confined it grieved him extremely to see every where in the parishes around him so much ignorance and superstition occasioned by the very great neglect of the pastoral care in the clergy of those parts how ill supplied the northern churches at this time were has already been observed and will still appear in a stronger light if we compare the state of these churches with that of those in the southern parts of the island which were universally allowed to have been less neglected of one diocese that of ely where the clergy do not appear to have been uncommonly remiss we have a curious account still preserved it contained one hundred and fiftysix parishes of which fortyseven had no ministers at all fiftyseven were in the bands of careless nonresidents and only the remaining fiftytwo were regularly served  the very bad consequences arising from this shameful remissness among the clergy induced mr gilpin to supply as far as he could what was wanting in others every year therefore he used regularly to visit the most neglected parishes in northumberland yorkshire cheshire westmorland and cumberland and that his own parish in the mean time might not suffer he was at the expense of a constant assistant in each place he stayed two or three days and his method was to call the people about him and lay before them in as plain a way as possible the danger of leading wicked or even careless lives  explaining to them the nature of true religion  instructing them in the duties they owed to god their neighbor and themselves  and showing them how greatly a moral and religious conduct would contribute to their present as well as future happiness  when a preacher though the merest rhapsodist or enthusiast seems to speak from his heart from a thorough sense of his duty what he says will be listened to the appearance of his being truly in earnest will dispose men at least to give him a fair hearing hence mr gilpin who had all the warmth of an enthusiast though under the direction of a very calm judgment never wanted an audience even in the wildest part where he roused many to a sense of religion who had contracted the most inveterate habits of inattention to every things of a serious nature  one thing he practiced which showed the bestdisposed heart where ever he came he used to visit all the jails and places of confinement few in the kingdom having at that time any appointed minister and by his labors and affectionate manner of behaving he is said to have reformed many very abandoned persons in those places he would employ his interest likewise for such criminals whose cases he thought attended with any hard circumstances and often procured pardons for them  there is a tract of country upon the border of northumberland called readsdale and tinedale of all barbarous places in the north at that time the most barbarous the following very picturesque description of this wild country we have from mr camden  at walwick north tine crosses the roman wall it rises in the mountains on the borders of england and scotland and first running eastward waters tinedale which has thence its name and afterward embracing the river read which falling from the steep hill of readsquire where the lordwardens of the eastern marches used to determine the disputes of the borderers gives its name to a valley too thinly inhabited by reason of the frequent robberies committed there both these dales breed notable bogtrotters and have such boggytopped mountains as are not to be crossed by ordinary horsemen we wonder to see so many heaps of stones in them which the neighborhood believe to be thrown together in memory of some persons there slain there are also in both of them many ruins of old forts the umfranvils held readsdale as doomsdaybook informs us in fee and knights service for guarding the dale from robberies all over these wastes you see as it were the ancient nomades a martial people who from april to august lie in little tents which they call sheals or shealings here and there dispersed among their flocks  before the union this coutry was generally called the debateable land as subject by turns to england and scotland and the common theater where the two nations were continually acting their bloody scenes it was inhabited as mr camden has just informed us by a kind of desperate banditti rendered fierce and active by constant alarms they lived by theft used to plunder on both sides of the barrier and what they plundered on one they exposed to sale on the other by that means escaping justice such adepts were they in the art of thieving that they could twist a cows horn or mark a horse so as its owners could not know it and so subtle that no vigilance could guard against them for these arts they were long afterward famous a person telling king james a surprising story of a cow that had been driven from the north of scotland into the south of england and escaping from the herd had found her way home the most surprising part of the story the king replied you lay least stress on that she passed unstolen through the debateable land  in this dreadful country where no man would even travel that could help it mr gilpin never failed to spend some part of every year he generally chose the holidays of christmas for this journey because he found the people at that season most disengaged and most easily assembled he had set places for preaching which were as regularly attended as the assizetowns of a circuit if he came where there was a church he made use of it if not of barns or any other large building where great crowds of people were sure to attend him some for his instructions and others for his charity  this was a very difficult and laborious employment the country was so poor that what provision he could get extreme hunger only could make palatable the badness of the wea there and the badness of the roads through a mountainous country and at that season covered with snow exposed him likewise often to great hardships sometimes he was overtaken by the night the country being in many places desolate for several miles together and as the bishop of chichester relates obliged to lodge out in the cold at such times he would make his servant ride about with his horses whilst himself on foot used as much exercise as his age and the fatigues of the preceding day would permit  all this he cheerfully underwent esteeming such sufferings well compensated by the advantages which he hoped might accrue from them to his uninstructed fellow creatures  our saxon ancestors had a great aversion to the tedious forms of law they chose rather to determine their disputes in a more concise manner pleading generally with their swords let every dispute be decided by the sword was a saxon law a piece of ground was described and covered with mats here the plaintiff and defendant tried their cause if either of them was driven from this boundary he was obliged to redeem his life by three marks he whose blood first stained the ground lost his suit see spelman nicholson and other enquirers into the antiquities of those times   this custom still prevailed on the borders where saxon barbarism held its latest possession these wild northumbrians indeed went beyond the serocity of their ancestors they were not content with a duel each contending party used to muster what adherents he could and commence a kind of petty war the people of this country have had one very barbarous custom among them if any two be displeased they expect no law but bang it out bravely one and his kindred against the other and his they will subject themselves to no justice but in an inhuman and barbarous manner fight and kill one another they run together in clans as they term it or names this fighting they call their deadly seides of late since the union of both kingdoms this heathenish custom is repressed and good laws made against such barbarous and unchristian misdemeanors survey of newcastle harleyan miscellany vol      so that a private grudge would often occasion much bloodshed  it happened that a quarrel of this kind was on foot when mr gilpin was at rothbury in those parts during the two or three first days of his preaching the contending parties observed some decorum and never appeared at church together at length however they met one party had been early at church and just as mr gilpin began his sermon the other entered they stood not long silent inflamed at the sight of each other they begin to clash their weapons for they were all armed with javelins and swords and mutually approach awed however by the sacredness of the place the tumult in some degree ceased mr gilpin proceeded when again the combatants begin to brandish their weapons and draw toward each other as a fray seemed near mr gilpin stepped from the pulpit went between them and addressing the leaders put an end to the quarrel for the present but could not effect an entire reconciliation they promised him however that till the sermon was over they would make no more disturbance he then went again into the pulpit and spent the rest of the time in endeavoring to make them ashamed of what they had done his behavior and discourse affected them so much that at his farther entreaty they promised to forbear all acts of hostility while he continued in the country and so much respected was he among them that whoever was in fear of his enemy used to resort where mr gilpin was esteeming his presence the best protection  one sunday morning coming to a church in those parts before the people were assembled he observed a glove hanging up and was informed by the sexton that it was meant as a challenge to any one that should take it down mr gilpin ordered the sexton to reach it him but upon his utterly refusing to touch it he took it down himself and put it in his breast when the people were assembled he went into the pulpit and before he concluded his sermon took occasion to rebuke them severely for these inhuman challenges i hear says he that one among you has hanged up a glove even in this sacred place threatening to fight any one who takes it down see i have taken it down and pulling out the glove he held it up to the congregation and then showed them how unsuitable such savage practices were to the profession of christianity using such persuasives to mutual love as he thought would most affect them  the disinterested pains he thus took among these barbarous people and the good offices he was always ready to do them drew from them the sincerest expressions of gratitude a virtue perhaps as frequently the growth of these natural soils as of the best cultivated indeed he was little less than adored and might have brought the whole country almost to what he pleased  how greatly his name was revered among them one instance will show  by the carlessness of his servant his horses were one day stolen the news was quickly propagated and every one expressed the highest indignation at the fact the thief was rejoicing over his prize when by the report of the country he found whole horses he had taken terrified at what he had done he instantly came trembling back confessed the fact returned the horses and declared he believed the devil would have seized him directly had he carried them off knowing them to have been mr gilpins  thus i have brought together what particulars still remain of this excellent mans behavior as a minister of the gospel they discover so very good a heart so strong a sense or duty and so strict a regard to it in every instance as would have been admired even in primitive times the corruptions now prevailing may perhaps make their truth questionable but they are all either taken from his life written by the bishop of chichester or from papers of undoubted authority  his own testimony to what has been said shall be subjoined in the following extract  i am at present says he apologizing to a friend much charged with business or rather overcharged i am first greatly burdened about seeing the lands made sure to the school which are not so yet and are in great danger to be lost if god should call me before they are assured moreover i have assigned to preach twelve sermons at other parishes beside my own and likewise am earnestly looked for at a number of parishes in northumberland more than i can visit beside i am continually encumbered with many guests and acquaintance whom i may not well refuse and often i am called upon by many of my parishioners to set them at one when they cannot agree and every day i am sore charged and troubled with many servants and workfolks which is no small trouble to me for the buildings and reparations in this wide house will never have an end  i will conclude this section with an instance of that resolution and spirit which on each proper occasion he failed not to exert and by which he always maintained that independency and real dignity which became his station  he received a message one day from dr barns bishop of durham appointing him to preach a visitationsermon the sunday following it happened he was then preparing for his journey into readsdale and tinedale he acquainted the bishop therefore with the necessity of keeping that appointment begging his lordship would at that time excuse him his servant informed him that the bishop had received his message but returned no answer concluding him therefore satisfied he set out on his journey but to his great surprise when he came home found himself suspended some persons through enmity to him having put the bishop upon this hasty step a few days after he received an order to meet the bishop at chester a town in the diocese of durham where the bishops of that see formerly resided here many of the clergy were assembled and mr gilpin was ordered by the bishop to preach that day before them he made his apology he had come wholly unprepared  besides he was suspended and thereby excluded from the pulpit the bishop answered he took off his suspension but mr gilpin still begged to be excused  he had brought no sermon with him and hoped none would be requireed from him but the bishop would take no excuse telling him that as he had been a preacher so long he must be able to say enough to the purpose without any previous meditation mr gilpin persisting in his refusal the bishop at length grew warm and required him upon his canonical obedience to go immediately into the pulpit after a little delay therefore he went up and though he observed several taking notes of what he said he proceeded without the least hesitation  the ecclesiastical court of durham was at this time very scandalously governed that mr barns presided over it who has already been mentioned and who made it indeed little better than an office for granting indulgencies the bishop was a wellmeaning weak man irresolute and wholly in the hands of others every thing was managed by his relation the chancellor whose venality and the irregularities occasioned by it were most notorious  the opportunity now afforded him mr gilpin thought no unfavourable one to open the bishops eyes and induce him to exert himself where there was so great reason for it private information had often been given him without any success mr gilpin was now resolved therefore to venture upon a public application to him accordingly before he concluded his sermon he turned toward the bishop to whom he thus addressed himself  my discourse now reverend father must be directed to you god has exalted you to be the bishop of this diocese and requires an account of your government thereof a reformation of all those matters which are amiss in this church is expected at your hands and now lest perhaps while it is apparent that so many enormities are committed every where your lordship should make answer that you had no notice of them given you and that these things never came to your knowledge for this it seems was the bishops common apology to all complainants behold i bring these things to your knowledge this day say not then that these crimes have been committed by the fault of others without your knowledge for whatever either yourself shall do in person or suffer through your connivance to be done by others is wholly your own therefore in the presence of god his angels and men i pronounce you to be the author of all these evils yea and in that strict day of the general account i will be a witness to testify against you that all these things have come to your knowledge by my means and all these men shall bear witness thereof who have heard me speak unto you this day  this freedom alarmed every one as mr gilpin went out of the church his friends gathered round him kindly reproaching him with tears for what he had done  the bishop had now got that advantage over him which he had long sought after  and if he had injured him before without provocation what would he do now so greatly exasperated mr gilpin walked on gently keeping them off with his hand and assuring them that if his discourse should do the service he intended by it he was regardless what the consequence might be to himself  during that day nothing else was talked of every one commended what had been said but was apprehensive for the speaker those about the bishop waited in silent expectation when his resentment would break out  after dinner mr gilpin went up to the bishop to pay his compliments to him before he went home sir said the bishop i propose to wait upon you home myself  this he accordingy did and as soon as mr gilpin had carried him into a parlour the bishop turned suddenly round and seizing him eagerly by the hand father gilpin says he to him i acknowledge you are fitter to be the bishop of durham than i am to be parson of this church of yours  i ask forgiveness for past injuries  forgive me father  i know you have enemies but while i live bishop of durham be secure none of them shall cause you any further trouble  section viii though mr gilpin was chiefly solicitous about the morals of those committed to his care he omitted not however to promote as far as he could their temporal happiness what wealth he had was entirely laid out in charities and hospitality  the value of his living was about four hundred pounds a year an income which however considerable at that time was yet in appearance very unproportionate to the generous things he did indeed he could not have done them unless his frugality had been equal to his generosity  in building a school and purchasing lands for the maintenance of a master and usher he expended above five hundred pounds as there was so great a resort of young people to this school that in a little time the town was not able to accommodate them he put himself to the inconvenience of fitting up a part of his own house for that purpose where he seldom had fewer than twenty or thirty children some of these were the sons of persons of distinction whom he boarded at easy rates but the greater part were poor children who could not so easily get themselves boarded in the town and whom he not only educated but clothed and maintained he was at the expense likewise of boarding in the town many other poor children he used to bring several every year from the different parts where he preached particularly readsdale and tinedale which places he was at great pains in civilizing and contributed not a little toward rooting out that barbarism which every year prevailed less among them  for the maintenance of poor scholars at the universities he yearly set apart sixty pounds this sum he always laid out often more his common allowance to each scholar was about ten pounds a year which for a sober youth was at that time a very sufficient maintenance so that he never maintained fewer than six by his will it appears that at his death he had nine upon his list whom he took care to provide for during their stay at the university  every thursday throughout the year a very large quantity of meat was dressed wholly for the poor and every day they had what quantity of broth they wanted twentyfour of the poorest were his constant pensioners four times in the year a dinner was provided for them when they received from his steward a certain quantity of corn and a sum of money and at christmas they had always an ox divided among them  wherever he heard of any in distress whether of his own parish or any other he was sure to relieve them in his walks abroad he would frequently bring home with him poor people and send them away clothed as well as fed  he took great pains to inform himself of the circumstances of his neighbors that the modesty of the sufferer might not prevent his relief  but the money best laid out was in his opinion that which encouraged industry it was one of his greatest pleasures to make up the losses of his laborious neighbors and prevent their sinking under them if a poor man had lost a beast he would send him another in its room or if any farmer had had a bad year he would make him an abatement in his tithes  thus as far as he was able he took the misfortunes of his parish upon himself and like a true shepherd exposed himself for his flock  but of all kinds of industrious poor he was most forward to assist those who had large families such never failed to meet with his bounty when they wanted to settle their children in the world  in the distant parishes where he preached as well as in his own neighborhood his generosity and benevolence were continually showing themselves particularly in the desolate parts of northumberland when he began his journey says an old manuscript life of him he would have ten pounds in his purse and at his coming home he would be twenty nobles in debt which he would always pay within a fortnight after  in the jails he visited he was not only careful to give the prisoners proper instructions but used to purchase for them likewise what necessaries they wanted  even upon the public road he never let slip an opportunity of doing good often has he been known to take off his cloak and give it to an halfnaked traveller and when he has had scarce money enough in his pocket to provide himself a dinner yet would he give away part of that little or the whole if he found any who seemed to stand in need of it  of this benevolent temper the following instance is preserved one day returning home he saw in a field several people crouding together and judging something more than ordinary had happened he rode up and found that one of the horses in a team had suddenly dropped down which they were endeavoring to raise but in vain for the horse was dead the owner of it seeming much dejected with his misfortune and declaring how grievous a loss it would be to him mr gilpin bad him not be disheartened ill let you have says he honest man that horse of mine and pointed to his servants  ah master replied the countryman my pocket will not reach such a beast as that  come come said mr gilpin take him take him and when i demand my money then thou shall pay me  his hospitable manner of living was the admiration of the whole country he spent in his family every fortnight forty bushels of corn twenty bushels of malt and a whole ox besides a proportional quantity of other kinds of provision  strangers and travelers found a cheerful reception all were welcome that came and even their beasts had so much care taken of them that it was humourously said if a horse was turned loose in any part of the country it would immediately make its way to the rector of houghtons  every sunday from michaelmas till easter was a sort of a public day with him during this season he expected to see all his parishioners and their families for their reception he had three tables well covered the first was for gentlemen the second for husbandmen and farmers and the third for daylabourers  this piece of hospitality he never omitted even when losses or a scarcity of provision made its continuance rather difficult to him he thought it his duty and that was a deciding motive if you should as you threaten says he in a letter to his old enemy chancellor barns give out a sequestration of my benefice you shall do me a greater favor than you are aware of for at this time i am run in no small debt i want likewise provision of victuals where i have had against michaelmas six or seven fat oxen and five or six fat cows i have now neither cow nor ox but must seek all from the shambles a sequestration given out i may with honesty break up house for a space which will save me twenty or thirty pounds in my purse but i trust you will think better of this matter  these times says he in another letter make me so tired of housekeeping that i would i were discharged from it if it could be with a clear conscience  even when he was absent no alteration was made in his familyexpences the poor was fed a usual and his neighbors entertained  he was always glad of the company of men of worth and letters who used much to frequent his house this sociable temper led him into a very large acquaintance which as he could not select his company became very inconvenient to him when he grew old i shall close this account of his manner of living with a story which does no little honor to his housekeeping  some affairs in scotland obliging queen elizabeth to send thither her treasurer the lord burleigh he resolved to take the opportunity of his return to pay a visit to mr gilpin hurried as he was he could not resist the desire of seeing a man whose name was every where so respectfully mentioned his free discourse from the pulpit to king edwards court had early recommended him to this noble person since which time the great distance between them had wholly interrupted their acquaintance the treasurers return was so sudden that he had not time to give any notice of his intended visit but the economy of so plentiful a house as mr gilpins was not easily disconcerted he received his noble guest with so much true politeness and treated him and his whole retinue in so affluent and generous a manner that the treasurer would often afterward say he could hardly have expected more at lambeth while lord burleigh stayed at houghton he took great pains by his own and the observation of his domestics to acquaint himself with the order and regularity with which every thing in that house was managed it contained a very large family and was besides continually crowded with persons of all kinds gentlemen scholars workmen farmers and poor people yet there was never any confusion every one was immediately carried into proper apartments and entertained directed or relieved as his particular business required it could not but please this wise lord who was so well acquainted with the effects of order and regularity in the highest sphere to observe them even in this humble one here too he saw true simplicity of manners and every social virtue regulated by exact prudence the statesman began to unbend and he could not without an envious eye compare the unquiet scenes of vice and vanity in which he was engaged with the calmness of this amiable retreat at length with reluctance he took his leave and with all the warmth of affection embracing his much respected friend he told him he had heard great things in his commendation but he had now seen what far exceeded all that he had heard if added he mr gilpin i can ever be of any service to you at court or elsewhere use me with all freedom as one you may depend on when he had got to raintonhill which rises about a mile from houghton and commands the vale he turned his horse to take one more view of the place and having kept his eye fixed upon it for some time his reverie broke out into this exclamation there is the enjoyment of life indeed  who can blame that man for not accepting of a bishopric  what does he want to make him greater or happier or more useful to mankind  section ix the last business of a public nature in which mr gilpin was engaged was the settlement of his school it answered his expectations so well by the good it did in the country that when he grew old it became his chief concern his infirmities obliged him now to relax a little from those very great fatigues he had undergone abroad and to draw his engagements nearer home his school situated near his house afforded him when most infirm an employment and he thought he could hardly die in peace till he had settled it to his mind what he had principally at heart was to compose for it a set of good statutes to provide it a better endowment and to fix all by a charter  as to the statutes he was daily employed in correcting adding to and altering those he had drawn up advising with his friends and doing all in his power to prevent any future abuse of his charity  with regard to a better endowment it was not indeed in his own power to do any thing more his exhibitions his other charities and his generous manner of living made yearly such large demands upon him which increased as he grew old that it became then impossible for him to lay up any thing he would gladly have contracted his hospitality which he thought his least useful expense but when he considered that he might probably by that means lose much of the esteem of the people he could not prevail with himself to do it thus unable to do any thing more out of his own purse he turned his eyes upon his friends  there was a gentleman in the neighborhood john heath esquire of kepier with whom mr gilpin had lived for many years in great intimacy he was a man of uncommon worth was master of a plentiful fortune and had an inclination to put it to the best uses he was besides a man of letters and an encourager of learning to this gentleman mr gilpin applied in favor of his school mr heath came with great readiness into the scheme proposed to him and doubled the original endowment mr gilpin prevailed upon some others likewise to contribute their assistance by which means the revenues of the school became at length answerable to his wishes  having thus obtained a sufficient endowment he began next to think of a charter for this he applied to his friend the earl of bedford  the two following letters from that earl are here inserted rather indeed to show his friendship for mr gilpin than because they are otherwise very material  to my very loving friend mr bernard gilpin after my hearty commendations i have received your letter of the   th of last month and besides the good news of your health am glad also to hear of your welldoing in those parts which want such men as you to call the rude sort to the knowledge and continuance of their duties toward god and their prince whereof there is great lack  concerning your suit moved at windsor the troubles that have since happened have been so many and so great that no convenient time has served to prosecute the same and the bill given in i doubt is lost so that for more surety it were good you sent up another copy and i will do my best endeavors to bring it to pass i will likewise do what i can to get some of those county forfeitures to be granted by her majesty for the furtherance of your good purpose  here is no news to write to you as for things in the north you have them there and albeit it has been said that a peace is concluded in france yet it is not so  and so wishing your health and well to do i do hereby thank you for your gentle letter and so commit you to god your assured friend  f bedford london may      0  after my very hearty commendations hoping in god you are in good health who as he has well begun in you so may he keep and continue you a good member in his church  i have moved the queens majesty for your school and afterward the bill was delivered to mr secretary walsingham a very good and godly gentleman who procured the same to be signed as i think you have before this heard by your brother assuredly you did very well and honestly therein and have deserved great commendations a thing most necessary in those parts is this of all other for the wellbringing up of youth and training them in learning and goodness  in any thing that i may stand you in stead i pray you be bold to use me whom you may assure yourself to remain ready to do you any good that i can  so for this time i commend you to god your assured friend  f bedford russelplace march          one of mr gilpins last good actions was his endeavor to convert a young jesuit a friend of his one mr genison of newcastle had taken into his house a brothers son who having been some time in italy and there inveigled by the jesuits had been taken into their order his time of discipline being over he was sent into england whither he brought with him the zeal of a novice his uncle a man of good plain sense soon discovered what had happened and being greatly afflicted that his nephew was not only become a papist but a jesuit said what he could to recover him from his errors but the young man had got his distinctions too perfect to be influenced by his uncles arguments the old gentleman therefore not knowing what to do with him himself at length thought of mr gilpin to him he wrote told him the whole affair and earnestly entreated him if he had any friendship sor him to try what impression he could make upon his nephew mr gilpin had little hopes of success from what he had heard of the young mans character and still less when he saw him he was naturally very full of himself and this turn his education had increased instead of examining attentively what was said and giving pertinent answers he was still running from the point advancing hi own tenets and defending them by strained interpretations of scripture and the grossest misapplication of it the truth was he wanted to signalize himself by making some eminent person his convert and his vanity led him to expect that he might bring over mr gilpin this was indeed the chief thing he proposed in coming to houghton when he found he failed in this he did what he could to corrupt the servants and such of the scholars and country people as came in his way he became at length so very disagreeable that mr gilpin was obliged to desire his uncle to send for him again his letter upon the occasion discovers so much honesty of heart and so beautiful a simplicity of manners that it deserves very well to be inserted  i trust sir you remember that when you first spoke to me about your brothers son your promise was that i should have a license from the bishop for my warrant but that is not done wherefore you must either get one yourself or suffer me for our curate and churchwardens are sworn to present if any be in the parish which utterly refuse to come to church i only desired him that he would come into the quire in the sermontime but half an hour which he utterly refused and willed me to speak no more of it he is indeed fixed in his errors and i have perceived by his talk that his coming here was not to learn but to teach for thinking to find me half a papist he trusted to win me over entirely but whereas i trust in god i have put him clearly from that hope yet i stand in great danger that he shall do much hurt in my house or in the parish for he comes furnished with all the learning of the hot college of jesuits they have found out i perceive certain expositions of the old testament never heard of before to prove the invocation of saints from abraham isaac and jacob he will not grant that any thing has been wrong in the church of rome the most abominable errors of indulgencies pardons false miracles and false relics pilgrimages and such like he can find them all in the gospel and will have them all to be good and holy  for my part i have determined myself otherwise age and want of memory compel me to take my leave of this wretched world and at this time of life not to study answers to such trumpery and new inventions seeing i was never any disputer in all my life i trust there be learned men enough in the universities who will sufficiently answer all that ever they can bring that is worth answering  wherefore good mr genison seeing your cousin is fixed in his errors as he plainly confesses help to ease me of this burden that i may with quietness apply to my vocation i am sent for to preach in diverse places but i cannot go from home so long as he is here people in these evil days are given to learn more superstition in a week than true religion in seven years  but if notwithstanding you are desirous to have him tarry two or three weeks longer i must needs have license from the bishop whether you will get the same or i must i refer to your good pleasure  and so i pray god to preserve you evermore your loving friend to his power  bernard gilpin   notwithstanding what is said in this letter it seems probable that mr gilpins arguments at length made some impression upon the young man for he entered afterward into a serious dispute in writing with him which he would scarce have engaged in unless the jesuit had shown greater willingness to discover truth than what had yet appeared  as sickness sores and other troubles says mr gilpin to him in a letterwould suffer me i have answered your objections out of st austin and the chief of them i trust are answered to the contentation of such as are willing to stay their conscience upon god and his word and not upon mans vain inventions wherein they shall find no rest of conscience nor quietness of mind  when leisure will serve to finish the residue i will send them unto you in the mean time i pray god to illuminate your eyes with his heavenly light and to guide your feet into the way of peace  toward the latter part of his life mr gilpin went through his duty with great difficulty his health was much impaired the extreme fatigue he had during so many years undergone had now quite broke his constitution thus he complains in a letter to a friend to sustain all these travels and troubles i have a very weak body subject to many diseases by the monitions whereof i am daily warned to remember death my greatest grief of all is that my memory is quite decayed my sight fails my hearing fails with other ailments more than i can well express  while he was thus struggling with an advanced age and much impaired constitution there happened a very unfortunate affair which entirely destroyed his health as he was crossing the marketplace at durham an ox ran at him and pushed him down with such violence that it was imagined the bruises he received weuld have occasioned his death he lay long confined and though he again got abroad he never recovered even the little strength he had before and continued lame as long as he lived but accidents of this kind were no very formidable trials to a mind so well tempered as his it was a persuasion he had long entertained that misfortunes are intended by providence to remind us of our neglected duty and thus he always used them making selfexamination the constant attendant upon whatever calamities besel him to this it was owing that misfortunes never dejected him but were received by him rather with thankfulness than repining  but sickness was not the only distress which the declining years of this excellent man had to struggle with as age and infirmity began to lessen that weight and influence he once had the malice and opposition of his enemies of course prevailed more  of what frivolous pretenses they availed themselves and with what temper he bore their malice the following letters will show better than any narrative  i am very sorry mr wren to hear that you should fall into such unlawful contention with any one and that to maintain an evil cause you should make an untrue report of me i am very glad however that the two other false reports if it be as you say were not raised by you one that i should make the marriage of ministers unlawful the other that i should make their children bastards whereas certainly it is known that long ago i was accused before bishop tunstal for speaking in favor of priests marriage since which time i have never altered my mind but in my sermons in this country northumberland westmorland cumberland yorkshire and lancashire i have as opportunity served spoken in defense of priests marriage and allowing their marriage i trust no man will believe that i should make their children bastards  you say i am called hypocrite i know i am so of diverse how they will answer gods law therein i leave to their own conscience but verily for my own part i can thank them for when i hear it i trust in god i gain not a little thereby in studying clearly to subdue that vice which i have strived against ever since i studied the holy scriptures and i suppose very few or no preachers in england have preached oftener against that vice than i and that as i trust with a clear conscience  but to make an end at this time because this bearer can show you what small time i have being sore overcharged with manifold studies and businesses it is time good mr wren both for you and me age and sundry diseases messengers of death giving us warning more deeply to ripe our own consciences and more diligently to search our own faults and to leave off from curious hearkening and espying of other mens especially when it breeds contention and can in no wise edify i pray you read st james the latter part of the  d chapter and there learn from whence comes contentious wisdom and this i beseech you remember that it is not long since god did most mercifully visit you with great sickness at that time i doubt not but you lamented sore your duty forgotten in your life past and for the time to come if god would restore you to your health i trust you promised a godly repentance and reformation of life good mr wren if you have somewhat forgotten that godly mind pray to god to bring it again and being had keep it pray in faith and st james says god will hear you whom i beseech evermore to have you in his blessed keeping your loving friend to his power  bernard gilpin   after my most hearty and due commendations having heard that sir william mitchell one of your brothers executors reported evil of me in sundry places bruiting abroad that i withold from him great sums of money and i know nothing wherefore but for sixteen books which i had of your brother being to return either the price or the books again i heartily beseech you seeing that you are joined executor likewise that you will let me know by this bearer william ayray if you can find any thing in any writings or accounts of your brother that can be lawfully demanded of me and god willing it shall be paid or i be much elder if as i believe i be debtor for nothing else saving the sixteen books whereof i know no price i have given this bearer my servant such instructions that he will either satisfy you or i will make return of the books  i pray almighty god to have you ever in his blessed keeping your loving friend to his power  bernard gilpin   but of all his enemies the most active were hugh broughton and chancellor barns  broughton acted the basest and most ungrateful part mr gilpin had educated and maintained him both at school and the university and had always shown him every civility in his power yet this man was afterward vile enough to endeavor to supplant the very patron who raised him he had craftily insinuated himself into the bishop of durhams favor and thought he stood fair for the first vacant preferment and as houghton was then the best thing in the bishops gift he had fixed his eye upon it mr gilpin was old and infirm and in all probability could enjoy it but a very few years yet broughton had not patience to let him spend the remainder of his age in peace he knew the bishop was easily imposed upon and found means to prejudice him against mr gilpin to this was owing as appeared afterward the affair of the suspension already mentioned and some other instances of the bishops displeasure but in the end poor broughton had the mortification to see his indirect measures unravelled the bishop saw his error was reconciled to mr gilpin and continued ever afterward his steady friend and broughton finding himself neglected left durham to seek his fortune elsewhere  chancellor barns was indeed a more generous as he was an open enemy besides what he did was in some measure in his own defense for it must be owned mr gilpin was very troublesome to him in all his designs see sect    and generally made the first attack after the affair at chester however the chancellor laid aside all decency and from that time nothing in his power that was disobliging was omitted but his malice had no other effect than to give mr gilpin an opportunity of proving how well he had learned the christian lessons of meekness though at the same time how becomingly he could exert a decent spirit when it was needful and show by tempering charity with his displeasure that he could be angry and yet not sin to this happy temper the following letters will bear sufficient testimony  right worshipful after my due commendations these are to certify you that my curate paying for me at the last visitation fortyfix shillings paid more than he ought to have done by about a noble as for the money i speak not i pray god that it may do my lord much good but i should be very sorry that through my default it should remain an everlasting burden to my successors wherefore i beseech you let it not be made a precedent and for my time if i live till the next visitation which i look not for i will not refuse to pay it no more than i do now so that care be taken my successors pay no more after me than that which is due which i take to be four pence for every pound in the queens majestys books  but you say i must needs pay it and my successors also because it is found in a certain ratebook of bishop pilkington as for that i am able to say and i trust i can bring witness that bishop pilkington at his first visitation clearly forgave me all the sum in consideration as i was told of my travel in northumberland and after that at his other two visitations i made no let but suffered his officers just to take what they would but my trust is that your worship will not burden my successors for this my simplicity or folly term it which you will  seeing then that i have so much reason they do me wrong who say i wrangled at the last visitation for god is my witness i love not differences of any kind  i pray god to have you in his blessed keeping yours to his power  bernard gilpin   i marvel mr barns that you should use me in this manner i seeking and studying to use you well in all things  about two or three years ago at my lords visitation when you took of others a groat in the pound as you can take no more you made me pay above my due for the which if i had sought remedy by the statute against extortion i trust the statute would have stood for me  after that the subsidy being gathered my servant by oversight not examining carefully the book paid a certain sum that was not due i think it was about twenty shillings but sure i could never get it restored to this day  now you seek unjustly to charge my living for my curate which seeing it has never been demanded before some will think you seek it for your own purse i pay unto the queens majesty god save her grace as duly and with as good a will as any subject twentythree pounds twelve shillings by the year but if you still continue resolved to charge me with this six pounds i promise you before i pay it i will spend five marks in defense of my right  but i trust after good advisement you will let this new suit drop i pray god almighty to keep you evermore your loving friend to his power  bernard gilpin   this load of calumny ingratitude and ill usage may justly be supposed heavy upon him already sinking under a weight of years yet he bore it with great fortitude strengthening himself with such consolations as a good christian has in reserve for all extremities  his resignation however was not long exercised about the beginning of february in the year      he found himself so very weak that he was sensible his end must be drawing near he told his friends his apprehensions and spoke of his death with that happy composure which always attends the conclusion of a good life he was soon after confined to his chamber his senses continued perfect to the last of the manner of his taking leave of the world we have this account  a few days before his death he ordered himself to be raised in his bed and his friends acquaintance and dependents to be called in he first sent for the poor and beckoning them to his bedside he told them he found he was going out of the world  he hoped they would be his witnesses at the great day that he had endeavored to do his duty among them  and he prayed god to remember them after he was gone  he would not have them weep for him if ever he had told them any thing good he would have them remember that in his stead  above all things he exhorted them to fear god and keep his commandments telling them if they would do this they could never be left comfortless  he next ordered his scholars to be called in to these likewise he made a short speech reminding them that this was their time if they had any desire to qualify themselves for being of use in the world  that learning was well worth their attention but virtue was much more so  he next exhorted his servants and then sent for several persons who had not heretofore profited by his advice according to his wishes and upon whom he imagined his dying words might have a better effect his speech began to falter before he finished his exhortations the remaining hours of his life he spent in prayer and broken conversations with some select friends mentioning often the consolations of christianity  declaring they were the only true ones  that nothing else could bring a man peace at the last he died upon the fourth of march      in the   th year of his age  i shall conclude this account of him with a few observations upon his character and some incidents which i could not introduce properly in any part of the narration  his person was tall and slender in the ornament of which he was at no pains he had a particular aversion to the fopperies of dress in his diet he was very temperate rather abstemious  his parts were very good his imagination memory and judgment were lively retentive and solid  his acquirements were as considerable by an unwearied application he had amassed a great store of knowledge and was ignorant of no part of learning at that time in esteem in languages history and divinity he particularly excelled he read poetry with a good taste himself as the bishop of chichester relates no mean poet but he laid out little time in the pursuit of any study foreign to his profession  his temper was naturally warm and in his youth i meet with instances of his giving way to passion but he soon got more command of himself and at length entirely corrected that infirmity  his disposition was serious yet among his particular friends he was commonly cheerful sometimes facetious his general behavior was very affable his severity had no object but himself to others he was humble candid and indulgent never did virtue sit with greater ease on any one had less of moroseness or could mix more agreeably with whatever was innocent in common life  he had a most extraordinary skill in the art of managing a fortune he considered himself barely as a steward for other people and took care therefore that his own desires never exceeded what calm reason could justify extravagance with him was another word for injustice amidst all his business he found leisure to look into his affairs well knowing that frugality is the support of charity  his intimacies were but few it was his endeavor as he thought the spirit of christianity required to dilate rather than to contract his affections yet where he professed a particular friendship he was a religious observer of its offices of this the following relation is an instance through his application the dean and chapter of durham had bestowed a living upon one of his friends soon after mr gilpin was nominated a referee in a dispute between them and the archbishop of york but for some particular reasons he excused himself the chapter of durham was in great disorder and in many instances much complained of sandys archbishop of york undertook to visit them but whitingham the dean withstood him having prevailed upon the lord president of the north to second him the archbishop complained to the council upon which a commission was issued out by the lord keeper impowering certain persons to examine the case among whom mr gilpin was named his reason for not acting was most probably because he thought the dean and chapter in the wrong    this irritated the dean and chapter so much that out of mere pique at him they took away two thirds from the allowance they had assigned to his friend he did what he could to pacify them but his utmost endeavors proving fruitless he insisted upon his friends accepting from him a yearly satisfacion for his loss to dr wilson right worshipful whereas i hear your worship named of many to the deanery of durham these are most humbly to beseech you if it shall please god so to bless that house that you will help as i trust god you may to redress among sundry enormities one which has happened a year ago or more  the dean and chapter of durham are parsons of a parish in northumberland called ellingham the living was better than thirty pounds a year our schoolmaster of houghton a scholar of oxford made labor for it at his suit and mine together it was granted as we judged with all such commodities as the last incumbent and others before had had but soon after the dean and chapter took away from the vicar as good as twenty pounds a year so that the poor man having wife and children might have begged if i and other friends had not helped him god knows it has been a costly matter to me but my trust now is that your worship knowing the matter will be willing to help it and may help it for the present possessor mr selby has nothing to show but a promise from mr whitingham whereunto the chapter would never consent mr ralph lever can inform you of all the matter if your worship can help it surely you cannot do a better deed would to god all violent workers of injuries were resisted  if god should send you into this country i trust to be better known to your worship i pray god preserve you evermore by yours to his power  bernard gilpin houghton july           at another time a friend desired he would request the bishop of durham to lend him a sum of money he made the application but not succeeding he wrote thus to his friend my lord has lent to so very many which i believe is true that you must pardon him for not sending you the money i pray you trouble him no more and i trust by little and little i can make up the sum myself  he was the most candid interpreter of the words and actions of others where he plainly saw failings he would make every possible allowance for them he used to express a particular indignation at slander often saying it more deserved the gallows than theft for himself he was remarkably guarded when he spoke of others he considered common fame as the falsest medium and a mans reputation as his most valuable property  his sincerity was such as became his other virtues he had the strictest regard to truth of which his whole life was only one instance all little arts and sinister practices those ingredients of worldly prudence he disdained his perseverance in so commendable a part in whatever difficulties it might at first involve him in the end raised his character above malice and envy and gave him that weight and influence in every thing he undertook which nothing but an approved sincerity can give  whatever his other virtues were their luster was greatly increased by his humility to conquer religious pride is one of the best effects of religion an effect which his religion in the most amiable manner produced  thus far however he has had many imitators the principal recommendations of him and the distinguishing parts of his character were his conscientious discharge of the duties of a clergyman his extensive benevolence and his exalted piety  as to the discharge of his function no man could be more strongly influenced by what he thought the duties of it the motives of convenience or present interest had no kind of weight with him as the income was no part of his concern he only considered the office which he thought such a charge as a man would rather dread than solicit but when providence called him to it for what was not procured by any endeavors of his own he could not but ascribe to providence he accepted it though with reluctance he then showed that if a sense of the importance of his office made him distrust his abilities it made him most diligent in exerting them as soon as ever he undertook the care of a parish it immediately engrossed his whole attention the pleasures of life he totally relinquished even his favorite pursuits of learning this was the more commendable in him as he had always a strong inclination for retirement and was often violently tempted to shut himself up in some university at home or abroad and live there sequestered from the world but his conscience corrected his inclination as he thought the life of a mere recluse by no means agreeable to the active principles of christianity nay the very repose to which his age laid claim he would not indulge but as long as he had strength sufficient persevered in the laborious practice of such methods of instruction as he imagined might most benefit those under his care  of popular applause he was quite regardless so far as mere reputation was concerned but as the favor of the multitude was one step toward gaining their attention in that light he valued it he reproved vice wherever he observed it with the utmost freedom as he was contented in his station and superior to all dependence he avoided the danger of being tempted to any unbecoming compliance and whether he reproved in public or private his unblameable life and the seriousness with which he spoke gave an irresistible weight to what he said he studied the low capacities of the people among whom he lived and knew how to adapt his arguments to their apprehensions hence the effects that his preaching had upon them are said to have been often very surprising in particular it is related that as he was once recommending honesty in a part of the country notoriously addicted to thieving a man struck with the warmth and earnestness with which he spoke stood up in the midst of a large congregation and freely confessed his dishonesty and how heartily he repented of it  with regard to his benevolence never certainly had any man more disinterested views or made the common good more the study of his life which was indeed the best comment upon the great christian principle of universal charity he called nothing his own there was nothing he could not readily part with for the service of others in his charitable distributions he had no measure but the bounds of his income of which the least portion was always laid out on himself nor did he give as if he was granting a favor but as if he was paying a debt all obsequious service the generosity of his heart disdained he was the more particularly careful to give away in his lifetime whatever he could save for the poor as he had often seen and regretted the abuse of posthumous charities it is my design at my departure says he writing to a friend to leave no more behind me but to bury me and pay my debts what little he did leave the following are a few extracts from his will which perhaps may not be unacceptable to the reader  first i bequeath and commend my soul unto the hands of almighty god my creator not trusting in mine own merits which am of myself a most wretched sinner but only in the mercy of god and in the merits of jesus christ my redeemer and my savior  my body i commit to be buried in the parish church or churchyard wheresoever it shall please god to call me to his mercy  for the disposition of my goods first i will that all my debts be truly paid with all speed which i shall gather and set after this my last will  my debts once discharged of what remains i give and bequeath    here follow legacies to the poor of nine parishes  likewise i give to the poor of houghton parish the great new ark for corn to provide them groats in winter and if none will make that provision let it be sold and the price dealt among them  likewise i give to the queens college in oxford all such books as shall have written upon the first leaf bernardus gilpin reginensi collegio d d and all such books as shall have written upon the first leaf johannes newton reginensi collegio d d and likewise all the books that mr hugh broughton has of mine viz eusebius greek in two volumes and josephus greek in one volume and certain other books i trust he will withhold none of them  also i give to keipier school in houghton all such books as shall have the name of it in the first leaf  also i give to my successor and to his successors after him first the great new brewing lead in the brewhouse with the gilefat and masefat likewise in the kiln a large new steep lead which receives a chauldren of corn at once likewise in the larderhouse one great saltingtub which will hold four oxen or more likewise in the great chamber over the parlour one long table and a shorter standing upon joined frames likewise in the parlour one long table upon a joined frame with the form likewise in the hall three tables at which he used to entertain his parish standing fast with their forms to them likewise    here follow a great many other pieces of furniture materials for building unwrought timber lime slate etc in consideration of all these and of my exceeding great charges in building and reparations since my first coming to this parsonage which i think with a safe conscience i may well say amounts to  00 pounds if i say no more i trust my successor will not demand any thing for delapidations and if he should i doubt nothing but that the bishop of durham will persuade him to be content with reason and to do all things with charity and if charity may bear rule i doubt not but all delapidations will fall  and here i most earnestly desire my successor not only to let all delapidations fall upon these considerations and also in favor of the poor upon whom chiefly my goods are bestowed in this testament but also that he will be a continual defender and maintainer of keipierschool in houghton both in seeing the statutes well kept and the children brought up in virtue and learning which if he do i doubt not but god shall prosper him the better in all things he takes in hand  moreover i give to the poor of houghton twenty pounds and nine of my oxen the other nine i bequeath to my three executors  likewise i give to the right reverend richard lord bishop of durham for a simple token of remembrance three silver spoons with acorns the history of paulus jovius and the works of calvin  also i give unto john heath esquire for a like remembrance other two silver spoons with acorns of the same weight and also the history of john sleden in latin  to mrs heath i give my english chronicle of fabian also i give to richard bellasis esquire for a like remembrance other two silver spoons with acorns of the same fashion and also my history called novus orbis  and i most humbly beseech these three men of honor and worship that for gods cause they will take so much pain as to become supervisors of this my last will and testament which being a work of christian charity i trust verily they will not refuse and above all other things i most humbly beseech them to take into their tuition and governance all the lands and revenues belonging to keipier school and all deeds evidences gift and other writings which are to show for the same all the right and title to these lands i give up wholly into their power for the good maintenance of the said school  and for as much as these lands are not so surely cstablished as i could wish i give unto keipier school twenty pounds which i desire the bishop of durham to take into his hands and to bestow as he shall see fit upon men learned in the laws  all the rest of my goods and chattels i will that they be divided into two equal parts and the one of them to be given to the poor of houghton the other to scholars and students in oxford whose names are ric wharton ste coperthwait geo carleton ralph ironside ewan ayray will cayrns hen ayray fr reisely and tho collison these i will be relieved as mine executors shall see needful a year two or three as the sum will arise  and for my three executors for as much as i have been beneficial to them in my lifetime so far as a good conscience would permit me and sometime further but god i trust has forgiven me i will and i doubt not but they will agree to the same that they be content with the nine oxen and if any gains do arise from the sale of my goods as i think i have prized them under the worth i will they shall have that amongst them only i earnestly request and desire them to be good to my poor neighbors of the parish being desirous to buy such things as they stand most in need of   he left wholly to the poor deducting a few slight tokens of remembrance that he bequeathed to his friends how vain it was for those who were not in real want to expect any thing from him he plainly showed by his own behavior for when a legacy was left him he returned it back again to such of the relations of the legatee as stood in more need of it  such instances of benevolence gained him the title of the father of the poor and made his memory revered long afterward in the country where he lived a monument in the chancel of houghton church is a remarkable instance of this  it is erected to the memory of mr davenport a worthy rector of that parish whom his encomiast thus celebrates  if the souls transmigration were believed you would say good gilpins soul be had received and with as liberal hand did give or more his daily charity unto the poor for which with him we doubt not he is possessed of righteous mens reward eternal rest as to the word more in the third line we will rather suppose the poet made use of it for want of another rhyme than through any disrespect to the memory of mr gilpin  whatever becomes of the notion of the metempsychosis one would imagine however that mr gilpins example at least had its influence upon the rectors of houghton for perhaps few parishes in england can boast such a succession of worthy pastors as that parish can since mr gilpins death     but no part of his character was more conspicuous than his piety it has been largely shown with what temper sincerity and earnestness he examined the controverted points of religion and settled his own persuasion he thought religion his principal concern and of course made the attainment of just notions in it his principal study to what was matter of mere speculation he paid no regard such opinions as influenced practice he thought only concerned him he knew no other end of religion but an holy life and therefore in all his enquiries about it he considered himself as looking after truths which were to influence his future conduct and make him a better man accordingly when his religious persuasion was once settled he made the doctrines he embraced the invariable rule of his life all his moral virtues became christian ones were formed upon such motives and respected such ends as christianity recommended it was his daily care to conform himself to the will of god upon whose providence he absolutely depended in all conditions of life resigned easy and cheerful under whatsoever commonly reputed misfortunes he might meet with he had some peculiar though it may be just notions with regard to a particular providence he thought all misfortunes which our own indiscretions did not immediately draw upon us were sent directly from god to bring us to a sense of our misbehaviour and quicken us in a virtuous course accordingly at such times he used with more than ordinary attention to examine his past conduct and endeavor to find out in what point of duty he had been defective  to the opinions of others however different from his own he was most indulgent he thought moderation one of the most genuine effects of true piety it has already appeared from his intercourse with the dissenters how great an enemy he was to all intolerant principles how wrong he thought it on one hand to oppose an established church and on the other to molest a quiet separatist  his life was wholly guided by a conscience the most religiously scrupulous i cannot forbear inserting an instance of its extreme sensibility though it may be thought perhaps rather superstitious he had behaved in some particular with regard to his parish in a manner which gave him great concern his conscience was so much alarmed at what he had done that nothing he was able to allege to himself in his excuse was able to make him easy at length he determined to lay open the whole case before the bishop of durham his diocesan and to surrender up his living or submit to any censure which the bishop might think his fault deserved without thus bringing himself to justice he said he never could have recovered his peace of mind his letter upon this occasion to the bishop is not extant nor does it appear what the fault was the following letter relates to it  grace and peace in christ jesus if any man be vexed in body or mind you know it is a very grievous thing to have no comforter which has constrained me to disclose unto you not doubting but to have both your comfort and help and to have it kept most secret that thing which besides to you i never opened to any living creature in this enclosed letter i have opened my grief and weakness of conscience unto my lord beseeching you if opportunity will serve to deliver it howbeit if either he should be pained with sickness or you would first by writing that i should have your advice or you see any other cause why to stay the delivery i refer all to your wisdom but if you have opportunity to my lord i hope by you to know speedily some part of his pleasure i trust my case weighed he will rather think me to be pitied than had in hatred how tender a thing conscience is i have found by too good experience i have found moreover that as it is easily wounded so it is with difficulty healed and for my own part i speak from my heart i would rather be often wounded in my body than once in my mind which things considered i trust you will bear with my weakness but you may object i have continued weak very long which fault certainly i find with myself but for this i accuse my own slowness both in study and prayer which by gods grace as far as my weak body will serve hereafter shall be amended for certainly those two are the chief instruments whereby i have sure trust that god of his goodness will make me strong   such was the life and character of this excellent man a conduct so agreeable to the strictest rules of morality and religion gained him among his contemporaries the title of the northern apostle and indeed the parallel was striking his quitting the corrupt doctrines in the utmost reverence of which he had been educated the persecutions he met with for the sake of his integrity the danger he often ran of martyrdom his contempt of the world his unwearied application to the business of his calling and the boldness and freedom with which he reproved the guilty whatever their fortunes or stations were might justly characterize him a truly apostolical person  viewed with such a life how mean and contemptible do the idle amusements of the great appear how trifling that uninterrupted succession of serious folly which engages so great a part of mankind crouding into so small a compass each real concern of life how much more nobly does that person act who unmoved by all that the world calls great and happy can separate appearances from realities attending only to what is just and right who not content with the closetattainment of speculative virtue maintains each worthy resolution that he forms persevering steadily like this excellent man in the conscientious discharge of the duties of that station whatever that station is in which providence has placed him  a sermon preached in the court at greenwich before king edward vi  the first sunday after the epiphany mdlii  by bernard gilpin b d  reprinted in the year       the following sermon is the only revised composition of mr gilpins that survived him he spent his time more usefully than in literary avocations yet to what good purpose he might have employed it in his closet this piece may convince us it was thought in king edwards time a very pathetic strain of eloquence well adapted to the irregularities then prevailing in the licentious court of that prince it has since been taken notice of by most of the writers who treat of the ecclesiastical affairs of those times and is mentioned by them as a remarkable instance of that commendable zeal and noble freedom which the illustrious reformers of our church then exerted in the cause of virtue and religion  but i will leave it to be its own recommendation  st luke ii ver      0 now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and when he was twelve years old and they were come up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast and had finished the days thereof as they returned the child jesus remained in jerusalem and joseph knew not of it nor his mother but they supposing that he had been in the company went a days journey and sought him amongst their kinsfolk and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back to jerusalem and sought him and it came to pass three days after that they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers so when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why have thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee with heavy hearts then said he unto them how is it that ye sought me know ye not that i must go about my fathers business but they understood not the word that he spoke unto them forasmuch as the whole gospel is more full of matter and plenteous in mysteries than that it can well be discussed within the limits of one sermon i have taken for this time to treat upon this one sentence spoken by christ unto his parents know ye not that i must go about my fathers business being content to omit the rest taking only so much as shall suffice to declare the occasion whereupon he spoke these words for the fuller understanding of the same  ye shall therefore understand that when our savior was come to the age of twelve years giving attendance upon his parents to jerusalem at the solemn feast of easter whither they yearly did repair at that time of sincere devotion and for the obedience of the law after that joseph and mary had devoutly passed the days of the feast and were returned home it came to pass not through blind fortune but by gods providence that his glory might appear that the blessed son jesus tarried behind at jerusalem and while his parents either not taking good heed of him or else going apart in sundry companies either of them trusting he had been with the other they went one days journey before they miffed him but after he was found wanting they sought him diligently among their kinsfolk and acquaintance but found him not which was undoubtedly unto them a very cross of bitter affliction so does god many times exercise his elect and chosen with adversity for their trial and to keep them in humility when they were returned to jerusalem and had long sought him with sorrowful hearts after three days they found him in the temple  here then by the way methinks the holy ghost teaches us this spiritual doctrine so long as we seek christ in our own kinsfolk that is our own inventions and devices we find him not but to find christ we must accompany these godly persons joseph and mary unto the temple of his holy word there christ is found unto so many as seek him with such humble spirits and meek hearts as joseph and mary did they found him in the temple not idly occupied as many are not mumbling things he understood not sine mente sonum a confused sound without knowledge but they found him occupied in his heavenly fathers business as all men should be in the temple either in speaking to god by humble and hearty prayer or hearing god speaking to them in his most blessed word so was christ occupied amongst learned men and opposing them where he teaches us to be always as glad to learn as to teach it is a probable conjecture that he opened to them the scriptures which spoke of messiah a matter then in controversy but whatsoever their matter was the evangelist says he made them all astonished at his understanding and answers so the glory of his godhead even then began to shine where we may mark the wonderful power of the gospel even the hardhearted that will not receive it the bright beams of the truth shining therein makes astonished it causes also the godly to marvel as mary and joseph but their admiration always ended with joy  yet notwithstanding his heavenly majesty made all men to wonder his mother thought she had some cause to expostulate with him for the great fear he had brought upon them casting them into a dungeon of sorrows and complaining said son why have thou etc she seemed to charge him with the breach of the first precept of the second table that he had not well entreated his parents but christ so shaped this answer that he takes away all her complaint teaching us how the precepts of the second table may not be understood in any wise to be a hindrance to the first wist ye not that i must go about my fathers business where our duty and service to god comes in place all human service and obedience which might be a hindrance thereto to whomsoever it be father or mother king or caesar must stand back and give place besides this he teaches us here a most necessary lesson for all men to know and bear away which is that his whole life and death was nothing else but a perfect obedience to the will of his heavenly father and that he was always most busily occupied therein and teaches us that if we look by adoption to be brethren and coheirs with christ of his fathers kingdom we must also with our master and lord yield up ourselves wholly to our heavenly fathers will and always be occupied in his business i have given you an example that ye should do even as i have done to you which lesson being so necessary of all christians to be kept and the breach thereof the cause of all iniquity i thought it good to pass over other places of ghostly instruction which this gospel might minister and to tarry upon this one sentence know ye not that i must go about my fathers business intending to show in order how all estates of men the clergy the nobility and the commonalty are under the band of this obligation oportet we must and ought of necessity to be occupied in our heavenly fathers business  but first of all mistrusting wholly mine own strength i crave aid of you by your devout prayers  know ye not that i must go about my fathers business after that our first parents through disobedience and sin had blotted and disfigured the lively image of god whereunto they were created and might have lived always in a conformity to the will of god man was never able to apply himself to god his fathers business nor yet so much as to know what appertained thereto the natural man says st paul perceives not the things of the spirit of god till christ the very true image of god the father did come down and took mans nature upon him which descent as he declares was to fulfill for us the will of his father that like as by disobedience of one man many were made sinners so by the obedience of one christ many might be made righteous what time as he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross which obedience lest carnal men should challenge to suffice for them howsoever their life be a continual rebellion against god and his holy will such as there be a great number and have been in all ages st paul wipeth them clean away saying christ has become salvation not to all but to all that obey him let no man therefore flatter and deceive himself if we will challenge the name of christs disciples if we will worthily possess the glorious name of christians we must learn this lesson of our master to be occupied in our heavenly fathers business which is to fly our own will which is a wicked and wanton will and wholly to conform ourselves to his will saying as we are taught thy will be done which as st augustine says the fleshly man the covetous adulterous ravenous or deceitful man can never say but with his lips because in his heart he prefers his own cursed will setting aside the will of god  now for so much as the greatest part of the world has at this day forsaken their fathers business applying their own and are altogether drowned in sin for the whole head is sick and the whole heart is heavy from the sole of the foot to the head there is nothing whole therein and as st paul says all seek their own and not that which is jesus christs and as i am here ascended into the high hill of sion the highest hill in all this realm i must needs as it is given me in commission cry aloud and spare not lift up my voice like a trumpet and show the people their transgressions i must cry unto all estates as well of the ecclesiastical ministry as of the civil governance with the vulgar people  but forasmuch as example of holy scriptures with experience of christs church in all ages has taught us that the fall of priests is the fall of the people and contrariwise the integrity of them is the preservation of the whole flock and the ministers as christ says being the light of his mystical body if the light be turned into darkness there must needs follow great darkness in the whole body i think it fit to begin with them who seem to have brought blindness into the whole body making men to forget their heavenly fathers business they which should have kept the candle still burning these will i chiefly examine in that businese which christ so earnestly committed to all pastors before his ascension when he demanded thrice of peter if he loved him and every time upon peters confession enjoined him straightly to feed his lambs and sheep wherein we have the true trial of all ministers who love christ and apply his business  but to consider how it has been forgotten in the church many years it might make a christians heart to bleed he that wrote the general chronicle of ages when he comes to the time of john viii and martin ii bishops of rome about six hundred years ago conferring the golden ages going before with the iniquity of that time when through ambition avarice and contention the office of setting forth gods word was brought to an utter contempt and trodden under foot in token whereof the bible was made the bishops footstool he falls to a sudden exclamation and complains thus with the lamentable voice of the prophet jeremy o lord god how is the gold become so dim how is the goodly color of it so changed o most ungracious time says he wherein the holy man fails or is not all truths are diminished from the sons of men there are no godly men left the faithful are worn out among the children of men in that time as it appeared both by this history and others ambition and greedy avarice had taught ministers to seek and contend for livings who might climb the highest by utter contempt of their office and our heavenly fathers business and so to make christs flock a ready prey for the devil who goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour  then the bishop of rome abusing always peters keys to sill judass fatchels dispensed with all prelates that brought any money in obeying christs commission given to peter feed feed my lambs and my sheep and stretched it so largely that instead of feeding christs lambs and sheep he allowed them to feed hawks hounds and horses i will not say harlots then instead of fishers of men he made them to become fishers of benefices and fat livings he brought preaching into such a contempt that it was accounted a great absurdity for a cardinal to preach after he had once bestrid his mule  but let us see after how this evil increased st bernard in his time about two hundred years after lamented that when open persecution of tyrants and heretics was ceased in the church then another persecution far worse and more noisome to christs gospel did succeed when the ministers christs own friends by pretense were turned into persecutors my lovers and my kinsmen stand aside from my plague and my kinsmen stand afar off the iniquity of the church says bernard began at the elders alas alas o lord god they are the foremost in persecuting of thee which are thought to love the chiefest place or preeminence in the church this complaint with much more too long to be rehearsed against the prelates of rome made st bernard in his time nothing afraid in the same place to call them antichrists and for murdering of silly souls redeemed with christs precious blood he makes them more cruel persecutors of christ than the jews which shed his blood  if the iniquity of rome four hundred years ago was so great and since has not a little increased it was high time that god should open the eyes of some christian princes to see the great abuses and enormities of romish bishops and to deliver christs gospel out of captivity and to bring down his horns whose pride if he might have had success in his tyranny began to ascend with lucifer above the stars  it is not many years ago that a champion of theirs named pelagius writing against marsilius paduanus in defense of rome has not been ashamed to leave in writing that the pope quodammodo after a sort does participate both natures the godhead and manhood with christ and that he may not be judged of the emperor because he is not a mere man but as a god upon earth and god says he may not be judged of man what intolerable blasphemy is this if i had not read it myself i could scarcely believe any such blasphemy to proceed from him which professes christ do you not perceive plainly the hissing and poison of the old serpent when he tempted our first parents and promised they should become like gods a vile wretched creature worms meat forgetting his estate must become a god upon earth  such gods shall follow jupiter mars and venus into the pit of damnation  but some will say what should we speak so much of the bishop of rome is he not gone his power taken away if preachers would let him alone the people would soon forget him truly for my part if i had that gift strength and calling i had rather though i were sure to smart therefore speak against his enormities in rome than to speak of them here and i think no man bears at least i am sure no man ought to bear any malice or evil against his person in speaking against his vice and iniquity we fight not says st paul against flesh and blood but we fight against the prince of darkness etc when any wicked man adversary to god and his word assaileth us we must take him for no other but as an instrument of the devil and satan himself to be our enemy and none other and even as when an enemy assaileth us on horseback we wish to overthrow the enemy and win the horse which may be profitable to us so if the devil could be cast out of such instruments as he has in rome the men would become profitable members of christ but if the devil sit so fast in the saddle that he cannot be turned out we cannot amend it yet our duty is to pray unto god for them and to hate none of gods creatures but rather that which satan has depraved if peradventure god will turn their hearts  but notwithstanding their faults ought to be chiefly told them in their presence yet not there only but even here amongst us also although it come not to their ears it is not a little expedient oftentimes to cry and thunder against their errors and vices chiefly that so often as we hear it we may give god thanks as we are most bounden for our deliverance from that captivity of babylon as st peter himself by the mind of ancient writers called it examples hereof we have in the scriptures the song of the israelites after their deliverance out of egypt and afterward when they were delivered by debora from the tyranny of sisera and after the deliverance from holofernes by judith we must be thankful lest for our unthankfulness god suffer us to fall into a worse bondage than ever we were in  but most of all it is profitable that we may from our hearts renounce with babylon all the vices of babylon for what did profit the deliverance out of egypt to those that did still carry egypt in their minds through the desert what did it avail the deliverance out of babylon to those that did bring babylon home to jerusalem i fear me yet in england a great many like fleshly israelites are weary of the sweet manna of the gospel and savor of the fleshly egypt desiring to live still under the bondage of pharaoh  but most of all it is expedient now for my purpose to speak of that sea from whence so far as ever i could learn those intolerable abuses have overflown and are come among us which as yet are great enemies to christs gospel here in england making his ministers to set aside his business such abuses as cannot yet be driven away nor sent home to rome to their father i mean dispensations for pluralities and totquots with dispensations for nonresidents which avarice and idleness transported hither from rome but for that they savor sweet for a time to carnal men they have so many patrons that they cannot be driven away with other abuses  and because they are accounted to stand by law they are used as cloaks for iniquity these may well be likened unto those fatlings which saul against gods commandment did keep alive when he vanquished the amalekites and truly till there be ordained some godly laws to banish these with other abuses gods wrath is kindled against us to destroy all such as are maintainers of them so long as it shall be lawful for men to have so many livings as they can get and discharge never a one and so long as men may have livings to lie where they will in idleness far from their cure fatting themselves like the devils porklings and letting a thousand souls perish for lack of spiritual food gods business shall never be well applied nor his gospel have success in england  it is pity that ever it should be needful to wish any laws to be made by man to bring ministers of gods word to do their duty being so plainly expressed in gods law if our hearts were not hardened more than pharaohs our judgment more blinded with insensibleness of heavenly things than the sodomites we should tremble and quake more at one threatening of gods vengeance against negligent pastors that feed themselves and set aside their heavenly fathers business whereof the scripture is full in every place than we should fear all the powers upon earth which as christ says having power only of the body cannot hurt the soul  o lord how dare men be so bold as to take on them the name of christs ministers and utterly refuse the work of their ministry by leaving their flock gods word being so plain against them  i marvel not so much at blind bayards which never take gods book in hand ignorance has blinded them they know not the price of mans soul but truly i could never enough marvel at learned men which read the scriptures where their hearts and understanding should be when they read almost in every leaf of scripture besides all ancient writers their own sharp sentence and judgment which a whole day were too little to bring them in  o merciful god where be their eyes to see their ears to hear do they think there is a god which is not master of his word i will let pass how they are called of the holy ghost by most odious names thieves robbers hypocrites idols wolves dumb dogs with many such like worthy their deserts i will only declare which methinks might suffice if there were no more how the scripture makes them most cruel murderers and guilty of blood in the thirtyfourth of ecclesiasticus it is written the bread of the needful is the life of the poor he that defraudeth them thereof is a man of blood if this sentence be true in them that defraud the needy of their corporal food how much more are they which withhold the food of the soul being the worthier part of man guilty of blood and therefore god by his prophet ezekiel tells them so many as perish by their negligence their blood shall be required at their hands as men guilty of blood now let them consider that if the blood of abel one man cried up unto heaven for vengeance against cain what an horrible cry shall the blood of a thousand souls make before the throne of god asking vengeance against that wicked pastor which most cruelly has hungered them to death in withholding from them the food of life the gold they lay up yearly brought far off by farmers their rings and jewels their fine apparel their beds they lie on their meat and drink being the spoil of the poor cry all for vengeance the stones in the wall the timber over their heads cry for vengeance  alas how far are they from excusing themselves with st paul saying to the people of ephesus i take you to record this day i am pure from the blood of all men for i have spared no labor but have showed all the counsel of god unto you but alas these men may rather say that they have kept counsel of gods counsel and where st paul preached publicly and by houses these men keep silence left they should disquiet the devil in his fort of whom christ says when a strong man armed watches his house the things that he possesses are in peace they say with the evil servant my master is long a coming and so beats his fellow servants like cruel murderers and tyrants whose judgment shall be straiter than any pharaoh nero or domitian that ever reigned but alas it helps nothing to call or cry upon them they have hardened their hearts as an adamant stone lazarus has lain so long buried and stinking in worldly lusts and sensualities the preacher cannot call him out nor yet remove the gravestone  what shall i then do  i must call unto you most noble prince and christs anointed  i am the king being absent these words were added extempore come this day to preach to the king and to those which be in authority under him i am very sorry they should be absent which ought to give example and encourage others to the hearing of gods word and i am the more sorry for that other preachers before me complain much of their absence but you will say they have weighty affairs in hand alas has god any greater business than this if i could cry with the voice of stentor i would make them hear in their chambers but in their absence i will speak to their seats as if they were present  i will call unto you noble prince as christs anointed christs little flock here in england which he has committed to your charge which wander by many thousands as sheep having no pastors they cry all unto you for succor to send them home their shepherds to the end that for things corporal they may receive spiritual and to let one pastor have one only competent living which he may discharge they call upon you to expel and drive away the great drones which in idleness devour other mens labor that after st pauls rule he that will not labor be not suffered to eat the little ones have asked bread etc christs little ones have hungered and called for the food of the gospel a long time and none there was to give it them now they cry unto you take heed you turn not your ears from them lest their blood be required at your hands also and lest god turn his ears from you samuel spoke unto saul fearful words because thou have cast away the word of the lord the lord has therefore cast away thee from being king you are made of god a pastor a pastor of pastors when david was anointed king of israel god said thou shall feed my people israel you must feed and that is to see that all pastors do their duty the eye of the master has great strength your graces eye to look through your realm and see that watchmen sleep not shall be worth a great number of preachers they call unto you to awake not only negligent pastors but also to take away other enormities which have followed in heaps upon those evils pluralities and nonresidents  if i might have time i think i should be able to prove that the great swarm of evils which reign at this day have flowed from those fountains or rather puddles but i will only speak of the great abuses which by spoil or robbery do hide the gospel how they have ensued  first of all the dispensations of nonresidents have brought forth farming of benefices to gentlemen laymen wherein they have found such sweetness and worldly wealth that preachers cannot have them they will be perpetual farmers which has opened a gap for the heathen as david says or else for cloaked christians much worse than the heathen who have entered into christs inheritance spoiled his holy temple and robbed his gospel such seem to make composition with our great enemy satan the idle pastor saying give to me riches take the rest to thy share whom satan answers if thou will betray to me the souls take riches for thy part  another gap has been opened for that the learned have not done their duties no more than the unlearned hereby christs vineyard has been urterly spoiled patrons see that none do their duty they think as good to put in asses as men the bishops were never so liberal in making of lewd priests but they are as liberal in making lewd vicars i dare say if such a monster as dervell gatherel the idol of wales burnt in smithfield should have set his hand to a bill to let the patron take the greatest part of the profits he might have had a benefice there is never any question how he can occupy himself in gods business john gerson a learned man in his time witnesses that whosoever in that time was admitted to a benefice in france must answer to this question scis utrumque testamentum know thou the old testament and the new and the ignorant was put back but with these men it skilleth not if he never opened the bible so much the meeter for their purpose as he is not able to speak against their absuses but will suffer them to sleep in their sin  and will you see what preposterous judgment they use for all worldly offices they search meet and convenient men only christian souls so dearly bought are committed without respect to men not worthy to keep sheep  your grace has sent forth surveyors as most needful it was to see there should be no deceit in payment of pensions and other offices abroad would to god you would also send forth surveyors to see how benefices are bestowed and used how christ and his gospel are robbed and dishonored to the great decay of your realm and commonwealth you should find a small number of patrons that bestow rightly their livings seeking gods glory and that his work and business may be rightly applied without simony or seeking their own profit  for first it is almost general to reserve the farming to himself or his friend and to appoint the rent at his own pleasure  but worse than this a great number never farm them at all but keep them as their own lands and give some threehalfpenny priest a curates wages nine or ten pounds even as jeroboam made priests of his own for his hillaltars to sacrifice to his calves that the people should not go up to jerusalem these jeroboams will never let the people ascend to jerusalem to find christ in the temple of his word they began first with parsonages and seemed to have some conscience toward vicarages but now their hearts be so hardened all is fish that comes to the net gentlemen are parsons and vicars both nothing can escape them there be vicarages about london having a thousand people so spoiled whereby it may appear what is done further off  your grace may find also where gentlemen keep in their hands livings of forty or fifty pounds and give one that never comes there five or six pounds some change the ground of the benefice with their tenants to the intent if it be called for the tenant shall lose it and not they is not this a godly patron  it shall appear also i could name the place where a living of an hundred marks by the year if i say not pounds has been sold for many years i suppose an hundred save one and so continues still  o good st ambrose if thou had been bishop there thou would never have suffered such wolves to devour the flock it may well be called a devouring for this living in a godly learned pastors hand might have refreshed five hundred in a year with ghostly food and all the country about with gods word which as i perceive in twenty miles compass has scarce one man to preach and yet no place in england more needful for boys and girls of fourteen or fifteen years old cannot say the lords prayer shall such injury to christ and his gospel be suffered in a christian realm that one enormity cries for vengeance till it be redressed  what shall i speak your noblemen reward their servants with livings appointed for the gospel certainly i marvel that god holds his hand that he destroys them not with nadab and abihu let them not abuse gods patience for if they do not shortly repent and bestow their livings better both master and man shall burn in hellfire  i am not able to rehearse nor yet any man knows all the abuses which the simoniacs ambitious and idle pastors have brought unto your realm by whose evil example ravenous wolves painted christians hypocrites have entered and defiled the sanctuary spoiled christ and his gospel to the destruction of his flock how great enemies they be to christ by keeping away his gospel it shall appear if ye consider what gross superstition and blindness remains still among the people only through lack of faithful preachers i pass over much infidelity idolatry sorcery charming witchcrafts conjuring trusting in figures with such other trumpery which lurk in corners and began of late to come abroad only for lack of preaching come to the ministration of the sacraments set forth now by common authority after the first institution they think baptism is not effectual because it wants mans tradition they are not taught how the apostles baptized a great number think it is a great offense to take the sacrament of christs body in their hands that have no conscience to receive it with blasphemous mouths with malicious hearts full of all uncleanness these come to it by threes of custom without any spiritual hunger and know not the end wherefore it was instituted they come to the church to feed their eyes and not their souls they are not taught that no visible thing is to be worshipped and for because they see not in the church the shining pomp and pleasing variety as they thought it of painted cloths candlestics images altars lamps and tapers they say as good to go into a barn nothing esteeming christ which speaks to them in his holy word neither his holy sacrament reduced to the first institution to be short the people are now even as the jews were at christs coming altogether occupied in external holiness and culture without any feeling of true holiness or of the true worship of god in spirit and truth without the which all other is mere hypocrisy many thousands know not what this means but seek christ still among their kindred in mans inventions where they can never find him as the jews preferred mans traditions before gods commandments even so it is now men think it a greater offense to break a fasting day or work upon a saints day than to abstain from profitable labor and turn it to bacchuss feasts exercising more ungodliness that day than all the week despising or soon weary of gods word  all this with much more comes through lack of preaching as experience tries where godly pastors be  it cannot much be marvelled if the simple and ignorant people by some wicked heads and firebrands of hell be sometimes seduced to rebel against their prince and lawful magistrates seeing they are never taught to know their obedience and duty to their king and sovereign so straightly commanded in gods law  but there hangs over us a great evil if your grace do not help it in time the devil goes about by these cormorants that devour these livings appointed for the gospel to make a sortress and bulwark to keep learned pastors from the flock that is so to decay learning that there shall be none learned to commit the flock unto for by reason livings appointed for the ministry for the most part are either robbed of the best part or clean taken away almost none have any zeal or devotion to put their children to school but to learn to write to make them apprentices or else to have them lawyers look upon the two wells of this realm oxford and cambridge they are almost dried up the cruel philistines abroad enemies to christs gospel have stopped up the springs of faithful abraham the decay of students is so great there are scarce left of every thousand an hundred if they decay so fast in seven years more there will be almost none at all and then may the devil make a triumph this matter requires speedy redress the miseries of your people cry upon you noble prince and christ for his flock cries to you his anointed to defend his lambs from these ravenous wolves that rob and spoil his vineyard by whose malicious endeavor if your grace do not speedily resist there is entering into england more blind ignorance superstition and infidelity than ever was under the romish bishop your realm which i am sorry to speak shall become more barbarous than scythia which lest god almighty lay to your graces charge for suffering the sword given to you for the maintenance of the gospel to lie rusting in the sheath bestir now yourself in your heavenly fathers business withstanding these cormorants by godly laws which rob christs gospel and tread it down they eat up gods people as it were bread your grace shall have more true renown and glory before god by defending christs gospel against them than by conquering all africa you shall do god more service by resisting this tyranny of the devil and his members than by vanquishing the great turk cut first away the occasions of all this mischief dispensations for pluralities and totquots for nonresidents suffer no longer the tithes of the farthest parts of england to be paid at pauls font cause every pastor as his living will extend to keep hospitality  but many think themselves excused for a year or two because their livings are taken away the first year which undoubtedly does not excuse them for their presence i had rather beg or borrow of my friends to help me to meat and clothes than suffer the devil to have such liberty one year it is no small number of souls that may perish by one years absence moses was from the people but forty days and they fell to idolatry  howbeit forasmuch as the scripture does allow the minister a living the first year also  he that serves at the altar let him live of the altar and again thou shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn i do not doubt but after your grace with the advice of your honorable council have considered how much it may set forth gods glory how many souls may be delivered from the devil by sending pastors to their livings the first month and suffering them to have no cloak of absence you will soon restore the first years living which in my conscience was wrongfully taken away at the first as i suppose by the bishop of rome but i doubt not if all were well redressed to this that this also should soon be amended wherefore here i will desire god to assist your grace in the advancement of his gospel which like unto josias you have helped to bring to light where it lay hid  but yet it is not heard of all your people a thousand pulpits in england are covered with dust some have not had four sermons these fifteen or sixteen years since friars left their limitations and few of those were worthy the name of servants now therefore that your glory may be perfect all mens expectation is that whatsoever any flatterers or enemies to gods word should labor to the contrary for their own lucre your grace will take away all such lets and abuses as hinder the setting forth of gods most holy word and withstand all such robbers as spoil his sanctuary traveling to send pastors home to their flocks to feed christs lambs and sheep that all may be occupied in their heavenly fathers business and for this your travel as st peter says when the prince of all pastors shall appear you shall receive an incorruptible crown of glory  and thus far concerning the ecclesiastical ministry  but now to come to the civil governance the nobility magistrates and officers all these must at all times remember they must be occupied in their heavenly fathers business they have received all their nobility power dominion authority and offices of god which are excellent and heroical gifts and if they be occupied in gods business it shall redound to his glory and the wealth of his people but if they fall from his business and follow their own will or rather the will of satan the prince of darkness and father of all the children of darkness then shall all these glorious titles turn them to names of confusion for falling unto ungodliness and framing themselves to the shape and fashion of this world nobility is turned into vile slavery and bondage of sin power and dominion are turned into tyranny authority is become a sword of mischief in a madmans hand all majesty and honor is turned into misery shame and confusion and ever the higher men be while they serve sin the more notable is their vice and more pestiferous to infect by evi examples because all mens eyes are bent to behold their doings every fault of the mind is so much more evident as the party is more notable who has it says juvenal for the worthier the person is which offends the more his offense is noted of others seeing that virtue in all whom god has exalted is the maintainer of their dignity without the which they fall from it it shall be most needful for them to embrace virtue and chiefly humility which is the keeper of all virtues which may put them ever in remembrance from whence power is given them for what end who is above them a judge an examiner of all their doings who cannot be deceived but as dignity goes now a days climb who may climb highest every man exalts himself and tarrieth not the calling of god humility is taken for no keeper but for an utter enemy to nobility as i heard of a wicked climber and exalter of himself who hearing the sentence of christ in the gospel he that humbles himself shall be exalted he most blasphemously against gods holy word said sure it was not true for if i said he had not put forth nor advanced myself but followed this rule i had never come to this dignity for which blasphemy the vengeance of god smote him with sudden death  i fear me a great number are in england which though in words they deny not this sentence of christs yet inwardly they can scarce digest it else certainly they would never seek so ambitiously to advance themselves to climb by their own might uncalled never seeking the public weal but rather the destruction thereof for their private wealth and lucre which causes us to have so many evil magistrates for all the while that men gather goods unjustly by polling pilling usury extortion and simony and therewith seek to climb with bribes and buying of offices it is scarce possible for such to be wholesome magistrates they enter in at the window which is used as well in civil government as in ecclesiastical and therefore may christs words well be verified he that enters not in at the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber and isaiahs complaint against jerusalem takes place among us thy princes are wicked and companions of thieves they love gifts altogether and gape for rewards as for the fatherless they help not him in his right neither will they let the widows cause come before them they will not know their office to be ordained of god for the wealth and defense of all innocents for the aid of all that be in misery the time is come that solomon speaks of when the wicked man bears rule the people shall mourn when had ever the people such cause to mourn as now when the greatest number of all magistrates are occupied in their own business seeking rather the misery of the people than to take it away rather to oppress them than to defend them their hands be ready to receive their money to rob and spoil them but their ears are shut from hearing their complaints they are blind to behold their calamities  look in all countries how lady avarice has set on work altogether mighty men gentlemen and rich men to rob and spoil the poor to turn them from their livings and from their right for ever the weakest go to the wall and being thus tormented and put from their right at home they come to london in great numbers as to a place where justice should be had and there they can have none they are suitors to great men and cannot come to their speech their servants must have bribes and that no small ones all love bribes but such as be so dainty to hear the poor let them take heed lest god make it as strange to them when they shall call for as solomon says whosoever stops his ear at the crying of the poor he shall cry and not be heard we find that poor men might come to complain of their wrongs to the kings own person king joram although he was one of the sons of ahab no good king yet heard the poor widows cause and caused her to have right such was the use then  i would to god that all noblemen would diligently note that chapter and follow the example it would not then be so hard for the poor to have access to them nor coming to their presence they should not be made so astonished and even speechless with terrible looks but should mercifully and lovingly be heard and succored gladly for christs love considering we are the members of his body even as my hand would be glad to help my foot when it is annoyed  o with what glad hearts and clear consciences might noblemen go to rest when they had bestowed the whole day in hearing christ himself complain in his members and redressing his wrongs but alas for lack hereof poor people are driven to seek their right among the lawyers and there as the prophet joel says look what the caterpillars had left in their robbery and oppression at home all that does the greedy locusts the lawyers devour at london they laugh with the money which makes others to weep and thus are the poor robbed on every side without redress and that of such as seem to have authority thereto  when christ suffered his passion there was one barabbas st matthew called him a notable thief a gentleman thief such as rob nowadays in velvet coats the other two were obscure thieves and nothing famous the rustical thieves were hanged and barabbas was delivered even so nowadays the little thieves are hanged that steal of necessity but the great barabbases have free liberty to rob and to spoil without all measure in the midst of the city the poor pirate said to alexander we rob but a few in a ship but thou robbest whole countries and kingdoms  alas silly poor members of christ how you be shorn oppressed pulled halled to and fro on every side who cannot but lament if his heart be not of flint there be a great number every term and many continually which lamentably complain for lack of justice but ail in vain they spend that which they had left and many times more whose ill success here causes thousands to tarry at home beggars and lose their right  and so it were better than here to sell their coats for this we see be the poor mans cause never so manifest a truth the rich shall for money find six or seven counselors that shall stand with subtleties and sophisms to cloak an evil matter and hide a known truth  a piteous case in a christian commonwealth alas that ever manifest falsehood should be maintained where the god of truth ought to be honored  but let them alone they are occupied in their fathers business even the prince of darkness you are of your father the devil  yet i cannot so leave them i must needs cry on gods behalf to his patrons of justice to you most redoubted prince whom god has made his minister for their defense with all those whom god has placed in authority under you look upon their misery for this is our heavenly fathers business to you appointed by his holy word when i come among the people i call upon them as my duty is for service duty and obedience unto their prince to all magistrates to their lords and to all that be put in authority over them i let them hear their own faults but in this place my duty is and my conscience upon gods word binds me seeing them so miserably so wrongfully so cruelly entreated on every side in gods behalf to plead their cause not by force of mans law but by gods word as an intercessor for as they are debtors unto you and other magistrates for love fear service and obedience under god so are you again debtors unto them for love protection for justice and equity mercy and pity if you deny them these they must suffer but god shall revenge them he stands says david in the congregation of gods and as a judge among gods take heed all you that be counted as gods gods ministers on earth you have one god judge over you who as he says in the same psalm sharply rebukes ungodly rulers for accepting of persons of the ungodly so he tells christian magistrates their true duties and business in plain words defend the poor and needy see that such as be in necessity have right deliver the outcast and poor save them from the hands of the ungodly here have all noblemen and christian magistrates most lively set forth to them their heavenly fathers business wherein he would have them continually occupied  would to god the whole psalm were graven in their hearts  truly for lack that this business is not applied but the poor despised in all places it has given such boldness to covetous cormorants abroad that now their robberies extortion and open oppression has no end nor limits no banks can keep in their violence as for turning poor men out of their holds they take it for no offense but say their land is their own and forget altogether that the earth is the lords and the fullness thereof they turn them out of their shrouds as mice thousands in england through such beg now from door to door which have kept honest houses these cry daily to god for vengeance both against the great nimrods workers thereof and their maintainers there be so many mighty nimrods in england mighty hunters that hunt for possessions and lordships that poor men are daily hunted out of their livings there is no covert or den can keep them safe these nimrods have such quick smelling hounds they can lie at london and turn men out of their farms and tenements an hundred some two hundred miles off  o lord when wicked ahab hunted after naboths vineyard he could not though he were a king obtain that prey till cursed jezebel as women ofttimes have shrewd wits took the matter in hand so hard a thing it was then to wring a man from his fathers inheritance which now a mean man will take in hand and now our valiant nimrods can compass the matter without the help of jezebels yet has england even now a great number of jezebels which to maintain their intolerable pride their golden heads will not stick to put to their wicked hands  o lord what a number of such oppressors worse than ahab are in england which sell the poor for a pair of shoes of whom if god should serve but three or four as he did ahab and make the dogs lap the blood of them i think it would cause a great number to beware of extortion to beware of oppression and yet escaping temporal punishments they are certain by gods word their blood is reserved for hell hounds which they nothing fear a pitiful case and great blindness that hearing gods word man should more fear temporal punishment than everlasting  yet has england had of late some terrible examples of gods wrath in sudden and strange deaths of such as join field to field and house to house great pity they were not chronicled to the terror of others which fear neither god nor man so hardened in sin that they seek not to hide it but rather are such as glory in their mischief which makes me oftentimes to remember a writer in our time musculus upon st matthews gospel which marvelled much at the subtle and manifold working of satan how he after the expelling of superstition and hypocrisy travelleth most busily to bring in open impiety that whereas before men feared men though not god now a great number fear neither god nor man the most wicked are counted most manlike and innocence holden beastliness  yet may we not say hypocrisy is expelled for as many of these ahabs as signify they favor gods word by reading or hearing it or with prayer honoring him as christ says with their lips their hearts being far from him are as detestable hypocrites as ever were covered in cowl or cloister i cannot liken them better than to the jews that said to christ hail king of the jews what their painted friendship is and how of christ it is esteemed st austin sets forth by an apt similitude even as says he a man should come up to embrace thee to kiss and honor thee upward and beneath with a pair of shoes beaten full of nails tread upon thy bare foot the head shall despise the honor done unto it and for the foot that smarteth say why treadest thou upon me so when feigned gospelers honor christ our head sitting in heaven and oppress his members on earth the head shall speak for the feet that smart and say why treadest thou on me paul had a zeal toward god hut he did tread upon christs feet on earth for whom the head cries forth of heaven saul saul why persecutest thou me although christ sits at the right hand of his father yet lies he in earth he suffers all calamities here on earth he is many times evil entreated here on earth  would to god we could bear away this brief and short lesson that what we do to his members upon earth we do to him it would bring men from oppression to show mercy without which no man can obtain mercy if they would remember how the rich glutton was damned in hell not as we read for any violence but for not showing mercy they might soon gather how sharp judgment remains for them which are not only unmerciful but also violently add thereunto oppression who are so far from mercy that their hearts will serve them to destroy whole towns they would wish all the people destroyed to have all the fields brought to a sheeppasture o cruel mercy it is like to the mercy of a bishop of magunce in germany named hatto which as the chronicles mention five hundred years ago in time of a great dearth called all the poor people in all the whole country into a great barn pretending to make a great dole but having them sure he fired the barn and burnt them all up saying these be the mice which devour up the corn this was a policy to make bread more cheap but for this unmerciful mercy god made him an example for all unmerciful men to the worlds end for a multitude of rats came and devoured him in such terrible sort that where his name was written in windows walls or hangings they never ceased till it were razed out  some peradventure shrink to hear such cruelty but doubtless there is almost daily as great cruelty practiced among us by such bloodsuckers as being infected with the great dropsy of avarice always drinking and ever athirst by famishing poor people drinking up their blood and with long continuance therein torment them more grievously than he that burnt them all in one hour  now seeing as i said this cruelty robbery and extortion grows daily to such intolerable excess and overfloweth this realm because it is not punished nor restrained it is high time for all those magistrates that fear god not only to abstain from this evil themselves but to resist it also it is gods business he has commanded it and will straightly require it would to god all noblemen would beware by the example of saul he was commanded to apply gods business go and smite amalek and have no compassion on them etc he left his business undone spared amalek and the fairest of the beasts but for this negligence he received of samuel a sorrowful message from god because thou have cast away the word of the lord he has cast thee off also from being king even so in every christian commonwealth god has commanded rulers to destroy amalek all extortion oppression and robbery to defend the needy and all innocents if they look not to this business but suffer amalek to live not only to live but to grow in might so truly as god lives he shall cast them off they shall not be his magistrates  but let it once be known that not only our most noble king whose godly example is a lantern to all other but that also all his nobles about him have wholly bent themselves in his business to withstand all violence and to oppose all oppression for defense of gods people that the wicked ahabs might know that god had in england a great number of pastors patrons feeders and cherishers of his people it should do that which the fear of god cannot do that is stop the great rage of violence oppression and extortion which taken away would pluck from many their vanity in superfluous and monstrous apparel sumptuous building such as seek to bring paradise into earth being the greatest causes of all oppression and spoiling of poor people which most unchristian vanities and blind affections never reigned so much in all estates in england as at this day it was a notable saying of charles v emperor of that name to the duke of venice when he had seen his princely palace when the duke looked that he should have praised it exceedingly charles gave it none other commendation but this haec sunt quae faciunt invitos mori these earthly vanities said he are what make us loath to die a truer sentence could not well be spoken by any man i could wish we would look on all our buildings when the beauty thereof so increases that it would grieve us to depart from it and to remember with all the holy patriarchs and with st paul say that we have not here a continuing city but we seek one to come  but truly methinks now in england for our vain delight in curious buildings god has plagued us as he did the builders of babel not with the confusion of tongues but with the confusion of wits our fancies can never be pleased pluck down and set up and when it contenteth us not down with it again our minds are never contented nor ever shall be while we seek felicity where it is not would god every one would consider what a hell it should be to all that vainly delight herein when death shall with great violence pluck them from their earthly heaven moreover extortion taken away shall soon abate the unmeasurable excess in costly fare it would also abate the intolerable excess in apparel which causes us to have robbers in velvet coats with st martins chains  but i must for lack of time pass over these enormities which alone give matter enough for whole sermons i leave them for others which shall follow more able to paint out such monsters in their colors  and here in conclusion i desire all noblemen and godly magistrates deeply to ponder and revolve in their memory what acceptable service they may do chiefly to god and secondly to the kings majesty and his whole realm in employing their whole study how to resist all such as spoil christs people whom he so tenderly loved that he shed his blood for them virtue joined with nobility spreads her beams over a whole realm and so your diligence in gods business shall soon inflame all other to follow your example that all may occupy themselves in gods business  but now that i have hitherto charged the ecclesiastical ministers and after the civil governors and all rich and mighty men with negligence in gods business methinks i do hear the inferior members rejoice and flatter themselves as if all were taken from them and they left clear in gods sight but if they consider their estate by gods word they shall find small cause to advance themselves for gods word plainly tells us both that evil and dumb pastors and wicked rulers and magistrates are sent of god as a plague and punishment for the sins of the people and therefore both isaiah and hosea after the most terrible threatenings of gods vengeance for sin bring it in as a most grievous plague of all that even the priests which should call them from sin shall become as evil as the people which plague st bernard said in his time was come with a vengeance for because the priests were much worse than the people and amos as a most grievous punishment of all other threatens hunger not of bread but of hearing gods word and concerning the civil magistrates it is plain in job that for the sins of the people god raises hypocrites to reign over them that is to say such as have the bare names of governors and protectors and are indeed destroyers oppressors of the people subverters of the law and of all equity  and seeing it is so so many as feel the grief and smart of this plague ought not to murmur against other but patiently suffer and be offended with their own sins which have deserved this scourge and much more and study for amendment that god may take it away for if they continue as they do to murmur against god and their rulers as the israelites did to provoke daily his anger by multiplying sin in his sight with envy malice deceit backbiting swearing fornication and with utter contempt of his word he shall for their punishment so multiply the number of evil governors unjust judges justices and officers that as it was spoken by a jester in the emperor claudiuss time the images of good magistrates may all be graven in one ring  god has cause greatly to be displeased with all estates when every man should look upon his own faults to seek amendment as it is a proverb lately sprung up no man amendeth himself but every man seeks to amend other and all the while nothing is amended gentlemen say the commonalty live too well at ease they grow every day to be gentlemen and know not themselves their horns must be cut shorter by raising their rents by fines and by plucking away their pastures  the mean men they murmur and grudge and say the gentlemen have all and there were never so many gentlemen and so little gentleness and by their natural logic you shall hear them reason how improperly these two conjugata these yoakfellows gentlemen and gentleness are banished so far asunder and they lay all the misery of this commonwealth upon the gentlemens shoulders  but alas good christians this is not the way of amendment if ye bite and devour one another as st paul says take ye heed lest ye be consumed one of another  histories make mention of a people called anthropophagi eaters of men which all mens hearts abhor to hear of and yet alas by st pauls rule england is full of such maneaters every man envieth another every man biteth and gnaweth upon another with venomous adders tongues far more noisome than any teeth and whereof comes it covetousness is the root of all every man scratcheth and pilleth from other every man would suck the blood of other every man encroacheth upon another covetousness has cut away the large wings of charity and plucketh all to herself she is never satisfied she has chested all the old gold in england and much of the new she has made that there was never more idolatry in england than at this day but the idols are hid they come not abroad  alas noble prince the images of your ancestors graven in gold and yours also contrary to your mind are worshipped as gods while the poor lively images of christ perish in the streets through hunger and cold this comes when covetousness has banished from amongst us christian charity when like most unthankful children we have forgotten christs last will which he so often before his passion did inculcate love one another  and herein we show ourselves worse than any carnal sons be they never so unkind yet always they remember the last words of their earthly parents nay rather i may say we are much worse than the brute beasts of whom when we consider how wonderfully nature has framed them to concord and unity to preserve and help one another of their own kind it may make us utterly to be ashamed the hearts swimming with much pain bear up their heads in the water for the remedy whereof every one lays his head upon the hinder part of another when the foremost having no stay is sore weary he comes behind and thus every one in his course takes pain for the whole herd  if men endued with reason would learn of these unreasonable creatures this lesson to help one another as we are commanded by st paul saying bear ye one anothers burden and so you shall fulfill the law of christ how soon then should charity the bond of perfection which seeks not her own but rather to profit others be so spread among all degrees that our commonwealth should flourish in all godliness but alas we see that all goes contrary for while all men as st paul says seek the things that be their own and not other mens not things which appertain to christ selflove and love of private commodity has banished charity and love to the commonwealth  and if we should seek the cause and ground of all these evils why gods business is so neglected among all estates and degrees i think it would appear to be ignorance of his will for if mary and joseph so godly and devout a couple understood not for a time christs saying wist ye not that i must go about my fathers business as st luke says they understood not that saying what marvel is it if we living so carnally and drowned in worldly pleasures and framed to the shape of this world be ignorant in our heavenly fathers business and therefore cannot well apply it but shall we think this to be very strange many apply not gods business nor his will which yet would disdain to be counted ignorant therein but undoubtedly good christians it is an infallible verity that negligence in performing gods will comes of ignorance it is all one to know god and his will and st john says plainly he that loves not knows not god for if he do know god he cannot but love him and love is always occupied in gods business  by this rule st augustine proves we cannot keep the first precept perfectly to love god so well as we ought to do while we are in this mortal life for all our love comes of knowledge but in this life our knowledge is imperfect and thus st augustines rule grounded upon st john is true that so far as we do know god so far we love him and so they that love him nothing at all they know him nothing at all although they seem to have never so much windy knowledge puffing up their stomachs with presumption as the apostle says knowledge makes a man swell so that if a man has studied the scripture all his life long and learned the whole bible by heart and yet have no love he is ignorant of gods will the poor man that never opened book if the love of god be shed abroad in his heart by the holy ghost overcomes him in the knowledge of gods will the godly pembus of whom we read in ecclesiastical history when he was first taught the first verse of the thirtyninth psalm i have said i will take heed to my ways that i offend not in my tongue refused a long time to take out a new lesson judging his first lesson to be unlearned till he could perfectly practice it by an holy conversation so ought we always to make our account to have learned gods word only when we have learned charity and obedience  but this knowledge though it lack in many learned yet ordinarily it comes by hearing gods word faith comes of hearing and hearing of the word of god wherefore as i said their case is to be lamented which would gladly hear gods word and can have no preachers then may we say god has abundantly poured his grace among us that have his gospel so clearly set forth unto us and have such opportunity that there wants nothing but ears to hear we must have ears to let it sink into our hearts but o men thrice unhappy and children of greater damnation if we harden our hearts and receive such abundance of grace in vain the earth says st paul which after the rain brings forth thorns and briars is reproved and is nigh unto cursing whose end is to be burned  would god all that be in the court that will not vouchsafe having so many godly sermons to come forth out of the hall into the chapel to hear them would remember what a heavy stroke of gods vengeance hangs over all their heads that contemn his word and over those in all places which had rather be idle and many times ungodly occupied in wanton and wicked pastimes than come to the church profaning the sabbath day appointed for the service of god and the hearing of his word bestowing it more wickedly than many of the gentiles yet if they would come to the sermons though their hearts were not well disposed gods word might win them as st augustine was won by the preaching of st ambrose when he came only to hear his sweet voice and eloquence o that they knew what dishonor they did to christ that esteem him so light to prefer vain nay i say wicked things to the hearing of his holy word are not these they as st paul says which tread under foot the son of god count the blood of his testament wherein they are sanctified an unholy thing and do despite to the spirit of grace o lord how can thou hold thy hands from punishing this unthankfulness certainly i think all other wickedness compared to this is shadowed and seems to be less  i would to god we would remember many times the plagues and tokens of gods extreme wrath that came upon the jews when first unthankfully they rejected christ and after his word when they were destroyed by titus and vespasian such a plague as never came upon any other country and look on their vices there reigned avarice ambition pride extortion envy adultery but these reigned also in other countries about where no such vengeance did light but then did god thus exercise his wrath upon them to the terror of all other for contempt of his holy word and for their unthankfulness which being called so many ways by his prophets by himself by the apostles still hardened their hearts this exceeded all other wickedness in the world now if as great unthankfulness be found in many of us toward christ and his gospel set forth so plainly unto us how can we without speedy repentance but look for the terrible stroke of vengeance god says valerius maximus has feet of wool he comes slowly to punish but he has hands of iron when he comes he strikes sore  philip king of macedonia hearing of one in his kingdom which refused most unthankfully to receive a stranger of whom before he had been succored in shipwreck in extreme need for a worthy punishment caused to be printed in his forehead with an hot iron these two words ingratus hospes an unthankful guest o lord if we consider when we were strangers from god in the shipwreck of sin how mercifully christ has delivered us and born our sins upon his body if after all this we most unthankfully refuse to receive him by refusing his word may we not think ourselves worthy many hot irons to print our unthankfulness to our shame and undoubtedly so many as continue thus unthankful though it be not written in their foreheads to put them to worldly shame yet shall it be graven in their conscience to their everlasting confusion and damnation when the books of every mans conscience shall be laid open as daniel says their judgment shall be more strait than that of sodom and gomorrah  let us all then from the highest to the lowest pray with one accord that god may soften and prepare our hearts with meekness and humility and thankfulness to embrace his gospel and his holy word which shall instruct us in his holy will and teach us to know his business every man in his vocation that as st paul says every man may give attendance to themselves and to the flock wherein the holy ghost has made them overseers to feed the congregation of god which he has purchased with his blood that all ravenous wolves may be turned to good shepherds so that christs ministers may enjoy the portion assigned for the gospel that all magistrates and governors may give their whole study to the public weal and not to their private wealth that they may be maintainers of justice and punishers of wrong and that all inferiors may live in due obedience meekly contenting themselves every one in their vocation without murmuring or grudging that under christ and our noble prince his minister here on earth we all being knit together with christian charity the bond of perfection may so fasten our eyes upon gods word that it may continually be a lantern to our feet to guide our journey through the desert and dark wilderness of this world that our eyes be never so blinded with shadows of worldly things as to make us embrace life deceitful and temporal felicity for that which is true steadfast and everlasting that this candle which shines now as st paul says as through a glass darkly when that which is imperfect shall be taken away may present us to that clear light which never is shadowed with any darkness that we may behold that blessed sight of the glorious trinity the father the son and the holy ghost to whom be all praise all honor and glory world without end  finis
