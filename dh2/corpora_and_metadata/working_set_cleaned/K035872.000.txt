himself with additions never before printed has the authors picture before it curiousty engraved on copper by m vandergucht and contains more than double the number of tracts incerted in the said spurious collection   the sincerity of the dissenters vindicated from the scandal of occasional conformity with some considerations on a late book entitled moderation a virtue price   d  the shortest way to peace and union by the author of the shortest way with the dissenters price   d   more reformation a satyr upon himself by the author of the true born englishman price   s  a challenge of peace addressed to the whole nation  with an enquiry into ways and means for bringing it to pass  london printed in the year   0   to the queen madam as the whole nation are happy in the things you do so they are particularly attentive to what you say the speeches your majesty is pleased to make in parliament are looked upon as words spoken to all the kingdom and their influences are accordingly universal  of all the expressions that ever passed from your royal lips i humbly presume none ever sounded in the ears of your protestant subjects with so general applause as your royal invitation to peace and union among themselves  your majesty has by this one step let all the world know that you not only seek but perfectly understand the general good of your people and the only way to make them invincible  it remains to your subjects to accept your royal proposal and look upon it as the most binding obligation since when princes stoop to invite their people to what was before their duty it carries with it the double force of a command  your subjects madam who wish for peace are encouraged to seek and pursue it while they are now satisfied that so long as they follow the natural dictates of their own reason they also concur with the judgment and obey the obliging commands of their sovereign  those unhappy people who either from the severity of their principles or really for want of principles are otherwise cnclind that are for suppressing their protestant brethren for opinions in religion or for oppressing their neighbors for interest and parties may now be satisfied that while they pursue that unchristian and impolitick method they not only weaken but disoblige your majesty and your real interest  and by this your majesty will plainly see who are your best subjects those who willingly embrace the peace and general charity of christians and englishmen according to your majestys obliging exhortation or they who by keeping up the differences of your subjects and by continual reproachings and reflections endeavor to represent your peaceable people as enemies to your person and government though they are and ever have been as dutiful and loyal as themselves  such may see their practices discouraged by your majestys healing example and would do well to consider that their peculiar duty to your majesty lies not in recriminating upon the infirmities of others but in correcting their own  your majesty has this complete satisfaction concerning all your subjects that the principal part of their contention is which party are most loyal to your government and among those who dissent from the church none of them dissent from your interest and those gentlemen who would fain persuade the world that those who dissent from the ecclesiastic establishment are also enemies to the civil have been driven to a necessity of a supposed extending the civil power beyond the limits of the laws to bring those people they would expose to so much as a temper of objecting against it  this is a method so grossly injurious to your majesty as well as to your subjects that it has been long earnestly wished you would on some occasion or other let them know how ill pleasing it was and how ill it corresponded both with your majestys principle as well as practice in all the parts of your government  it is an unhappy violence these men offer to your majestys character that they would be content to have your majesty become a tyrant so they might but be capable to prove the dissenters disloyal to your government  but as we bless god that your majesty has resolved to regulate your government by the great foundation of all government the laws so we cannot think we offend your majesty in saying that in a full obedience to your government and the laws none of your subjects have exceeded in loyalty more than those that have at the same time dissented in some point of religion from the established church  and among those who thus dissent they whose principles are honest have always regarded the church of england with a temper both of charity and respect and it is to them a matter of no difficulty to entertain a proposal of union in affection and interest and to give all the defference and distinction in government to the established church  from whence and your majestys most generous invitation to peace which on all occasions they most readily embrace they humbly hope the heats and animosities of those gentlemen who charge them with disloyalty of principles will in obedience to your most gracious speech to your parliament be buried and forgotten that they may enjoy together with all your loyal subjects the public favor and protection of their sovereign till they give your majesty some just cause which god forbid to withdraw it from them  and if this cannot be obtained your majesty and all the world will be witnesses to their sincere desires and forward endeavors after the general union of your subjects and will be effectually satisfied at whose doors the black charge will lie and to whom we owe all the unhappy divisions of the nation  your protestant subjects madam who as your majesty once observed have the misfortune to dissent from the established church have yet a greater misfortune than that namely to be misrepresented to your majesty as enemies to your person and government but among all their unhappiness they esteem this as a blessing from heaven that they have now an opportunity offered them to convince your majesty of the honesty of their principles by being the forwardest to close with your invitation of peace and union as the thing in all the world which most suites both their practice and inclination  humbly assuring your majesty that as with the greatest thankfulness they receive the expressions of your earnest defires for the peace and union of all your subjects so with a steady application they resolve to be the first who shall publicly practice it and endeavor to express their zeal for the public good and your majestys glory by heartily complying with what they were always inclined to by their principles and inclinations but much more by the obedience their duty calls for to your majestys commands of peace and union  the humblest of your subjects madam would have subscribed his name to a petition of pardon for the presumption of this dedication but that when he compares his despicable character with the glorious subject he has attempted to advance he cannot prevail upon himself to let the cause suffer by the meaness and unworthiness of the advocate and only craves leave to assure your majesty that however he may have been represented he is a passionate admirer of peace an earnest petitioner for the prosperity of your majesty and this kingdom and the entire union of all your subjects  amen a challenge of peace addressed to the whole nation with an enquiry into ways and means for bringing it to pass when her majesty in her speech to the parliament pressed the house to union and peace i believe twas included in her royal intentions that we should all understand her speaking to the whole nation and that her majesty would have all her subjects study concord and unanimity among themselves in their neighborhood and converse as well as in the councils and debates of their representatives in parliament  i cannot suppose her majesty should mean a union of opinions in religion for though i ought to believe her majesty wishes all her protestant subjects were of one mind with her self and followed her majesty in the same path to heaven yet i cannot believe her majesty sees it so probable as to expect it but i suppose her majesty to mean that they should all unite in affection where they differ in opinion unite in interest and concur in their obedience to the established government unite in a unanimous agreement of management and unite as to parties and factions unite as englishmen as christians and as protestants this every good christian would be glad to see and this every man ought to suppose himself invited to in her majestys speech  if i am mistaken as i believe i am not let any man give me a construction of her speech more genuine if they can  these sheets are designed as a comment upon this glorious text and further to explain the subject and if possible both describe the sense and remove the obstructions  it is a most fatal unhappy circumstance that every body is for peace and yet no body will bring it to pass all men agree that peace is a blessing from on high that the want of it among our selves undoes us ruins our preparations at home and our expeditions abroad fills us with fatal parties factions and animosities makes our councils confused our war tedious our designs abortive and our felicity precarious want of peace and unity among our selves makes our arms less feared our friendship less courted and in short is the only thing in the world can ever ruin us  i am persuaded there is not a man in the nation but concurs in these generals but when you come to speak of the particular steps to be taken to obtain this blessed article of the nations happiness all men are for having their neighbors stoop to their opinions but wont yield a jot of their own they are for making abatements for other men but admit of none for themselves  to come directly to the point concerning this union of parties i think it is necessary a little to examine the negatives which are not the ways to obtain this blessing as  first sacheverells bloody flag of defiance is not the way to peace and union the shortest way to destroy is not the shortest way to unite persecution laws to compel restrain or force the consciences of one another is not the way to this union which her majesty has so earnestly recommended  secondly to repeal or contract the late act of tolleration is not the way for this so much wished for happiness to have laws revived that should set one party a plundering excommunicating and unchurching another that should renew the oppressions and devastations of late reigns this will not by any means contribute to this peace which all good men desire  new associations and proposals to divest men of their freehold right for differences in opinion and take away the right of dissenters voting in elections of members this is not the way to peace and union  railing pamphlets buffooning our brethren as a party to be suppressed and dressing them up in the bares skin for all the dogs in the street to bait them is not the way to peace and union  railing sermons exciting people to hatred and contempt of their brethren because they differ in opinions is not the way to peace and union  shutting all people out of employment and the service of their prince and country unless they can comply with indifferent ceremonies of religion is far from the way to peace and union  reproaching the succession settled by parliament and reviving the abdicated title of the late k james and his supposed family cannot tend to this peace and union  laws against occasional conformity and compelling people who bear offices to a total conformity and yet force them to take and serve in those public employments cannot contribute to peace and union  these are some of the negativae some of the immediate contraries the opposites to this blessed peace and union which her majesty has recommended to the whole nation while these things are practiced or allowed i doubt her majesty will be defeated of the expectation she has from the exhortation she has been pleased to make the breaches are too wide the wound too deep and ranckld almost to a gangreen and if it goes long without a cure will certainly come to amputation of members or to a mortification of parts the breaches of parties if not ended in a healing agreement will certainly end in the suppression if not the destruction of one party if not of all  the ways and means for this nations destruction are very plain and obvious they are all within our selves they are begun and carried on by our selves we dig the grave of the commonwealth with our own hands the fire of discord will burn up the very bowels of the nation and consume us insensibly and all owing to the civil fury of contending parties no nation can destroy england but it self and if the feuds and heat of parties continue no nation can prevent our destruction  her majesty sensible of the evil consequence has given a large and very seasonable caution and solemnly invites all the nation to lay aside the contention of parties to embrace peace love unity and conjunction of interests that uniting hearts and hands in the common defense the whole government may be strengthened her majesty the more cheerfully assisted and the public burden sustained  to these blessed ends all good protestants ought to contribute as far as in them lies but as all parties must yield part of their present stifness to the great conjunction her majesty desires i thought it might not be improper to let all sides see some necessary steps which they not only should but must and ought to take in order to make this heavenly work possible  i humbly conceive all the present discord of this nation may be comprehended in these two differences in religion differences in interest   one concerns the conscience and the other the estate but both are so twisted together that it seems as if there were no broil but about religion and that the church was the only bone of contention  but as they have generally least of religion who contend most about it so in the public strife of parties there seems to be a color of religion placed upon the general contention but really at the bottom the whole quarrel is guided by the interests of parties places preferments to get some in and some out this seems the main thing in hand  parties contend to get into the executive power that they may put all their friends into the great places and offices of the crown  some would have such a king or such a family to succeed to the crown and why not so much because this king or prince or family is of this of that religion but because they are of such or such a party and then such and such friends get into employment  i dont say it is impossible to reconcile parties wave differences and bring all to a temper of peace but there is so much to be done so much selfdenial of practice required that i dare not say i hope to see it brought to pass and yet i shall not descend to particulars in order only to show the difficulty and so discourage the work but to let you see that though it may be difficult it is not impossible  the first article of ways and means to this peace must be found in the general temper of the nation there must be a propensity a general inclination to yield and bend to one another it is nonsense to talk of particulars if the general bent of mens thoughts are not first brought to love seek and desire peace and were this once produced could any probable steps be taken in this part could there be but an appearance of a peaceable temper in the nation the rest of the work would be found easier than we imagine all differences would vanish did but the inclination to difference vanish did the wrangling temper cease were but the spirit of contention taken away the causes of contention would not be so eagerly embraced this is the tinder of the nation which is so ready to catch hold of the fire of dissension this unhappiness of temper has been an old and epidemick disease and has got such ground among us twill be very hard to have any thing but some public calamity to cure it affliction reconciles friends common dangers unite nations and settle disjointed parties all are obliged to join in common defense  but it is very hard as well as unkind to our selves that we can never be in a condition to be reconciled to one another till we are just at the door of being ruined that nothing but enemies can persuade us to be friends and the more violent our assaults are from abroad the more forward our peace is at home from whence that verse seems to be verified of the english and by far harder to rule in times of peace than war   now seems a prevaling juncture to reduce us to a temper of peace foreign wars though we feel them not in our own bowels yet one would think they have presented a field spacious enough to vent all our gall and ill temper in though the war has not been so considerable as to put us out of our selves for fear yet it has not been so inconsiderable as not to afford us sufficient reason for unity union of councils union of purses hands and hearts are all little enough  but it is in vain to talk of union till the temper of disunited parties is brought over to desire it we may unite in words but we shall never do it in affection till all people are willing pretenses of union tend but to the widening the breach and is like hypocrisy in religion represented in scripture by drawing near to god with the mouth when the heart is far from him he that presses his argument for this temper should direct his speech to all parties and to all such i freely say they who have not this temper of peace who do not incline to union of interest and union of affection are blind to the public benefit of their native country enemies to the present government disrespectful and disloyal to her majesty and underminers of their own posterity  it may be expected very rationally that i should enter into the particulars of parties and examine who have most need to be exhorted to union and peace and though i would not be partial to parties yet i cannot help advancing this general head that the main article of dissension strife and contention lies now on those gentlemen who call themselves highchurchmen who can the invitation to peace mean but those people who want the hint it is plain neither the moderate churchmen nor the dissenters can be meant for they are desirous of peace it is their interest their principle and their inclination the temper seems to be plainly seen there  the high churchmen say they are for peace but they are for peace without union they are for the peace of subjection they would have all be peace that is their feet on the necks of their enemies but it is peace and union the queen has spoke for and it is to these gentlemen the speech is directed for they chiefly stand in need of the exhortation  these are the men who carry the heat of their arguments out to the extreme of reproach and the indecency of contempt these are the men that print preach and cry up all modern discontents that strive to blacken their brethren with marks of distinction these are they that have stigmatized all the men of moderation with the brand of lowchurchmen and all other writings represent them as traitors to their friends to the church and to their own principles worse than dissenters fanatics or schismatics and yet all i can find these gentlemen charged with is that they are not for tearing people to pieces for religion and ruining their dissenting brethren the shortest way  these are the gentlemen who have lifted up the bloody flag against their protestant neighbors and declared that all the true churchmen are bound to list in the new crusado of the church  these are the gentlemen who are for confounding and not converting their friends the dissenters and instead of desiring them to conform are for preventing that occasional communion they can comply with in order to keep them out of places so that they had rather keep up the schism in the church than obtain a union at the price of their temporal advancement discovering a true christian spirit in being neither willing to let us dissent nor conform  these are the gentlemen that have the most need to learn the doctrine of peace and union since if they pleased we might be soon removed from the most contentious divided nation in the world to an universal family of love and christian charity endeavoring to win and engage one another by mildness and temper and struggling to fortify our opinions by the christian emulation of love and good works  the charge seems great but might easily be made out that this party only are the agressors in contention  the low churchmen as they call them are men of moderation and peace and hated by these because they are so they are neither for oppressing the property nor imposing upon the conscience a large charity for their fellow christians aversion to persecution tenderness of property and the laws are their peculiar character  to these there is no occasion of speaking a word for they are with her majesty heart and hand for peace and union  to these we owe the act of toleration and the quieting the uneasy consciences of the people  to these we owe the restoring of parliaments to their due power and that power to its frequent exercise  to these we owe the disarming the ecclesiastical harpies and paring the talons and claws of the church vultures who were always tearing to pieces and preying upon their neighbors  to these we owe the currency and supremacy of the laws and the just concession of right made to the people  to these we owe the late revolution deposing the dispensing arbitrary will of approaching tyranny  to these we owe the securing our posterity in the possession of their indubitable rights under a protestant succession and removing the nations fears from a precarious unsettled futurity what have not these men of peace done for us  these are the center to which all parties if they will have peace must incline  to these the dissenters freely and cheerfully remit the trust of government and the conduct of constituted right  these are the men whom the dissenters are universally willing should reign over them and from among whom if it was in their choice they would demand a king  with these liberty property conscience law justice and all the parts of the constitution are secure their end is peace and their mean justice and the laws  the dissenters and these have but one interest and there never was a man of these in post of trust or honor in the nation who kept close to this honest principle but the dissenters loved him stood by him voted for him and in all cases needful vindicated and encouraged him  nor do the dissenters stand in so much need of this peaceable hint relating to the public for they have never been found embroyling the state or breaking the public measures they have been misrepresented as engrosing and possessing the places of trust and profit in the last reign but the case remains unprovd and in all the black roll of mismanagement represented to her majesty in the address of the house of commons i fairly challenge any man to show me the name of one dissenter they have suffered in the calamities occasioned by those missconducts they have born the share of taxes misapplied and deficiencies of funds but they can never prove upon them that any dissenters were either personally or occasionally instrumental in those defects your ran  s your sr john m  sr r  g  w  and j  were none of them dissenters the frauds and treacheries of the late reign cannot be laid at their door  all their grievances are that they suffer by other mens knavery that they are threatened with the repeal of the tolleration blackened with slanders and bullied with bloody flags defiances and billinsgate language from the press and from the pulpit their meeting houses represented as houses of sedition and the world asks this insolent question in print whether is worse or more pernicious to the government a meeting house or a playhouse they are daily suffering the indignities of hairbrained priests buffooning poets and clubs of insolent pamphleters and twould be endless to quote the beargarden language thrown upon them in a rapsody of prints which they suffer with regret but have always born with patience  these things being removed the dissenters are naturally at ease the liberty of their persons safety of their properties and birth right and the tolleration of their consciences are the full of all their demand and these being secured we may safely defye all the power of malice to charge upon them the breach of the publickquiet or any encroachment upon the government their neighbors or the laws  the assaults of their intemperate adversaries may have filled them with just apprehensions that the sub version of their liberty is designed and they will perhaps be ready to say they have good reason for it but as her majesty has always comforted them with the full assurance of her royal word in that case they have always behaved with duty and deference to her majesty and every part of her government and let those who have so openly attempted to prove the dissenters fatal to the english constitution and consequently have proposed to have them deprived of their birthright as freeholders let them give an instance of one act of disloyalty which they have been guilty of to her majesty to merit so much her royal displeasure  the dissenters therefore do not come in as the immediate subjects of this exhortation to peace their circumstances their interests their number their estates oblige them to peace and they cannot be fomenters of our breaches and divisions without being fools and madmen blind to their own happiness and thieves to their posterity  if this blessed motion of peace affects the dissenters at all it must be as it respects the conduct of themselves to themselves the infinite feuds divisions and animosities harbored among their separate parties and daily expressed against one another is too much a scandal upon them as christians and too much reproaches their morals as men and here it is to be acknowledged they deserve reproof and cannot defend themselves wherefore they are most justly called upon by her majestys speech and by the whole nation to hearken to peace  their character as christians their pretenses of more than common reformation their interest as a party their profession their god and their queen all call upon them to peace and union union of affection if not union of profession union of practice if not union of principle  having thus run through the parties who are concerned in this matter it leads me to repeat to my reader that were the temper of peace were the propensity to a general union fixed in the breasts of these parties there might be some hopes that a further progress might be made but there must first be an inclination to peace before there can be any real foundation to hope for it i know nothing in the world could have been a greater step to form this inclination in the minds of all parties than the vehemence with which her majesty has been pleased to recommend it in her speech it is a call from heaven by the mouth of the queen and doubtless her majesty was inspired from thence to move that particular article of her speech with so much uncommon earnestness that those whoever entertained any thoughts of her majestys being bast by a party might see their mistake that the party themselves who began too much to depend upon her patronage in their ill designs might be discouraged and that all her people might see her majesty was entirely engaged in the general interest of her peoples good without respect to parties to faction or the private projects of designing people about her  for my part i confess my self surprised with joy to find her majestys eyes open to the general happiness of her people and should take it for a judgment upon the nation if the peoples eyes should remain shut to their own felicity and that feuds and parties should have run us to that extreme that even a healing monarch cannot unite us  it has not been a common thing for the nation to be summoned to unity and peace from the throne evil princes have been shye and jealous of the union of their subjects and maintaining and keeping up the jealousies and animosities of parties has been thought a needful policy to protect the crown but this practice has been a just satyr upon those princes that allowed it as a certain demonstration they had something to impose which nothing but the private feuds of parties could bring them to consent to  the union of subjects is the dread of tyrants for no people in the world would bear the insults and cruelties of encroaching arbitrary princes were not the people themselves divided in interests parties factions and designs it is a token for good to the people of england that the queen however by a sort of men she has been misrepresented and abused has yet this testimony to give the world of her justice and the integrity of her designs that she covets that peace among all her people which some of her arbitrary ancestors have been afraid to bring upon the stage  instead of being afraid of the union of her subjects she is of nothing more desirous than to bring out that blessed article to see all her subjects practicing charity and kindness one to another the reason is plain her majesty having regulated her conduct by the laws and confined her desires to the happiness of her people she can give no testimony of it like this that she covets to see them united in the bonds of love and walking hand in hand in her service  none but tyrants covet to be feared just princes value themselves upon the love of their people  the hearts of subjects are the strength of kings now it is impracticable to have all the people join in duty and affection to their prince while they are embroiled with heat and passions one with another universal love makes universal loyalty no subjects are so true to their prince nor so hearty to his cause as those who are united among themselves and unanimous in their way of living  while therefore her majesty invites all her subjects to union and peace it is a certain indication of her resolved design to govern this nation by the laws and preserve the rights and liberties of her subjects she would else be very unwilling the people should have any endearing conversation among themselves least one time or other they should open their eyes to see the way to liberty and cast off the yoke of their intended slavery but if her majesty calls us to peace she calls us to freedom and lets us know she is far from encouraging the mischievous designs of those who strive to bring in destruction at the door of contention and who are willing to keep up the strife of the people that they might not agree in their own deliverance  i confess my self surpised at this discovery of the royal intentions to peace and union and that i expected not her majesty had yet seen far enough into the malicious designs of that party who designed to engage her on one part of her people against the other and have had many a melancholy prospect of the consequences of a nation divided against her self nor do i know any way in the world to have given that hot temper so universal an overthrow as her majesty has now taken viz to let them know that what ever they may expect from her how much soever they may fancy they please her in running down one party to raise and establish another her majesty is not of their mind the queen knows a better way to hold the balance of parties than to erect any one upon the destruction of another what ever the opinions in religion are they are all her majestys subjects they have all a title to her protection while they behave themselves dutifuly to her person and government reconciling their plrinciples is none of her majestys province as queen and if it were seems but too impracticable but to reconcile their persons make them useful to her self conversible to one another quiet and obedient to the laws and her government this her majesty professes to desire is her resolution and all her peoples advantage  in concurrence with this design it is our business to strive who is the forwardest for peace that her majesty may be convinced who are the incendiaries of the nation mark such as sow divisions let us mark our selves for visible healers of divisions and the contrary will mark the wideners of our breaches  as i have undertaken to advance in the behalf of the dissenters that they are the forwardest to embrace this universal peace so i hope i shall not be ashamed to affirm that both their interest and their principles concur to press them to it and i yet hope their practice will not let me nor any one who undertakes the vindication of their cause be ashamed of being their advocate  they cannot be enemies to this reconciliation of parties unless at the same time they have lost their senses and are qualifying themselves for bedlam and i am of the opinion that had a general assembly of all the dissenters in this nation been met together to consider what they would desire her majesty to do for them i mean for them particularly as dissenters they could have thought of nothing more material to them and the whole nation than a cessation of this party strife and a civil union with all the rest of her majestys subjects  what else had they to ask their properties are secured by the law their religion by the tolleration and both reassurd by the queens repeated promises to continue them they could have nothing more to ask but that her majesty would do what in her wisdom she should find conducing to a general peace and union of affection between them and those people from whom they were obliged to dissent in point of religion  this her majesty has done without their application and i think the dissenters cannot answer it to the sense of their own interest if they do not make public acknowledgment to god and her majesty for so remarkable a mercy  had we beaten the french fleet at sea or had any more than ordinary advantage over the nations enemies been obtained we should and reason good have made a day of public rejoicing and thanksgiving to god for so great a blessing and by addresses of congratulation complimented her majesty upon that head  this is a victory over the worst enemy the nation has an enemy the most fatal and most formidable of any in the world contention is the devils generalissimo that has always led on the infernal troops to invade the peace of this unhappy nation her majesty has given an overthrow to the grand army of hell and dispersed the numerous squadrons that were embatteling themselves against the general quiet and who verily thought they had the queen on their side  it remains for all her subjects to pursue the flying troops of this defeated army and to destroy and remove all the little foundations of party feuds fears jealousies reproaches and raillery that blow up the grand flame of discord in the nation  would all parties fall in heartily with her majestys command a general kiss of friendship and reconciliation would pass through these three kingdoms the wolf and the lamb would lie down together peace would smother all the remains of enmity and the seeds of dissension would dye in the earth and spring up no more  and that i may not seem to press my readers to think of what i cannot direct them how to do i think it not improper to say this work is not difficult it is easier to agree than to fall out if men were all inclined to peace  i shall not pretend in the short compass of these sheets to draw a full scheem of a project of peace among the general parties nor unless i were directed would i engage in any thing so nice having no need to feel the further resentment of those who may no more be pleased with the project than they are with the person but i will venture to touch the preliminaries and tell the people of england how they may begin i will put them into the road in which if they please but to go on straight forward as they say they cannot fail to arrive at the port of peace  not at all to concern matters of religion and opinions about worshipping god with our civil affairs and common charity leaving all people freely as now the laws do to the dictates of the spirit and the conduct of their consciences  religion is a matter of peace the ways of god are ways of pleasantness and all his paths are peace which though it means speculative peace yet i may apply it here there is nothing in religion which has a tendency to sour our tempers ruffle our conversation or disorder our lives as to converting one another the scripture is full of rules to direct us to act in that by the power of persuasion even reproof is to be done with the spirit of meekness says the apostle and rebuking one another in love and provoking one another to love and to good works and if the scripture were silent in the case the reason and nature of the thing seems to imply that all coercive methods are vain as well as unlawful as to conscience  experience might convince those sons of violence who are for persecution of their neighbors that it has been a fruitless war and if we were to examine how many converts to the church have been made by such measures i doubt they can give but a slender account of the fruit of that method whereof the whole church is now ashamed i say ashamed for that in the preamble to a late bill for the preventing occasional conformity it is there owned that persecution for conscience is contrary to the principles of the christian religion and to the doctrine of the church of england  i avoid all the just examples i could give of the irregularities and oppressions the dissenters have suffered under on this head that i may begin with my self and bury the remembrances of violences and ill usage in this new resolution of peace which we are all invited to by her majesty and which i hope all the dissenters in the nation will be the most forward to accept  but as to future conduct let matters of religion be things of serious choice but not of violence and debate we may differ but not quarrel we may dissent without censure and uncharitableness they may conform without envy and reproach honest men should agree with honest men of whatsoever opinion they may be and not with knaves whatsoever party they take a little charity sown on good land would produce a huge crop of peace and even grace it self planted in a soil barren of charity sours and grows morose  what has religion to do with politics honest men of all persuasions are honest men and knaves are the worse the more pretense they make to religion we should not have a tenth part of the differences in state affairs did not church matters and statematters mingle so much together  the law has placed the administration in the hands of the church and though there has been a thousand reviling pamphlets that have accused the dissenters of repining at it yet not one dissenter can be charged with a design to alter it let but peace and moderate principles possess the men of government the dissenters were always content and ever will be pleased to have the power rest in the hands of the church and where this peace and moderation is not i believe all men will grant me that the principal qualifications for government are wanting  it is nothing but the want of this peace and moderation which has made the matters of religion and government clash and the whole nation fall out about them and if any man shall attempt to prove that this contentious spirit has been on the side of the dissenters i think i may not be taxed with arrogance if i say i can easily consute him  but however it has been for peace never recriminates i shall adventure in the name of the dissenters presuming upon their universal consent and with the consent of some of the most judicious among them to make their adversaries this fair challenge  let the sincerity of the peaceable spirit be tried by the consequence the queen has made a general invitation to peace and union and we accept it let her majesty now see who are her most loyal subjects who are greatest friends to the general interest and the truest lovers of their country by distinguishing among them who have most regard to her earnest recommendation and who are really and unfeignedly of peaceable tempers and principles and who are not who are most for peace and union who readiest to obey their sovereigns command who honestest to their own pretenses the high churchmen or the dissenters  if this challenge would be accepted if persons deputed by both parties were to meet how easy would it be to settle conditions of mutual society agreement of parties and general charity in the whole nation which whoever would break should be hist out of all conversation contemned by all sides and no body care to speak to him  all this might be done and religion never be concerned in the matter the concerns of conscience would be a class by it self and never make a rupture in our civil society men would be gentlemen as well as christians and the union of conversation and interest would make a little heaven in the nation  we should no more be cutting of throats about religion and sending one another to the devil for not going to heaven our own way  this would be the shortest way with the dissenters and sachavrells bloody flag would be a fool to it  this would make us be dissenters and no dissenters and there would be a conformity in civil ceremonies though there was none in religious  this would bring the christian and the englishman to understand one another who have been a long while at variance  this would make the devil out of love with the climate and people would get to heaven with the less interruption  in a word twould be a strength to our millitary power a glory to our civil and a luster to our religious twould make the nation invincible the laws impregnable trade increase religion flourish the queen victorious and the people happy  finis
