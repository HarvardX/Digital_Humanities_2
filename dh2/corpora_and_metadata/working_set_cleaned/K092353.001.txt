younger preface i am well aware that some of the earliest letters to be met in this collection will at first glance appear too trivial for publication and that persons who limit their perusal to them will be apt to pronounce unfavourably of the whole i therefore think it necessary to assign my reasons for including them and at the same time give a short account of the work in general  these letters are truly what they are announced in the title page genuine the lady to whom they were written entrusted me with the publication on my first perusal of them i thought they contained matter much too good to be lost the moral lessons wherewith they abound being chiefly calculated for younger minds i took the liberty in my proposals to recommend the work as a proper companion to the time of education in both sexes those letters which contain critiques on many celebrated writers appeared to me not unworthy the notice of men of reading and erudition i revised and transcribed those on homer in particular with the original and popes translation at my hand and can at least venture to affirm there is a great deal of new in mr prestons remarks i declare with great truth that i have his reputation at heart more than my own emolument and therefore hope for his sake my weak judgment may not be called in question  my motive for retaining those initiatory letters which seem less consequential were partly in hope that they might have the same good effect on other pupils which they had on his it may be objected that they contain rules which are to be found in every french grammar granted but to use a maxim of our writers may not a precept or two scattered in this light epistolary manner have more force than all the formal documents that ever were penned what has been may be i am a witness that his pupil profited excellently by this mode of instruction i therefore think the insertion of them cannot be wholly useless beside that it gives an opportunity of admiring that kind and easy pliancy with which a man of learning and genius descended to the level of a puerile comprehension  i lament that it has not been in my power to obtain a sight of the young ladys letters we have her tutors word for her being possessed of good sense and a quickness of apprehension her remarks therefore could not but be entertaining if not instructive inasmuch as they came pure and genuine from the heart unsophisticated with casuistical reasonings or pedantry of expression he frequently mentions the pleasure her letters afford him unfortunately they are all wanting she had the affliction to lose her friend and instructor when he was many miles distant from her and all attempts to recover his papers proved fruitless  to account for the endearing terms in which the tutor sometimes addresses his pupil be it known he was her godfather and his unremitted attention to the improvement of her mind demonstrates how conscientiously he regarded that important office he undertook at her baptism which is too often by the generality of mankind as iniquitously neglected as it inconsiderately assumed  for the gratification of such readers as wish to be more nearly acquainted with mr preston i have prevailed on the lady to sketch his character which i hereunto subjoin  i have little more to say i mean to give an useful work to the public should i fail in my judgment my intention at least is good and however weak my abilities may be i have this comfortable reflection that they are dedicated to a moral purpose to which important end i wish that all my little labors should conduce as most suitable to my inclination and most consistent with my profession  letter to the editor you ask me for a character of my revered mr p you tell me i must hasten for that the publication is in great forwardness alas what a task have you given me already have i suffered extreme pain on a reperusal of his letters which since his death i have never dared to look into till you encouraged me by saying they might be of the same service to others which they had once been to me flattered by this opinion i ventured to read them again all my affection all my gratitude all my respect awakens but all embittered by the recollection of my loss he lives and dies to me again on this review of what i owe to him i am now less equal to the task you require of me than i was when i first delivered the papers to your hands i then deferred writing what you wished through a consciousness of incapacity and a shame at delivering my sentiments intentionally to the press that consciousness that shame is now absorbed in my fears for the sacred reputation of my beloved teacher what will an idle a dissipated public say of these valuable letters should they be treated with scorn or even disrespect i shall never forgive myself is it not possible that persons without a tithe of his understanding his education or his virtue will set themselves up for condemners of his sense his literature and his morals have not i trespassed on the duty i for ever owe his memory in running such a risque my motive must be my apology and if the departed know any thing of the actions of survivors he will know i mean but to pursue his own plan of doing as extensive good as my power will let me to that public who will shortly receive them i can only say the favored individual to whom they were addressed owes all the little merit you and her other partial friends have ever ascribed to her under heaven to the lessons she received from the author of these letters naturally petulant capricious obstinate he knew with happy art how to turn even her failings to account and skillfully used even the curvings of her temper as instruments to the improvement of her mind the letters truly are what you have announced them genuine the writer was a gentleman of an ancient and honorable family once of affluent fortunes the name you have adopted in lieu of his own indicates the misfortune of his life he was accounted a man of the first sense among men of sense his education was complete his literature deep yet polished his taste nice yet not cavillous if i may use the word his wit was as sound as his judgment and as sweet as his manners his humor was infinite and harmless as it was pleasant this was his character from men of standard judgment for it is not to be supposed that i at any time could be capable of understanding this part of it much less at sixteen at which age i had the unhappiness to lose him but what i have repeated is no more than i have heard often asserted by persons of established reputation for skill in what they spoke of but his heart  to describe that is properly my province yet how shall i be equal to it pious as a primitive christian cheerful in the same degree he was pious benevolent in the most extensive sense of the word beneficent as far as a limited power would let him mild in his censures strict in his actions charitable in thought word and deed merciful even to an infect kind not only in intention and act but his very address was kindness pourtrayed yet was he to use his own words speaking of mrs k very resentful if he conceived himself slighted a strong trait of his character was the pliancy with which he yielded to his fallen fortunes and the unyielding spirit with which he supported an independence in despite of them if it would not appear too fanciful i should say he united in his temper the poetical descriptions of the ivy and the oak the misfortune hinted at owing to education and the principles of his family early imbibed in the youthful part of his life depriving him of the means of providing for a family equal to their birth and his spirit kept him a single man my father and himself involved in the same cause and the same consequences were the most intimate friends he prevailed on mr p to take charge of me as a godchild an office he held so sacred that he never took it on him but for me and from that time he looked on me as his own and i am sure felt all the affection of a father for me nor did i ever feel the loss of one my own dying while i was an infant till i lost him  thus have i endeavored to fulfill your request and be assured that neither my affection or my gratitude have impelled me to flatter the character of a man whose worth exceeds the power of words that the precious deposit i have committed to your care may meet with such a reception as the gentleness of your own heart and the goodness of your intention induces you to think it will is at present the most fervent wish  of dear sir etc p s such of your readers as are inclined to judge liberally will allow for the plainness of the style in a correspondence with a girl from seven years old to sixteen he strove to be plain in order to be quicker understood and the rather as some of his subjects are abstruse but the definition the illustration the lesson the sentiment the moral are equally good as if dressed in a more lifted style they may be considered as mr p himself says of creechs horace a wholesome pill without any gilding    genuine letters letter i mr preston to miss nancy blisset dear nancy i was just now at your mamas who was gone out so i dont know how you got to w   or whether she has heard from you it is to be remembered here that the pupil was at this time just turned ten years of age which accounts for the tutors descending in his style to the comprehension of a child   i send you here enclosed a craftsman there was at the time of this correspondence as great a contest between high party and low court and country as we have now between majority and minority this excited the young ladys curiosity which it was the tutors rule never to thwart he hoped also to turn this curiosity to account and by feeding her vanity give her a taste for history particularly that of her own country  all the political papers of this day are but indifferent however i would not be worse than my promise besides the articles of news may divert you  pray let me know if you got safe to the country and if you had any adventures by the way he wished to give her a habit of making observations and reflections on every occurrence to prevent things sliding off her mind and by encouraging her to transmit them to paper help her to develope her own ideas and form a style  worth noticing be sure to write to me give my humble service to your aunt how does she do  i allow you to write the first letter you send me in english if you please i shall write you in french the next time and send you an exercise  i am dear nancy your affectionate friend j preston london july         letter ii ma chere nannette jay receu votre lettre par le post dhier mais cest sans datte je vais toute a lheure en campaigne ou je resterai jusqua mardi a mon retour je vous marquerai les petits defauts dans les traductions que vous avez fait en general else sont fort bonnes et je les ay lu avec beaucoup de plaisir it was mr p  s constant method to use more praise than blame since from the turn of his pupils disposition he found he got credit for the latter in proportion as he bestowed the former and she generally stopped short if she found the balance on the wrong side   faites mes compliments a madame s   jay done votre lettre a votre mere  je suis votre tres sincere ami j preston a londres ce    de juilett      letter iii dear nancy i have the pleasure of yours of the   th current i have not yet got time to look into the translation to see if it is done right  pray translate the enclosed passage a passage from the english telemachus to be rendered into french  not at once but take two or three different times to do it in and study it well for the french is very nice which i shall send as soon as you have finished the translation  why do you begin words with a small that ought to be begun with a great letter pray learn to write in a fashionable way  give my hearty service to your aunt we have no news  je suis tous jours ma chere nannette votre ami tres affectione this little mixture of the languages in one and the same letter is frequently repeated and seems purposely done to make instruction sit lighter on his pupil and coax her rather than compel her into learning and undoubtedly proves the tutors knowledge of human nature see a sketch of her disposition given in the notes on the last letter  j preston july         letter iv dear nancy i have sent you the original of your two translations there are differences between them that i dont think much of but pray observe the nicety of the french in using the pronouns du dela de en and so forth observe too that you use the singular for the plural and sometimes the plural for the singular you will fall eternally into this error unless you will fix the conjugations of verbs in your head pray examine the translation by the original word by word and study the reasons of their difference by this means you shall become more a mistress of the french in six weeks than you have been in all all your time hitherto the leisure the country affords and the little avocation you have there afford an excellent opportunity for this  why do you say i set you long tasks i do not i bid you take time and dont fatigue yourself perform them a deux ou trois reprises ou a combien vous le voulez mais ayez guard de les fair tous jours soigneusement  i design to translate for your use the history of nonchalante babellarde and finette not only for the sake of the french but for your conduct in life they deserve to be got by heart and printed deep in your memory though they seem to be written only for young children this is another instance of the tutors knowledge of human nature this little compliment thus judiciously thrown in serves at once to encourage her and to excite her farther emulation it is also a proof that whatever book she read he always directed her search toward the moral  yet they contain a most excellent moral when you are going to do or say something that you are in doubt if it ought to be said or done consider whether it will be like nonchalante or babellarde or finette but i am afraid that you will begin to think i am a babellarde so i conclude in assuring you that few people love you better than dear nancy  your faithful friend j p faites mes compliments a madame votre tante london july         p s i dont wonder at the great difference between your translation and the original in telemaque because the english is so different from the original but you will observe the real faults i herewith send another test of your abilities    letter v dear nancy i received yours of the   th which is worse writing than any of your former letters you dont point out the place in telemaque from which you took the second translation in yours but i can scarcely read it you have so strong an inclination to write the initial letters of your name small that you do it always to your mama and to me sometimes namely in your last  i observe with pleasure a good deal of the genius and true turn of the french language in your letters and translations but you neglect the most common things namely the spelling the construction and regimes des verbes pray dear nancy correct that and learn to dispose your letter in a handsome manner  you translate too much at a time do a little at once and do it well take more care of your writing and learn to point  i go to the country this afternoon and return on monday when i expect to find one from you  vous etes trop empressee ma fille decrire beaucoup a la fois ecrivez moins et avec plus de soin faites mes compliments a madame votre tante et soyez persuade que  je suis votre fidelle ami j preston a londres ce    de juillet      p s je vous envoyerai une critique sur votre derniere lettre dans la mienne de lundi encore je suis a vous    letter vi dear nancy i have been out of town since saturday at my return i got your letter but it is neither dated nor pointed i am glad to find the spirit of the french language in your letters and translations and they grow better every time you write but as i told you before you neglect the modes tenses numbers construction and regimen which are as it were the very rudiments of the language then you write with so heavy a hand that one would think you rather used a gravingiron than a pen  i have sent you on the other side of this sheet your translation of the last task i set you with the original opposite to it i would have you my dear consider it word by word not only for the grammarpart but likewise to learn the true idiom of the french and the difference of that from the english i shall only trouble you with one example we say he put his affairs in good order the french say he put a good order to his affairs you will see in your translation you have followed the english idiom be it remembered and allowed for in the midst of all these idioms that mr p  being a scotchman falls into many idioms even in his own english   i shall continue this subject in my next in the mean time i assure you that your letters give me very great pleasure  adieu ma chere nannette je suis votre etc j p london aug        p s i send you another task which i have translated nearer to the french idiom than the former that it may be the easier run into french when you undertake it  faites mes compliments a madame votre tante  encore une sois adieu   letter vii london aug        my dear nancy my last was by thursdays post i received yours yesterday in which you excuse the faults of your translations by pleading that they are not committed through carelessness but surely you dont look into your grammar else you would spell more correctly and observe the differences of the numbers and tenses better  your letters and translations give me great pleasure there is something so much of the french turn in them  they are only the most common things which you oversee you spell english as well as a man of learning does and much better than the most part of your sex i would have you as perfect at spelling french i dont expect that your translations should be equal to the original how can that be when the translation that i send you and which you are to render again into the original is so widely different from the original itself but then i would have you observe the difference nicely as it would make a lasting impression on your mind i would have you make some paper up in different folds then write your own phrase on one side and the french original on the other if the difference is worth noticing for instance in this manner  you say le soin de sa famille lui chagrina le plus  the original ce que linquietoi le plus cetoit le soin de sa famille  yours is not bad french but then the other is better if you will take this method it will infix the most proper and elegant expression deep in your mind  i shall detain you no longer having many letters to write i have enclosed another paper than i used to send you though it bears the same name because it is more diverting than the former i shall set you no task today for i would not choose to oppress you i am just going to your mamas that if she thinks fit she may add a postscript  the weather is not more uncertain than the rumors we have of peace and war  adieu ma chere nannette je suis a vous etc etc j p p s you should add now and then a postscript to your mother for you should not be guilty of so much as the appearance of neglect to her    letter viii london aug        dear nancy i received yours of the  th instant i am charmed with the translation it is the best you have done and much better than i expected it is impossible that it can be so good french as that of so great a master as mons perrault but by setting them in opposition you see the difference and if you will mind it and keep the copies that you may have recourse to them on occasion i do not know a better way to attain to the purity of the french language  in your letter you say la consideration de cela que vous fair pardonner etc instead of que vous fait pardonner and so on in many instances using the infinitive for the imperfect of the indicative mood ma tante vous fair les compliments for vous fait these mistakes are so obvious that nothing but carelessness she has endeavored to exculpate herself from the charge of carelessness yet here she is again arraigned for it probably she was unconscious of it she did not mean to be inattentive and was only hurried on by early warmth and wished if possible to attain the essence of learning without the necessary forms that lead to it such instances are not uncommon can make you fall into them vous ne devez pas vous pleindre de peu de capacite parceque vous lavez belle et bonne et vous en etes bien redevable a dieu  you should carefully remark the principal differences between the french and english manner of speech this is what we call different dialects it is impossible to enumerate them they are so many but the greatest arise out of these particles ou en du des de etc when we would say a thing is generally reported we use this indefinite expression it is said or they say the french say on dit we say at that time they say du temps we say in europe they say of europe we say i have got a fever they say a fever has taken me then the use of a or de before the infinitive is very hard to be distinguished without great care as you will see by comparing the last translation with the original in like manner the difference is difficult between en and dans when the adverb ne is to be used and when not we say he is richer than you think etc the french say he is richer than you dont think then we have an auxiliary verb which they want and which adds great force and energy to our expression on some occasions and that is the verb do when we aver a thing with vehemence we say i do say so  i do think so this is much stronger than to utter simply i say so  i think so you may observe the force of this auxiliary do in many other expressions  nannette adieu jusqua jeudi et faites mes compliments a madame votre tante j p p s i shall defer sending you your last translation and perraults original till thursday    letter ix london aug        dear nancy on the other side you have your translation and on the next the original pray mark the difference for though yours is much better than i expected yet you will find in the other a shorter way of expression my transation which was impossible to be made iterally from the french has occasioned a greater difference between yours and the original french than would have been otherwise besides though you sometimes use words different from the author that is nothing your words have the same meaning  you will observe you sometimes mistake he gender i shall only notice two intances you say rien de si indolente uetoit nonchalante the author says rien de fi indolent your mistake is you hink indolent agrees with nonchalante and therefore you put it in the feminine gender but it agrees with rien and so should have been in the masculine  the next thing is you say le meme longeur du temps this is a stiff expression besides it is an anglicism we say the same length of time but the french say assez long temps moreover this expression is so natural and usual that i wonder you endeavored to find out another  i have no more faults to find only in the spelling but the translation is so well in the main that i will send you some little present for it  i hope to hear from you tomorrow how you like baron tomlisons speech inserted in a craftsman you have never acknowledged the receipt of any of those papers  adieu ma chere nannette jusqua samedy j p  letter x london aug         dear nancy i have the pleasure of yours of the   th instant which is still better than any of the former only you forget to spell aright you say vous me traiter instead of vous me traitez ceci vous trouverai instead of ceci vous trouvera the french is exceeding well but observe you write jay receu chaque papier vous mavez envoye this is an anglicism for we say i have received every paper you sent me instead of every paper that you sent me but the french do not so it should have been chaque papier que vous mavez envoye  i have not been abroad since saturday being confined to the house by a great cold i have sent you on the other side the rest of babillardes character i want to know how you do and how you pass your time mr preston among his other attentions to his favorite scholar used much to endeavor at impressing on her mind an idea of the value of time and wished her to be continually employed sports and recreations he called employments in their turn especially when earned by application to more serious affairs but sheer idleness he used to say in the scottish dialect the human mind should think shame of which you may write in english and at length  when i can go abroad i shall remember what i promised your following tasks shall be shorter than the former that you may consider them well and not be hurried in point of time i am with my hearty service to your aunt ma chere nannette  a vous j p p s you will observe that the translation herewith sent is very near the french idiom this i did to make it more easy for you when you return to town i would have you try to put these translations into more proper english we come next to the character of finnette which i shall divide into three small tasks a sin que vous vous en acquittier a votre aise et avec plaisir    letter xi london aug         dear nancy i have the pleasure of yours of the  0th and showed it to your mama who was writing to you in the mean time but i suppose her letter dont reach you till this night  you certainly do not remark the differences between the original and your translation or you would not fall so often into faults which are so obvious you frequently mix substantives and adjectives of different genders together and nouns and verbs of different numbers i have reproved you twice for that word mis which you use both in the singular and plural number and yet you have it twice in the last translation  i remarked to you formerly that you used the perfect time when the imperfect was more proper and if you had but compared the original with your own translation you would have found it as i said you are to observe as i told you before when you speak of a particular thing done some time ago you should use the perfect but when you speak of a thing usually done the imperfect for example  elle mettoit lordre dans la maison du roi that is she used to do it but when it is only a peculiar action done once or at a certain time  elle mit lordre etc  observe also that they do not use the word avec in france in so extensive a sense as we do with in england what we translate into with is sometimes a sometimes de in french as the true idiom of a language is generally the last point which is learned and requires a greater degree of comprehension than is necessary for understanding a plain grammatical rule i hope this passage will not be deemed too trifling to have been retained it is possible that a young mind might receive a deeper impression from meeting a rule thus in the course of a letter than in the formal mode of instruction remark too they say la cadette de ces deux we say the youngest of the three the sense is the same though the expression is somewhat different for cadette signifies properly one that is younger le cadet for example is the younger brother whereas cadette in this place implies the sister who was younger than the other two  when they talk of any thing that we learn they use scavoir instead of pouvoir as you may see in the original and it is worth your observarion  i cannot say but the translation has the true spirit of french in it for this reason it vexes me to see you fail in the commonest things i shall not trouble you with a new exercise till saturday that you may consider what i have remarked in this and my fomer letters with care and diligence  je suis votre ami j p  letter xii london aug         dear nancy i have the pleasure of yours of the   th i have not yet seen your mama when i do i shall deliver her your letter  i shall not dispute your care but there is a wide difference between taking care and taking due care we may exercise a great deal but if it is not rightly conducted it may be very unprofitable if you would survey your verbs with attention you would not write liser for lire nor ils etoit for ils etoient these errors would never happen if you were as circumspect as you ought to be i do not expect that you should fall upon the best phrases in the french language that is impossible but when you compare the originals with your translations you should do it with so much accuracy as to imprint the french phrases and idioms strongly on your mind remember what i wrote to you about the exercise the character of finette on the other side when you lay that and the original together you will have a good opportunity to remark the different use of the perfect and imperfect tense  i have got gil blas to divert you when you return to town if you are very anxious to see it and are to stay some further time in the country i will send it by the coach  i was far from well when i wrote last and rather worse on sunday but have been prevailed upon to take a medicine and am now much better  they talk warmly of putting more ships in commission and raising additional forces as if there were to be an invasion and the pope the devil and the pretender french tyranny and arbitrary government were all ready to burst in upon us and at one sup to eat us up as the dragon of wantley devoured the three poor children the antiministerial people however say that all this noise is only like crying boh to make a child quiet and that the poor children three are england scotland and ireland whom they want to make lie quiet till they tie them down in their cradle and rock them fast asleep dont you remember when i used to frighten you with the fox nancy this is just such another farce if you will believe our patriots as they call themselves but we must not trust them too far for they are thought to be dissatisfied if not disaffected and some of them even suspected to be jacobites  and love their country notwithstanding  but how can that be  well these things are above our ordinary capacities and so well even let them alone  ne lisez vous quelquefois la saint ecriture nannette il y a des chooses tres dignes de votre attention malgre tous ces fous qui sen mocquent  give my humble service to your aunt bon jour mademoiselle  letter xiii london sept        dear nancy you still continue to use the singular verb for the plural is not this negligence in the highest degree these little faults apart the translation is admirable by far the best you ever made and you improve in every one i grant it is your application to write fine french that makes you neglect common things but then it looks ugly to see such good french defective in the very first principles that a beginner would be ashamed of i do not think il causoit for il faisoit good french pray observe the arangement of the original and compare it with your translation you say il fit linfidelite de cet homme de retomber  they say il fit retomber linfidelite etc hence you may remark that they put as few words as they can between the infinitive and the verb that governs it after fair they never use the particle for example je le ferai entrer and not dentrer or a entrer  on the whole your translation charms me and the faults are but like a little mole or two on a fine face i shall give you but a very short task this day  i can promise you vast pleasure in the reading of gil blas it is worth observing how nicely mr preston slides in another author and lays it before his pupil as if with a view to her amusement only by this means instruction wears the face of kindness and while he fixes her attention on the pleasure of the story and the utility of the precept he insensibly advances her in the knowledge of the language  it is both instructive and pleasant and very pretty french i thought it might divert you now and then in bad weather  i commend you much for accustoming yourself to read the psalms and chapters for the day as the psalms are a piece of the finest poetry in the world as well as of the most divine and exalted devotion and as you have a taste for poetry how admirably does this excellent man lead her to a love of religion and while he flatters her vanity in allowing her to have a taste for the great beauties of the divine poetry he at once excites an attention which is most likely to awaken or even form that taste and obliges her to employ so much more time that the principles of piety may take root which by a cursory reading might make but little impression on so young a mind  and like every body who has a taste must have some preferable passages in all authors i should be glad to know which are your favorite psalms i will acquaint you afterward which were mine when i was about your age and which remain so still  j p  letter xiv london sept        dear nancy i have the pleasure of yours of the  th instant your translation is admirable it outdoes all your former outdoings as our laureat says colley cibber esquire there are only two things scored which you will correct yourself so i shall not speak of them  i give you till this day sennight to translate the exercise i now send i have preserved the french air and idiom as much as i could to lead you by the hand as it were to translate it well  madame votre mere se port passablement bien madame m  elle et moi nous dinames ensemble hier chez elle madame m  vous faite bien de compliments le temps commence detre un peu rude ne serez vous pas de retour bientot tout le monde de votre connoisance a grande envy de vous revoir  you cannot imagine my dear nancy whar pleasure your choice of the psalms gives me they are every one my own favorites every one without exception but then i had some more such as the             0                 0      but especially the             the   th is also a fine psalm but i would have you read them in the bible and not in our prayer book the style is much nobler in the bible that translation being far better than the other  the book of ecclesiastes is the properest book i know to be read for making a true judgment and estimate of human life and the things of the world and the book of proverbs and the wisdom of jesus the son of sirach in the apocrypha contain the wisest precepts for the conduct of private life we may observe in this place and indeed throughout these letters how strongly mr preston inculcates the maxim that a servent piety is the necessary and indispensable qualification of a wise welllettered and a polished mind   i am my dear nancy yours j p  letter xv dear nancy this is chiefly to cover the enclosed from your mama i am afraid you are ill that you have not wrote to me these two posts but perhaps you have been busy or visiting or diverted with company however that may be i shall be uneasy if i dont hear from you tomorrow  hier au grand matin don thomas giraldino lambassadeur despagne

xvi oxford july         there has not been any loss of the tutors letters to occasion this great chasm in the dates he was in town with his pupil and the instruction was carried on in person during this interval he grounded her in english and french and made her acquainted with such easy writings as he judged necessary to train her mind to a knowledge of higher authors how far she profited may be seen from those which he proposes for the subjects of their letters in this renewal of their correspondence  dear nancy nothing has happened since i saw you worth writing we set out yesterday morning at a quarter after four and arrived here this evening at a quarter before eight heartily weary of the stagecoach as most people are  i was at church this forenoon and heard a sermon preached before the heads of the university  i hope you will continue to translate and be strict to the same but you must take some liberty in the expression because the idioms of the two languages will not admit of a literal translation you must therefore follow horaces advice not word for word too faithfully translate  in my next i shall begin to make observations upon virgil homer milton or any other author you shall think fit to mention to me for we may vary our subject occasionally and derive advantage from it whatsoever book you are engaged in if there be any point on which you may wish to have my opinion i hope you will apply without reserve and be assured i shall always gratify myself when i can oblige you  i give my humble service to your mother and aunt and am  my dear nancy your sincere friend and servant j p  letter xvii oxon sept        dear nancy i received your letter yesternight and am charmed with it it is written with sense and spirit and in an easy familiar style as all letters should be written the writing too is good the lines strait and the paper kept free from blurs or blots these particulars give me pleasure pray persevere in this care and attention good habits are full as easy to be attained and preserved as bad ones the only point is to st out in a right way at first and enter upon it with determination  i would have you by all means purchase the archbishop of cambrays dialogues des morts with the fables and lives of the ancient philosophers they are all bound up together in one volume it is an excellent book and though one would think that you a young girl should have little to do with the lives of old philosophers yet you cannot fail of finding many things which will be of vast advantage to you if you duly observe them you will perceive that even the greatest men were subject to gross failings and follies but the main points to claim your observation are those wise rules and maxims that were established among them some by one some by another and the salutary observations they made of men and things these if you consider them will be of great service to you in the conduct of life  i would have you my dear to read often the proverbs of solomon the ecclesiastes ecclesiasticus and the wisdom of the son of sirach there are few books which i know fit to be compared with them for instructions to make us wise and happy  i would likewise recommend to you the  th  0th   th   th   th and   th satires of juvenal and the  d of persius and that you would think well and often on them  preserve still that goodness and sweetness of temper of which you are so much mistress and that modesty humility and freedom from affectation pride and vanity which without flattery are so remarkable in you persevere unceasingly in affection and obedience to your mother in kindness and compassion to your fellow creatures and above all in the fear and love of god there will be then no danger but that you will find people who will love and esteem you nay very probably even pique themselves on serving you and be proud to be thought your friends and benefactors  let me hear from you often my dear write freely let me always know what you are about and what happens to you i long to hear that you are gone into the country lest you should not be in time to see mrs f  before she leaves it she is a most deserving woman and i could wish to make you acquainted with her an intimacy with a person of real merit is one great blessing of life they who live longest perceive this most inform me when you set out and i will send you a letter of introduction  there is a little book called the duke of rochefoucaults maxims full of excellent observations on the world and human life i would have you procure this little treatise either in french or english as you can best meet with it  adieu ma chere for this time my kind service to your mother and aunt  i am your faithful friend j preston  letter xviii oxford sept        my dear nancy as soon as this comes to your hand pray carry the enclosed letter the gentleman to whom it is addressed and his wife passed through this place the day before yesterday she will be glad to see you she talked very kindly of you and said she had heard a great character of you  she is a person of much worth and good sense if you converse with her freely and naturally like yourself without ostentation or affection you cannot miss to please her  i have heard some of your acquaintance complain that you are too bashful  regard not that  your modesty becomes you be not too pressing to gain applause if you go on in your own way it will come to you uncourted and love and esteem will come along with it endeavor to merit it and the more indifferent you seem about it the more certain you are to acquire it  i have a long letter for you soon so i shall say no more now but adieu ma tres chere  je suis tout a vous j p p s my humble service to your mother and aunt adieu encore my little dear    letter xix oxford sept         my dear i have your agreeable letter of the   th instant and would have answered it before but that i have been gaged lately in a little business which has prevented my writing to you so often as i intended  you want to have long letters from me i want the same thing from you i wish you had been particular about your visit to mr and mrs f  and that you had let me know the subject your conversation turned upon you dont tell me if mr w  has sent the archbishop of cambrays book nor what you think of rochefoucaults maxims but as you are deeply engaged in homer i can easily excuse that  there are infinite beauties in homer and though all translations must in some respects fall short of so great an original yet i think mr pope preserves the life and soul and fire of it in a great degree there is not such a vast warmth and ardour in virgil but then there is such a beauty and i may say loveliness in him as passes all description nor is it possible for the heart of a reader who is ignorant of this original to form any manner of idea of it when you read popes translation you read something like homer himself but when you read drydens translation of virgil you can scarce have any notion or image of his genuine excellencies no painter ever gave more fine and lively expression to a picture or with more exactness and judgment than virgil gives to his descriptions nay if you saw the thing itself represented before you it would scarcely make a deeper impression yet i do not hereby presume to aver that dryden was a poet inferior to pope but he was old and not a son aise when he translated virgil a betexcuse however may be brought for him namely that neither our language nor to my belief any other language in the world can come up to the beauty elegance and energy of the matchless original  though no one can read homer who has any though ever so little elevation of fancy without being charmed with him yet if we are let into his great design the structure and contrivance of his fable the plot conduct and execution of the whole with what the critics call the characters the sentiments diction figures descriptions etc i say when these things are duly known we shall have a much greater pleasure in reading him than otherwise we can possibly attain  if you will read popes introduction to the iliad with care it will prove of great use to you you should also make yourself acquainted with his notes but in order to have a just conception of this style of writing it is necessary to pay great attention to bossus treatise of epick poetry it is commended as the most judicious essay on that subject that ever was written and though it be of little use to us till we are somewhat acquainted with epick poetry yet once dipped into that excellent way of writing it is of infinite service to give us a true taste for it we should experience the advantage of it in a high degree through the iliad the odyssey the aeneid and paradise lost many other epick poems are written which perhaps may as well be let alone as read i except some prose performances such as telemaque tassos jerusalem delivered has been recommended to me well worth reading it was originally written in italian i am apt to think mr preston was not singular in having lived many years ignorant of this beautiful production within the small circle of my acquaintance i have been amazed on quoting tassos jerusalem to find several persons of exquisite taste and lovers of reading utter strangers to the very name it is surely an admirable poem and should be universally known  there is however i am told an old translation of it into english by edward fairfax which i am going to read forthwith a friend on whose taste and judgment i can depend assures me it is an admirable work abounding with exquisite poetry and all the spirit of an original statius who certainly had a great poetic genius wrote an heroic poem in latin called the thebaid but it falls so infinitely short of virgil in some particulars and perhaps in all except in his fire of which statius had a large portion that his poem and virgils are often opposed to each other in bossu by way of contrast so that you may there see close and nice examples of judiciousness and injudiciousness beauties and defects it might be of great advantage to you to have statius and virgil before you when you read bossu that you might immediately consult the originals when any remarkable quotation is made there is some part of the thebaid translated by mr pope but i do not know if the whole is rendered into english by any hand now if you are inclined to read bossu i will send it to you  there are some noble beauties in homer and virgil which i have with great accuracy observed perhaps the chief of them may have been noticed by other people however as they are my own and not borrowed from though they may resemble others i flatter myself they may not be unwelcome to you  to begin with homer we are to consider in the first place what was his design or end in writing an heroic poem abstracted entirely from the tendency of the work  the end this poet proposed to himself perhaps was to procure praise perhaps profit the latter has been too often the case of poets and if the tradition be true that homer was blind and poor it might have been the same with him horace ingenuously confesses of himself paupertas impulit audax ut versus facerem  to wit poverty which is impudent compelled me to write verses yet when we consider the sublimity and almost divinity of homers writings we are surely tempted to think that he was not poor if he was how much is he to be admired and revered who scorned to stoop to low disgraceful subjects by which however he might possibly have obtained an easier and more plentiful subsistence than by producing such a laborious sublime and useful work  it is probable that the aeneid was wrote with a design to compliment augustus caesar and procure his favor allowing this i cannot but think that virgil pleased himself at the same time with the beauty and loveliness of the characters and descriptions he gave us and in the reflection of having endeavored to make mankind better by representing the excellence of virtue and detestability i believe this is a word of mr prestons own coining but the strength and application of it appeared to me to carry the apology with them it cannot be objectionable i presume to any but a caviller a liberal judge scorns on every flight occasion ta make a cold appeal to a dictionary not but in my humble opinion the word though not to be found is very justifiable in grammatical propriety we have placability us well as placable and why not detestability as well as detestable and are not such liberties so long as they do not contradict reason and probability not only allowable but praiseworthy inasmuch as they contribute to enlarge and enrich our language of vice in their distinct colors  you perceive hereby that we are to distinguish between the end an author proposes to himself by his work and that which he proposes to the world the general design and tendency may be equally to amuse and improve mankind the particular tendency to inculcate some useful truth in the minds of those persons for whom the work was chiefly written  virgil founds his subject on the actions and sufferings of aeneas from the destruction of troy till he settled a new empire in italy and the lesson to be deduced from it seems to be the great efficacy of a due mixture of active and passive virtues his aeneas is wise just pious valiant goodnatured patient and firm to his purpose these virtues carry him at last through all his difficulties but his patience and piety seem most important to him this is nicely judicious in the author to make the hero owe his happiness to his unrepining endurance of hardships his implicit submission to the will of heaven and his pious affection for his father his son his friends and his people hence he is beloved of them all and we find notwithstanding his long sufferings he was the peculiar care of heaven  man is not a faultless being virgil therefore did not choose to draw his hero out of nature he has described him with the imperfections of a human being he is very culpable in his behavior to dido this is his great fault but you see the author has judiciously attributed that to him which the greatest of men are liable to and the best of men sometimes fall into aeneas however acted not half so bad a part by dido as david did with respect to bathsheba and uriah and yet you see it cost aeneas very dear and it was not without great grief and anguish of heart that he extricated himself at last supposing the story to be true a man of so much goodness of disposition as aeneas must have had many bitter reflections during the whole course of his life for his behavior at carthage and the fatal event which attended it  dido stands a great example to all ages of the danger and ruin a woman of virtue exposes herself to who ventures to give way though ever so slightly to the first advances toward illicit love to your sex she should be a perpetual warning it is worth your while to set the picture before you we will forget the queen and consider her as more woman we find her struggle with her inclination at first and even swear against giving way to her passion yet she listened with pleasure to every thing aeneas said by degrees she is overcome she then throws off all reserve and shame neglects her affairs gadds about with him from place to place throwing aside all the decorum of her sex and situation rides and hunts with him at length poor woman she finds he is going to forsake her she storms and threatens weeps and entreats by fits now sends a resentful now a submissive message he answers all with respect and goodmanners but at he same time with coldness and indifference this treatment fills her with agony unspeakable rest and sleep are utter strangers to her at length he departs from carthage then she becomes distracted exposes herself to the whole city execrates herself for not having destroyed him his son and herself she then sinks again into complaints and lamentations till she is lost in despair and resolves to sacrifice her life possessed with this horrid determination she becomes outrageous and flies through her apartments with the looks and fury of a fiend devoting him and his posterity to endless torments the presents he had made her then meet her eyes she dissolves into tears at the sight and moans in painful recollection over the happy hours she had passed with him unable longer to endure the variety of torments that surround her she slays herself with a sword which had belonged to the author of them and in the agonies of death throws herself on the rich apparel he had left behind him be it not forgot that in this act of despair she placed the picture it is remarkable that in some capital paintings of the death of dido this very natural and striking circumstance of the picture is omitted by the artists of her lover on the funeral pile thus notwithstanding all her rage and reentment love held the largest dominion over her mind and possessed her o the last  collect the whole and meditate well upon it it nearly behooves you and very one of your sex so to do for be ssured my dear nancy every loose etrayer is pictured in aeneas and every educed woman in dido from the days of virgil to this present hour the etrayer will abandon the victim of his nwarrantable passion and the victim will sink under misery and despair and uch must be the end of every licentious amor yet your unhappy sex will not ake warning though all ages and histoians unite to prove the fatal truth  i have given you a very long letter the story of dido led me so far beyond what i proposed but as it was done with a view to your future safety and welldoing i hope you will not think i have said too much but will treasure up in your remembrance this cautionary admonition of  your very sincere friend j p  letter xx oxon sept         dear nancy the beauties and various incidents in the fourth book of the aeneid engaged me so closely as to make me postpone what i should before have observed namely the tendency of this most noble poem i now come to it  near the beginning of the first book virgil makes this reflection so great a task was it to found the roman empire tantae molis erat romanam condere gentem so it runs in the original and in dryden  such time such toil required the roman name such length of labor for so vast a frame   from which i am of opinion that the immediate and particular design of his work was to imprint on the minds of the romans his countrymen a great esteem for themselves a passionate love for their country and a becoming piety and gratitude toward the gods those gods who had fought for them who had led them through so many dangers and difficulties and after such severe encounters with other nations and even with some of the deities themselves who were enemies to the trojans had at last settled them in that fine country of italy and from small beginnings had enabled them to grow up to such a height as perhaps the world had never seen before nor ever shall again  if this was virgils design and surely it is very probable how agreeable is it to what we find in holy writ jacob says  i have passed over this brook with my staff and now i am become two bands moses tells the israelites that they were the fewest of all people and god had made them a mighty and a strong nation this is in order to excite in them gratitude and piety david in a hundred places mentions the assistance of god whereby from a low and depicable estate he was become great and mighty  i am poor and needy but the lord cares for me  he teaches my hands to fight  a bow of brass is broken by my arms  by my god i shall leap over a wall  he subdueth the people under me  as the lord lives who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity etc  now virgil when he wrote his aeneid seems to have been possessed of the same sentiments as those of david moses and jacob it appears manifestly so by the spirit which runs through his whole work  we find him every where in love with piety prudence patience constancy of mind modesty humanity candor and in short with all that is praiseworthy he has beside a passion for the belleslettres and arts and sciences in general and by his maxims recommends a sober industrious life and contentment with a little rather than we should prostitute ourselves and our principles for gain so that this noble work is not only a fine poem but moreover a complete system of morality  not only the virtues abovementioned are recommended and placed in a favorable light throughout the whole work but their contrary vices are branded with infamy and detestation always hurtful if not fatal to the persons possessed of them the author makes virtue and piety carry people through all difficulties that is in most instances but he has peculiar exceptions he knew too much of the world and of nature to make it always so this would have been contradictory to experience and even his own maxims for he frequently gives us plain intimations that it often pleases providence to do and bring about things which we cannot account for you may remember for instance that at the burning of troy aeneas lost his wife creusa in the confusion he returned and went again through all his dangers in quest of her at last she appears to him and desires him to employ no more solicitude about her for he was never to see her again she adds that such things do not happen but by the will and ordination of heaven intimating that it was the great mother of the gods who had detained her in those parts purposely that she might not be enslaved by the greeks lastly she recommends with great earnestness their son ascanius to his care the common pledge of their love now to ask why a virtuous affectionate couple should be so dreadfully separated and why creusa should perish in troy who had not deserved it by any crime were to ask a presumptuous and an impious question allowing the story to be true it was undoubtedly to answer some great and better purpose intentionally concealed from our weak judgments and this is the lesson which virgil means to give us creusas tender concern for her child is most affectingly natural and the reality has been verified in the deathbed farewell of many worthy wives  will you permit me to digress one moment to mark to you a beauty of this kind in our great dramatic bard our shakespeare in the third act of hamlet when the ghost appears to the prince and his mother in the closet to whet his almostblunted purpose he suddenly breaks from that to a tender concern and compassion for the queens situation but see amazement on thy mother sits o step between her and her fighting soul conceit in weakest bodies strongest works speak to her hamlet this solicitude for the sufferings of one who in life was dear surviving the grave is most inexpressibly beautiful  to return to virgil dont you think nancy that if he had lived since popery came into the world the roman catholics would have said that the mother of the gods detaining creusa meant that the virgin mary had taken her into her especial service  whenever this author makes virtuous persons suffer it is necessary that you should observe he makes them guilty of some fault which naturally brings on their distresses and it is to such fault yon must attribute them abstractedly from their good qualities i shall give you a short instance or two  the hopeful the beautiful the virtuous pallas was killed untimely in the very bloom of his youth so was the charming young euryalus the only joy of his mother as the other was the only hope of his father lausus met also the same destiny the worthy son of an unworthy father  now while you pity them consider they were all three too rash the heat of youth carried them beyond the bounds of prudence they all loved their parents and were beloved by them with great tenderness but that heat and impetuosity rendered them disobedient pallass eagerness made him break his promise to his father the case was much the same with lausus after he had saved his fathers life his eagerness prevented his attending him though often and often sent for euryalus undertook an exploit above his years and that without taking leave of an affectionate mother much is to be learned from these examples for though virgil does not expressly say they suffered on these accounts yet he plainly insinuates it again the impious father of lausus is forced to confess that his wickedness was the original cause of his sons loss and owns it to be a just judgment on him  by these examples virgil teaches us how dangerous it is to fail in a point of duty to parents albeit through the mere frailty of our nature and neither out of contempt nor stubbornness of temper  adieu my dear j p  letter xxi oxon sept         my dear the infinite beauties of virgil have carried me so much farther than i intended that if i can prevail upon myself i shall contract what i have to say further on this subject into a narrow compass though there are so many charms in this glorious poem that i scarce know how to quit it  to point out all the excellencies of the aeneid it would be necessary to repeat the whole poem i will therefore only touch on some of those passages which please me most and are what i judge the chief beauties  in the first book we may remark his meeting with his mother under the figure of a huntress his going to carthage the reception which the queen gave him and her becoming enamoured of him and the artifice which venus used for that purpose  the story of sinon in the second book the return of aeneas to seek his wife his interview and conversation with her spirit and the affectionate care and anxiety he testified for his father his son and whole family are very affecting  how striking are his adventures and distresses through the whole third book but particularly his encounter with helenus and andromache how natural was all that happened on that event the story of achaemenides the cyclopes and the description of aetna  in the fourth book the whole process of the loves of aeneas and dido with their fatal consequences are beyond all parallel all power of imitation  in the fifth the funeral games are introduced in honor of anchises particularly the mockfight of the children called ludus trojanus these are followed by the burning of the ships and behavior of the matrons  the whole sixth book is inexpressibly fine his meeting with dido and their mutual behavior thereon his encountering deiphobus and his father and having the ghosts of his posterity shown him are all most awefully affecting shakespeare seems to have imitated this last circumstance in his macbeth  how well does he describe the joys of heaven and hell and what sort of inhabitants are to be found in each place the chief in heaven are those who have suffered wounds and death for their country priests who have lived a holy life becoming their profession and bards who have written and sung in pious strains not unworthy of the gods intimating that those who prostitute such sublime talents to mean and vicious purposes deserve nor the care of heaven next in degree to these are persons who have employed their life in arts and inventions for the benefit of mankind and such as have distinguished themselves by doing good  in the other state he allots the greatest share of misery to those who when alive hated their brethren herein the writer agrees exactly with what our savior said to peter about forgiving his brother and what is likewise inculcated in many other parts of scripture st john says  he that says he loves god and hates his brother is a liar and the truth is not in him we next behold those who have rejected their parents defrauded their dependants and deceived such as confided in them after which come those who have sat brooding over their gold and refused to share it with the needy those who have sold their country for mercenary ends have wrested the laws and destroyed the constitution and those who have dared to be guilty of adultery or incest to what noble purposes my dear nancy does this visionary scene conduce how admirably has virgils fancy and morality gone hand in hand  do you not admire that charming description in the seventh book of the different nations who came as allies to the war which was impending their behavior habits arms customs how infinitely entertaining and particularly the charming picture of camilla the female warrior and her troop of ladies  the great events in the ensuing part of the work are aeneass visit to evander the conversation and consequences the simple way of life pursued by that old prince the story of cacus and that of nisus and euryalus the praises of hercules the speeches of turnus and drances and the deaths of pallas camilla and lausus what noble fire and spirit does he display when he describes the conflict between aeneas and turnus and how sublime are the sentiments of the latter when he discovers that he had been pursuing a spectre instead of aeneas and again when he is about to expire these my dear nancy are such great and beautiful passages as appear to rise in your estimation the more you consider and the oftener you peruse them  it is worth your while also to observe how humane a man and how fine a gentleman virgil appears throughout his whole work with what pleasure does he dwell on instances of piety paternal love filial duty conjugal affection humanity hospitality and every social virtue with what apparent delight does he speak of a lovely child or a promising youth we see instances of this in his ascanius astyanax euryalus pallas and lausus  he seems to describe with no less participation of joy examples of fond tender parents in aeneas evander creusa andromache amata and the mother of euryalus he instructs us in the knowledge of human nature wherein he was deeply skilled by painting the love and concern for a worthy son in the savage and impious mind of mezentius we may hence derive some very important truths and lessons we learn first that love to our children is so inherent that persons who acknowledge no other claim who feel no other call of nature and who are actually guilty of great faults in other respects still preserve their duty and affection here we learn beside that worth and goodness will always be beloved and admired and extort some degree of approbation even from the most unfeeling heart had the son of mezentius been less deserving probably his father would not have mourned his loss to such excess aeneas not so strongly regretted having killed him nor would virgil have bewailed him in such terms as to use the expression of horace were worth his dying for he lost his life through his excess of virtue he was alarmed with grief and fear at sight of his fathers danger rushed between him and aeneas and preserved his parent by this we are taught another useful truth namely that no fault of a parent can supersede the duty of a child he might have escaped after he had preserved his father but rashness so incident to youth drove him to venture beyond his strength aeneas forewarned him he was deaf to this humane advice and his death was the natural consequence  how finely natural is the interview between aeneas and andromache the widow of hector and mother of astyanax it is worth your while to place them plainly and exactly before you she weeps he stands amazed and can hardly hiss out such is the literal meaning of virgils expression a few words when she has power of utterance she expatiates on many subjects at once she relates the story of her life since the taking of troy then enquires of his then questions him about his son if he was not a promising youth if he did not copy after him and his uncle hector and if he did not take to heart the death of his mother at parting from aeneas she takes leave of ascanius she calls him the very picture of her poor astyanax she discovers the same countenance eyes and hands and that had he happily survived he would have been of the same growth this is the very strength and beauty of nature whose workings and effects are the same in all degrees of life our stations may be different but our feelings are alike  virgil not only dwells upon the duty of children to their parents but even to their nurses to those who have had the care of their infancy he recommends this and exalts the character of his hero at the same time that part of the coast of italy where the nurse of aeneas was buried was called after her name and the pious hero bestowed on her an honorable funeral  how pleasing is the description of annas nurse whom dido treated with the same tenderness as she would her own who was deceased with an intent and busy air laboring to execute the queens orders virgils expression is studio anili that is with that caution and concern so peculiar to her age and office  our author appears also as partially fond of his old men who are good and pious his priam anchises evander and butes priam is the first man to encourage sinon and anchises is the same to achaemenides you see the care and attention which the tutor of ascanius shows his pupil thus virgil paints mankind in every stage and station of life and in all with equal propriety his judgment never fails him  i had forgot to recommend two very fine passages the meeting between alecto and turnus and the story of aeneass shield made by vulcan had i nothing to divert me from this my favorite employ of instructing you my observations should be more copious and distinct but still i hope they are what will be of some use if i have not tired you i will employ another letter on this same subject so difficult do i find it to leave this admirable writer ever desiring you to retain in your mind that it is not in order to make you a critic only to enable you to read these two incomparable poems the iliad and aeneid with pleasure and profit  i am my dear angel tout a vous j p p s i send this by a private hand    letter xxii oxon sept         my dear angel i received yours of the   d instant it gave me more pleasure than i can express your sentiments of particular passages in homer so far as you have read are just and fine and i desire you will give me your thoughts on all the remainder as you proceed homer certainly strikes us more than virgil at first he surpasses almost all writers in loftiness in strength in fire and in a boundless fancy but more of this at length when we come to have him before us and make him our mutual topic though in truth you have prevented a good deal of what i should have had to say on him and will continue so to do as you go on i will now conclude my observations on the aeneid and that in as few words as possible  virgil makes his hero not only do humane offices to his friends his relations and to his nurse but even to his servants his care of the funerals of misenus his trumpeter and palinurus his pilot are instances of this  when he describes a funeral pomp a sacrifice the admission of an ambassador the consecration of a trophy the celebration of a festival the solemnities at declaring war or concluding peace or any ceremonial whatsoever it is not only most beautifully delivered but we may be assured he lets us at the same time into the exact manners and customs of the romans on all such occasions so that delight and instruction go hand in hand  not only every word in virgil is a jewel but they are all so put together that every sentence may be said to represent a string of jewels set to the best advantage and the whole aeneid is so compact one part so connected with another that they tend to illustrate each other in the most striking colors and follow in such natural order and process as renders the whole work beautiful and places it in the most becoming point of sight  it is observable that virgil never uses an idle word although there are some things the purpose whereof we do not perceive at a first reading yet on nearer observation before or by the time we reach the end of the poem we plainly discover it i will give you an instance of this fine address in virgil  he makes his hero not only the greatest character in his work but also the most beautiful and virtuous this is the reverse of homers proceeding who seems to make hectors character the most lovely of his heroes and perhaps both poets were in the right as i shall hereafter endeavor to make appear when we come to compare notes on the greek virgil describes turnus fierce and haughty when he kills pallas he does it with pleasure he insults over him and dispatches a cruel message to his father he indeed sends back the body for this author seems resolved not to make turnus so savage as achilles but spoils him of his armor and puts it on himself together with the gorgeous belt which pallas wore now we should be apt to suppose at this particular crisis that there was nothing more implied herein than that it was customary for great warriors to wear the arms of adversaries whom they had subdued but we find afterward that virgil had a particular use to make of this belt which he had so especially mentioned turnus puts it on and wears it in triumph whereon the poet makes a useful reflection and at the same time gives us a hint of what will follow the mind of man says he elated with prosperity is incapable of behaving with moderation and blind to futurity the time will come when turnus will sorely regret that ever he assaulted pallas  i will break off here lest my letter should be too long and give you one more on this subject  the lines you have quoted as when the moon refulgent lamp of night etc l     to l     are in my opinion the most beautiful in the whole iliad if you remember one night as we were coming through the park after i had repeated to you miltons description of a fine evening i endeavored to give you those but could not recollect them all  adieu my dear j p  letter xxiii oxford oct        my dear your letter of the   th came safe to my hand on the   th i really cannot tell you particularly when i shall be in town but believe it will be some time this month my comings depends on the receipt of some letters from scotland  as you intend to read the aeneid again there are many things that i shall pass over because i would not forestall the pleasure you are to have if you read it with due attention i shall only finish the remark i began about pallass belt  when aeneas vanquishes turnus at the latter part of the poem turnus sues for his life now it was not proper to grant it and the nicety was how to make aeneas who was so famous for humanity and a merciful disposition not comply with the request and yet preserve his own character behold this very belt is made use of which naturally and critically meets his eye at the very instant when his anger begins to relent and his heart to melt he immediately fires with fresh resentment on recollection of the cruel insults which turnus was guilty of when he flew pallas hence a noble indignation resentment and even compassion for the fate of pallas occasions the death of turnus and thus the poet by a beautiful stroke of fancy makes that great event the result of friendship and pity which otherwise had been an act of cruelty we learn also from the instance before us this fine lesson that what people are most proud and vain of is often the occasion of their ruin there is a noble reflection to this purpose at the end of the tenth satire of juvenal all that i have further to say about the aeneid is to point out to you some charming comparisons and then i have done with it this i shall do in my next letter which i propose writing on sunday  i would have you my dear look into the lives of the ancient philosophers and particularly regard their observations made on life they will be of great use to you  you do not tell me what you think of the duke of rochefoucaults maxims and observations  i am now going through ovids metamorphoses anew and the more i read the more i am charmed with it i wonder you do not proceed in that work no man surely had ever so easy so natural so charming a manner of telling a story you love novels ovid has an hundred at least and all of them infinitely beautiful in their way but no more of him at present it will be near a week before i can say any thing to you about homer  adios it is necessary to observe here that mr preston had an intention had he lived to make his pupil acquainted with italian spanish and latin after she was wellgrounded in english and french it is with this view therefore that he occasionally slides in particular words to awaken her curiosity in order to make that instruction wear the air of a gratification of her inquiries rather then the imposition of a task which if formally laid down might appear too heavy and laborious yours most sincerely j p  letter xxiv oxford oct        my dear nancy i wrote to you on the  st instant with a small enclosure which i hope is come safe to hand it will enable you to buy the iliad since you love it so well and furnish you with a little pocket money over and above  you neither write me if you have been to see the lady i recommended again nor how you like rochefoucault nor the archbishop of cambrays lives of the philosophers but i fancy homer engages all your attention at present  i shall conclude all that i have to say about virgil with pointing out some few striking comparisons  in the first book of the aeneid neptune reproving the winds and the waves is well compared to a man of merit and authority speaking to an enraged mob in the fourth dido to a wounded deer  and turnus and aeneas to two distinct conflagrations in different parts of a forest or two torrents pouring down a steep hill when aeneas after the arrow was drawn out with which he was wounded is returning to the place of battle with the whole corpse de reserve while clouds of dust arise and the earth trembles with the beating of the horses feet his enemies struck with terror are nobly compared to husbandmen who see a black storm coming across the sea that threatens universal ruin destroys the trees and lays waste the fruits of the earth the poet makes it still more terrible by one peculiar circumstance which is a whisking wind a certain forerunner of such a dreadful storm as he there describes  aeneas pursuing turnus and not being able to overtake him is aptly likened to a hound pursuing a deer and this is so lively a representation to one who has seen such a chase as nothing can surpass again turnus in his engagement with aeneas when confounded with fear and the bad omens he had met with and persuaded the gods were against him fights indeed but in such a manner as one imagines one does in a dream how forcibly picturesque but read it that exceeds all description  there is however a comparison in milton which is far beyond all i ever read in virgil homer or any where that is the comparison of michael and satan to two black clouds that fill up the different parts of the sky big with thunder lightening and tempest and at last discharge their whole artillery at each other  the last observation i shall make on virgil is that he has been a great lover of what is called the belles lettres we can perceive that be admired painting himself by what he relates of aeneas admiring the paintings in didos palace before he broke through the cloud and by his charming description of aeneass shield you will find too he loved statuary music and architecture and you may discern the same of ovid in a hundred places we see two instances of his skill in the contest between pallas and arachne and beside how nicely he understood the art of weaving arras i am reading him over just now he has so many beautiful stories that i wonder you do not take more delight in him than you appear to do you love novels and i never read any so beautiful as his pyramus and thisbe medea and jason scylla and minos cephalus and procris ceyx and alcyone perseus and andromeda the fable of niobe pallas and arachne the muses and the pierides meleager and atalanta and a hundred more are stories the most exquisitely told that are any where to be found and are withal perfect images of nature you may likewise discern through all how the poet is delighted with whatever is good and virtuous worthy and laudable and on the other hand how he detests all kind vice of and wickedness nay even every degree of rudeness and illmanners  it is clear to me that ovid was not only one of the greatest wits and one of the best of men but one of the bestnatured besthumoured and bestbred gentlemen in the world he wrote indeed with a sort of carelessness and his unhappy banishment hindered him to correct his admirable poem the metamorphoses which has ever since continued the great fund whence sculptors painters and writers of operas and some other dramatic authors have derived their subjects  adieu my dear this is a sight which it is true i saw once and therefore took care never to see it a second time    letter xxv oxford oct        my dear nancy i received your most agreeable letter of the  st instant with infinite pleasure your remarks on homer are most agreeable and just i must only observe that idomeneus assisting a wounded soldier of his own party and insulting an enemy are not at all irreconcilable as to what you call a slip of the poets memory i shall look into the passage and give you my opinion in my next  i heartily agree with you in your censure of homers making his heroes so savage and this brings into my mind a passage of horace aliquando bonus dormitat homerus that is the excellent homer sometimes nods or is like to drop asleep  in allusion to this the great earl of roscommon it is much to be lamented that this excellent writer is not so well known as he deserves to be his works should be as familiar as dear to all men of true taste and principles he shines with double luster forasmuch as he was brave enough to draw his pen in the cause of modest virtue in the licentious age of charles the second in one of his poems speaking of homer says  his bullying heroes and his scolding gods make us suspect he sleeps as well as nods i have much more to say but not time for it at present i leave off unwillingly  je suis ma tres chere le votre j p je scaurois bien dire ce que dit u poet excellent   this little playful condescension to the youthful disposition of the pupil in a man of learning and genius is surely a strong proof of the sweetness of mr prestons temper and the mildness of his heart he still is the instructor though in a more familiar and engaging style we may here discover in a great measure how extensive an education he proposed to give her had he lived since it is evident he had at this time made her mistress of the greek alphabet  a trial of skill for you  unriddle it   hold the question in your last remains unanswered  though juno put on the cestus of venus she still continued juno and jupiter did not take her for venus for she was his daughter but homers poems re full of the mythology of the ancients that is allegorical stories by the ceus of venus are implied those charms and fine accomplishments which make woman lovely juno in fine laid down l her jealous fits her pride her illnare and scolding and put on sweetness and kindness in their stead if i rememer right the poet also says that she dresd after bathing and washing all impureess from her person insinuating hereby how becoming is elegance and cleanliness in either man or woman  encore adieu ma chere je vous souffle dix baisers    letter xxvi oxford oct         my dear i have just now received a letter from you not dated i wonder the books should have cost you so much especially homer but i presume you do not know where they may be cheapest purchased or the bookseller has imposed on you  no matter you have the authors for your constant amusement  you have given me a very particular account how you have laid out the contents of the draught but that was more than i desired i only wished to know how it had been chiefly bestowed not how you had laid out every farthing that had been the exaction of a hard dealer not the liberal claim of a guardian and friend the more prudently you lay out your money the better for yourself and this was all the satisfaction i required i think however you have assigned all that is disbursed to good uses  i shall write again soon  adios j p  letter xxvii oxford oct         my dear nancy the last i wrote to you was short and this will not be much longer it being the fifth letter this day and i am accountable for the dispatch of as many more this post pray deliver the enclosed without loss of time  i hope to be in town this week or the next at farthest but let not that hinder your writing to me as often as you have leisure if you have nothing to write write me that nothing for nothing you can write will be unwelcome and nothing will even be welcome if it look like something in this play upon a word mr preston seems to have had the following line of ovids art of love in his mind or at least is justified by it if there be nothing brush that nothing thence it will show at least a kind attention and that is very valuable  in my next i shall treat about homer and hope to have a letter from you upon that author that is to say a continuation of your remarks this too i flatter myself i shall receive soon  give my humble service to your mama and aunt and believe me to be  my dear nancy your hearty wellwisher and real friend j p  letter xxvii oxford oct         my dear nancy i have the pleasure of yours of the   st instant and am exceedingly pleased to find you have executed all my commissions with so much address and prudence  you need not fear being troublesome to the lady your new acquaintance if you go at proper times observe the disposition the family is in and whether business or any other cause may not make your visit unseasonable which you will easily discover and in that case let your stay be short take care too always to leave a due distance of time between your visits what i wrote you once before i will write again though it becomes almost unnecessary now never give yourself airs nor show affectation nor endeavor to shine as it is called talk modestly within the compass of your understanding and if you dont court praise praise will court you  before i enter upon homer let me observe that you have omitted to mention the figure hector makes at the end of the twelfth book where he breaks through the grecian entrenchments like sudden night and with eyes burning like fire as the poet expresses it this is thought one of the most spirited passages in the whole work it is incomparable in the greek and not much short of the original in the english  i am sorry to tell you that i cannot see you so soon as i expected it will not suit my affairs to leave this place for ten days yet but be sure to write me often in that time that is as often as your other business will allow and let homer be the subject of your letters i will write you as frequently as i can and begin upon the same subject  i have just now entered upon popes preface and essay to see whether some of the particulars i have remarked are not in his observations homer will furnish us matter enough to write about i would rather have you send short letters and often than long letters and seldom  my kind service to your mama aunt and mrs m   i hope to dine with you on my birthday  adieu my dear life i am your real friend and servant j p  letter xxix oxford oct         my dear nancy just now i have the pleasure of yours of the   th you mentioned a passage in the thirteenth book of the iliad which was the last on that subject i am just now reading the observations on the first book i hope to see you on thursday night or friday morning and when i come we shall compare notes i do not mean to be guilty of a pun here though it sounds much like it  i shall go tomorrow to a gentlemans house about twelve miles from this where i shall stay three days and thence set out for london  my intended visit is not the call of business but mere matter of ceremony which you know i am not over fond of yet i think it a kind of duty to comply with it the gentleman was here for a week during which time i conversed with him frequently he is sensible and his character good he pressed me earnestly to give him my company some days at his retreat an earnest entreaty is a warm compliment and as my peculiarity of humor namely a dislike to strangers was my strongest objection i held it incumbent on me by the rule of politeness to submit my own peculiarity to his there are many punctilios which we ought to give way to as brethren of society if a more important claim does not interfere  give my service to the persons mentioned in your letter and write me by next post after that i hope to see you before you will have occasion to write again  i am dear nancy yours most affectionately j p  letter xxx we here see the tutor on his return to oxford after a short excursion to london and it is worth while to draw a parallel between the modern mode of traveling and that which was practiced thirty years ago here were ten hours consumed in getting twentyseven miles and almost two days requisite for traveling from london to oxford had our present expedition on the road been proposed to our ancestors as a possible thing they would probably have derided it as the dream of a lunatic  wickham    miles from london nov         my dear life i went to bed yesternight that is to say this morning about two i was wakened about five and in the coach near half an hour after seven we got to uxbridge before twelve where we took breakfast but i had wisely drank three dishes of coffee and eaten a buttered toast beforehand  we arrived here before five we dined and now after finishing the enclosed letter i write you this desiring you not to neglect the enclosure my health is not clever but i hope to sleep well tonight and then i shall be right again to children and persons advanced in life sleep is a medicine for many ills and surely the pleasantest of all medicines did you ever read shakespeares tragedy of macbeth if not get it and send me your opinion of it i will transcribe his passage on sleep which for the luxuriant variety of sweet and noble images is scarce to be equalled  the innocent sleep sleep that knits up the ravelld sleeve of care the death of each days life sore labors bath balm of hurt minds great natures second course chief nourisher in lifes feast what a group of beautiful images are here nor has the great bard assembled them merely to indulge his fine fancy no they are of a piece with the great action of the scene and answer an important moral end for by how much he endears to us the inestimable blessing of sleep by so much he aggravates the atrocious crime of murder from the commission whereof macbeth is but just returned observe too the first epithet which he gives to sleep innocent it is very copious it not only implies that sleep is innocent in itself that while we sleep we are free from guilt but that sleep most naturally dwells with innocent and undisturbed minds  i have no doubt but i shall dream of you tonight for i have been dreaming of you all day i shall write you again on sunday and include a small missive to mr k  which you will deliver when you think fit give my humble service to your mama and aunt and believe me to be most truly  your friend j p  letter viii oxford nov         my dear nancy i wrote to you from wickham which i hope is come to your hand i have little to say at present only that i am well having arrived here safe and found on saturday about three oclock  i have enclosed a letter to mr k  which you need not deliver till you have occasion for a recruit of cash i shall endeavor to get some franks for you let me know when you meet with a spencer to your mind though i think you have so many books already to read and consider that you need not be over hasty  go on with your observations on the illiad and write to me soon when you sit down to write you should be at leisure have a disposition for it have the subject digested in your mind be in a cheerful complying humor have a good pen good ink and good paper and place yourself in an easy and convenient posture all these things will make you write so as to please and even make the hand itself more agreeable  my humble service to your mama and aunt and be assured that i am  my dear angel your most affectionate and faithful friend j p  letter xxxii oxford nov         my dear nancy i had the pleasure of yours of the   th the next day after it was written i have very little to say at present and believe i should not write at all till another occasion were it not for the pleasure i take in conversing with you and for fear you should think i forget you which i never do  i greatly approve your not going to mr k  till you have an absolute occasion for that was the purpose of giving you the credit you know my dear young as you are i have not scrupled to acquaint you exactly what i hold in trust for you and it would be folly to lavish away in trifles what is meant for material uses besides you would neither have the satisfaction nor advantage that i intend if you were to misemploy your little fortune but i am counselling one who wants no advice in these points my letter of credit is not in force till tomorrow but you did not know that and i am pleased you did not as in that case your postponing your claim had been the consequence of my advice which is now the result of your own prudence purchase the capuchin you mention if you have a fancy for it be the price what it may there is no occasion for a trifling economy in matters which are real necessaries of life to retrench in superfluities is our chief duty and ought to be our constant care were this point generally attended to i believe moderate incomes would go much farther than they do at present  have you made the improvements in your apparel which i recommended have you seen your agreeable acquaintance how does she how do your aunt and mother tell me all that relates to you though in the most distant degree  i am just now going to read a book of the iliad that i may be the better enabled to converse with you on that subject  adieu ma tres chere petite ange et sois bien et assurement persuadee que  je suis votre tres fidelle ami j p  letter xxxiii oxford dec        my dear nancy i should begin this letter with homer and proceed in form and order but i have so many letters to write this day that i dare not venture on it i shall only mark out two or three passages in the fourth book of the iliad which i have just now read and which i think peculiarly fine  the first is at line     as when the fleecy flocks unnumberd stand in wealthy folds and wait the milkers hand the hollow vales incessant bleating fills the lambs reply from all the neighboring hills   the second is at line     as torrents roll increased by numerous rills with rage impetuous down their echoing hills rush to the vales and poured along the plain roar through a thousand channels to the main the distant shepherd trembling hears the sound so mix both hosts and so their cries rebound   these are two fine comparisons and at the same time are noble descriptions i the rather quote them to you because you might possibly pass them over without regarding them so much as you never saw the originals of which these descriptions are a picture but if you had seen them as i have often done being born and bred up all my younger days in a very mountainous country you would own that nothing can be more natural or beautiful  to understand the first comparison rightly it is necessary to know that when the lambs arrive at a certain age they are weaned and put in a separate flock by themselves the ewes are put in folds to be milked that reciprocal desire which the ewes and lambs have to be together makes them bleat incessantly and when within hearing they regularly answer each other those sounds the hillsecho back and fill the whole valleys or glens as we call them in scotland with a very agreeable noise even music is scarcely more agreeable at least to me  how exceedingly fine is the description of discord line  0  small at her birth and rising every hour etc  this is very judiciously placed where he grecians and trojans who were early reconciled dissent again the coloring suits the nature of discord or trife admirably which often arises from very small beginnings perhaps from a mere trifle and to what a monstrous height does it sometimes grow it reminds me of what solomon says the beginning of strife is like the letting in of water for if we will make but a small passage for water to enter at it will itself enlarge it sufficiently we have this expressive proverb in scotland the mother of mischief is no greater than a midges wing that is a gnats wing  intimating how small a circumstance how worthless and inconsiderable may occasion much contention and great mischief  the moral on the whole is avoid strife as much as possible and as the apostle says excellently seek peace with all men  adieu my dearest nancy i am your faithful friend j p p s i forgot to remark to you that the description of the storm and torrents breaking down the sides of the hills in the twelfth book of the aeneid are admirably painted    letter xxxiv oxford dec        my dear nancy i had a letter from you by yesterdays post which gave me great pleasure  i should now begin to explain to you the nature of the iliad the odyssey and the aeneid but i do not know if you have yet made any progress in the admirable treatise on epick poetry by monsieur bossu if you have read and marked him attentively i could omit many things as needless and yet write a great deal more that you would understand and be pleased with but this would not be proper before you have read that complete treatise which unfolds the whole art and mystery of the epick poem  mr pope i think says that the iliad points out the effects of anger the odyssey those of patience and wisdom the effects of anger and resentment are rash mad and foolish actions tending to misery and destruction the effects of patience and long suffering are welladvised actions terminating in the accomplishment of our wishes and leading to happiness horace who knew mankind as well perhaps as any man who lived before or since his time except some few whom we meet in the holy writings says that he who violently hastens his revenge renders the very end he would attain ineffectual the iliad and odyssey are two great examples of the truth of this in the former we see the rage and resentment of achilles and agamemnon frustrate the very design for which they came to troy to wit the destruction of the town what miseries did they not occasion what loss of gallant men and achilles who even got the better in the contest between him and agamemnon paid dear for it in the loss of his beloved patroclus what though he had the satifaction or rather triumph of killing hector a much worthier man than himself yet that did not remove his grief and misery for after that we still find him in the agonies of sorrow so true is it that even when our blind and mad desires are granted we find ourselves as far from happiness as we were before again what did the satisfaction of killing hector cost him in the first place we see he was forced to forego the savage pleasure he took in abusing the body of that illustrious chief in spite of his teeth as we say jove compelled him to forego it he was even obliged to do honor to the corpse furthermore we find his own fate was attached to that of hector hector told him at his death the gods would not let his death pass unrevenged apollo accordingly met achilles at the scean gate and revenged it home and to his utter disgrace made him fall at last by a far less worthy hand than that of hector  i shall take notice of this particular more at length in some following letter all i shall add at present is that it is true we have not such thunder and lightning so great an eclat such bold characters such force such grandeur and majesty in the odyssey as in the iliad yet the archbishop of cambray observes that the ancients at least the best judges and critics of antiquity do not give the iliad the preference i shall not repeat what he says on that head but refer you to his own words they are in the dialogues des morts  adieu my dear nancy i am your unfeigned friend j p  letter xxxv oxford dec        my dear yesterdays post brought me yours of the  th in which your hurry makes you leave out some words and misplace others this i wish you to guard against it is a neglect unworthy of you  before you proceed in the iliad i must beg you to read bossu at least some chapters in the beginning of his admirable treatise they will give you a proper idea of the nature and plan of this and every other heroic poem there is also a short discourse on epick poetry prefixed to the last english translation of telemaque which is well worth your attention though i cannot agree with the writer in preferring telemaque to homer and virgil  i do not recommend these books in order to make you a nice critic but to enable you to read such works as the iliad odyssey aeneid paradise lost and telemachus with greater pleasure and profit you may add to the list tossos jerusalem which i have just finished a fine poem indeed and admirably translated and ramsays travels of cyrus about which we will talk when i come to town  there are several other works some of which you have that will be of great service toward forming a true idea of those noble authors and likewise of all other kinds of poetry such as aristotles art of poetry roscommon on translated verse horace vida and the duke of buckkinghams art of poetry rapins and daciers discourses on eloquence and poetry drydens and popes discourses popes art of criticism the most excellent archbishop of cambrays discourse on eloquence and the spectators on milton congreves letter on humor is also most excellent and judicious so are dr trapps discourses on virgil these writings will give you a true notion of tragedy comedy satire pastoral ode elegy and song as well as of epick poetry which last indeed together with tragedy and comedy are the three great species of poetry  i will now suppose that you have formed or procured a right notion of the nature of an heroic poem and of the action that it must be one great entire marvelous but not incredible piece of a just length instructive and entertaining i will presume likewise that you have a notion of the characters manners sentiment and diction and of the ornamental aid of figures episodes descriptions and similes or comparisons by which those characters and manners are set off to advantage  this being all presupposed let us enquire what homer proposes to do in his two matchless poems and then examine the end and tendency of that proposition  we will begin with the iliad mr pope says that the subject of the iliad is the shortest that ever was undertaken namely the anger of achilles mr dryden if i am not mistaken says that virgils proposition or subject is far preferable to the former the one is the anger of achilles the other is the establishment of a noble empire the noblest perhaps that the world ever saw  now i cannot agree altogether either with pope or dryden for in the first instance it is not the anger of achilles simply considered that homer proposes for the business of his poem but the delays disappointments and calamities which attended the greeks in consequence of the anger and resentment of achilles this is the plan which he lays down and on which he promises to proceed and the particular moral that naturally arises from it is the most proper and useful that could be offered to his countrymen the grecians were composed of many little states it was therefore their interest to be unanimous and closely united when engaged in a common cause how apt then was his moral he wished them to learn that their safety consisted in their union and that discord and dissension would be their ruin this was in the course of time actually verified philip of macedon overthrew and enslaved them and the means he pursued to bring it about was first by sowing dissension among them and dividing one state from the other so divided he found them an easy conquest the same thing has happened a thousand times since not only in sovereign states and kingdoms but even in private families one of our saviors tenets is a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand and this is the grand moral which arises out of the particular subject of the iliad  in the next place if we consider the tendency of the poem i do not see but it may be deemed of as great consequence as that of the aeneid though it may not be so speciously agreeable the tendency of the one is to show by what means degrees and worthy qualities a mighty empire was founded the tendency of the other to point out the misconduct the vices and follies by which a great undertaking was almost ruined and indeed had been entirely so but for an extraordinary accident and the whole force of greece overpowered this last is surely as useful a lesson as the first and strictly justifiable in homer inasmuch as he proposed to write another poem wherein he was to demonstrate the great and good effects of virtue for such is the purport of the odyssey  i think it is mr addison who says that beside the grand particular moral that arises out of an epick poem or that which the poet had chiefly in view there are many others which contingently result from the fable this is certainly true it appears manifestly in homer and perhaps it was as much his intention to show these as the great moral abovementioned in my ensuing letters i will occasionally mark out some of these and describe what i conjecture to be the greatuniversal intention of the author at present i fear i haved tired you so shall trouble you no more for two or three days  adieu ma tres chere j p  letter xxxvi oxford dec         my dear nancy i have some few remarks to make in this letter on the sixth book of the iliad but they are very few pope has given us so many fine observations that little is left for any other pen you have also contributed to lessen what i might have had to say by sending some of your own which i am much pleased with  the speech which hector makes to his mother is admirable far hence be bacchus gifts the chief rejoined inflaming wine pernicious to mankind unnerves the limbs and dulls the noble mind let chiefs abstain and spare the sacred juice to sprinkle to the gods its better use by me that holy office were profaned ill fits it me with human gore distained to the pure skies these horrid hands to raise or offer heavens great sire polluted praise   the four last lines are peculiarly beautiful and conform to that place of holy scripture where david being a man of blood was not allowed by god to build him a temple  all that passes between hector and his wife is beautiful beyond comparison especially his last reply andromache my souls far better part why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart no hostile hand can antedate my doom till fate condemns me to the silent tomb flxd is the term to all the race of earth and such the hard condition of our birth no force can then resist no flight can save all sink alike the fearful and the brave no more  but hasten to thy tasks at home there guide the spindle and direct the loom me glory summons to the martial scene the field of combat is the sphere for men where heroes war the foremost place i claim the first in danger as the first in fame   throughout the whole work hectors piety toward god his conjugal and paternal affection his love to his country his filial duty and his resignation to the will of providence are placed in a most glorious light  the following comparison in the seventh book as when a general darkness veils the main soft zephyr curling the wide watery plain the waves scarce heave the face of ocean sleeps and a still horror saddens all the deeps is inimitably picturesque but you will say you never saw such a scene in your life and much of the beauty it thereby lost  i will only mention one more favorite passage of mine in the eighth book and subjoin a transcript of some few verses of isaiah which it is worth your while to compare with it  full hecatombs lay burning on the shore the winds to heaven the curling vapors bore ungrateful offering to the immortal powers whose wrath hung heavy over the trojan towers nor priam nor his sons obtained their grace proud troy they hated and her guilty race isaiah chap i to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me says the lord i am full of the burnt offerings of rams etc  when ye come to appear before me who has required this at your hands to tread my courts bring no more vain oblations etc your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates they are a trouble to me i am weary to bear them what a smilitude between the poet and the prophet  i am my dear nancy le votre j p  letter xxxvii oxford dec         my dear nancy by yesterdays post i received yours of the   th but cannot much commend the writing i do not desire you to write me when you are in so very great a hurry rather put it off till you have more leisure  i shall not trouble you with a long letter of particulars at present but give you my opinion of the iliad in general  beside the great moral thereof there are many other things which the conduct of the poem was meant to set forth we are shown the ill effects of unlawful love vain glory pride injustice breach of faith dissimulation cowardice covetousness etc for instance in paris agamemnon asius pandarus dolon and many others hence as the particular intent of this wonderful poem is to show the fatal consequences of dissension and anger among princes so the main and general design seems calculated to point out the bad effects of ungoverned passions and appetites in all mankind to set forth that our giving way to them leads into sin that one sin leads into another and the whole into misery and punishment  the great moral arising from it is to give it you in the greek  that is to say so the counsel of the gods was perfected or fulfilled this is the very beginning of the iliad and mr pope has translated it such was the sovereign will and such the deom of jove  but homer is much shorter more simple and sublime for  does not only signify will but counsel and wise determination hereby teaching us that misery is the consequence of illgoverned passions and according to the stated nature of things it must be so how agreeable is this to the spirit of the sacred scriptures where it is said  the counsel of the lord endures for ever but the counsel of the wicked shall be brought to naught i was very well pleased the other day when i found the above sentence called in popes notes the grand moral of the poem for in truth though i had always thought so i did not know that any one had said it  adieu my dear j p  letter xxxviii oxford dec         my dear nancy i wrote to you yesterday and having now a leisure afternoon i shall continue the same subject  homer shows us there is a necessary natural connection between giving way to our inordinate appetites and affections and transgressing our duty to god and man and thence a consequential tendency to misery and punishment it is in this sense that one of the minor prophets fays is there evil in the city and the lord has not done it teaching us thereby that no mischief or evil befalls an impious city or people but what happens by the wise counsel and will of god  there are two ways whereby the great author of the iliad shows us the connection between misery and sin and between sin and inordinate affections the one is the natural connection we have before observed the other the immediate vengeance of god proceeding from his displeasure of these we  without number both in  and  holy writings for  the pgues of egypt are such a  paralel that one would almost  homer had copied from moses  and madame acier have observed that the gradation of punishments related by moses is imitated by the other and in both the long suffering and goodness of god is remarkable in the iliad first the dogs then the fowls of the air then the cattle lastly the people themselves were smitten with the darts of apollo in the scripture the lice the locusts the flies etc preceded the cutting off the firstborn but i need not say more on this head only refer to the passages and indeed many other poets as well as homer abound with examples of this kind  the next thing to be pointed out my dear is how admirably the greek poet has made inordinate affections beget offenses to god and injuries to man and how naturally and clearly he has made miseries and punishments arise out of the former but i will not detain you longer now than to with you health and happiness and that you may improve these things not less to your advantage than to your pleasure  adieu my dear nancy i am always yours j p  letter xxxix oxford dec         my dear i wrote you on friday the   th and thought i might possibly hear from you on sunday but perhaps my letter did not come time enough to your hand  mr pope has observed that through the iliad homer has in a manner made every thing done by divine providence some deity always assists the hero who gets the better except ajax alone when hector breaks through the grecian wall and sets fire to their ships jupiter assists him when he is killed jupiter has abandoned him and pallas assists achilles in a word in all encounters and in all actions where any point is to be gained by valor courage or wisdom the supreme power assists in defeat and disappointment that power deserts them how conformable still to the holy writings where god is said to put wisdom into the heart to strengthen it and on the contrary to make blind and to harden the heart  virgil has often said that such and such an event came about by chance by the vicissitude of fortune and by the instability of human affairs perhaps he meant the same with homer since he has often mentioned the fates or decrees of the gods in very express terms though his meaning is not so clearly pointed but homer is peculiarly strict in his expressions for he always makes the will or counsel of the supreme to be the disposer of every thing by which we may learn what worthy sentiments he had of the true god and that all things must be regulated by his wise counsel howsoever they may appear mere chance to us who by reason of our human blindness and weakness can neither foresee nor avoid thousands of events that fall out every day and every hour  this perhaps you will reckon a digression and it is so but it opens the way to what i shall write you in my next  i am my dear nancy your real friend j p p s after writing the above i have received yours and shall answer it tomorrow or next day    letter xl oxford dec         dear nancy homers intention as i have observed before is to show us that inordinate affections lead to sin and sin to misery he gives us a hundred instances to prove this but the chief is the wrath of achilles the great design and tendency of the iliad is repeatedly set forth and illustrated by mr preston yet i cannot presume it was through inadvertency to what he had once said it was certainly his intention so to do in order to make a strong and lasting impression on his pupils mind   beside the instances themselves the beautiful order and natural connection in which he disposes them fully illustrate his proposition and from the whole tenor of his story this conclusion naturally arises that the counsel and wise disposition of god is fulfilled in every thing mr pope has showed this in his notes on many particular passages throughout the iliad but if we take a short view of the fable or story we shall then see it in the clearest light  though the author begins with the wrath of achilles yet in the course of his works he takes care to show us the source of all the miseries which he has painted in his most admirable poem  paris was a youth of royal blood beautiful and amorous he sung and played he seduced from her husband the most beautiful woman in the world perhaps as amorous as himself her husband who had hospitably entertained him resents this usage he asks the assistance of his friends and the neighboring states they sail to troy destroy the country and at last sit down before the town the daughter to the priest of apollo was made a captive her father goes to redeem her agamemnon refuses his most just suit threatens and illtreats him the priest complains to his god who sends plagues first upon the grecian cattle then upon the people the causes hereof are enquired the prophet is afraid of the king but being assured of protection from achilles proclaims aloud the cause of the displeasure of heaven agamemnon insults him hereupon a contest ensues between agamemnon and achilles wherein they illtreat each other agamemnon threatens to take achilless captive briseis from him and actually does it on which achilles refuses to fight for the grecians the trojans obtain many advantages by this refusal a duel is proposed by paris and accepted on the terms proposed menelaus is treacherously wounded the trojans refuse to restore helen or stand to the terms agreed on and though priam was certainly of the same opinion with antenor that she ought to be given up yet through indulgence to his son he subscribes to a breach of the agreement hereupon battle on battle ensues both greeks and trojans are miserably destroyed and consequently many proofs are given of courage wisdom piety constancy patience friendship and compassion as also of cowardice rashness brutality vanity cruelty and almost of all virtues and vices the several incidents are managed with great address honorable embassies are sent to achilles to return to the service of the greeks he is inexorable till hector kills his friend this gets the better of his resolutions he returns to the fight from a principle of revenge and kills hector  adieu j p  letter xli oxford dec         my dear in my last i gave you a short summary or argument of the whole fable of the iliad which is so nicely connected one incident or circumstance so naturally and orderly depending on another that each part serves to strengthen and illustrate the other and the whole leads to a demonstration of the authors first proposition to wit that the wrath of achilles occasioned many and grievous miseries to the greeks hence we are taught that strife and dissension as i have observed before are the certain ruin of any common cause state kingdom or family that inordinate affections lead to vice that vice increases in its course insomuch that one sin if i may be allowed the expression begets another and consequently such persons as give way to their passions and lusts become gradually degenerate fall from bad to worse till they are irrecoverably plunged in guilt and unhappiness  homer shows us also that the wrath of god hangs over the head of the wicked whether a nation king or private person god sends his judgments upon them withdraws his assistance fights against them sends judicial blindness and hardness of heart upon them and assists their enemies to overthrow them who in executing the secret will of heaven are themselves sometimes guilty of the same crimes he made them the instruments to punish and are in their turn chastized  on the other hand he shows how much good men engaged in a righteous cause are favored by heaven the way to obtain this favor he points out to be by supplicating and serving god and the return to be made by thankfulness and praise  in my next i shall illustrate all this from the summary of the poets fable  i am my dear nancy your affectionate friend j p  letter xlii oxford dec         my dear nancy i received your letter written on christmas day and wrote to you the day after that date but i had sealed mine before yours came to hand so did not choose to open it  i told you in my last except one that homers purpose in his iliad is to show us that inordinate ungoverned unrestrained passions and appetites are the means of leading us into sin and consequently into misery and that the order and connection of the story helps to set this position in the strongest light i gave you likewise a short sketch or argument of the iliad now let me comment a little on it and we shall thereby not only see homers great and accurate judgment but discover some very valuable truths on which if we will well observe and improve happy will it be for him or her who does it  the source of all this mischief the destruction of troy and of the whole royal race of that kingdom of infinite woes and miseries to their allies as well as to the grecians was an unlawful amor the cause which homer assigns to wit the wrath of achilles against agamemnon is but an intervening not the original cause the seduction of helen and breach of hospitality in carrying her off during her husbands absence that husband who had entertained the seducer kindly who was a person too of such distinction no less than a king these i say were the original source of all those woes and devastations  here we cannot but admire the judgment of homer and the excellency of his fable  paris was a kings son helen a queen two of the handsomest persons in the known world homer would teach us herein that handsome men and women are subject to much greater inconveniences of this kind than others such a man has great advantages over the fair sex and such women are more liable to flattery and the danger of having their morals spoiled by false suggestions of intriguing men who never fail when they meet with a woman of virtue to endeavor to reason her out of it before they can hope for success not half so much pains is ordinarily taken on women who are but homely and we see daily that more fine women are ruined than others  homer chose for his purpose two persons of such exalted condition so highly bred alike possessed of some virtues and yet made the crime very black for the following reasons  had they been persons of mean degree or abandoned principles they would not have made so deep an impression on our minds nor should we have had that care or concern at least not that pity for them which in the present case we feel every now and then to return upon us  if paris had been a downright ruffian and helen a low dissolute wretch they could not have been of any use to the poet then or to us now what can be learned from two people quite sunk in debauchery but these though bad enough had yet great remorses at least helen and paris was not a ruffian though he was a seducer now where some good qualities are mixed with bad where virtue and sin struggle together and sometimes honor sometimes natural frailty gets the better the poet can show humankind as it is and place it in a very instructive light otherwise he cannot  it was absolutely necessary to make the crime very provoking and the person injured of a very distinguished character else the poet could not with any due probability have brought all greece together in arms to revenge the injury had helen been a person of mean degree kings and princes would not have leagued together to resent her husbands wrongs had the injury been slight it could not have borne a quarrel nor could homer have vindicated his greeks whom he is so fond of nor the gods themselves had he built his beautiful poem on a slight event again if paris had been of low extraction whom could the greeks fight against not troy  for the whole state and their allies could not have engaged in the defense of one who was less then a kings son in the one case homer could not have had his greeks to fight in the other he could nor have had the trojans to fight against on the whole therefore i hope you will agree with me that the bard was most judicious in choosing two persons of great distinction of great beauty and guilty of a great crime to be the originals whereon to found his excellent moral poem  adieu ma charmante j p  letter xliii oxford jan          my dear i have the pleasure of yours of the   d and am very glad to hear you are in good health i presume both your aunt and mother are well since you mention nothing to the contrary  it would be very agreeable to me that you write of the odyssey your last letter on homer was of the   th of december so that correspondence has been long suspended in my next i shall resume my observations on the iliad but shall now contract them as much as possible there being many things in mr popes remarks which anticipate what i should otherwise have observed  i did indeed expect a longer letter from you at least two or three short ones  a method that i shall pursue hereafter nothing damps the spirit wherewith a correspondence should be kept alive so much as neglecting to write a little because you have not leisure for a great deal remember this maxim and pursue it  my humble service and believe me to be my dear little angel  your sincere friend j p  letter xliv oxon jan          my dear nancy pursuant to my promise of yesterday i sit down to give you only a short letter i now return to homer  i would have you read over my former observations on this subject when you peruse this letter in the tenth year of the war between the two nations we have seen the greeks sit down before troy homers poem begins here and the circumstance wherewith he opens it is the dissension which happens between agamemnon and achilles this fatal difference had almost ruined the greeks it arose you remember from agamemnons refusal to accept ransom for the priest of apollos daughter only because he loved her better than his own wife he affronts the priest abuses and threatens the augur calchas calling him a false interpreter of the will of heaven hereupon a quarrel arises between the king and achilles they insult and defy each other till in the end agamemnon takes from him his captive briseis  what we have to remark on this event is well worth notice we see agamemnon fall into the very crime which he came to revenge how highly natural there is nothing more common in ordinary life than to stumble into the same faults and errors for which we condemn others how blind and partial are we to ourselves how quicksighted to those around us both men and women are equally culpable in this respect you remember congreves amoret  she loves herself yet others hates for that which in herself she prizes adieu ma tres chere j p  letter xlv oxford jan          my dear those human frailties i was upon in my last partiality to ourselves and uncharitableness to our neighbor are the causes of more than half the mischief that happens in the world hence it was that our savior perpetually preached the nonresentment and forgiveness of offenses nothing can so much contribute to the peace of mankind to return to homer  we see this inordinate affection in agamemnon betrayed him into passion rudeness and injustice and these brought on misery what insults did he not undergo what stinging reproaches did he not endure to what grief shame and repentance was he not exposed in what calamities did he not involve his army how was he constrained to court and sue to achilles and how were his supplications rejected and his proffers scorned here is a natural connection between his crime and the sad effects of it  observe likewise his crime was not only punished in its own consequences but by the absolute interposition of heaven the plague is sent upon the greeks and burials are heaped on burials this is exactly conformable to what our holy religion teaches namely that one sin naturally draws on another and that the end and wages of sin are death or misery beside this inherent punishment god sometimes sends immediate vengeance being essentially merciful he begins with milder judgments but upon obstinacy and impenitence he pours forth the fullness of his wrath in popes notes you see the conformity of the procedure in this plague to that inflicted on pharaoh  it is observable that agamemnon fell into a crime of the same nature with that of paris but not near so heinous in degree the punishments therefore were only proportionable troy was utterly destroyed for the atrocious crime of that people and their obstinate continuance in it the greeks suffered severely but were not destroyed forasmuch as their crime or perseverance therein was not so flagrant  we gather also from this excellent poem that people are often involved in the vices and punishments of their princes a wicked king is not only a plague in himself to his subjects but in his sins he calls down judgments upon them this is confirmed in the scriptures as well as in homer for instance in the  d book of kings chap xxiv we read  surely at the commandment of the lord came this upon judah to remove them out of his sight for the sins of manasseh according to all that he did  and also for the innocent blood that he shed for he filled jerusalem with innocent blood which the lord would not pardon  the holy writings teach us that children are punished for the faults of their parents homer shows us the same  we often see children unaccountably as far as appearance goes involved in the faults of their parents and suffering on their account it appears strange at first but on due reflection we must allow there is nothing more natural in the common course of things than that the sins of a parent should fall heavy on a child there is such a connection between them the one is so much a part of the other that this consequence can hardly be avoided at least in many instances  the scriptures teach us that god makes one people the instrument of his vengeance on another and again contrarywise ephraim shall destroy manasseh and manasseh ephraim and it is said to the people of israel  you shall be a scourge and a plague to the heathen that are about you and they shall be a scourge to you nothing can be more natural or more just with respect to two guilty nations homer enforces the same the trojans and greeks are both guilty but not equally they are both punished but not equally only in proportion to the size and aggravation of their crimes and they were made reciprocally the means of each others punishment through the whole bible particularly in the prophets and more especially in isaiah and jeremiah this doctrine is strongly inculcated  how amazingly great then is homer we find a heathen through the strength and justness of his own conceptions and sentiments agree almost in every point with the word of god and by the tenor of the whole his grande morale is fully evinced namely   the counsel of god was accomplished i wish you health and happiness believe me to be  my dear angel your j p  letter xlvi oxford jan          my dear nancy i will let homer stand still a while and give you a short description of oxford  on the road from london we come first within sight of the city at about two miles distance on the top of a pretty high hill called shootoverhill here we have a view of the river with the plain country embanking it and on either hand a range of hills the river below oxford is called the thames but at oxford there are two rivers that on the west is called the isis that on east the cherwell the one comes from the north the other to wit isis from the north west they meet at oxford which stands in the point between them on a little rising ground surrounded with rivers and meadows on the east west and south and with fine corn fields on the north beyond those meadows and rivers are two tracts of pretty high hills covered with pasture corn and woods intermixed when you come within view of the town from shootoverhill it strikes you very agreeably with a great number of public buildings such as churches colleges schools the theater printing house dr ratcliffes library etc  just as you enter oxford from london you cross the cherwell by a bridge thence ascend gradually to the middle of the town then you descend as gradually till you come to the isis over which you pass by several bridges the many canals into which these two rivers have been cut have been the occasion of so many bridges about oxford  their private buildings are but ordinary but the great number of public buildings the squares avenues of trees the gardens groves fine walks and beautiful country around make it a most delightful place in summer the streets for the chief part are clean and dry  this description though but faint is enough to give you a sort of taste of the beauties of oxford if you wish to be more particularly informed let me know and i will do the best i can to satisfy you i subjoin a sort of sketch or plan of oxford drawn very correctly though with his pen only a strong instance of his assiduous kindness and probably more valuable to his pupil than the most accurate and beautiful engraving  as well as i am able to give it i should have told you that the two rivers are very unlike each other the cherwell is deep flow and muddy with many turnings and windings the banks overgrown consequently the water not easily to be come at in many places the isis has a strait course runs pretty swift the water clear the bottom gravelly and firm and the banks smooth clean and disengaged from woods or shrubs  adieu my dear angel i am yours j p  letter xlvii oxon feb         my dear i received yours of the  st of this month on the day thereafter and in return will endeavor to gratify your curiosity respecting this city  the university here is one of the most famous in the world it is a place for education in all the liberal sciences for this purpose there are no less than seventy colleges and five or six halls where instructors in these respective branches reside namely for divinity logic physic anatomy astronomy law rhetoric and languages each of these colleges is a building by itself and many of them are very stately each is likewise a separate society by itself governed by its own laws and customs under its own particular charter and the whole incorporated into one great body is called the university hence they derive great privileges the city of oxford is subject to them they send members to parliament and every college has a particular founder as a king queen or other distinguished personage  those who have built and first settled endowments on colleges are called the founders those who have left sums of money lands or books since their foundation are styled benefactors  the halls were originally buildings belonging to some particular colleges though separated from them and were erected for the convenience of lodging students when the colleges were too much crowded or for the reception of the sons of great men who did not like to be confined to strict collegehours but now things are altered some of the halls have been turned into colleges and others are wholly independent of them  you desire perhaps to know the difference between these buildings  a college is a body corporate within themselves who have a charter of their own and can buy and sell take and enjoy by gift or legacy in their own name the charter is a grant from the king  a hall has one head or chief in the same manner as a college and like that is also a part of the university it has its own rules orders and government but no charter consequently is not a body corporate within itself the society possess no lands nor rents nor can they take and enjoy like a college in their own name when any thing is given or bequeathed for their use they cannot hold it themselves but must lodge it in the university for their use  there are many good schools in london but not an university the reason is plain london is a place of great hurry and business full of temptations and avocations oxford is a retired place surrounded with gardens woods groves hills meadows and rivers these scenes the muses haunt and phoebus loves at least so the poets tell us  adieu ma charmante et soyez bien persuadee que je suis tant a vous que vous etes a moi faites mes complements a madame votre mere et tante et m m  le votre j p p s i forgot to mention to you the public schools and libraries the fine theater the printing house and museum the place where the rarities are kept there is a chief or head in every college and hall in some he is called the master in others the principal in others the provost and in christ church he is called the dean    letter xlviii oxon feb         my dear nancy i took notice to you formerly that not alone the fine moral and the great and important subject of homers poem was to be admired but also his judicious manner of conducting it and the beauty of the whole contexture of his fable or story whence it is not only pleasant as well as profitable but from being pleasant it makes a deeper impression on our memories and we recollect it with continual satisfaction the writer seems admirably to have adopted this agreeable precept in his own practice he catches hold of every opportunity to throw in that simplicity and playfulness which make instruction most engaging a tribute of this kind is paid to the memory of mr savage in an elegant latin inscription in the cloister of westminster abbey the monument is said to be erected by the scholar of that foundation from this inscription i have taken my motto for this work the turn of it being so immediately adapted to our tutors disposition may i be forgiven if i here subjoin the whole and presume to add an humble imitation of it in english which i have been induced to attempt merely from the delight i have taken in the original inscription tu nostrae memor usque scholae dum vita manebat musa nec immemores nos sinit esse tui ipse loei genius te moeret amicus amicum et luctu pietas not propiare ferit nobiscum assueras docto puerascere lusu fudit and ingenitos cruda senecta sales chare senex puer hoc te saltem carmine donat ingratum pueri nec tibi carmen erit imitation while life remained our school with heedful eye did thou regard and thy loved memory so the muse bids with us shall never dye the very genius of the place complains as friend for friend laments in mournful strains and piety but aggravates our pains how would thou sport with us in learned play and sage advice in wits light strains convey a pupil gives this grateful verse to thee nor can a pupils verse unwelcome be    homer has made use of wonderful stratagems for this purpose the enumeration of the ships the names of the commanders the geographical description of the several countries they came from the characteristic distinction of the leaders the nice plot contrived to give us an idea even of the make and shape of their persons in bringing helen to describe them to old priam the engaging of paris and menelaus first then of ajax and hector in single battle the manifest advantage he gives to menelaus and a sort of advantage to ajax though not great the trojans breaking the truce wounding menelaus and refusing to restore helen  all these serve to vindicate the greeks and ascribe blame to the trojans  observe that though several of the grecian heroes have now and then the advantage over hector yet he in his turn has the advantage over every one of them this is that the poet may give the greater honor to achilles who is the only man designed at last to conquer hector and not even then without the assistance of a deity nor till heaven had abandoned hector we see too that hector though the best man among all the heroes either greek or trojan and the man whom jupiter loves for his piety and other virtues was yet involved in the common calamity he fought it is true from love to his country and family but he fought on the wrong side how agreeable this to the holy scripture there we find national sins draw down judgments on such particular persons as are no matter by what means involved therein  the case of good old priam seems to be the same with that of good old eli though priam approved not of his son pariss crime yet he was indulgent to him and did not compel him to do justice herein his default was parallel to that of eli of whom the lord says to samuel  i will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not sam b i c i ver    it is worth your while to read this whole chapter and that preceding it  in mr popes notes you will read the several instances of homers judgment in the whole conduct of his story so i need not repeat them i shall mention only two  you know it is a proof of great judgment in a poet to suit every circumstance with propriety and to make his personages act in character there is an instance of the former when homer to relieve us from the fury of a battle brings in his heroes in a sort of parley as that between glaucus and diomede to which i refer you another instance is in his fit disposal of time as mr pope has observed in that busy night which preceded hectors breaking in upon the grecian intrenchments  to illustrate his persons acting up to character consider the care and concern nestor is in when the embassy is sent to achilles you know the ambassadors were ulysses phoenix and ajax observe their different characters their different modes of behavior the different impressions their speeches made on achilles and the different treatment he gave them again observe the different demeanor of the grecian heroes on that melancholy night when as the poet expresses it hectors approach in every wind they hear and hectors fury every moment fear   all this is worthy to be remarked with the utmost care it is admirably fine and proves to what a great degree homer has kept up to what the critics call mores the manners  i am my dearest yours j p by way of postscript to my letter of this day i shall add a few lines  you see through the whole iliad that the gods always refused the prayers and supplications of wicked men especially those who continued in their wicked courses i need not quote examples we see the same verified in many passages of the scripture and it is confirmed by no less an author than our savior  not every one that faith unto me lord lord but he that does the will of my father that is in heaven the great moral of the iliad was confirmed by the sad experience of aftertimes and one would almost think that homer had foreseen for philip of macedon as well as the kings of syria and persia the romans after taking advantage of the dissensions that arose among the greeks or of those they sowed among them themselves fell a prey to other nations at last and this will certainly happen to be the case of the united provinces one time or other unless they continue to be more wise and virtuous than any states ever were united in the same manner as they are  now my dear i should be glad you would let me know what you next wish to converse about in this manner as i read homer through i shall hint to you such particular beauties as i occasionally meet  you do not tell me whether or no you have the little essay on epic poetry before your telemaque be sure to write me what you like best in the odyssey as you read it but dont confine yourself to that and read it only when you please to relish what we read and profit by it we should sit down to it with an inclination  adieu ma tres chere nannette et soyez persuadee que je vous aim tant que jaime mes yeux  j p    letter xlix oxon feb  0       my dear nancy i dare say you are beginning to be weary of homer as well as you love him and of the many observations we have made therefore we will drop him after this and my next letter  at least for some time and find another subject for our epistolary conversation  in the mean time please to observe that when achilles was reconciled to agamemnon it was not either that his anger was abated or that the love of his country or his countrymen got the better of it but another piece of resentment and desire of revenge got the better of the former as it was incompatible with the other and this new resentment of his was still more furious than the first and much more unreasonable for certainly hector was in the right to kill patroclus and though achilles might lament the death of his friend yet there was no reason for his exercising such a brutal passion against a fair enemy  you will find this very agreeable to the accounts we have in the holy scriptures of the dispensations of god who makes every thing even the sins and follies of people contribute to advance and bring about the completion of his sacred purposes and will it still serves too to illustrate his grande morale which he never loses sight of   the jews when they cried out against our savior crucify him crucify him little dreamed that they were forwarding the salvation of mankind nor had judas any such design when he betrayed him neither did the high priest know the grand import of his own words when he said it was expedient for one man to die for the people  thus providence punished the greeks by the fierceness of achilles and by that very fierceness saved them when reconciled to them many are the instances of this kind in the sacred writings david says  the wrath of man shall turn to thy praise and the residue thereof thou shall restrain another thing very well worth observing and which is still a great proof and illustration of the truth of the above moral is this homer never brings any great event to bear any fortunate act to be performed or noble virtue exercised without the assistance of a divine power when his heroes fail it is because the gods have forsaken them do they succeed it is because the gods are with them do they act prudently the gods inspire them do they act foolishly the gods blind them but then it is as observable that this is the result of their own conduct and principles there is a something in their minds which renders them either dear or detestable to the deities this is agreeable to the whole tenor of the old testament as you may read in an hundred instances of the kings of israel juda syria etc etc  lastly you see the means of acquiring the favor of the supreme was next to a virtuous life bespeaking him by prayer this is the practice of all homers great men and the success of their undertakings was always accompanied with sacrifices of praise and thanksgiving this was understood to be an indispensable return of duty and gratitude to the gods when hector escapes safe from diomede the latter cries out once more thank phoebus for thy forfeit breath well by apollo are thy prayers repaid and jupiter says in more places than one when speaking in hectors favor that he had offered many sacrifices to the deities  thus as these heroes imputed the escape of their enemies to some god so when they expressed their hopes of getting the better of them they are frequently accustomed to say if such or such a god assist me herein they conformed to the phrase in scripture they did not put their trust in their own swords or bows virgil has given us an instance of an hero it is true who did put his trust in his own strength i mean mezentius my own right hand says he is my god and the dart i am going to throw but virgil took care beforehand to represent him a most impious wretch and a tyrant and makes his end suitable to his bad character  now my dear fearing i have sufficiently tired you i will add no more but that i am  your faithful and most affectionate friend j p  letter l oxon feb          this subsequent letter may more properly be styled a postscript to to the foregoing wherein i forgot to observe to you that when the purpose of heaven was fulfilled by the resentment of achilles against hector the former was checked in his career before the half of his resentment was satisfied he had doomed the body of hector to be without burial and funeral honors to be left a prey to dogs and vultures but jove and the other gods would not permit that hector was dear to them on account of his piety jove would have him buried honorably and achilles was obliged to let go his hold herein the residue of his wrath was restrained heaven having no further use for it and herein also is verified another passage in scripture  precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints ps cxvi ver    i am my dear nancy ever yours j p  letter li oxon feb          my dear i said in a former letter that i had done with homer but i find i have not  in order to make his morals or the application of his doctrine relish better he has beautifully diversified his story he has introduced many episodes that are very delightful for example that which glaucus tells to diomede that which phoenix tells to achilles that which nestor relates and many others observe too they are always told in a proper place and always recommend some virtue or arraign some vice  many of his episodes and other stories have also the same tendency with the great design that is to say to show the ill effects of division resentment and obstinate revenge particularly that of phoenix to achilles or to show us that inordinate lusts affections or appetites lead to sin and misery or to illustrate the grande morale that gods will must be accomplished and his counsel must stand and by continually mixing these stories in his work he calls up our attention to the great purpose of it  besides this great purpose he gives us occasional precepts instances of what is fit decent prudent and of their contraries he sets before our eyes many beautiful and useful things in nature as of the heavens the earth rural labors winter summer harvest rocks mountains rivers seas etc as likewise of artificial things namely of war peace commerce etc but i refer you to what mr pope has said hereon  the last thing that i shall desire you to observe is this though the main design of the iliad is to show us that misery flows from sin and sin from unbridled appetites yet he therein presents us with many instances of happiness and success flowing from doing our duty and contrarywise in the odyssey though the main tendency of that poem be to show that happiness slows from a discharge of our duty to god and man which is the consequence of subduing our passions yet he mixes in the course of his story frequent instances of misery arising out of sin  to conclude  i fancy to myself that i see homer like a most renowned old philosopher or one of the ancient prophets preaching to his countrymen in this manner  learn o my countrymen that all unhappiness proceeds from sin and sin proceeds from inordinate affections learn that all happiness proceeds from virtue and virtue from hearkening to the dictates of reason that in the one case god will assist you in the other desert you to obtain his assistance you must depend on him you must ascribe all to him that you do well you must apply to him by servent prayer and not that alone but you must leave vice and embrace virtue otherwise god will not hearken to you though you make many prayers and when he blesses and assists you you must render him the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving  to confirm the first of these my doctrines i will tell you a story of the wrath of achilles and the quarrel that happened between him and agamemnon supreme leader of the grecians at the siege of troy which besides confirming my first doctrine will plainly prove that divisions and dissensions among people united in a common cause and interest though they may consist of many little independent states and sovereignties must probably be the ruin of them all this may be the case of greece and you may be swallowed up by some great prince or other if divisions be raised and encouraged among you  to prove my second doctrine to wit that bridling your passions acting with patience prudence and piety and consequently having god to favor you will lead you to success through the greatest difficulties i will tell you a story of the travels of ulysses and from both you may derive this important truth namely that every thing whatsoever is ordered disposed governed conducted and established by the allwise allpowerful and immutablycertain will of god and must be brought to the period that he has set and determined  if you have creechs horace at hand read the second epistle of his first book of epistles it is inscribed to lollius you will see there in what view he considers these two poems  adieu j p  letter lii oxon feb          my dear nancy i am highly gratified in seeing you take so much delight in the iliad particularly in the moral doctrine inculcated throughout that excellent poem  by the earnestness wherewith you desire me still to continue my remarks it should seem as if you conceived there were no other author fit to be the subject of our epistolary correspondence there are many more some you have ever at hand if you would now and then read the proverbs of solomon ecclesiastes the wisdom of solomon and of jesus the son of sirach with the archbishop of cambrays dialogues fables and lives of the philosophers they could not miss to furnish you with abundance of reflections equally proper for writing and conversation and this they would do without its being necessary that you should comment on every passage you read there or write down every reflection that presents itself only such as most strongly and naturally affect you  i am pleased with your observations on many of homers beauties i have gone through the author as i have examined them these added to those of mr pope who has been so copiously excellent leave very little for me to say but i will oblige you wherever i can nothing has occurred to me till now with the  th book open before me it would be endless to point out every passage i think excellent i shall only confine myself to such as i fancy will admit some particular remark or illustration  the complaint against jove at line    is what mankind in general is too guilty of we lay to the charge of god what is our own fault jeremiah seems to have been exactly in this predicament when he says why art thou to me as a liar etc  at verse    diomede says to agamemnon thou first and thou alone in fields of fight durst brand my courage and defame my might   he recollects the reproach cast on him in a former book though at that time he made no reply to it hence we learn to take care what we say for though we may fancy an expression forgot it may return and be of bad consequence when we least expect it  verse     nestor says now pray to jove to grant what greece demands pray in deep silence and with purest hands   this is agreeable to what our savior recommends when thou prayest enter into thy closet etc and david says i will wash my hands in innocence and so will i compass thine altars o lord  in the beginning of book the tenth observe with how much propriety agamemnon is employed then menelaus diomede nestor and ulysses the wisdom of diomede in choosing ulysses for his companion together with the whole transaction of that night point out the great use of taking advice and assistance in an arduous enterprise  adieu j p  letter liii oxon feb          neptunes progress to assist the greeks in book the thirteenth is admirably described and mr pope has shown us the affinity between that and a passage in the sixtyeighth psalm but there are many other places in the holy writings wherewith it may be compared it would be endless to enumerate them they will occur to you in your perusal of that sacred volume which is absurdly given as a taskbook to children indiscriminately of all capacities when it is an exercise for the most adult and experienced understanding what mr preston says here is surely no contradiction to his having recommended the bible to his pupil though so early as at  0 years of age be it observed that by his excellent instructions she had then read other authors and was more than capable of digesting what he proposed namely the proverbs ecclesiasticus etc he only objected to the absurd custom practiced then as at this day of suffering children to learn to read from the bible whence they too often contract a distaste to the most edifying and important volume that can in the process of their lives be laid before them   if i may be excused for saying it i think there are some few faults in mr popes translation and notes in these two books in book xiii verse   0 his troops unpracticed in the fights of stand is surely a strange expression  mr popes note on hectors reproach to paris verse     illfated paris slave to womankind etc is not accompanied with his usual judgment hector indeed is bold and impatient  so far he may resemble achilles but he is neither violent nor unjust though he was impetuous yet we see through the whole book that he was manageable achilles never was and had not hector cause during the course of the war to be highly offended at paris  book xiv verse   0 great jove awaking shook the blessed abides with rising wrath and tumbled gods on gods   the latter part of this translation i could wish not quite so low though it is pretty near the original which actually signifies throwing the gods about etc it reminds me of an expression in lees oedipus gods meet gods and jostle in the dark  i shall write you again on friday je suis avec mes complements ou ils sont dues le votre  j p  letter live oxon feb          my dear i have now reperused the   th and   th books of the iliad your own observations on these are remarkably good therefore i have very little to say  in verse    book xv the swiftness of a god compared to that of the thought of man is inimitably beautiful mr pope has justly remarked it but a much inferior genius could not have overlooked it  in verse     we find nestor placing the confidence of his prayer in his piety toward the gods which confirms one of homers great moral rules and which i have touched upon in a former letter  book xvi verse   this simile is extremely striking literally rendered from the greek it would run thus  no child that runs after its mother and holds her fast by the robe and hinders her from proceeding and looks up in her face weeping to make her take it in her arms etc you cannot imagine how beautiful it is in the original  in verse  0 homer now makes the same implication in the person of patroclus that he did formerly in the person of phoenix namely the obstinacy of achilles and the ill consequences thereof this is an epitome of the whole scope of the poem which as mr pope remarks homer every now and then introduces to fix our attention to his great design  in my preceding letter i endeavored to distinguish the disposition of hector from that of achilles in verse     we have a strong instance of the savage temper of the latter how unlike the pious hector  verse     this description of patroclus besides being admirably beautiful conveys an excellent moral  i have just received yours but have not yet had time to read it all adieu jusqua dimanche  i am your affectionate j p  letter lv oxon feb          my dear nancy since i wrote you last which was on friday i have perused two books more of the iliad accompanied with your observations  the conflict at verse     book xvii about the body of patroclus is wonderfully fine how naturally is it compared to fires that rise and sink by turns homer seems fond of the image himself for he repeats it in book xviii indeed the whole struggle from the time patroclus was killed till achilles appeared is most admirably described  book xviii verse    pensive he sat for all that fate designed rose in sad prospect to his boding mind this picture of achilles is most affectingly fine but here i will presume to say we may prove mr pope to have been wrong in his remark on a former book where he avers it was jealousy of his honor that made achilles lay his commands on patroclus not to fight with hector we see here that he immediately imagines him to have been slain whence it appears more probable that his warning him to shun hectors force was from apprehension of the consequences not jealousy of the motive  verse     here are four admirable lines the description of the shield is admirable throughout what mr pope himself has said about it and what he has quoted from others will in great measure give you a true taste of sculpture and painting and deserves to be read often  i am my dear nancy yours truly j p  letter lvi oxon feb         my dear i have now gone through another book of homer and made the following remarks  book xix verse    achilles confirms the observation i formerly made namely that it was not the love of his country but a new resentment that incited him and though he preaches here against resentment and obstinate fury yet it is obstinate fury which here possesses him and actually makes him preach against it  verse    agamemnon in his speech confirms your observation laying the blame of his folly on fate and the gods and thinks thereby to clear himself of the imputation i think the story he tells here though to the purpose might have been spared mr pope observes very justly that homer always regards due decorum he makes achilles rise but agamemnon sit still  verfe     here achilles imputes the blame of his own folly to jove as agamemnon did before and herein as in other instances it may be said that homer means to remind us of the great tendency of his poem for he tells us it was the high will of jove that doomed their strife and doomed the greeks to fall  book xx verse     i think what dionysius of halicarnassus has said in this note is very reasonable and as strong as any thing mr pope has said against it how the fact really was is hard to know at this distance of time  i shall finish what i have to say on the iliad in two more letters i believe and hope to conclude this week  i am my dear nancy yours j p  letter lvii oxon march         at the beginning of book the twentyfirst the description of the flood endeavoring to drown achilles is the produce of a vast imagination the comparison at verse    is admirable as is also the conflagration and the effect it had on the fishes  but with submission i think all the scuffle between juno and diana verse     very ridiculous  verfe  0  this comparison and the note upon it proves what i have often observed a conformity between homer and our holy scripture  book xxii verse     a further confirmation how dear are pious men to god  verse     read the notes here methinks mr pope or eustathius overacts the defense of homer in this place the note here entirely belongs to eustathius pope is not actually only negatively involved in it merely by not having contradicted what was asserted by the other  they explain the supernatural assistances which achilles receives into allegory yet affirm the like when shown to hector to be real merely to favor or rather to aggrandize the valor of ajax and achilles  verse     here is surely one of the most beautiful passages in the whole iliad and what andromache observes and complains of we find verified to this day it ever has and will be so  the lamentations of priam hecuba and andromache in this book and those of hecuba helen and andromache in the last are all different they arise from different motives and each person utters what immediately belongs to his or her character and circumstances a further proof how judiciously homer has preserved the manners throughout his poem it is again evinced in book xxiii verse    the behavior of achilles in this place how very consistent the appearance of the ghost of patroclus and all that passes is extremely fine  in the detail of prizes given to the racers at the funeral games observe the following lines a woman for the first in beautys bloom skilled in the needle and the laboring loom   do they not imply with many other passages in this poem that women how beautiful soever are not prized without some useful and laudable qualification  verse     here we have a beautiful picture of an old man instructing his son how to win the prize and we also discern with what an extensive genius homer was blessed for the rules that nestor gave being universally useful are as much in force now as they were then  the observation on line     by madame dacier and popes subjoined sneer are in my opinion equally nonsensical  the note on verse     beginning at these words but also his design might be to compliment the greeks etc is by no means just and even contradicts what the author has often said of ajax  to return to the very first note on this book i cannot concur with mr popes opinion in defense of homers conduct in carrying on his work for two books after the death of hector he urges that homers undertaking was to describe the anger of achilles and as that anger did not die with hector but persecuted even his remains so the poet still keeps up to his subject but mr pope with deference i speak it is mistaken it is not simply the anger of achilles that is homers subject but that particular anger and resentment which was so destructive to greece and took birth from his dissension with agamemnon this subject after the death of hector is entirely exhausted and the revenge then pursued is of a different nature from the wrath which homer undertook to sing for instead of being destructive it then becomes advantageous to the greeks  in my next i shall give you my opinion of the reasons which induced the author to protract his work beyond the death of hector i thought to have done it here and so have finished this subject of our letters but the assizes are now held in this city some gentlemen from london engage my time and an acount i have just received of the duke of hamiltons death unnerves my spirits  your last is come to hand the matter and handwriting please me infinitely  adieu my dearest i will write again on sunday  yours truly j p  letter lviii oxford march         dear nancy i have now read the iliad to an end and have but few remarks to make on the two last books  book xxiii verse     the huge ox bellowing falls with feebler cries expires the goat the sheep in silence dies these two lines are a just picture of the nature of the respective animals how characteristically affecting is the last to a tender mind  ver   0 here are eight fine lines and they show us what was the creed at that time the last i think much exceeds the original  these two notes escaped me when i wrote last as many other things do and indeed mr popes excellence in criticism has left very little in the power of any succeeding commentator i seldom repeat to you what he has said unless i think it so remarkable as to deserve your peculiar attention  i now proceed to the twentyfourth book and shall consequently very soon put an end to this subject which has entertained us so long  verse   this description of achilless lamentation is admirable though the lines    and    are not in my judgment so full and so expressive as in the original which is as follows if literally rendered  sometimes he lay on his side sometimes he turned quickly on his back then he lay prone on his face and then he stood strait up on his feet verse     this is an exceeding natural picture of a person particularly one in years overwhelmed with grief mr popes note is most judicious and well worthy attention there is nothing more common than for a parent in the first transports of affliction to prefer a child that is dead to all who remain alive  i have done now with particular remarks and though we have dwelt on this subject so long i yet feel a desire to communicate my general sentiments i mean my opinion of homers continuing his poem beyond the reconciliation of achilles with agamemnon perhaps i may not express myself so well as to be understood or my arguments may appear too subtle not solid enough be that as it may i shall expect an impartial account of your sense of them and what your sentiments really and unreservedly are on the same point  but this in my next and then adieu homer  i am my dear angel your faithful friend j p  letter lix oxon march         my dear nancy in these my general sentiments on our great bard i must be very frank and the rather to induce you to be so in your answer i profess myself of a different opinion from mr pope concerning the reasons which induced homer to carry on his work beyond the death of hector i am apt to think the true reason was that the poet had many more beautiful things to say which he was unwilling should be lost and truly i am glad they were not but then the question is whether he has done judiciously in protracting the work rather than to close it with the death of hector as virgil has finished the aeneid with that of turnus  to form a right judgment hereon we should consider the subjects of the respective poems that is what those two great poets proposed by them  the subject of the aeneid is the achievements as well as sufferings of aeneas till he brought about a settlement in a new kingdom for himself his family and the people in italy to the accomplishment of all this there was no obstruction but the rivalship of turnus consequently on his death all is completed there was no need to carry the work further though one masshoeus has added a thirteenth book wherein aeneas is married to lavinia but this is superfluous the great obstacle being removed the poet leaves us to imagine all the rest what he had proposed was entirely fulfilled to wit all the sufferings his hero had to undergo with seas and winds with men and gods and all the cross accidents he had to wrestle with and bravely subdue by his patience or exploits but it is not so in the iliad the poet there proposes to sing the fatal consequences of the resentment of achilles it was therefore very justifiable in him to carry on his work beyond the time that resentment lasted if it ought to have ended with that there was no need to make him kill hector for that event fell without the period of his resentment to agamemnon which is the groundwork of his poem but the poet certainly designed to show not only the sad disasters that befell the greeks through the resentment of achilles but to give still a stronger impression of the bad effects of dissension among chiefs as well as other persons whose interests are united he paints the great change of the grecian affairs for the better on his reconciliation with the leader of the greeks the ships are saved hector is killed the trojans are repulsed and driven within their town what follows namely the dragging the coarse of hector round troy the grief and behavior of achilles on the loss of patroclus the institution of the games at his funeral all this is in order to complete the character of his hero to show us his virtues as well as his vices he makes him an extraordinary person both ways and yet of vast nay of absolute importance to the successful issue of the war he has probably given him this mixed character as a lesson how princes and rulers ought to manage persons of great importance who have strong qualities both good and bad so that they may turn the former to their advantage and by a cautionary prudence divert any bad effects from the latter  to point out the importance of achilles still stronger it was necessary to set forth that of hector though this is done throughout the whole work while hector lived it is not sufficient the poet does not stop there the circumstances of his death the lamentations of his father mother wife sister helen and the whole people the behavior of the grecians and indeed achilless own speech after he had killed him render him still more important than all that had been said or described of him before  add hereunto the approbation in which he was held by jupiter apollo mercury and almost all the gods their resentment at achilles on his account their compelling the body to be delivered up to honorable burial and achilles himself lifting it on the bier  i am apt to think that piety which homer has all along recommended was the great lesson he proposed to inculcate by this last book the praises of hector for his piety occur so thick and the concern of the gods for his death is so strongly painted that one would be tempted to believe hector was as much his hero as achilles only of another kind and though the poet condemns the cause he was concerned in and makes him suffer for it yet he seems to be more in love with him than with his professed hero he does ample justice to his virtues and seems to make him much rather than achilles a pattern for imitation  remember you are to send me your free opinion on all i have said i dont desire you to write very long letters write two or three short ones at different times and then put them all under one cover  i am my dear nancy yours j p  letter lx oxon march          dear nancy i received your favor of the   th but have not yet laid in provision for a letter on the odyssey i have at last read the two plays you desired me sir fopling flutter and sir courtly nice  the man of mode or sir fopling flutter was first written the author was a highbred gentleman his characters are well drawn the dialogue is easy natural and genteel there is a great deal of wit and good sense in the conversation among the principal characters especially between dorimant and loveit and between the same gentleman and harriet old bellair is very entertaining he is goodnatured pleasant open and sincere in a word he is a downright country gentleman of the best sort  if i mistake not the spectator long ago censured this play as being built on a wrong foundation for says he the end of it is to promote vice dorimant his fine gentleman is a wit well bred of excellent sense and extremely engaging but totally devoid of faith and honor harriet the fine lady is perpetually despising her mother the scene of the orangewoman and drunken shoemaker is too gross and ought not to have been brought into such polite company a lady of good quality and a fine young heiress lodging in an orangewomans house is i think wrong judged and dorimant affirming his intention of marrying harriet was to repair his fortune is in my opinion out of character unless that as a rake he thought shame to own that he was really in love but surely even that is driving the rake too far for dorimant  the spectator after having remarked some passages in this comedy adds this whole celebrated piece is a perfect contradiction to good manners good sense and common honesty nothing but being lost to a sense of innocence and virtue can make any one see it without observing more frequent occasion to move sorrow and indignation than mirth and laughter he had great reason indeed for what he said the sufferance of such immoral pieces perverts the true intent of the stage which was meant to be a place of instructive amusement not empty dissipation that mr addison considered it in this light is evident from the two pieces he gave to the theater cato and the drummer the growth of licentious pieces is principally if not altogether to be ascribed to the vitiated taste of an audience the vulgar expression if there were no receivers there would be no knaves may be here not unaptly alluded to if there were no encouragers of immoral pieces none such would be represented it cannot be doubted but the regulator of a theater would rather desire to see it a seat of decorum than of licentiousness or that an actor would be better pleased to utter sentiments of truth and virtue than those of vice and immorality  the other play sir courtly nice seems to be an imitation of the man of mode though a faint one notwithstanding there are some good things in the former yet the characters are not by far so genteel nor is there so much wit or good sense in the dialogue as in the latter farewell is a sort of dorimant only not vicious the aunt is a copy of lady woodvill and leonora of harriet the contrast between hothead and testimony is diverting but i cannot think they are naturally brought in sir courtly nice is well drawn but not so delightful a fop as sir fopling nor do i think his foppery savours so much of the gentleman i do not know what to make of lord belguard i think him in the main a silly fellow though perhaps with some smattering of good sense and breeding hotheads behavior to him is quite outree cracks character appears overdone and the unravelling of the plot not entirely natural surly altogether is too gross though some part of what he he says is entertaining enough there are certainly many worse plays the purpose and tendency of this piece being rather good than otherwise gives it in my opinion one material ascendancy over the man of mode  perhaps what i have said may engage you to read them over again and then i shall be glad to have your opinion of them  i am my dear your sincere friend j p  letter lxi oxon march           my dear angel i received a letter from you just as i had finished my last and since that i have received yours of the  th instant  i am exceedingly pleased with your observations on the odyssey i only regret that you have not made more and have gone so quickly through it in a late letter i reminded you of some books which i had mentioned formerly such as the bible and apochrypha rochefaucault etc where you might find very good subjects for our conversation  i have begun to read the odyssey but shall only at this time take notice of the observation you make on the answer telemachus gives to mentes about the doubtfulness of his legitimacy pope says whatever truth there may be in the reply there is very little decency in it i must own myself of a different opinion i think telemachus rather means a compliment than a reflection on his mother the meaning of the author in my conception amounts to this the certainty of our legitimacy depends on the word and honesty of our mothers penelope avows me to be her son by ulysses and considering the virtuous character of my mother there is no doubt to be made of my being so her avowal of it amounts to absolute proof  prefixed to the odyssey is an abstract from bossu on epic poetry which if i had read it before i wrote my letters on the iliad would ha saved me a great deal of what i wrote as it will many things which otherwise i might write on the odyssey it is a most excellent piece and i would have you read it over and over again  i remember when i was very young the fourteenth book of the odyssey pleased me peculiarly and i then minuted down my observations upon it if i recollect right it is the conversation between ulysses or telemachus and eumoeus i have not the volume at hand just now  i am mightily pleased with your last letter it is written clean and carefully the style is good and the observations just and judicious i hope to have more such from you soon in every letter i write i shall transmit my remarks on two books you have prevented me in many  tell me particularly how your mama does and believe me to be  my dear nancy yours unalterably j p  letter lxii oxon march          in the first book of the odyssey we find the misfortunes that befell the companions of ulysses sprung from the very cause whence those in the iliad arose namely an offense to the gods they had committed an affront to apollo  their impious folly dared to prey on herds devoted to the god of day b i v   the next point wherein they resemble each other is in the assistance of heaven in all difficulties being granted to the virtuous obtained by prayer and returned by sacrifice and thanksgiving  the next is in the vengeance of heaven on wicked men i must again recommend to you to read the abstract from bossu prefixed to the odyssey you well observe that hospitality is represented in a most beautiful light in both works  i think all that mr pope and the other commentators have said in the note on verse   0 does not satisfactorily account for this voyage of ulysses and we find the suitors afterward drawing the occasion of a jeer from that very passage or comes from ephyre with poisons fraught and kills us all in one tremendous draught b ii ver   0  to remark some particular passages i go back to the first book the advice given by mentes to telemachus verse     deserves your closest attention the prudent caution at verse     if yet ulysses views the light etc is very remarkable  book ii line    to climb with haughty fires the royal bed etc has been much criticized and not without reason there is something rather too free in the expression  what a natural and affecting picture is given of the old nurse verse  0   she filled the walls with cries and tears ran trickling from her aged eyes the description of telemachuss embarkment and setting sail gives a beautiful close to this book it is as excellent in mr popes translation as it is natural in the original  j p  letter lxiii oxon march  0       my dear i have read over the third and fourth books of the odyssey  the advice which mentor or rather pallas in his shape gives to telemachus at the opening of the third book is most admirably prudent and just  verse    and    are very poetical and instructive to all degrees of life  verse     notwithstanding what mr pope says here about the force of destiny i think no other defense can be made for telemachus than his youth and that impatience which naturally arises from a long endurance of afflictions the answer of pallas which is most admirable certainly points it out  verse     what a charming instance have we here of the power of good advice when delivered in a pleasing amiable way poetry and music united with divine or moral precepts conspire to keep the mind from giving way to temptation  verse     besides that this is a very judicious observation in the poet for the reasons which mr pope assigns in his note it includes an excellent moral precept to mankind  verse     to     what an admirable picture is given us of nestor and his family  book iv verse     i cannot but think it somewhat indecent in telemachus to style his father the man but perhaps this is the fault of the translator i have not the original by me at present to determine it  the stanza at line     is an instance of what i have often remarked to be one great point through the whole work and at verse     we see it again  book v i agree with you that nothing can be more beautiful than the grotto of calypso and the environs but verse     i think is a little obscure the frequent repetition of the word he without a distinction seems to make it so it runs go then he may he must if he ordain would it not have been better thus go then he may he must if jove ordain  perhaps you will say i am cavilling at words but i feel the objection strongly i think too that calling ulysses the man verse     is not so well would not the prince or the chief have done better ver     ulysses robbed him in the cloack and vest appears to me not particular enough there is something too inconsequential for the hero  verse     notwithstanding all that mr pope has said in defense of ulysses being able to complete his boat in four days time from the description of it i think it is hardly probable  the critics have been very severe on these words the wellfought wall verse      you see my observations on this book are rather employed in finding faults than discovering excellencies and i really think mr pope has made more escapes herein than in any i have read yet  the note upon verse     is very fine and merits particular notice  book vi is charming throughout it gives us a delightful picture of the goodnature hospitality paternal affection and simplicity of the manners of the ancients verse     and     perfectly agree which the holy psalmist where he says whosoever gives to the poor lends to the lord pray return to verse  00 and read the note on that

academy at paris and professor of fencing in st dunstans court fleet street  the author of this work humbly presumes that he has offered many considerable improvements in the art of fencing having founded his principles on nature and confuted many false notions hitherto adopted by the most eminent masters he has rendered the play simple and made it easy and plain even to those who were before unacquainted with the art after bringing his scholar as far as the assault and having demonstrated to him all the thrusts and various parades he lays down rules for defense in all sorts of swordplay the monthly reviewers for december last express themselves in the following terms for aught we dare say to the contrary mr oliviers book is a very good book and may help to teach as much as books can

only purpose to which the commonplace book may be successfully applied it is not solely for the divine the lawye the poet philosopher or historian that this publication is calculated by these its uses are experimentally known and universally admitted it is for the use and emolument of the man of business as well as of letters for men of fashion and fortune as well as of study for the traveller the

pleasure    four volumes price   s the phoenix or the history of polyarchus and argenis translated from the latin by a lady  the public is here presented with a new translation of that fine old romance barclays argenis the original has been well known to the learned these   0 years and for the accommodation of the mere english readers two versions of it in our language were given in the course of the last century but the style of these is grown too obsolete for the present age the editor as she chooses to style herself rather than translator has prefixed to the work a very judicious account of the authors design and of the merit of his performance which is as she well observes a romance an allegory and a system of politics considered as an investigation of the various forms of government and of the most proper remedies for the political distempers of a state it will certainly be thought a work of great merit if we make due allowance for the time in which it was written but if regarded only as a work of moral entertainment it will be allowed to stand in the foremost rank of the old romances sacred to chivalry and virtue in brief to use the words of the ingenious editor  barclays argenis affords such variety of entertainment that every kind of reader may find in it something suitable to his own taste and disposition the statesman the philosopher the soldier the lover the citizen the friend of mankind each may gratify his favorite propensity while the reader who comes for amusement only will not go away disappointed monthly review    now first published in two

it would be no easy task to draw a lin that could limit the bounds of its utility the very sensible author of the performance now before us has enumerated some particulars of this kind but to specify all would be a vain attempt what he has observed however in his introduction is just and pertinent  an universal catalogue of vegetable productions is a work of so extensive a nature that to render it useful it ought to be executed with as much brevity as possible and a proper attention to this circumstance is a principal qualification of that before us which appears to contain a larger variety of the various species of plants and shrubs than other performances of the kind the author has restricted himself to the most characteristic descriptions of each vegetable without swelling his work with a multiplicity of synonymous names the english ones however are annexed to the description of every species which is another considerable circumstance in favor of this work  critical review    price

agriculture deduced from a rational philosophy a subject of enquiry which may be considered as of the same importance to an accomplished farmer as the knowledge of the animal economy is to a skilful
