been so hackneyd a practice for authors to pretend that imperfect copies of their works had crept abroad that the writer of the following pastoral is almost ashamed to allege this as the real cause of the present publication this little poem was composed several years ago the authors age eighteen and recited at that time and since by a party of young ladies for which purpose it was originally written by this means some mutilated copies were circulated unknown to the author through many hands  to mrs gwatkin dear madam as the following little poem turns chiefly on the danger of delay or error in the important article of education i know not to whom i can with more propriety dedicate it than to you as the subject it inculcates has been one of the principal objects of your attention in your own family let not the name of dedication alarm you i am not going to offend by making your eulogium panegyric is only necessary to suspicious or common characters virtue will not accept it modesty will not offer it  the friendship with which you have honored me from my very childhood will i flatter myself be exerted in my favor on this occasion and induce you to pardon me for venturning

boast she sends me here to beg your kind indulgent partial ear of critic man she could not stand the test but you with softer gentler hearts are blessed with him she dares not rest her feeble cause

fountains and ye verdant glades from all the gilded misery of the great from all the dull impertinence of state from scenes where daring guilt triumphant reigns it is dark suspicions and it is hoard of pains where pleasure never comes without alloy and art would varnish over fallacious joy where folly crowns the day excess the night and dull satiety succeeds delight where midnight vices their fell orgies keep and guilty revels scare the phantom sleep where dissipation wears the name of bliss from these we fly in search of happiness  euphelia and lo at length propitious to our view behold the spot our anxious hopes pursue these branching oaks which old as time appear proclaim uranias dwelling to be near and see  observe the lowroofd cottage rise not regal domes so grateful to my eyes  pastorella how the description with the scene agrees here lowly thickets there aspiring trees the hazle copse excluding noondays beam the tufted arbor the pellucid stream the blooming sweetbriar and the hawthorn shade the springing cowslips and the daisied mead the wild luxuriance of the fullblown fields which spring prepares and laughing summer yields  euphelia here simple nature strikes the raptured eye with charms which wealth and art but ill supply the genuine graces which without we find display the beauty of the owners mind  laurinda yes be assured this grove contains the cell where

shades allure our eager sight nor lambkin lost our searching steps invite  florella or is it happily yonder branching vine whose trunk the woodbines fragrant tendrils twine whose spreading height with purple clusters crowned attracts the gaze of every nymph around or does the juicy pear your eyes invite whose rich delicious ripeness tempts the sight say is it this or ought i have beside florellas fruits her flowers her fleecy pride  euphelia florella our united thanks receive sole proof of gratitude we have to give and since you deign to ask o courteous fair the motive of our unremitting care know then our wishes terminate in this and what we seek and crave is  happiness  florissa long have we searched throughout this bounteous isle with constant ardor and with ceaseless toil the various ways of various life we have tried but peace sweet peace has ever been denied we have sought in vain through every different state the rich the poor the lowly and the great does she with kings in palaces reside or dwells obscurely far from pomp and pride to learn this truth we have bid a long adieu to all the shadows blinded men pursue  we seek urania her whose virtues fire our virgin hearts to be what we admire report has blazoned her accomplished mind the spotless mansion of the graces joined for though with care she shuns the public eye yet worth like here is can never obscurely lie  laurinda on such a fair and faultless model formed by prudence guided and by virtue warmed perhaps florella can direct our youth and point our footsteps to the paths of truth  florella new as i am to lifes all varying scene scarce knowing yet what vice and virtue mean unskilled in points which sage experience shows i dare not solve the question you propose but would you know the way to perfect bliss which virtue and the virtuous never miss the dame you seek inhabits yonder cell in her united worth and wisdom dwell poor not dejected humble yet not mean cheerful though grave and lively though serene benevolent kind pious gentle just reason her guide and providence her trust if heaven indulgent to her little store adds to that little but a little more with pious praise her grateful heart

propitious fate under her kind protecting wing i live she gives to all  for she has much to give since heaven has blessed her with an ample heart a liberal soul which would to all impart but wise in all it is operations joined a narrow fortune to a noble mind  pastorella her bright perfections charm my listening ear elate with hope we come to seek her here to ask the way to virtue and to bliss of her who boasts supremest happiness  florella doubtless fair nymph from her you may receive advice and prayer the whole she has to give  laurinda lead fair florella to that humble shed where peace resides from courts and cities fled  end of the first dialogue dialogue ii scene a cottage in the grove florissa pastorella euphelia laurinda and florella at a little distance urania flora and eliza come out of the cottage urania ye tender objects of maternal love ye dearest joys urania ever can prove behold another blessed morn arise behold the sun all glorious mount the skies say can you see this animating sight without a fervent pious strong delight does not that sun whose allprolific ray inspires each object to be light and gay does not that vivid power teach every mind to be as warm benevolent and kind to burn with unremitted ardor still like him to execute their makers will then let us power supreme thy will adore invoke thy mercies and proclaim thy power shall thou these benefits in vain bestow shall we forget the source from whence they flow teach us through these to lift ourselves to thee and in the gift the bounteous giver see to view thee as thou art all good and wise nor let thy blessings hide thee from our eyes from all obstructions clear our mental sight pour on our souls thy beatific light teach us thy wondrous goodness to revere with love to worship and with reverence fear in the mild works of thy benignant hand as in the thunder of thy dread command in common objects we neglect thy power nor find a miracle in every flower yet neither hurricanes nor storms proclaim in louder language thy almighty name  tell me my first my last my darling care if you this morn have raised your hearts in prayer say did you rise from the sweet bed of rest your god unpraisd his holy name unblessed  flora with pious thoughts with holiest notions fraught by those pure precepts you have ever taught by great example more than precept strong of prayer and praise we have tuned our matin song  eliza and now we come with duteous joy to attend our best exemplar our maternal friend  florella aside to the ladies who advance see how the goodly dame with pious art makes every thing a lesson to the heart observe the attentive listeners how they stand improvement and delight go hand in hand  urania but where is florella   florella here is the happy she whose dearest blessing next to heaven is thee  urania but what are these in whose attractive mien so sweetly blended every grace is seen  florissa lo humbly to the earth thy servants bend   urania rise fair ones and command your willing friend speak my florella say the cause why here these beauteous damsels on our plains appear  florella invited hither by uranias fame to seek her friendship to these shades they came straying alone at mornings earliest dawn i met them wandering on the desert lawn i courted theirs nor did they shun my love i have brought them here your piety to prove  urania tell me my fair the real reason tell which brings such guests to grace my lowly cell ask what we have to give  it is not ours heaven has but lent it us to make it yours  florissa your counsel your advice is all we ask and for urania that is no irksome task it is happiness we seek o deign to tell where the coy fugitive delights to dwell  urania ah rather say where you have sought this guest this lovely inmate of the virtuous breast avow the various methods you have essayed to court and win the bright celestial maid but first though harsh the task each beauteous fair her taste and temper must with truth declare  euphelia bred in the regal splendors of a court where pleasures dressed in every shape resort i tried the power of pomp and costly glare nor ever thought nor ever formed a prayer in different follies every hour i spent reflection always on some errand sent without reflection whence could rise content my hours were shared betwixt the park and play and music served to waste the tedious day yet softest airs no more with joy i heard soon as some sweeter warbler was preferred the dance succeeded and succeeding tired if some more graceful dancer was admired no sounds but flattery ever soothed my ear ungentle truths i knew not how to bear in drawingrooms my dull pale vigils spent with ardor sought but found not there content the siren mocked me with delusive charms i grasped  the shadow fled my eager arms the scorpion envy goaded still my breast some newer beauty robbed my soul of rest or if my elegance of form prevailed and happily her inferior graces failed yet still some cause of wretchedness i found some barbed shaft my shattered peace to wound perhaps her gay attire exceeded mine  when she was finer how could i be fine  flora pardon my interruption beauteous maid can truth have prompted what you just have said do you believe it possible that dress can lessen or advance your happiness or that your robes though splendid rich and fine possess intrinsic value more than mine  eliza is nature then to folly so allied that what makes human shame makes human pride or moves mankind by customs slavish rule and is it fashion constitutes the fool  florissa another source my melancholy draws the effects the same though different is the cause i sighed for fame i languishd for renown i would be praised caressed admired and know on daring wing my mounting spirit soared and science through her boundless fields explored i scorned the salique laws of pedant schools which chain our genius down by tasteless rules i longed to burst these female bonds which held by passion prompted and by fame impelled to boast each various faculty of mind thy graces pope with johnsons learning joined like swift with strongly pointed ridicule to brand the villain and abash the fool to judge with taste with spirit to compose now mount in epic now descend to prose steal flowers from burke at once sublime and sweet from mason numbers and from colman wit thy talents melmoth hume thy polished page all hammonds softness and all drydens rage i pined for passion sentiment and style to weep with otway and with goldsmith smile with poignant stern now laugh the hours away or court the muse of elegy with gray with langhorne fancys fairy walks to range and please like langhorne howsoeer i change abstruser studies soon my fancy caught the poet in the astronomer forgot newton and leibnitz now my thoughts inspired and numbers less than calculations fired descartes and euclid shared my varying breast and plans and problems all my soul possessed less pleased to sing inspiring phoebus ray than mark the flaming comets devious way the pale moon dancing on the silver stream and the mild luster of her trembling beam no more could charm my philosophic pride which sought her influence on the flowing tide no more could sylvan beauties strike my thought which only facts and demonstrations sought let common eyes i said with transport view the earths bright verdure or the heavens soft blue false is the pleasure the delight is vain colors exist but in the vulgar brain i now with lock trod metaphysic soil and searched the microscopic world with boil sighed for their fame but feared to share their toil the laurel wreath in fond idea twined to grace my learned temples i designed these were my notions these my constant themes my daily longings and my nightly dreams the idol fame my bosom robbed of rest too small the mansion for so great a guest  pastorella to me no joys could pomp or fame impart far softer thoughts possessed my virgin heart no prudent parent formed my ductile youth nor pointed out the lovely paths of truth left to myself to cultivate my mind pernicious novels their soft entrance find their poisonous influence led my mind astray i sighed for something what i could not say i died for heroes who have never been and fancied virtues which were never seen i sickend with disgust at sober sense and loathed the pleasures worth and truth dispense contemned the manners of the world i saw fiction my nature and romance my law strange images my wandering fancy fill each wind a zephyr and each brook a rill i found adventures in each common tale and talked and sighed to every passing gale conversed with echoes woods and shades and bowers cascades and grottoes fields and streams and flowers folly within my heart her empire found my passions floating and my judgment drowned reason perverted fancy on her throne my soul to all my sexes softness prone i neither spoke nor looked as mortal ought by sense abandoned and by fancy taught a victim to imaginations sway which stole my health and rest and peace away professions void of meaning i received and still i found them false  and still believed imagined all who courted me approved who praised esteemed me and who flattered loved fondly i hoped now vain those hopes appear each man was faithful and each maid sincere still disappointment mocked the lingering day still newborn wishes kept my soul in play when in the rolling year no joy i find i trust the next the next will sure be kind the next fallacious as the last appears and sends me on to still remoter years they come  they promise but forget to give i live not but i still intend to live at length deceived in all my schemes of bliss i joined these three in search of happiness  eliza is this the world of which we want a sight are these the beings who are called polite  flora if so oh gracious heaven hear floras prayer preserve me still in humble virtue here far from such baneful pleasures may i live and keep o keep me from the taint they give  laurinda till now i have slept on lifes tumultuous tide no principle of action for my guide from ignorance my chief misfortunes flow i never wished to learn or cared to know with every folly slowpaced time beguiled in size a woman but in soul a child in slothful ease my moments crept away and busy trifles filled the tedious day i lived extempore as fancy fired as chance directed or caprice inspired too indolent to think too weak to choose too soft to blame too gentle to refuse i took my coloring from the world around the figures they my mind the simple ground fashion with monstrous forms the canvas stained till nothing of my genuine self remained my pliant soul from chance received it is bent and neither good performed or evil meant from right to wrong from vice to virtue thrown no character possessing of it is own though not by nature to a vice inclined a drear vacuity possessed my mind too old to be with infant sports amused unfit for converse and to books unused the wise avoided me they could not hear my senseless prattle with a patient ear disgusted restless every plan amiss i come with these in search of happiness  florissa united thus by some uncommon fate resolved on virtue if not yet too late we formed a friendship which through life shall last and vows and choice and love have bound it fast we laid our elegant attire aside  euphelia euphelia thought it hard to put off pride   pastorella each left her title and exchanged her name   florissa an act florissa hopes will merit fame   urania your candor beauteous damsels i approve your foibles pity and your merits love how few o sacred virtue can acquire that heartfelt transport thy pure flames inspire but ere i say the methods you must try to gain the glorious prize for which you sigh your fainting strength and spirits must be cheered with a plain meal by temperance prepared  florella no luxury our humble board attends but love and concord are it is smiling friends   they retire into the cottage end of the second dialogue dialogue iii scene the inside of the cottage a rural entertainment urania flora eliza florella pastorella euphelia florissa laurinda during the repast florella sings the following song i how kind is that power who has first sent us meat and then has with appetites blessed us to eat let the rich and the great and the vain and the gay still ridicule wisdom and all she can say ii in beautiful nature no charm can they find the pleasures they follow a sting leave behind can criminal passion enrapture the breast like virtue protected or innocence blessed iii o would you ye great ones her impulse attend no longer at luxurys shrine would you bend our mornings are cheerful our labors are blessed our evnings are pleasant our nights crowned with rest iv our water is drawn from the clearest of springs and our fruits are as ripe as yours or your kings of how little use then to us were your wealth when without it we purchase both pleasure and health  they rise and come forward urania thus pass the tranquil hours of rural ease where life is bliss and pleasures truly please  laurinda with joy we view the dangers we have past assured we have found felicity at last  florella i weep to think how greatly you mistake but youth will ever rash conclusions make judge no man happy by his outward air all may within be bitterness and care though the full heart with agony be rent prudence will wear the semblance of content seclude it is anguish from the public sight and feed on sorrow with a sad delight fly every eye to cherish darling grief this fond indulgence it is supreme relief to show contentment treads not human ground nor can in any state of life be found know that urania that accomplished fair whose virtues make her heavens peculiar care even she who merits every joy to know has deeply drained the bitter cup of woe with those sad eyes she weeps a husband dead with those poor hands she earns her infants bread in affluence born and bred in splendid state she feels the cruellest extreme of fate yet noble and superior to distress she knows the hand which wounds has power to bless instead of murmuring at his sacred will grateful she bows for what he leaves her still remembers who to erring man did spare one son exempt from sin but none from care  pastorella blessed be that power divine who brought us here   urania dear to my arms and to my heart most dear of all the various evils which infest the human mind and rob it of it is rest our highest happiness and heaviest woe from good or evil education flow and hence our future dispositions rise the ill we fly from or the good we prize mistaken damsels could you hope for bliss the slaves of errors you yourselves confess euphelia sighs for flattery dress and show the too too common source of female woe in beautys sphere preeminence to find she slights the great improvements of the mind i would not rail at beautys charming power i would but have her aim at something more beauty with reason need not quite dispense and coral lips may sure speak common sense beauty makes virtue most divinely rare virtue makes beauty more than mortal fair confirms it is conquest over the yielding mind and those your beauties gain your virtues bind would you ye fair the bright example give fired with ambition men like you would live would choose for merit and esteem for sense and taste the solid transports these dispense no more would rakes disdain the shackled life nor scorn that poor neglected thing  a wife but shunning each delusive path of sin all joy without all sweet content within would rouse at virtues and at honors voice and love from reason whom they liked from choice then marriage would with peace go hand in hand and concords temple close to hymens stand each might be blessed would each in turn submit nor man affect control nor woman wit discord begun how seldom does it cease it is the first difference breaks the chain of peace abhor beginnings  always dread the worst admit a doubt and youre completely cursed it is follies more than vices that destroy not sin but weakness taints the nuptial joy let woman then her real good discern and her true interests of urania learn her lowest name  the tyrant of an hour and her best empire negligence of power by yielding she obtains the noblest sway and reigns despotic when she seems to obey  euphelia i find how those mistake the way to bliss who in externals look for happiness tutored by thee no more the men shall find the power of flattery over euphelias mind it is the weak avenue the unguarded part which lets in vice directly to the heart  urania i pity pastorellas hapless fate by nature gentle generous mild yet great one false propension all her powers confined and chained her finer faculties of mind how all the virtues might have triumphed there with early culture and maternal care if good we plant not vice will fill the mind and weeds despoil the space for flowrs designed the human heart never knows a state of rest from bad to worse from better on to best we either gain or lose we sink or rise nor rests poor struggling nature till she dies it is the disease most fatal to the soul to stop the race before we have reached the goal for naught our farther progress can preclude so much as thinking we are already good then place the standard of fair virtue high pursue and grasp it even beyond the sky  pastorella i mourn the errors of my thoughtless youth and long with thee to tread the paths of truth  urania learning is all the fair florissas aim she seeks the loftiest pinnacle of fame would she the privilege of man invade learning for female minds was never made taste elegance and talents may be ours but learning suits not our less vigorous powers learning but roughens polished taste refines dacier less lovely than sevigne shines know fair aspirer could you even hope to speak like stonhouse or to write like pope to join like ferneys or like hagleys sage the historic ethic and poetic page with all the powers of wit and judgment fraught the flow of style and the sublime of thought yet if the milder graces of the mind graces peculiar to the sex designed goodnature patience sweetness void of art if these embellished not your virgin heart you might be dazzling but not truly bright a pompous glare but not an useful light a meteor not a star you would appear for woman shines but in her proper sphere as some fair violet loveliest of the glade sheds it is soft perfumes on the lonely shade withdraws it is modest head from public sight nor courts the sun nor seeks the glare of light should some rude hand profanely dare intrude and bear it is beauties from it is native wood exposed abroad it is languid colors fly it is form decays and all it is odors die so woman born to dignify retreat unknown to flourish and unseen be great to give domestic life it is sweetest charm with softness polish and with virtue warm fearful of fame unwilling to be known should seek but heavens applauses and her own no censures dread but those which crimes impart the censures of a selfcondemning heart with angelkindness should behold distress and meekly pity where she cannot redress like beaming mercy wipe afflictions tear but to herself not justice so severe her passions all corrected or subdued but one the virtuous thirst of doing good this great ambition still she calls her own this best ambition makes her breast it is throne  florissa confused with shame to thy reproofs i bend thou best adviser and thou truest friend from thee i will learn to judge and act aright humility with reading to unite the finished character must both combine the perfect woman must in either shine  urania laurindas dark untutored mind may show what ills from want of education flow wisdom and virtue no dominion keep over passions not reindin but fast asleep passions are treasures if they are managed right and make the lamp of reason burn more bright how growing virtues fortify by time and how illhabits strengthen into crime those squandered hours which nothing can replace might have enriched her soul with every grace accomplishments by heaven were first designed less to adorn than to amend the mind each should contribute to this general end and all to virtue as their center tend the acquirements which our best esteem invite should not project but soften mix unite in glaring light not strongly be displayed but sweetly lost and melted into shade  laurinda o that important time could back return laurinda then should have no cause to mourn accept just heaven my penitence sincere my heartfelt anguish and my fervent prayer  urania florella shines with more than human grace her heart all goodness as all charms her face reason in her to pure religion tends subservient only to the noblest ends true pietys the magnet of the soul which upwards points immortal bliss the pole above the wretched and below the great kind heaven has placed her in a middling state from rich and poor at equal distance thrown the smile invidious and the insulting frown the demon fashion never warped her soul her passions move at reasons wise control her eyes the movements of her heart declare for what she dares to be she dares appear unlecturd in dissimulations school to smile by precept and to blush by rule no pain she knows for guilt she never knew to friendship faithful and to honor true she smooths the path of my declining years and looks with me beyond this vale of tears her thoughts are rational her virtue pure  a virtuous mind is happiness secure no accident can ever make it less nor any outward circumstance increase content alone in virtue we can find and happiness exists but in the mind  florissa let us join to bless that power who brought us here adore his goodness and his will revere assured that health content and peace of mind are all the blessings man on earth can find  florella and a chorus of nymphs sing this song whilst beauty and pleasure are now in their prime and folly and fashion expect our whole time ah let not these phantoms our wishes engage let us live so in youth that we blush not in age let us try to get charms which will never decay nor listen to all that deceivers can say how the tints of the rose and the jessmines persume the eglantines fragrance the lilacs gay bloom though fair and though fragrant unheeded may lie for that neither is sweet when florella is by i sigh not for beauty nor lauguish for wealth but grant me kind providence virtue and health then richer than kings yes and proud too as they my days shall pass sweetly and swiftly away for when time shall admonish that youth is no more and age wrinkled age threatens loud at my door what charm then in beauty or wealth should i find my treasure my wealth is a sweet peace of mind reflexions a heaven which on earth we enjoy to look forward is transport and backward is joy thus virtue and wisdom shall warm the cold scene and sixty shall flourish as gay as sixteen and when long i the burden of life shall have borne and death with his sickle shall cut the ripe corn resigned to my fate without murmur or sigh i will bless the kind summons and lie down and die urania now strike with sprightly airs the violin and virgins now the festive dance begin  music and a rural dance the end prologue to hamlet
