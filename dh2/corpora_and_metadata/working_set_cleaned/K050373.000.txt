bate bradwelllodge nov    th      advertisement to prepare massingers tragicomedy the picture for a modern entertainment proved a more arduous task than was at first conceived after giving a different turn to the drama by making the changes of the picture the effects of eugeniuss jealousy instead of the magic art of baptista and expunging the gross indelicacies which overran the play it was found that most of the characters required a little fresh modelling to complete the design of the present undertaking hence the necessity of newwriting no inconsiderable part of the dialogue in imitation of the old dramatist though enamoured with the beauties of the antique structure the alterer set about its reparation with the utmost dissidence fearing like an unskilful architect he might destroy those venerable features he could not improve what has been his success the public decision must determine  the same kind of irregular and broken measure through necessity still prevails except where the language could be reduced to the heroic verse without impairing the spirit of the dialogue  as to the unities  being so totally disregarded by massinger himself no use could possibly be made of them

occasion mr shield aided it with his harmonic powers and every performer by a well sustained character united in it is support but miss younges sophia was too striking a representation not to demand a

passions i must know farther or you have made good but half your promise while my love stood by holding here is upright  how thus untempted could she give proof of welltried constancy but when i am

she will  eugenius these doubts must be made certainties by your assurance or your boasted art will lose its admiration  baptista i cannot dive into her hidden thoughts and learn her close intents

i ask no more  baptista take then this little model of sophia with more than human skill portrayed each line and lineament of the drawing so punctually observed that had it motion twould even dispute

much have you engaged me by this favor that the service of my life will scarce repay it adieu  baptista not yet for i have more to impart that as we ride along for i am not quite so old but i may see

is of moment  ubaldo to those who carry lives in either army  ricardo was it cheerfully received by the king  ubaldo so so  soon however as assured the lines approached within each others view he dispatched an officer to ferdinand with absolute authority from him to try the fortune of the day  ricardo the general then no doubt will fight it bravely heaven prosper him this military art i grant to be the noblest of professions and yet i thank my stars i never was inclined to learn it for that bubble honor the pretty nothing for which these soldiers fight is in my judgment of too dear a purchase  ubaldo give me our court warfare eh ricardo the dangers not so great in the encounter of a mistress  the conflict there costs no limbs  thou by thy own report ricardo wast a wag when young and since that time have studied every rank from the night trader in the street with certain danger to thy pocket to the gay highflier in the cabinet  ricardo you talk ubaldo as though you would appear a novice in loves mysteries or perhaps my better genius gives you cause for envy  ubaldo no thanks to my stars i no man envy from my own want or his abundance to tell thee plainly being as you see the likelier man and of much more experience there is no beauty but yields ere it be summoned and as nature has stamped me the monopolist of maidens there is no man can buy till i have made my market  ricardo ha ha ha  ubaldo as i live i jest not why i would part with half my estate nay travel over the globe to find that only phoenix in my search that could wing out of my sure shot  ricardo who will dare doubt the dexterity of him that twangs so long a bow pray what do you think of the queen  ubaldo no no ricardo i never yet did aim at the liproyal  that i still except yet were she not our sovreigns own soft dove i would venture this neck to a halter to write her in my amorous catalogue  ricardo have you but marked with what reserve she looks when the king himself makes his approach to her as she were still a virgin and his life but one continued wooing  ubaldo yes and how she often has swoond when she has heard of other women famed for charms or honors  ricardo i marvel that she does not banish hence all other female virtue from her court  ubaldo well where twill end i know not for the king is so indulgent to her humors that even now when both his crown and life are at the stake he only studies her content  and when she is pleased to show herself music and masks are with all care and cost provided  ricardo this night she promised to appear  ubaldo she did and will no doubt for prithee mark the bustle of her royal harbinger  enter ladislaus eubulus and attendants with perfumes ladislaus these rooms are not perfumed as we directed  eubulus no sir i am sure the odorous incense cost treble the price of the whole weeks provision spent in your royal household  ladislaus how eubulus when my honoria descends to sanctify a place and make for me a temple say were it not profane to deck it only with a careless hand  eubulus well since you so closely hug your fetters in loves name wear them you are king and that concludes you wise  for me i do subscribe

to adoration look not on her heaven how he fawns and with what assured gravity she takes it as if it were his duty oh she at last vouchafes her hand and as if he had sucked nectar from it how he is exalted  she is about to speak what oracles shall we hear now  honoria since you are pleased with such assurances of love and favor to grace your handmaid but in being yours sir a matchless queen i am bound in gratitude to deserve the grace conferred upon me  ladislaus you transcend in all things madam and it is my glory to depose myself from absolute command  surrendering up my will and faculties to your disposure and here i vow not for a day or year but my whole life that whatsoever i in justice may exact from these my subjects you from me may boldly challenge  and when you require it in sign of my subjection as your vassal thus will i pay my homage kneels to her  honoria o forbear sir let not my lips envy my robe on them print your allegiance often i desire no other tribute  ladislaus

the privilege of his bonnet tauntingly  ladislaus do not tempt me  ricardo aside a devilish rough councellor this  ubaldo the king seems all amazement  ricardo the queen too has her share of deep imaginations eubulus has put both to it  ubaldo now she seems resolved  ricardo i long to know the issue  honoria give me leave dear sir to reprehend you for appearing perplexed with what this privileged old man has in his taunting irony applied  you know it was your own delight to sue to me with more humility than i desired yet twas my duty to obey i do but act the part you put upon me and though you make me personate a queen and you my subject when the play your pleasure is at an end i then am what i was still your humble wife and you my king  ricardo admirable on my troth  honoria to eubulus and now to your wise lordship has my king cause to repent the excess of favor to me which you dislike speak nay boldly too for i am not ignorant what i can deserve and may with justice challenge  eubulus this i looked for after a seeming humble ebb i knew a gushing tide would follow aside  honoria by my birth and liberal gifts of nature as of fortune from you as what is beneath me i expect what is due to majesty in which i am a sharer with your sovereign  eubulus good again  honoria and as i am most eminent in place in all my actions i would appear so  ladislaus you need not fear a rival  honoria i hope not and till i find one i disdain to know what envy is  ladislaus you are above it madam  honoria for beauty without art discourse and free from affectation with what graces else can in the wife and daughter of a king be wished i dare prefer myself  eubulus does the court afford no oiltongud parasite that you are forced to be your own gross flatterer  ladislaus be dumb

thou shall be the best of hillarios for she has drank too often the bitter cup a pleasant one must now restore her but think you she will endure a jest about his death since for his absence only she so grieves  hillario um that is a question which a widow only can resolve and therefore worth the trying there be who in their husbands sickness have wept their pottle of tears a day but being assured at midnight he was dead in the morning dried up their handkerchiefs and thought no more on it  corisca tush she is none of that race if her sorrow be not true woman never wept in earnest she has made herself a prisoner to her chamber dark as a dungeon in which no beam of comfort enters  hillario and yet there may be mischief done in a dark bedchamber nay i have heard as much  corisca pooh she admits no visits this hour she takes the air with fondest hope to receive assurance from some that may pass by of the success and safety of her lord now if your device will take   hillario never fear

meteor i appear hung in the air between my hopes and fears and every hour that yields a waning light to dying comfort i do expect my fall and certain ruin in wretched things more wretched is delay dreams and fantastic visions walk their round about my widowed bed and every slumbers broke with loud alarms can these be then but sad presages girl  corisca you make em so and antedate a loss shall never befall you such pure affection such mutual love a house without contention in two bodies one will and soul like to the rod of concord kissing each other cannot be short lived  sophia o corisca

hillario no all mere word of mouth in the camp we use no pens but write with swords know he is in health and what is more full of glory and now i will proclaim his matchless deeds but tremble not while i relate the wonder though i declare it in a voice of thunder  sophia this is some counterfeit braggard  corisca nay hear him madam  hillario the rear marched first which followed by the van and winged with the swift battalia no man durst stay to shift his shirt or disencumber it of its hopeful stock yet ever the armies joined that pickled elf thy dainty duckling bold eugenius advanced with gallant stride like hercules a hundred thousand turks it is no vaunt assailed him with their bashaws of nine tails but how did he receive them with his keen lance he did so cut and carbonade em that one half fled  but to other wanting legs and arms could neither fight nor follow  sophia this is ridiculous  hillario i must take breath then like a nightingale i will sing his death  corisca his death  hillario on my troth i am out my wit forsakes me aside  corisca recover dunderhead aside  hillario how he escaped i should have sung not died for though a knight when i said so i fibbd weary he was and scarce could stand an end when looking round for some courageous knight to rescue him as one perplexed in woe he called to me  help help hillario  corisca he has spoiled all aside  sophia are you the man of arms then i will make bold to take off your martial beaver you had fools hair enough without it  slave how dare thou make thy sport of what concerns me more than life in such an antic

soldier at least  sophia hence buffoon i never but with reverence name my lord and shall i hear him by thy tongue profaned but since you are transformed and turned knight errant take your course and wander where you please for here i vow by my lords life an oath i will not break till his return or certainty of his safety my doors are shut against thee  exit sophia corisca you have made a fine piece of work on it how do you like your reward you had a foolish itch to be an actor and may now stroll about where you please  hillario will you buy my share of the profit corisca  corisca no i fear i have already too much of mine own  and so dear don quixote taking my leave i leave you to your new fortune  exit corisca hillario have i cudgelled my poor brain for this rare invention to be thus rewarded  i could turn tragedian and roar amain but that i fear twould get me too large a stomach having no meat to satisfy her cravings  ah poor me i cannot beg in armor that would dishonor more than myself and steal i dare not  my end must be to stand in a corn field and fright away the crows for bread and cheese or find some hollow tree in the highway and there sell switches till my lords return  exit hillario scene ii enter eubulus ricardo and ubaldo with wands of office eubulus i like the issue of this stubborn battle are the officers gone as by the king directed to receive the gallant general  ricardo long since and ere this have greeted him  eubulus you know your office lords on his arrival  ubaldo who we oh fear not us my lord i pray we know our distance and degrees  ricardo the state were miserable truly if the court had none of her own breed familiar with all the gaits of form and punctilio to receive its visitors  ubaldo it is a great pity that such as sit at the helm provide no better for the training up of the gentry  in my judgment an academy erected with large pensions to such as miraculously speak in the congees cringes postures and the phrase proper to every nation  ricardo o it were an admirable piece of work  ubaldo and yet rich fools throw away their charity on hospitals for beggars and lame soldiers and never study the due regard to compliment and court breeding  eubulus our court needs no aid this way since it is a school of nothing else there are some of you whom i forbear to name whose coining heads are the mint of all new fashions that have done more hurt to the kingdom by superflous foppery which the foolish gentry imitate than a war or a long famine all the treasure by this foul excess is got into the hands of silkmen tailors and embroiderers nay the third part of the land too our nobles engrossing titles only  ubaldo my lord you are bitter  ricardo sharp as a hoarfrost a trumpet  enter a servant servant the general is alighted and now entered  ricardo were he ten generals i am prepared and know what i will do  ubaldo prythee what ricardo  ricardo why i will fight at compliments with him  ubaldo will you then i will

prattle taught in your academy of compliments to ric and ubal  ferdinand nay i will present you to the king myself  eugenius that is a grace will go beyond my merit  ferdinand you undervalue what i cannot set too high a price on  eubulus with a friends true heart i congratulate your return  ferdinand next to the favor of my prince i am happy in your friendship  ubaldo by courtliness coarse enough on both sides  ferdinand pray you receive this stranger by our knowledge on my credit at all parts he deserves it  eubulus your report is a strong assurance to me  sir most welcome  eugenius the reverence of your age commands me to believe it  ricardo this was pretty  ubaldo but now for my attack  apart  you will second me  ricardo i cannot stoop so low to do your excellence that due observance which your fortune claims  eubulus the prig forgets his virtue and his valor  ricardo for being as you are the soul of soldiers and bulwark of bellona   ubaldo the protection both of the court and king   ricardo and the sole minion of mighty mars  eubulus hey dey  ricardo it being impossible in my arms to circle such giant worth   ubaldo at distance we presume to kiss your honored gauntlet  eubulus what reply now can he make to this foppery  ferdinand you have said gallants so much and hitherto done so little that till i learn to speak and you to act i must take time to thank you  eubulus as i live answered as i could wish how the fops gape now  ricardo this was harsh and scurvy  ubaldo we will be revenged when he comes into the circle of the court ladies  eubulus nay do your offices gentlemen and conduct the general to the presence  ricardo keep your order  ubaldo make way for the general exeunt scene iii the royal saloon the curtain rising discovers ladislaus

our court delights but first from your relation with delighted ears i will hear the music of your war which must be sweet ending in victory  ferdinand not to trouble your majestys with the description of a battle too full of horror for the place i will be as brief as possible it was well fought on both sides and almost with equal fortune it continuing doubtful upon whose tents plumed victory would take her glorious stand impatient of delay with the flower of our prime gentlemen i charged their main battalia and with their assistance broke in but when i was almost assured they were routed by a stratagem of the subtle turk rallying up his troops on either side i found myself so far engaged for i must not conceal my faults that i knew not which way with honor to retreat  eubulus i like a general that tells his faults and is not ambitious to engross unto himself all honor as some have in which with justice they could not claim a share  ferdinand being thus hemmed in their scymetars raged amongst us and my horse killed under me i every minute looked for an honorable end and that was all my hope could fashion to me circled thus with death and horror as one sent from heaven this man of men with some choice horse that followed to eugenius his brave example did pursue the track his sword cut for them and but that i see him already blush to hear what he being present i know would wish unspoken i should say sir by what he did we boldly may believe all that is writ of ancient heroes  eugenius general pray spare the feelings of an humble soldier  eubuius do not blush to hear a truth here are a pair of monsieurs to ubaldo and ricardo had they been in your place would have run away and never changed countenance  ubaldo we have your good word still  eubulus and shall

under his strong arm more with his looks frighted the valiant fled with which encouraged my soldiers like young eagles preying under the wings of their fierce dam bravely came on by him i was remounted inspired with treble courage and such as fled before boldly made head again and to confirm em it suddenly was apparent that the fortune of the day was ours each soldier and commander performed his part but this was the great wheel by which the lesser moved and all rewards and signs of honor to him alone belong  ladislaus and they shall deservedly fall on him to the banquet now  prepare to entertain em the masks retire repeating the chorus honoria permit me sir to hope that your commanders especially this stranger may as i in my discretion shall think good receive what is due to their deserts  ladislaus what you determine shall know no alteration  eubulus the soldier is like to have good usage when he depends upon her pleasure  honoria with you sir to eugenius i will begin and as in my esteem you are most eminent expect to have what is fit for me to give and you to take bring me my casket and with speed acanthe goes out and returns immediately with a casket see here the lapidarys idol gold is trash a poor salary fit for grooms  wear these as studed stars within your circling shield call them honorias gift who loves not a valiant soldier yet not to take from the magnificence of the king i will dispense his bounty too but as a page to wait on mine for other losses take an hundred thousand crowns your hand dear sir and this shall be thy warrant takes off the kings signet are you pleased sir with what i have done  ladislaus yes my queen and confirm it with this addition of mine own you have sir from our loved queen received some recompense for your life hazarded in the late action and that we may follow her great example in cherishing her love ask what your heart can wish  eugenius if wealth were my ambition by the queen i am made rich already to the amazement of all that see or shall hereafter read the story of her bounty  if to spend the remnant of my life in deeds of arms no region is more fertile of good knights from whom my knowledge that way may be bettered than this your warlike hungary  but alas sir i am not my own being by destiny which i cannot resist forced to prefer my countrys homely smoke before the fire with which your bounties warm me  all then i ask dread sir is but your gracious license for my departure  ladislaus whither  eugenius to my own home sir just on the frontier of your realm my own poor home which will at my return grow rich by your munificence i am here but a body without a soul and till i find it in the embraces of a constant wife whose beauteous excellencies know no rival i am but half myself  honoria and is she then so chaste and fair as you infer have i lived to hear this aside  eugenius o madam though it must argue weakness in me thus to show my wealth before an armed host by praising of my wife only to fan the flame of love in others to admire her such is my confidence in her virtue though in my absence she were now besieged by a strong party of lascivious wooers  here is the assurance of her unsappd honor kisses the picture  ladislaus what is that  honoria how  have i lived to hear my fame excelled aside  ladislaus nay frown not sweetest the cyprian queen compared to you in my opinion

picture no my sophias still the same  the same pure crystal rock of innocence perish all allurements that may alter me  the snow of her sweet chastity has quite put out the fire that but even now

am still perplexed and troubled and when most confirmed it is true a curious jealousy to be assured by what means and from whom such a mass of wealth was first deserved then gotten cunningly steals in

life eubal hems plague on it how fast the minutes glide away aside pray you fair lady to excuse my manners i left a letter in my chamber window which i would not have seen on any terms fie on my carelessness  but this i will soon dispatch withdraws  sophia this is strange his letters said these jewels were presented him by the queen as a reward for his good service what can all this mean

necklace of paulina a rich courtezan worn but a day when she married old gonzago and left off trading  sophia oh my heart  ubaldo this chain of pearl was a great widows that invited your lord to a masque and the weather proving foul he lodged in her house all night  and merry they were but how he came by it i know not  sophia perjured man  ubaldo o there is not a single gem or jewel in the court but may be at his command  sophia agitated i commend him but i pray you leave me a little to myself  enter ricardo ubaldo you may command your servant madam she is stung to the quick  to ric

into your care the guard of innocence aid me for i am a creature so forfeited to despair hope cannot fancy a ransom to redeem me i begin to waver in my faith and make it doubtful whether the saints so canonized for their holiness of life sinned not in secret since my eugenius is fallen from his virtue in such an open fashion could it be else that such a husband so devoted to me so vowed to temperance  for unhallowed gifts should thus to wantons sacrifice his fame was it for this he left me was it not enough to cloth me with the shame but he must make me wear their amorous spoils here will i tear them off and with my tears their poison wash away  yet hold who knows but these are false and wanton knaves who traduce his honor with the basest views his longtryd love a different tale relates and bids me not too rashly censure him at least these lords with keener eye i will read ere i impute to him so foul a deed ex end of act the third act iv scene i enter eugenius eugenius this

will clear my eyesight  perhaps melancholy makes me see that which is not  enter baptista baptista what is it there you see  eugenius indeed baptista it is but too apparent i grieve to look upon it  besides the yellow that does assure she is tempted  i think i see a sable color spread its baneful hue over every line of her once lovely face confirming both her own and my dishonor  baptista aside  well may they say that monster jealousy creates the food it feeds on  indeed i see no alteration  eugenius fact baptista make not yourself a pandar to her vices in laboring to palliate what a mask of impudence cannot cover  did woman ever in her will decline from chastity but found means to give her passion scope  more possible is it with my single arm to underprop a falling tower  or in its violent course to stop the forked lightning than to stay a wanton woman  baptista pray you temper the violence of your passion  eugenius oh my baptista i am headlong thrown into a gulf of misery and find myself past hope  this figure of my idol so late that chaste and lovely mirror is to a magic glass transformed and shows nothing but horror and deformity  baptista i am sure you do her wrong  eugenius have i refused a queen whose soft beauties had ravished at first sight a hermit from his beads and changed his prayers to amorous sonnets to preserve my faith inviolate to thee with the hazard of my death with tortures to be thus requited yet hold  i will not curse thee sophia nor for thy falsehood rail against the sex it is poor and common i will only whisper unto myself however they seem nor present past nor ages yet to come have heretofore can now or ever shall produce one constant woman  baptista this is more than the satirists wrote against em  eugenius there is no language that can express the poison of these aspics these weeping crocodiles and all too little that has been said against em  but i will mould my thoughts into another form and if she can outlive

to drag me from your arms it should not fright me  honoria pause yet a little  the bounties of the king and what weighs more your boasted constancy to your matchless wife should not too soon be shaken  eugenius the whole fabric when i but look on you is in a moment overturned and as flowing rivers lose their names when by the ocean swallowed in you alone all faculties of my soul are wholly taken up my wife and king are naught but things forgotten  honoria can this be possible fortune here i thank thee for my purpose now is gained aside  eugenius wherefore stay ye madam why muse ye so  honoria to think how poor an empty nothing is mans constancy  eugenius your beauties make it so in me sweet lady  honoria and it is my glory i could be coy now as you were but i am of a gentler temper however in a just return of what i have suffered in your disdain with the same measure grant me equal deliberation i ever long will visit you again and when i next appear as conquered by it slavelike wait on my

homilies to her in the dark she is bound to it by her canons  ladislaus still tormented with thy impertinence  honoria by yourself dear sir i was ambitious only to overthrow his boasted constancy in his consent but for fact i contemn him i was never unchaste in thought i labored to give proof what power dwells in this beauty you admire so and when you see how soon it has transformed him as strait you shall and with what superstition he adores it determine as you please exit ladislaus well i will observe the issue  eubulus how had you took this general in your wife  ferdinand as a strange

lists  eugenius and i prepared to meet her  baptista i know my duty going  honoria not so you may stay now as a witness of our contract  baptista i obey in all things madam  honoria where is that reverence or rather superstitious adoration which captivelike to my triumphant beauty you paid last night no humble knee nor sign of vassal duty then you freely swore your certain loss of life in the kings anger was far too mean a price to buy my favor and that false glowworm fire of constancy to your wife extinguished by a brighter light shot from our eyes  eugenius i do remember i once saw such a woman  honoria ha  eugenius and then she did appear a most magnificent queen and what is more virtuous though somewhat shaded with pride and self opinion  eubulus call you this courtship  eugenius and she was happy in a royal husband whom envy could not tax unless it were for his too much indulgence to her humor  eubulus pray sir observe that touch it is to the purpose  eugenius you yet retain some part of her angelic form but when envy to the beauty of another woman one she had never seen but in this picture had spread infection through her veins  honoria i like not this aside  eugenius

and glorious like seeming shadows wanting real substance vanished  honoria how his reasoning works upon me  eugenius retire into yourself fair queen there your own breast is strongly nervd by virtue be but as you were and there is no office so low to which a man may stoop but i will gladly bow to but as you play and juggle with a stranger varying your shapes like thetis though beauties such as

deceived me  ladislaus i am charmed with what i have seen and heard they come forward  honoria how have i wandered out of the track of honor and mislead by the oerweening pride and flattery of fawning sycophants could never meet till now a passenger that in his charity would stay me in my precipice to ruin how ill when you know all have i returned your goodness to me the horror in my thoughts often turns me marble what can i do to show my deep contrition kneels to the king  ladislaus pray you rise  honoria never till you have forgiven and received unto your love and favor a changed woman my state and pride turned to humility henceforth shall wait on your commands  ladislaus all is forgot and this fair change shall prove a second and a happier union to us  honoria why did you make me rise my loving lord till with a free confession of a crime unknown as yet to you i asked a suit  ladislaus whatever it be my lips do thus confirm it kisses her hand  honoria know then in envy of this good mans wife i did suborn those ready courtly slaves ubaldo and ricardo to corrupt her  eubulus i marvelld if the mischief were all out  honoria how far i have prevailed i am ignorant but my request good sir in fine is this that you for the honor of this gallant knight would let us travel thither the journey being but short to call them home  ladislaus this hour we will put on  baptista i if you please your royal harbinger exit eugenius and i your faithful follower  ladislaus i thank you let me infold you in my arms your service against the turk compared with this weighs nothing  eugenius i am still your humble soldier  ladislaus my true friend  ferdinand and so youre bound to hold him  eubulus such a plant imported to your kingdom and here grafted would yield more fruit than all the
