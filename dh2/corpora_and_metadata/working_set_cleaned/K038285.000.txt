we find who bove controulment dares to speak his mind dares unabashd in every place appear and nothing fears but what he ought to fear him fashion cannot tempt him abject need cannot compel him pride cannot mislead to be the slave of greatness to strike sail when sweeping onward with her peacocks tail quality in full plumage passes by he views her with a fixed contemptuous eye and mocks the puppet keeps his own due state and is above conversing with the great perish those slaves those minions of the quill who have conspired to seize that sacred hill where the nine sisters pour a genuine strain and sunk the mountain level with the plain who with mean private views and servile art no spark of virtue living in their heart have basely turned apostates have debased their dignity of office have disgraced like elis sons the altars where they stand and caused their name to stink through all the land have stooped to prostitute their venal pen for the support of great but guilty men have made the bard of their own vile accord inferior to that thing we call a lord what is a lord does that plain simple word contain some magic spell as soon as heard like an alarm bell on nights dull ear does it strike louder and more strong appear than other words whether we will or no through reasons court does it unquestioned go even on the mention and of course transmit notions of something excellent of wit pleasing though keen of humor free though chaste of sterling genius with sound judgment graced of virtue far above temptations reach and honor which not malice can impeach believe it not  twas natures first intent before their rank became their punishment they should have passed for men nor blushed to prize the blessings she bestowed  she gave them eyes and they could see  she gave them ears  they heard  the instruments of stirring and they stirred  like us they were designed to eat to drink to talk and every now and then to think till they by pride corrupted for the sake of singularity disclaimed that make till they disdaining natures vulgar mode flew off and struck into another road more fitting quality and to our view came forth a species altogether new something we had not known and could not know like nothing of gods making here below nature exclaimed with wonder  lords are things which never made by me were made by kings a lord nor let the honest and the brave the true old noble with the fool and knave here mix his fame cursed be that thought of mine which with a b  and f  should grafton join a lord nor here let censure rashly call my just contempt of some abuse of all and as of late when sodom was my theme slander my purpose and my muse blaspheme because she stops not rapid in her song to make exceptions as she goes along though well she hopes to find another year a whole minority exceptions here a mere mere lord with nothing but the name wealth all his worth and title all his fame lives on another man himself a blank thankless he lives or must some grandsire thank for smuggled honors and illgotten pelf a bard owes all to nature and himself gods how my soul is burnt up with disdain when i see men whom phoebus in his train might view with pride lacquey the heels of those whom genius ranks amongst her greatest foes and what is the cause why these same sons of scorn no thanks to them were to a title born and could not help it by chance hither sent and only deities by accident had fortune on our getting chanced to shine their birthright honors had been yours or mine twas a mere random stroke and should the throne eye thee with favor proud and lordly grown thou though a bard might be their fellow yet but felix never can be made a wit no in good faith  that is one of those few things which fate has placed beyond the reach of kings bards may be lords but it is not in the cards play how we will to turn lords into bards a bard  a lord  why let them hand in hand go forth as friends and travel through the land observe which word the people can digest most readily which goes to market best which gets most credit whether men will trust a bard because they think he may be just or on a lord will choose to risque their gains though privilege in that point still remains a bard  a lord  let reason take her scales and fairly weigh those words see which prevails which in the balance lightly kicks the beam and which by sinking we the victor deem it is done and hermes by command of jove summons a synod in the sacred grove gods throng with gods to take their chairs on high and sit in state the senate of the sky whilst in a kind of parliament below men stare at those above and want to know what they are transacting reason takes her stand just in the midst a balance in her hand which over and over she tries and finds it true from either side conducted full in view a man comes forth of figure strange and queer we now and then see something like them here the first was meager flimsy void of strength but nature kindly had made up in length what she in breadth denied erect and proud a head and shoulders taller than the crowd he deemed them pygmies all loose hung his skin over his bare bones his face so very thin so very narrow and so much beat out that physiognomists have made a doubt proportion lost expression quite forgot whether it could be called a face or not at end of it however unblessed with beard some twenty fathom length of chin appeared with legs which we might well conceive that fate meant only to support a spiders weight firmly he strove to tread and with a stride which showed at once his weakness and his pride shaking himself to pieces seemed to cry observe good people how i shake the sky in his right hand a paper did he hold on which at large in characters of gold distinct and plain for those who run to see saint archibald had wrote l o r d this with an air of scorn he from afar twirld into reasons scales and on that bar which from his soul he hated yet admired quick turned his back and as he came retired the judge to all around his name declared each goddess titterd each god laughed jove stard and the whole people cried with one accord good heaven bless us all is that a lord such was the first  the second was a man whom nature built on quite a different plan a bear whom from the moment he was born his dam despised and left unlickd in scorn a babel which the power of art outdone she could not finish when she had begun an utter chaos out of which no might but that of god could strike one spark of light broad were his shoulders and from blade to blade a h  might at full length have laid vast were his bones his muscles twisted strong his face was short but broader than twas long his features though by nature they were large contentment had contrived to overcharge and bury meaning save that we might spy sense lowering on the penthouse of his eye his arms were two twin oaks his legs so stout that they might bear a mansion house about nor were they look but at his body there designed by fate a much less weight to bear over a brown cassock which had once been black which hung in tatters on his brawny back a sight most strange and awkward to behold he threw a covering of blue and gold just at that time of life when man by rule the fop laid down takes up the graver fool he started up a fop and fond of show looked like another hercules turned beau a subject met with only now and then much fitter for the pencil than the pen hogarth would draw him envy must allow even to the life was hogarth living now with such accoutrements with such a form much like a porpoise just before a storm onward he rolled a laugh prevailed around even jove was seen to simper at the sound nor was the cause unknown for from his youth himself he studied by the glass of truth he joined their mirth nor shall the gods condemn if whilst they laughed at him he laughed at them judge reason viewed him with an eye of grace looked through his soul and quite forgot his face and from his hand received with fair regard placed in her other scale the name of bard then for she did as judges ought to do she nothing of the case beforehand knew nor wished to know she never stretched the laws nor basely to anticipate a cause compelled sollicitors no longer free to show those briefs she had no right to see then she with equal hand her scales held out nor did the cause one moment hang in doubt she held her scales out fair to public view the lord as sparks fly upwards upwards flew more light than air deceitful in the weight the bard preponderating kept his state reason approved and with a voice whose sound shook earth shook heaven on the clearest ground pronouncing for the bards a full decree cried  those must honor them who honor me they from this present day wherever i reign in their own right precedence shall obtain merit rules here be it enough that birth intoxicates and sways the fools of earth nor think that here in hatred to a lord i have forged a tale or altered a record search when you will i am not now in sport you will find it registered in reasons court nor think that envy here has strung my lyre that i depreciate what i most admire and look on titles with an eye of scorn because i was not to a title born by him that made me i am much more proud more inly satisfied to have a crowd point at me as i pass and cry  that is he  a poor but honest bard who dares be free amidst corruption than to have a train of flickring levee slaves to make me vain of things i ought to blush for to run fly and live but in the motion of my eye when i am less than man my faults to adore and make me think that i am something more recall past times bring back the days of old when the great noble bore his honors bold and in the face of peril when he dared things which his legal bastard if declared might well discredit faithful to his trust in the extremest points of justice just wellknowing all and loved by all he knew true to his king and to his country true honest at court above the baits of gain plain in his dress and in his manners plain moderate in wealth generous but not profuse well worthy riches for he knew their use possessing much and yet deserving more deserving those high honors which he wore with ease to all and in return gained fame which all men paid because he did not claim when the grim war was placed in dread array fierce as the lion roaring for his prey or lioness of royal whelps foredone in peace as mild as the departing sun a general blessing wheresoeer he turned patron of learning nor himself unlearned ever awake at pitys tender call a father of the poor a friend to all recall such times and from the grave bring back a worth like this my heart shall bend or crack my stubborn pride give way my tongue proclaim and every muse conspire to swell his fame till envy shall to him that praise allow which she cannot deny to temple now this justice claims nor shall the bard forget delighted with the task to pay that debt to pay it like a man and in his lays sounding such worth prove his own right to praise but let not pride and prejudice misdeem and think that empty titles are my theme titles with me are vain and nothing worth i reverence virtue but i laugh at birth give me a lord that is honest frank and brave i am his friend but cannot be his slave though none indeed but blockheads would pretend to make a slave where they may make a friend i love his virtues and will make them known confess his rank but cannot forget my own give me a lord who to a title born boasts nothing else i will pay him scorn with scorn what shall my pride and pride is virtue here tamely make way if such a wretch appear shall i uncovered stand and bend my knee to such a shadow of nobility a shred a remnant he might rot unknown for any real merit of his own and never had come forth to public note had he not worn by chance his fathers coat to think a m  worth my least regards is treason to the majesty of bards by nature formed when for her honour sake she something more than common strove to make when overlooking each minute defect and all too eager to be quite correct in her full heat and vigor she impressed her stamp most strongly on the favored breast the bard nor think too lightly that i mean those little piddling witlings who oerween of their small parts the murphys of the stage the masons and the whiteheads of the age who all in raptures their own works rehearse and drawl out measured prose which they call verse the real bard whom native genius fires whom every maid of castaly inspires let him consider wherefore he was meant let him but answer natures great intent and fairly weigh himself with other men would never debase the glories of his pen would in full state like a true monarch live nor bate one inch of his prerogative methinks i see old wingate frowning here wingate may in the season be a peer though now against his will of figures sick he is forced to diet on arithmetic even whilst he envies every jew he meets who cries old clothes to sell about the streets methinks his mind with future honors big his tyburn bob turned to a dressed bag wig i hear him cry  what does this jargon mean was ever such a damned dull blockhead seen majesty  bard  prerogative  disdain has got into and turned the fellows brain to bethlem with him  give him whips and straw  i am very sensible he is mad in law a saucy groom who trades in reason thus to set himself upon a par with us if this here is suffered and if that there fool may when he pleases send us all to school why then our only business is outright to take our caps and bid the world good night i have kept a bard myself this twenty years but nothing of this kind in him appears he like a thorough truebred spaniel licks the hand which cuffs him and the foot which kicks he fetches and he carries blacks my shoes nor thinks it a discredit to his muse a creature of the right camelion hue he wears my colors yellow or true blue just as i wear them it is all one to him whether i change through conscience or through whim now this is something like on such a plan a bard may find a friend in a great man but this proud coxcomb  zounds i thought that all of this queer tribe had been like my old paul injurious thought accursed be the tongue on which the vile insinuation hung the heart where twas engendered cursed be those those bards who not themselves alone expose but me but all and make the very name by which they are called a standing mark of shame talk not of custom  it is the cowards plea current with fools but passes not with me an old stale trick which guilt has often tried by numbers to oerpowr the better side why tell me then that from the birth of rhyme no matter when down to the present time as by the original decree of fate bards have protection sought amongst the great conscious of weakness have applied to them as vines to elms and twining round their stem flourished on high to gain this wished support even virgil to maecenas paid his court as to the custom it is a point agreed but twas a foolish diffidence not need from which it rose had bards but truly known that strength which is most properly their own without a lord unproppd they might have stood and overtoppd those giants of the wood but why when present times my care engage must i go back to the augustan age why anxious for the living am i led into the mansions of the ancient dead can they find patrons no where but at rome and must i seek maecenas in the tomb name but a wingate twenty fools of note start up and from report maecenas quote under his colors lords are proud to fight forgetting that maecenas was a knight they mention him as if to use his name was in some measure to partake his fame though virgil was he living in the street might rot for them or perish in the fleet see how they redden and the charge disclaim  virgil and in the fleet  forbid it shame hence ye vain boasters to the fleet repair and ask with blushes ask if lloyd is there patrons in days of yore were men of sense were men of taste and had a fair pretense to rule in letters  some of them were heard to read offhand and never spell a word some of them too to such a monstrous height was learning risen for themselves could write and kept their secretaries as the great do many other foolish things for state our patrons are of quite a different strain with neither sense nor taste against the grain they patronize for fashion sake  no more  and keep a bard just as they keep a whore m  on such occasion i am loath to name the dead was a rare proof of both some of them would be puzzled even to read nor could deserve their clergy by their creed others can write but such a pagan hand a wills should always at our elbow stand many if begged a chancellor of right would order into keeping at first sight those who stand fairest to the public view take to themselves the praise to others due they rob the very spital and make free with those alas who have least to spare  we see  has not had a word to say since winds and waves bore singlespeech away patrons in days of yore like patrons now expected that the bard should make his bow at coming in and every now and then hint to the world that they were more than men but like the patrons of the present day they never bilkd the poet of his pay virgil loved rural ease and far from harm maecenas fixed him in a neat snug farm where he might free from trouble pass his days in his own way and pay his rent in praise horace loved wine and through his friend at court could buy it off the key in every port horace loved mirth maecenas loved it too they met they laughed as goy and i may do nor in those moments paid the least regard to which was minister and which was bard not so our patrons  grave as grave can be they know themselves they keep up dignity bards are a forward race nor is it fit that men of fortune rank with men of wit wit if familiar made will find her strength  it is best to keep her weak and at arms length it is well enough for bards if patrons give from hand to mouth the scanty means to live such is their language and their practice such they promise little and they give not much let the weak bard with prostituted strain praise that proud scot whom all good men disdain what is his reward why his own fame undone he may obtain a patent for the run of his lords kitchen and have ample time with offal fed to court the cook in rhyme or if he strives true patriots to disgrace may at the second table get a place with somewhat greater slaves allowed to dine and play at crambo over his gill of wine and are there bards who on creations file stand ranked as men who breathe in this fair isle the air of freedom with so little gall so low a spirit prostrate thus to fall before these idols and without a groan bear wrongs might call forth murmurs from a stone better and much more noble to abjure the sight of men and in some cave secure from all the outrages of pride to feast on natures sallads and be free at least better though that to say the truth is worse than almost any other modern curse discard all sense divorce the thankless muse critics commence and write in the reviews write without tremor griffiths cannot read no fool can fail where langhorne can succeed but not to make a brave and honest pride try those means first she must disdain when tried there are a thousand ways a thousand arts by which and fairly men of real parts may gain a living gain what nature craves let those who pine for more live and be slaves our real wants in a small compass lie but lawless appetite with eager eye kept in a constant fever more requires and we are burnt up with our own desires hence our dependence hence our slavery springs bards if contented are as great as kings ourselves are to ourselves the cause of ill we may be independent if we will the man who suits his spirit to his state stands on an equal footing with the great moguls themselves are not more rich and he who rules the english nation not more free chains were not forged more durable and strong for bards than others but they have worn them along and therefore wear them still they have quite forgot what freedom is and therefore prize her not could they though in their sleep could they but know the blessings which from independence flow could they but have a short and transient gleam of liberty though twas but in a dream they would no more in bondage bend their knee but once made freemen would be always free the muse if she one moment freedom gains can never more submit to sing in chains bred in a cage far from the seatherd throng the bird repays his keeper with his song but if some playful child sets wide the door abroad he flies and thinks of home no more with love of liberty begins to burn and rather starves than to his cage return hail independence  by true reason taught how few have known and prized thee as they ought some give thee up for riot some like boys resign thee in their childish moods for toys ambition some some avarice misleads and in both cases independence bleeds abroad in quest of thee how many roam nor know they had thee in their reach at home some though about their paths their beds about have never had the sense to find thee out others who know of what they are possessed like fearful misers lock thee in a chest nor have the resolution to produce in these bad times and bring thee forth for use hail independence  though thy names scarce known though thou alas art out of fashion grown though all despise thee i will not despise nor live one moment longer than i prize thy presence and enjoy by angry fate bowed down and almost crushed thou came though late thou came upon me like a second birth and made me know what life was truly worth hail independence  never may my cot till i forget thee be by thee forgot thither o thither oftentimes repair cotes whom thou love too shall meet thee there all thoughts but what arise from joy give over peace dwells within and law shall guard the door oerweening bard law guard thy door what law the law of england  to control and awe those saucy hopes to strike that spirit dumb behold in state administration come why let her come in all her terrors too i dare to suffer all she dares to do i know her malice well and know her pride i know her strength but will not change my side this melting mass of flesh she may control with iron ribs she cannot chain my soul no  to the last resolved her worst to bear i am still at large and independent there where is this minister where is the band of ready slaves who at his elbow stand to hear and to perform his wicked will why for the first time are they slow to ill when some grand act against law is to be done does  sleep does bloodhound  run to l  and worry those small deer when he might do more precious mischief here does  turn tail does he refuse to draw illegal warrants and to call them law does  at g  d kicked from g  d run with that cold lump of unbakd dough his son and his more honest rival ketch to cheat purchase a burial place where three ways meet believe it not  is  still and never sleeps when he should wake to ill  does lesser mischiess by the bye the great ones till the term in petto lie  lives and to the strictest justice true scorns to defraud the hangman of his due o my poor country  weak and overpowrd by thine own sons  eat to the bone  devoured by vipers which in thine own entrails bred prey on thy life and with thy blood are fed with unavailing grief thy wrongs i see and for myself not feeling feel for thee i grieve but cannot despair  for lo at hand freedom presents a choice but faithful band of loyal patriots men who greatly dare in such a noble cause men fit to bear the weight of empires fortune rank and sense virtue and knowledge leagued with eloquence march in their ranks freedom from file to file darts her delighted eye and with a smile approves her honest sons whilst down her cheek as twere by stealth her heart too full to speak one tear in silence creeps one honest tear and seems to say why is not granby here o ye brave few in whom we still may find a love of virtue freedom and mankind go forth  in majesty of woe arrayed see at your feet your country kneels for aid and many of her children traitors grown kneels to those sons she still can call her own seeming to breathe her last in every breath she kneels for freedom or she begs for death  fly then each duteous son each english chief and to your drooping parent bring relief go forth  nor let the siren voice of ease tempt ye to sleep whilst tempests swell the seas go forth  nor let hypocrisy whose tongue with many a fair false fatal art is hung like bethels fawning prophet cross your way when your great errand brooks not of delay nor let vain fear who cries to all she meets trembling and pale  a lion in the streets  damp your free spirits let not threats affright nor bribes corrupt nor flatteries delight be as one man  concord success ensures  there is not an english heart but what is yours go forth  and virtue ever in your sight shall be your guide by day your guard by night  go forth  the champions of your native land and may the battle prosper in your hand  it may it must  ye cannot be withstood  be your hearts honest as your cause is good the end books written by mr
