future progeny never fails to strike the attention of the inquisitive researcher into their economy  to perpetuate their race is the great end of their being and the most astonishing effort of their ingenuity and care is employed to perfect this grand design we not only find innumerable eggs and larvae of insect on all kinds of plants in all standing waters and in animal matter when putrid but many which can only be hatched from the egg by the warmth of living animals thus the tabanus pierces the thick hide of the cow and plunges its eggs into the flesh the heat and moisture of which nourishes both in the egg and larva the hippobosca equina protrudes its eggs into the rectum of horses and the ichneumon into living caterpillars to those we could add many remarkable instances of insects who have shown a lower species of perception by depositing their eggs in places where the larvae would find abundance of proper food and with such ingenious contrivances for their safety in a defenseless state as we could only expect from the sagacity of larger animals but it is only our intention to premise with those general remarks lest the subject we have chosen for our present plate should be considered as a solitary example of such ingenuity and care toward their future offspring  the natural history of the common be has been both fully and ably treated of by schirach maraldi reaumur debraw and other authors of respectability and may be supposed to be pretty generally known by those conversant in rural affairs the manners however of other species of the same genus has neither been so fully explained nor examined they yet present a fund for the enquiries of the naturalist equally worthy his attention though less beneficial as the honey they make cannot be converted to our use  among the solitary bees some penetrate into the earth scoop out hollow cavities then polish the sides within and deposit their eggs with proper food for the larvae till it becomes a pupa others form nests of loose sand which they glue together with a strong cement those nests are generally formed against walls that are exposed to the south without they are rude and irregular but within are very neatly finished and divided into several cells or apartments in each of which the parent be lodges an egg of our present and a few other species we may say in firmest oak they scoop a spacious tomb and lay their embryo in the spurious womb brooks on universal beauty    we find this season the apis centuncularis has done considerable injury among the timber plantations in essex and we have similar information from some parts of cambridgeshire a gentleman sent me early in the spring a piece of oak containing a quantity of the larva from his plantation at birdbrook in essex he informs me several gentlemen in his neighborhood had found large trunks of apparently healthy oaks completely perforated and filled with the larva of this mischievous insect in many instances the trunk had been materially injured and the cases were arranged as shown by the horizontal section at fig   in our plate  the perforations were in a longitudinal direction several feet through the solid timber and when the leaves were fresh appeared as shown at fig    the insect commences its operation at the upper part of the trunk of the tree then boring in an oblique direction for about two inches or more it follows a longitudinal course it divides the ligneous fibers or threads till it forms the diameter of the cavity which is about threeeighths of an inch its depth various sometimes only a few inches at others considerably more when the cavity is entirely formed and all the dust and fragments cleared away it finishes the sides perfectly smooth the hardest knot in the timber being insufficient to resist the strength of its jaws  the cavity when finished appears divided by slight ridges placed at the distance of about three quarters of an inch from each other this serves to regulate the size of each apartment or cell and it now only remains to be lined for the reception of the egg this lining is generally composed of roseleaves and is applied to the apartments in a very curious manner the parent be flies with a leaf to the orifice of the perforation where she clips it round to the size of the hole this is forced to the bottom of the lowest cell about seven eight or ten of such pieces form the first layer it next forms the sides or cylindrical part of the lining this is done by laying several whole leaves partly over each other as shown in our plate and cementing them together with a glutinous substance thus the sides and bottom each consisting of several layers being finished in the form of a thimble the be partly fills it with a kind of paste then throws over it a small quantity of leaves reduced to powder and deposits the egg the covering to the whole is formed of the same materials and in the same manner as the bottom when she has forced about ten or fifteen circular pieces of leaves into the avenue and cemented them to the top the covering is completed and the egg is completely secured from accident  the covering separated is shown in the plate at fig   the larvae at fig    in this manner she proceeds with and finishes every cell distinctly till the perforation is entirely filled in some trees forty or fifty such perforations are placed within a quarter of an inch of each other  the be comes forth late in august if the lowest is formed before those above it eats its way up the channel through their cases  mr adams in his essay

size etc  we find also that though this insect has been named phalaena anastomosis in the most scientific cabinets in london and always received as such by the best authority it is not the insect referred to by fabricius in his species insectorum under that title that author as well as linnaeus refers under the specific name ph curtula to the   d plate of the third volume of roesels insects in this plate is figured a moth which is certainly a species distinct from our insect and is well known by its linnaean name curtula or english title chocolate tip yet fabricius gives an additional reference for the same species to the   th plate of roesels fourth volume of insects and in this we find the figure of a moth whose markings and general appearance correspond with our specimen though its colors are totally different being a very pale gray with scarcely any dark color near the apex of the wings the larva much more resembles our figure and induces us to conclude that though the figure of this last moth is so extremely different it is probably intended for the same species as our insect and therefore that the two distinct species have been confounded together by a false quotation of linnaeuss amanuensis  and we are partly confirmed in this supposition by the words of linnaeus himself he says ph anastomosis is very like ph curtula but the moth figured in roesels plate and referred to in the synonyms under anastomosis does not bear the least resemblance to it  our insect on the contrary though evidently a distinct species is not unlike it   plate cxxx gryllus
