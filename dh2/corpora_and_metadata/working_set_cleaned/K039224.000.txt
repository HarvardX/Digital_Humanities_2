prologue spoke by mr wright in short  good folk  a dismal truth to tell i come to toll our authors passing bell his farce will not do  the reason would you know it for sure the spark has something of the poet the muse cries out such sad examples taught her no bard can thrive  unless he cross the water severe decree  no homeborn muse delights nothing shall please  but what a stranger writes let us exert ourselves  assume a spirit and think our title  good as theirs  to merit what heaven loved clime  but our thrice happy coast of such successful patriots can boast with one collected force the arts to nourish make trade survive and sacred culture flourish and yet  to future times twill seem surprising while each deserving artists sure of rising while a mechanic merits well rewarded the tattered muse repines  not once regarded to this august assembly we submit to you  we recommend the cause of wit arise  nor see a native genius braved too long have such been banished  or enslaved and

minute of appointment is just at hand this letter in answer to the one you delivered her informs me that she is kept by an old jealous knight in the city  she is a fine woman by heaven  and if it be in the power of her sex to drive that intolerable coquet charlott out of my head i think it is she can do it   jer heaven send there comes a good end on it  well if i should have my bones shattered in this rencounter twill not be the first time i have been paid for my ingenuity   will peace scoundrel and learn to bear misfortunes with a pimplike patience   jer patience yes you may talk of patience truly while all the pleasure of the sin belongs to yourself and all the punishment to your humble servant  how often have these unfortunate bones of mine been beaten to a jelly in your service   will why sirrah if your illstars condemn you to disappointments can i prevent them if ever you suffered in your vocation some unfortunate blunder of your own occasioned it you remember the letter you gave to charlotts jealous guardian when in the overflowing of your wisdom you mistook him for her footman   jer remember it i do by all that is unfortunate confound the old dog  he laid on me like an hercules he had put on her footmans livery on purpose to lay wait for me yet all this i could have borne with the patience of an alderman but the insupportable weight of your honors oaken cudgel   will my resentment was reasonable sirrah such a preposterous mistake but tell me jerry dont you think charlott will be confoundedly piqud at my so sudden departure fron oxford without sending her one single line or whining out the least tender adieu at parting   jer piqud sir lord sir i thought you understood the inside of a coquet better though it might puzzle one of a longer standing at oxford to tell what to make of her  why sir a coquet is always so well pleased with herself that nothing in nature is capable of discomposing her   will and yet jerry though she used me with such a studied ill nature i sometimes thought she did not hate me   jer hate you no no sir in my humble opinion she was extremely well pleased with you at least she has reason to be very well pleased with herself since she had it in her power to make so fine a gentleman a downright    will come out with it sirrah i shall not be angry   jer a downright ass  begging your honors pardon   will why really sir you do make something free with me but will your worship be pleased to explain what you mean by honoring me with that extraordinary title   jer nay sir i beg you will not take it ill that i said so for on my honor sir i assure you i have seen persons of great rank and distinction act over all the pretty follies of that sagacious animal and value themselves extremely upon it   will pray then most philosophical sir will you please to inform me what one action of mine happens to fall under the lash of your satire   jer why really sir as you have been so long notorious in the class of lovers i think your question is easily resolved lovers since the creation have been generally esteemed little better than  but since the title of the forementioned animal seems to affect you so nearly i will forbear repeating it and leave it to yourself to consider what are the motives which hurried you so suddenly to london with scarce a single guinea in your pocket unknown to your father or friends and i may even venture to say almost unknown to yourself   will why jerry i think my coming to london a masterpiece of resolution and i applaud myself for it extremely i doated even to folly on that charlott the greatest tyrant of her sex you are sensible how she used me  in short i was become ridiculous even to myself and judging with a great deal of justice that in dear london alone i might hope to recover my reason i resolved to break my chains at once and let the coquet see that beauty without merit had lost all power to make a fool of me   jer so we take horse in a pet whip spur and away leave being silly at oxford to come and play the downright fool at london for curse me sir still begging your honors pardon if i can at present see that your intentions are conducted with the least appearance of common sense   will since i must explain my intentions sir to make a man of your vast judgment approve them you must know that by a variety of pleasures here in london i design to lose even the remembrance of my oxford mistress and least the presence of an old peevish father might interrupt those pleasures i am positively resolved to avoid all places where twere probable i might meet with him   jer and so sir you begin this fine variety of pleasures by an intrigue with mistress what is her name here this fine kept mistress  and that too with a pair of pockets damnably badly lined  a likely prospect of succeeding truly   will if you exert yourself jerry our plot upon my father cannot miscarry then if she be a mercenary whore damn money twas made to purchase pleasure
