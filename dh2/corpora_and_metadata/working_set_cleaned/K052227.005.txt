fontes virg london printed by w bowyer for bernard lintot between the templegates    0  the seventeenth book of the iliad the argument the seventh battle for the body of patroclus the acts of menelaus menelaus upon the death of patroclus defends his body from the enemy euphorbus who attempts it is slain hector advancing menelaus retires but soon returns with ajax and drives him off this glaucus objects to hector as a flight who thereupon puts on the armor he had won from patroclus and renews the battle the greeks give way till ajax rallies them aeneas sustains the trojans aeneas and hector attempt the chariot of achilles which is borne off by automedon the horses of achilles deplore the loss of patroclus jupiter covers his body with a thick darkness the noble prayer of ajax on that occasion menelaus sends antilochus to achilles with the news of patrocluss death then returns to the fight where though attacked with the utmost fury he and meriones assisted by the ajaxes bear off the body to the ships  the time is the evening of the eight and twentieth day the scene lies in the fields before troy  the seventeenth book of the iliad on the cold earth divine patroclus spread lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead great menelaus touched with generous woe springs to the front and guards him from the foe thus round her new fallen young the heifer moves fruit of her throes and firstborn of her loves and anxious helpless as he lies and bare turns and returns her with a mothers care opposed to each that near the carcass came his broad shield glimmers and his lances flame the son of panthus skilled the dart to send eyes the dead hero and insults the friend this hand atrides laid patroclus low warrior desist nor tempt an equal blow to me the spoils my prowess won resign depart with life and leave the glory mine the trojan thus the spartan monarch burned with generous anguish and in scorn returned laughst thou not jove from thy superior throne when mortals boast of prowess not their own not thus the lion glories in his might nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight nor thus the boar those terrors of the plain man only vaunts his force and vaunts in vain but far the vainest of the boastful kind these sons of panthus vent their haughty mind yet twas but late beneath my conquering steel this boasters brother hyperenor fell against our arm which rashly he defied vain was his vigor and as vain his pride these eyes beheld him on the dust expire no more to cheer his spouse or glad his sire presumptuous youth like his shall be thy doom to wait thy brother to the stygian gloom while yet thou may avoid the threatened fate fools stay to feel it and are wise too late unmoved euphorbus thus that action known come for my brothers blood repay thy own his weeping father claims thy destined head and spouse a widow in her bridal bed on these thy conquered spoils i shall bestow to sooth a consorts and a parents woe no longer then defer the glorious strife let heaven decide our fortune fame and life swift as the word the missile lance he flings the wellaimd weapon on the buckler rings but blunted by the brass innoxious falls on jove the father great atrides calls nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain it pierced his throat and bent him to the plain wide through the neck appears the grizly wound prone sinks the warrior and his arms resound the shining circlets of his golden hair which even the graces might be proud to wear instarrd with gems and gold bestrow the shore with dust dishonored and deformed with gore as the young olive in some sylvan scene crowned by fresh fountains with eternal green lifts the gay head in snowy flourets fair and plays and dances to the gentle air when lo a whirlwind from high heaven invades the tender plant and withers all its shades it lies uprooted from its genial bed a lovely ruin now defaced and dead thus young thus beautiful euphorbus lay while the fierce spartan tore his arms away proud of his deed and glorious in the prize affrighted troy the towering victor flies flies as before some mountain lions ire the village curs and trembling swains retire when over the slaughtered bull they hear him roar and see his jaws distill with smoking gore all pale with fear at distance scattered round they shout incessant and the vales resound meanwhile apollo viewed with envious eyes and urged great hector to dispute the prize in mentes shape beneath whose martial care the rough ciconians learned the trade of war forbear he cried with fruitless speed to chase achilles coursers of ethereal race they stoop not these to mortal mans command or stoop to none but great achilles hand too long amused with a pursuit so vain turn and behold the brave euphorbus slain by sparta slain for ever now suppressed the fire which burned in that undaunted breast thus having spoke apollo winged his flight and mixed with mortals in the toils of fight his words infixd unutterable care deep in great hectors soul through all the war he darts his anxious eye and instant viewed the breathless hero in his blood imbrued forth welling from the wound as prone he lay and in the victors hands the shining prey sheathed in bright arms through cleaving ranks he flies and sends his voice in thunder to the skies fierce as a flood of flame by vulcan sent it flew and fired the nations as it went atrides from the voice the storm divined and thus explored his own unconquered mind then shall i quit patroclus on the plain slain in my cause and for my honor slain desert the arms the relics of my friend or singly hector and his troops attend sure where such partial favor heaven bestowed to brave the hero were to brave the god forgive me greece if once i quit the field it is not to hector but to heaven i yield yet nor the god nor heaven should give me fear did but the voice of ajax reach my ear still would we turn still battle on the plains and give achilles all that yet remains of his and our patroclus  this no more the time allowed troy thickened on the shore a sable scene the terrors hector led slow he recedes and sighing quits the dead so from the fold the unwilling lion parts forced by loud clamours and a storm of darts he flies indeed but threatens as he flies with heart indignant and retorted eyes now entered in the spartan ranks he turned his manly breast and with new fury burned over all the black battalions sent his view and through the cloud the godlike ajax knew where laboring on the left the warrior stood all grim in arms and covered over with blood there breathing courage where the god of day had sunk each heart with terror and dismay to him the king oh ajax oh my friend haste and patroclus loved remains defend the body to achilles to restore demands our care alas we can no more for naked now despoiled of arms he lies and hector glories in the dazzling prize he said and touched his heart the raging pair pierce the thick battle and provoke the war already had stern hector seized his head and doomed to trojan dogs the unhappy dead but soon as ajax reared his towrlike shield sprung to his car and measured back the field his train to troy the radiant armor bear to stand a trophy of his fame in war meanwhile great ajax his broad shield displayed guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade and now before and now behind he stood thus in the center of some gloomy wood with many a step the lioness surrounds her tawny young beset by men and hounds elate her heart and rowzing all her powers darkoer the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lowrs fast by his side the generous spartan glows with great revenge and feeds his inward woes but glaucus leader of the lycian aids on hector frowning thus his flight upbraids where now in hector shall we hector find a manly form without a manly mind is this o chief a heros boasted fame how vain without the merit is the name since battle is renounced thy thoughts employ what other methods may preserve thy troy it is time to try if ilions state can stand by thee alone nor ask a foreign hand mean empty boast but shall the lycians stake their lives for you those lycians you forsake what from thy thankless arms can we expect thy friend sarpedon proves thy base neglect say shall our slaughtered bodies guard your walls while unrevenged the great sarpedon falls even where he died for troy you left him there a feast for dogs and all the fowls of air on my command if any lycian wait hence let him march and give up troy to fate did such a spirit as the gods impart impel one trojan hand or trojan heart such as should burn in every soul that draws the sword for glory and his countrys cause even yet our mutual arms we might employ and drag yon carcass to the walls of troy oh were patroclus ours we might obtain sarpedons arms and honored corse again greece with achilles friend should be repaid and thus due honors purchased to his shade but words are vain  let ajax once appear and hector trembles and recedes with fear thou dare not meet the terrors of his eye and lo already thou preparst to fly the trojan chief with fixed resentment eyed the lycian leader and sedate replied say is it just my friend that hectors ear from such a warrior such a speech should hear i deemed thee once the wisest of thy kind but ill this insult suits a prudent mind i shun great ajax i desert my train it is mine to prove the rash assertion vain i joy to mingle where the battle bleeds and hear the thunder of the sounding steeds but joves high will is ever uncontrolled the strong he withers and confounds the bold now crowns with fame the mighty man and now strikes the fresh garland from the victors brow come through yon squadrons let us hew the way and thou be witness if i fear to day if yet a greek the sight of hector dread or yet their hero dare defend the dead then turning to the martial hosts he cries ye trojans dardans lycians and allies be men my friends in action as in name and yet be mindful of your ancient fame hector in proud achilles arms shall shine torn from his friend by right of conquest mine he strode along the field as thus he said the sable plumage nodded over his head swift through the spacious plain he sent a look one instant saw one instant overtook the distant band that on the sandy shore the radiant spoils to sacred ilion bore there his own mail unbracd the field bestrowd his train to troy conveyed the massy load now blazing in the immortal arms he stands the work and present of celestial hands by aged peleus to achilles given as first to peleus by the court of heaven his fathers arms not long achilles wears forbid by fate to reach his fathers years him proud in triumph glittering from afar the god whose thunder rends the troubled air beheld with pity as apart he sat and conscious looked through all the scene of fate he shook the sacred honors of his head olympus trembled and the godhead said ah wretched man unmindful of thy end a moments glory and what fates attend in heavenly panoply divinely bright thou standst and armies tremble at thy sight as at achilles self beneath thy dart lies slain the great achilles dearer part thou from the mighty dead those arms have torn which once the greatest of mankind had worn yet live i give thee one illustrious day a blaze of glory ever thou fadst away for ah no more andromache shall come with joyful tears to welcome hector home no more officious with endearing charms from thy tired limbs unbrace pelides arms then with his sable brow he gave the nod that seals his word the sanction of the god the stubborn arms by joves command disposed conformed spontaneous and around him closed filled with the god enlarged his members grew through all his veins a sudden vigor flew the blood in brisker tides began to roll and mars himself came rushing on his soul exhorting loud through all the field he strode and looked and moved achilles or a god now mesthles glaucus medon he inspires now phorcys chromius and hippothous fires the great thersilochus like fury found asteropaeus kindled at the sound and ennomus in augury renowned hear all ye hosts and hear unnumberd bands of neighboring nations or of distant lands twas not for state we summoned you so far to boast our numbers and the pomp of war ye came to fight a valiant foe to chase to save our present and our future race for this our wealth our products you enjoy and glean the relics of exhausted troy now then to conquer or to die prepare to die or conquer are the terms of war whatever hand shall win patroclus slain whoever shall drag him to the trojan train with hectors self shall equal honors claim with hector part the spoil and share the fame fired by his words the troops dismiss their fears they join they thicken they protend their spears full on the greeks they drive in firm array and each from ajax hopes the glorious prey vain hope what numbers shall the field overspread what victims perish round the mighty dead great ajax marked the growing storm from far and thus bespoke his brother of the war our fatal day alas is come my friend and all our wars and glories at an end it is not this corpse alone we guard in vain condemned to vulturs on the trojan plain we too must yield the same sad fate must fall on thee on me perhaps my friend on all see what a tempest direful hector spreads and lo it bursts it thunders on our heads call on our greeks if any hear the call the bravest greeks this hour demands them all the warrior raised his voice and wide around the field reechod the distressful sound oh chiefs oh princes to whose hand is given the rule of men whose glory is from heaven whom with due honors both atrides grace ye guides and guardians of our argive race all whom this wellknown voice shall reach from far all whom i see not through this cloud of war come all let generous rage your arms employ and save patroclus from the dogs of troy oilean ajax first the voice obeyed swift was his pace and ready was his aid next him idomeneus more slow with age and merion burning with a heros rage the longsucceeding numbers who can name but all were greeks and eager all for fame fierce to the charge great hector led the throng whole troy embodied rushed with shouts along thus when a mountainbillow foams and raves where some swollen river disembogues his waves full in the mouth is stopped the rushing tide the boiling ocean works from side to side the river trembles to his utmost shore and distant rocks rebellow to the roar nor less resolved the firm achaian band with brazen shields in horrid circle stand jove pouring darkness over the mingled fight conceals the warriors shining helms in night to him the chief for whom the hosts contend had lived not hateful for he lived a friend dead he protects him with superior care nor dooms his carcass to the birds of air the first attack the grecians scarce sustain repulsed they yield the trojans seize the slain then fierce they rally to revenge led on by the swift rage of ajax telamon  ajax to peleus son the second name in graceful stature next and next in fame with headlong force the foremost ranks he tore so through the thicket bursts the moutain boar and rudely scatters far to distance round the frighted hunter and the baying hound the son of lethus brave pelasgus heir hippothous dragged the carcass through the war the sinewy ancles bored the feet he bound with thongs inserted through the double wound inevitable fate oertakes the deed doomed by great ajax vengeful lance to bleed it cleft the helmets brazen cheeks in twain the shattered crest and horsehair strew the plain with nerves relaxed he tumbles to the ground the brain comes gushing from the ghastly wound he drops patroclus foot and over him spread now lies a sad companion of the dead far from larissa lies his native air and ill requites his parents tender care lamented youth in lifes first bloom he fell sent by great ajax to the shades of hell once more at ajax hectors javelin flies the grecian marking as it cut the skies shunned the descending death which hissing on stretched in the dust the great iphytus son schedius the brave of all the phocian kind the boldest warrior and the noblest mind in little panope for strength renowned he held his seat and ruled the realms around plunged in his throat the weapon drank his blood and deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood in clanging arms the hero fell and all the fields resounded with his weighty fall phorcys as slain hippothous he defends the telamonian lance his belly rends the hollow armor burst before the stroke and through the wound the rushing entrails broke in strong convulsions panting on the sands he lies and grasps the dust with dying hands struck at the sight recede the trojan train the shouting argives strip the heroes slain and now had troy by greece compelled to yield fled to her ramparts and resigned the field greece in her native fortitude elate with jove averse had turned the scale of fate but phoebus urged aeneas to the fight he seemed like aged periphas to sight a herald in anchises love grown old revered for prudence and with prudence bold thus he  what methods yet oh chief remain to save your troy though heaven its fall ordain there have been heroes who by virtuous care by valor numbers and by arts of war have forced the powers to spare a sinking state and gained at length the glorious odds of fate but you when fortune smiles when jove declares his partial favor and assists your wars your shameful efforts against your selves employ and force the unwilling god to ruin troy aeneas through the form assumed descries the power concealed and thus to hector cries oh lasting shame to our own fears a prey we seek our ramparts and desert the day a god nor is he less my bosom warms and tells me jove asserts the trojan arms he spoke and foremost to the combat flew the bold example all his hosts pursue then first leocritus beneath him bled in vain beloved by valiant lycomede who veiwd his fall and grieving at the chance swift to revenge it sent his angry lance the whirling lance with vigorous force addressed descends and pants in apisaons breast from rich paeonias vales the warrior came next thee asteropeus in place and fame asteropeus with grief beheld the slain and rushed to combat but he rushed in vain indissolubly firm around the dead rank within rank on buckler buckler spread and hemmed with bristled spears the grecians stood a brazen bulwark and an iron wood great ajax eyes them with incessant care and in an orb contracts the crowded war close in their ranks commands to fight or fall and stands the center and the soul of all fixed on the spot they war and wounded wound a sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground on heaps the greeks on heaps the trojans bled and thickning round em rise the hills of dead greece in close order and collected might yet suffers least and sways the wavering fight fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns and now it rises now it sinks by turns in one thick darkness all the fight was lost the sun the moon and all the etherial host seemed as extinct day ravished from their eyes and all heavens splendors blotted from the skies such over patroclus body hung the night the rest in sunshine fought and open light unclouded there the aerial azure spread no vapor rested on the mountains head the golden sun poured forth a stronger ray and all the broad expansion flamed with day dispersed around the plain by fits they fight and here and there their scattered arrows light but death and darkness over the carcass spread there burned the war and there the mighty bled meanwhile the sons of nestor in the rear their fellows routed toss the distant spear and skirmish wide so nestor gave command when from the ships he sent the pylian band the youthful brothers thus for fame contend nor knew the fortune of achilles friend in thought they viewed him still with martial joy glorious in arms and dealing deaths to troy but round the corpse the heroes pant for breath and thick and heavy grows the work of death oerlabourd now with dust and sweat and gore their knees their legs their feet are covered over drops follow drops the clouds on clouds arise and carnage clogs their hands and darkness fills their eyes as when a slaughtered bulls yet reeking hyde strained with full force and tugged from side to side the brawny curriers stretch and labor over the extended surface drunk with fat and gore so tugging round the corpse both armies stood the mangled body bathed in sweat and blood while greeks and ilians equal strength employ now to the ships to force it now to troy not pallas self her breast when fury warms nor he whose anger sets the world in arms could blame this scene such rage such horror reigned such jove to honor the great dead ordained achilles in his ships at distance lay nor knew the fatal fortune of the day he yet unconscious of patroclus fall in dust extended under ilions wall expects him glorious from the conquered plain and for his wished return prepares in vain though well he knew to make proud ilion bend was more than heaven had destined to his friend perhaps to him this thetis had revealed the rest in pity to her son concealed still raged the conflict round the hero dead and heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled cursed be the man even private greeks would say who dares desert this welldisputed day first may the cleaving earth before our eyes gape wide and drink our blood for sacrifice first perish all ever haughty troy shall boast we lost patroclus and our glory lost thus they while with one voice the trojans said grant this day jove or heap us on the dead then clash their sounding arms the clangors rise and shake the brazen concave of the skies meantime at distance from the scene of blood the pensive steeds of great achilles stood their godlike master slain before their eyes they wept and shared in human miseries in vain automedon now shakes the rein now plies the lash and sooths and threats in vain nor to the fight nor hellespont they go restive they stood and obstinate in woe still as a tombstone never to be moved on some good man or woman unreprovd lays its eternal weight or fixed as stands a marble courser by the sculptors hands placed on the heros grave along their face the big round drops coursd down with silent pace conglobing on the dust their manes that late circled their arching necks and waved in state traild on the dust beneath the yoke were spread and prone to earth was hung their languid head nor jove disdained to cast a pitying look while thus relenting to the steeds he spoke unhappy coursers of immortal strain exempt from age and deathless now in vain did we your race on mortal man bestow only alas to share in mortal woe for ah what is there of inferior birth that breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth what wretched creature of what wretched kind than man more weak calamitous and blind a miserable race but cease to mourn for not by you shall priams son be born high on the splendid car one glorious prize he rashly boasts the rest our will denies ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart ourself with rising spirits swell your heart automedon your rapid flight shall bear safe to the navy through the storm of war for yet it is given to troy to ravage over the field and spread her slaughters to the shore the sun shall see her conquer till his fall with sacred darkness shades the face of all he said and breathing in the immortal horse excessive spirit urged em to the course from their high manes they shake the dust and bear the kindling chariot through the parted war so flies a vulture through the clamorous train of geese that scream and scatter round the plain from danger now with swiftest speed they flew and now to conquest with like speed pursue sole in the seat the charioteer remains now plies the javelin now directs the reins him brave alcimedon beheld distressed approached the chariot and the chief addressed what god provokes thee rashly thus to dare alone unaided in the thickest war alas thy friend is slain and hector wields achilles arms triumphant in the fields in happy time the charioteer replies the bold alcimedon now greets my eyes no greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains or holds their fury in suspended reins patroclus while he lived their rage could tame but now patroclus is an empty name to thee i yield the seat to thee resign the ruling charge the task of fight be mine he said alcimedon with active heat snatches the reins and vaults into the seat his friend descends the chief of troy descried and called aeneas fighting near his side lo to my sight beyond our hope restored achilles car deserted of its lord the glorious steeds our ready arms invite scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight can such opponents stand when we assail unite thy force my friend and we prevail the son of venus to the counsel yields then over their backs they spread their solid shields with brass refulgent the broad surface shined and thick bullhides the spacious concave lined them chromius follows aretus succeeds each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds in vain brave youths with glorious hopes ye burn in vain advance not fated to return unmoved automedon attends the fight implores the eternal and collects his might then turning to his friend with dauntless mind oh keep the foaming coursers close behind full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow for hard the fight determined is the foe it is hector comes and when he seeks the prize war knows no mean he wins it or he dies then through the field he sends his voice aloud and calls the ajaces from the warring crowd with great atrides hither turn he said turn where distress demands immediate aid the dead incircled by his friends forego and save the living from a fiercer foe unhelpd we stand unequal to engage the force of hector and aeneas rage yet mighty as they are my force to prove is only mine the event belongs to jove he spoke and high the sounding javelin flung which passed the shield of aretus the young it pierced his belt embossed with curious art then in the lower belly stuck the dart as when the ponderous axe descending full cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull struck twixt the horns he springs with many a bound then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground thus fell the youth the air his soul received and the spear trembled as his entrails heaved now at automedon the trojan foe discharged his lance the meditated blow stooping he shunned the javelin idly fled and hissed innoxious over the heros head deep rooted in the ground the forceful spear in long vibrations spent its fury there with clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed but each brave ajax heard and interposed nor longer hector with his trojans stood but left their slain companion in his blood his arms automedon divests and cries accept patroclus this mean sacrifice thus have i soothed my griefs and thus have paid poor as it is some offering to thy shade so looks the lion over a mangled boar all grim with rage and horrible with gore high on the chariot at one bound he sprung and over his seat the bloody trophies hung and now minerva from the realms of air descends impetuous and renews the war for pleased at length the grecian arms to aid the lord of thunders sent the blueeyd maid as when high jove denouncing future woe over the dark clouds extends his purple bow in sign of tempests from the troubled air or from the rage of man destructive war the drooping cattle dread the impending skies and from his halftilld field the labrer flies in such a form the goddess round her drew a livid cloud and to the battle flew assuming phoenix shape on earth she falls and in his wellknown voice to sparta calls and lies achilles friend beloved by all a prey to dogs beneath the trojan wall what shame to greece for future times to tell to thee the greatest in whose cause he fell o chief oh father  atreus son replies o full of days by long experience wise what more desires my soul than here unmoved to guard the body of the man i loved ah would minerva send me strength to rear this wearied arm and ward the storm of war but hector like the rage of fire we dread and joves own glories blaze around his head pleased to be first of all the powers addressed she breathes new vigor in her heros breast and fills with keen revenge with fell despite desire of blood and rage and lust of fight so burns the vengeful hornet soul all over repulsed in vain and thirsty still of gore bold son of air and heat on angry wings untamed untird he turns attacks and stings fired with like ardour fierce atrides flew and sent his soul with every lance he threw there stood a trojan not unknown to fame eetions son and podes was his name with riches honored and with courage blessed by hector loved his comrade and his guest through his broad belt the spear a passage found and ponderous as he falls his arms resound sudden at hectors side apollo stood like phaenops asius son appeared the god  asius the great who held his wealthy reign in fair abydos by the rolling main oh prince he cried oh foremost once in fame what grecian now shall tremble at thy name do thou at length to menelaus yield a chief once thought no terror of the field yet singly now the long disputed prize he bears victorious while our army flies by the same arm illustrious podes bled the friend of hector unrevenged is dead this heard over hector spreads a cloud of woe rage lifts his lance and drives him on the foe but now the eternal shook his sable shield that shaded i would and all the subject field beneath its ample verge a rolling cloud involved the mount the thunder roared aloud the affrighted hills from their foundations nod and blaze beneath the lightnings of the god at one regard of his allseeing eye the vanquished triumph and the victors fly then trembled greece the flight peneleus led for as the brave boeotian turned his head to face the foe polydamas drew near and razed his shoulder with a shortened spear by hector wounded leitus quits the plain pierced through the wrist and raging with the pain grasps his once formidable lance in vain as hector followed idomen addressed the flaming javelin to his manly breast the brittle point before his corselet yields exulting troy with clamor fills the fields high on his chariot as the cretan stood the son of priam whirled the missive wood but erring from its aim the impetuous spear struck to the dust the squire and charioteer of martial merion coeranus his name who left fair lyctus for the fields of fame on foot bold merion fought and now laid low had graced the triumphs of his trojan foe but the brave squire the ready coursers brought and with his life his masters safety bought between his cheek and ear the weapon went the teeth it shattered and the tongue it rent prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain his dying hand forgets the falling rein this merion reaches bending from the car and urges to desert the hopeless war idomeneus consents the lash applies and the swift chariot to the navy flies nor ajax less the will of heaven descried and conquest shifting to the trojan side turned by the hand of jove then thus begun to atreus seed the godlike telamon alas who sees not joves almighty hand transfers the glory to the trojan band whether the weak or strong discharge the dart he guides each arrow to a grecian heart not so our spears incessant though they rain he suffers every lance to fall in vain deserted of the god yet let us try what human strength and prudence can supply if yet this honored corpse in triumph born may glad the fleets that hope not our return who tremble yet scarce rescued from their fates and still hear hector thundering at their gates some hero too must be dispatched to bear the mournful message to pelides ear for sure he knows not distant on the shore his friend his loved patroclus is no more but such a chief i spy not through the host the men the steeds the armies all are lost in general darkness  lord of earth and air oh king oh father hear my humble prayer dispel this cloud the light of heaven restore give me to see and ajax asks no more if greece must perish we thy will obey but let us perish in the face of day with tears the hero spoke and at his prayer the god relenting cleared the clouded air forth burst the sun with allenlightning ray the blaze of armor flashed against the day now now atrides cast around thy sight if yet antilochus survives the fight let him to great achilles ear convey the fatal news  atrides hasts away so turns the lion from the nightly fold tho high in courage and with hunger bold long galled by herdsmen and long vexed by hounds stiff with fatigue and fretted sore with wounds the darts fly round him from a hundred hands and the red terrors of the blazing brands till late reluctant at the dawn of day sowr he departs and quits thuntasted prey so moved atrides from his dangerous place with wearied limbs but with unwilling pace the foe he feared might yet patroclus gain and much admonished much adjurd his train oh guard these relics to your charge consigned and bear the merits of the dead in mind how skilled he was in each obliging art the mildest manners and the gentlest heart he was alas but fate decreed his end in death a hero as in life a friend so parts the chief from rank to rank he flew and round on all sides sent his piercing view as the bold bird endud with sharpest eye of all that wing the mid aerial sky the sacred eagle from his walks above looks down and sees the distant thicket move then stoops and sowsing on the quivering hare snatches his life amid the clouds of air not with less quickness his exerted sight passed this and that way through the ranks of fight till on the left the chief he sought he found chearing his men and spreading deaths around to him the king beloved of jove draw near for sadder tidings never touched thy ear thy eyes have witnessed what a fatal turn how ilion triumphs and the achaians mourn this is not all patroclus on the shore now pale and dead shall succor greece no more fly to the fleet this instant fly and tell the sad achilles how his loved one fell he too may haste the naked corpse to gain the arms are hectors who despoiled the slain the youthful warrior heard with silent woe from his fair eyes the tears began to flow big with the mighty grief he strove to say what sorrow dictates but no word found way to brave laodocus his arms he flung who near him wheeling drove his steeds along then ran the mournful message to impart with tearful eyes and with dejected heart swift fled the youth nor menelaus stands though sore distressed to aid the pylian bands but bids bold thrasymede those troops sustain himself returns to his patroclus slain gone is antilochus the hero said but hope not warriors for achilles aid though fierce his rage unbounded be his woe unarmed he fights not with the trojan foe it is in our hands alone our hopes remain it is our own vigor must the dead regain and save our selves while with impetuous hate troy pours along and this way rolls our fate it is well said ajax be it then thy care with merions aid the weighty corse to rear my self and my bold brother will sustain the shock of hector and his charging train nor fear we armies fighting side by side what troy can dare we have already tried have tried it and have stood the hero said high from the ground the warriors heave the dead a general clamor rises at the sight loud shout the trojans and renew the fight not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood with rage insatiate and with thirst of blood voracious hounds that many a length before their furious hunters drive the wounded boar but if the savage turns his glaring eye they howl aloof and round the forest fly thus on retreating greece the trojans pour wave their thick falchions and their javlins shower but ajax turning to their fears they yield all pale they tremble and forsake the field while thus aloft the heros corse they bear behind them rages all the storm of war confusion tumult horror over the throng of men steeds chariots urged the rout along less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire to whelm some city under waves of fire now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes now crack the blazing temples of the gods the rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls and sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles the heroes sweat beneath their honored load as when two mules along the rugged road from the steep mountain with exerted strength drag some vast beam or masts unwieldy length inly they groan big drops of sweat distill thenormous timber lumbring down the hill so these  behind the bulk of ajax stands and breaks the torrent of the rushing bands thus when a river swelled with sudden rains spreads his broad waters over the level plains some interposing hill the stream divides and breaks its force and turns the winding tides still close they follow close the rear engage aeneas storms and hector foams with rage while greece a heavy thick retreat maintains wedged in one body like a flight of cranes that shriek incessant while the faulcon hung high on poised pinions threats their callow young so from the trojan chiefs the grecians fly such the wild terror and the mingled cry within without the trench and all the way strowd in bright heaps their arms and armor lay such horror jove impressed yet still proceeds the work of death and still the battle bleeds observations on the seventeenth book observations on the seventeenth book i this is the only book of the iliad which is a continued description of a battle without any digression or episode that serves for an interval to refresh the reader the heavenly machines too are fewer than in any other homer seems to have trusted wholly to the force of his own genius as sufficient to support him whatsoever lengths he was carried by it but that spirit which animates the original is what i am sensible evaporates so much in my hands that though i cannot think my author tedious i should have made him seem so if i had not translated this book with all possible conciseness i hope there is nothing material omitted though the version consists but of sixty five lines more than the original  however one may observe there are more turns of fortune more defeats more rallyings more accidents in this battle than in any other because it was to be the last wherein the greeks and trojans were upon equal terms before the return of achilles and besides all this serves to introduce the chief hero with the greater pomp and dignity  ii verse   great menelaus   the poet here takes occasion to clear menelaus from the imputations of idle and effeminate cast on him in some parts of the poem he sets him in the front of the army exposing himself to dangers in defending the body of patroclus and gives him the conquest of euphorbus who had the first hand in his death he is represented as the foremost who appears in his defense not only as one of a like disposition of mind with patroclus a kind and generous friend but as being more immediately concerned in honor to protect from injuries the body of a hero that fell in his cause eustathius see the   th note on the  d book  iii verse   thus round her new fallen young etc in this comparison as eustathius has very well observed the poet accomodating himself to the occasion means only to describe the affection menelaus had for patroclus and the manner in which he presented himself to defend his body and this comparison is so much the more just and agreeable as menelaus was a prince full of goodness and mildness he must have little sense or knowledge in poetry who thinks that it ought to be suppressed it is true we should not ues it nowadays by reason of the low ideas we have of the animals from which it is derived but those not being the ideas of homers time they could not hinder him from making a proper use of such a comparison dacier  iv verse id thus round her new fallen young etc it seems to me remarkable that the several comparisons to illustrate the concern for patroclus are taken from the most tender sentiments of nature achilles in the beginning of the   th book considers him as a child and himself as his mother the sorrow of menelaus is here described as that of a heifer for her young one perhaps these are designed to intimate the excellent temper and goodness of patroclus which is expressed in that fine elogy of him in this book      he knew how to be goodnatured to all men this gave all mankind these sentiments for him and no doubt the same is strongly pointed at by the uncommon concern of the whole army to rescue his body  the dissimilitude of manners between these two friends achilles and patroclus is very observable such friendships are not uncommon and i have often assigned this reason for them that it is natural for men to seek the assistance of those qualities in others which they want themselves that is still better if applied to providence that associates men of different and contrary qualities in order to make a more perfect system but whatever is customary in nature homer had a good poetical reason for it for it affords many incidents to illustrate the manners of them both more strongly and is what they call a contrast in painting  v verse    the son of panthus the conduct of homer is admirable in bringing euphorbus and menelaus together upon this occasion for hardly any thing but such a signal revenge for the death of his brother could have made euphorbus stand the encounter menelaus putting him in mind of the death of his brother gives occasion i think to one of the finest answers in all homer in which the insolence of menelaus is retorted in a way to draw pity from every reader and i believe there is hardly one after such a speech that would not wish euphorbus had the better of menelaus a writer of romances would not have failed to have given euphorbus the victory but however it was fitter to make menelaus who had received the greatest injury do the most revengeful actions  vi verse    instarrd with gems and gold we have here a trojan who uses gold and silver to adorn his hair which made pliny say that he doubted whether the women were the first that used those ornaments est quidem apud eundem homerum virorum crinibus aurum implexum ideo nescio an prior usus a foeminis coeperit lib    chap   he might likewise have strengthened his doubt by the custom of the athenians who put into their hair little grasshoppers of gold dacier  vii verse    as the young olive etc this exquisite simile finely illustrates the beauty and sudden fall of euphorbus in which the allusion to that circumstance of his comely hair is peculiarly happy porphyry and jamblicus acquaints us of the particular affection pythagoras had for these verses which he set to the harp and used to repeat at his own epicedion perhaps it was his fondness of them which put it into his head to say that his soul transmigrated to him from this hero however it was this conceit of pythagoras is famous in antiquity and has given occasion to a dialogue in lucian entitled the cock which is i think the finest piece of that author  viii verse    thus young thus beautiful euphorbus lay this is the only trojan whose death the poet laments that he might do the more honor to patroclus his heros friend the comparison here used is very proper for the olive always preserves its beauty but where the poet speaks of the lapithae a hardy and warlike people he compares them to oaks that stand unmoved in storms and tempests and where hector falls by ajax he likens him to an oak struck down by joves thunder just after this soft comparison upon the beauty of euphorbus he passes to another full of strength and terror that of the lion eustathius  ix verse   0 did but the voice of ajax reach my ear how observable is homers art of illustrating the valor and glory of his heroes menelaus who sees hector and all the trojans rushing upon him would not retire if apollo did not support them and though apollo does support them he would oppose even apollo were ajax but near him this is glorious for menelaus and yet more glorious for ajax and very suitable to his character for ajax was the bravest of the greeks next to achilles dacier eustathius  x verse     so from the fold the unwilling lion the beauty of the retreat of menelaus is worthy notice homer is a great observer of natural imagery that brings the thing represented before our view it is indeed true that lions tigers and beasts of prey are the only objects that can properly represent warriors and therefore it is no wonder they are so often introduced the inanimate things as floods fires and storms are the best and only images of battles  xi verse     already had stern hector etc homer takes care so long beforehand to lessen in his readers mind the horror he may conceive from the cruelty that achilles will exercise upon the body of hector that cruelty will be only the punishment of this which hector here exercises upon the body of patroclus he drags him he designs to cut off his head and to leave his body upon the ramparts exposed to dogs and birds of prey eustathius  xii verse     you left him there a prey to dogs it was highly dishonorable in hector to forsake the body of a friend and guest and against the laws of jupiter xenius or hospitalis for glaucus knew nothing of sarpedons being honored with burial by the gods and sent embalmed into lycia eustathius  xiii verse     i shun great ajax hector takes no notice of the affronts that glaucus had thrown upon him as knowing he had in some respects a just cause to be angry but he cannot put up what he had said of his fearing ajax to which part he only replies this is very agreeable to his heroic character eustathius  xiv verse  0  hector in proud achilles arms shall shine the ancients have observed that homer causes the arms of achilles to fall into hectors power to equal in some sort those two heroes in the battle wherein he is going to engage them otherwise it might be urged that achilles could not have killed hector without the advantage of having his armous made by the hand of a god whereas hectors was only of the hand of a mortal but since both were clad in armor made by vulcan achilless victory will be complete and in its full luster besides this reason which is for necessity and probability there is also another for ornament for homer here prepares to introduce that beautiful episode of the divine armor which vulcan makes for achilles eustathius  xv verse     the radiant arms to sacred ilion bore a difficulty may arise here and the question may be asked why hector sent these arms to troy why did not he take them at first there are three answers which i think are all plausible the first that hector having killed patroclus and seeing the day very far advanced had no mind to take those arms for a fight almost at an end the second that he was impatient to show to priam and andromache those glorious spoils thirdly he perhaps at first intended to hang them up in some temple glaucuss speech makes him change his resolution he runs after those arms to fight against ajax and to win patrocluss body from him dacier  homer says eustathius does not suffer the arms to be carried into troy for these reasons that hector by wearing them might the more encourage the trojans and be the more formidable to the greeks that achilles may recover them again when he kills hector and that he may conquer him even when he is strengthened with that divine armor  xvi verse     jupiter s speech to hector the poet prepares us for the death of hector perhaps to please the greek readers who might be troubled to see him shining in their heroes arms therefore jupiter expresses his sorrow at the approaching fate of this unfortunate prince promises to repay his loss of life with glory and nods to give a certain confirmation to his words he says achilles is the bravest greek as glaucus had said just before the poet thus giving him the greatest commendations by putting his praise in the mouth of a god and of an enemy who were neither of them like to be prejudiced in his favor eustathius  how beautiful is that sentiment upon the miserable state of mankind introduced here so artfully and so strongly enforced by being put into the mouth of the supreme being and how pathetic the denunciation of hectors death by that circumstance of andromaches disappointment when she shall no more receive her hero glorious from the battle in the armor of his conquered enemy  xvii verse     the stubborn arms etc the words are   if we give  a passive signification it will be the arms fitted hector but if an active as those take it who would put a greater difference between hector and achilles then it belongs to jupiter and the sense will be jupiter made the arms fit for him which were too large before i have chosen the last as the more poetical sense  xviii verse   0 unnumberd bands of neighboring nations eustathius has very well explained the artifice of this speech of hector who indirectly answers all glaucuss invectives and humbles his vanity glaucus had just spoken as if the lycians were the only allies of troy and hector here speaks of the numerous troops of different nations which he expressly designs by calling them borderers upon his kingdom thereby in some manner to exclude the lycians who were of a country more remote as if he did not vouchsafe to reckon them he afterward confutes what glaucus said that if the lycians would take his advice they would return home for he gives them to understand that being hired troops they are obliged to perform their bargain and to fight till the war is at an end dacier  xix verse   0 call on our greeks eustathius gives three reasons why ajax bids menelaus call the greeks to their assistance instead of calling them himself he might be shamed to do it lest it should look like fear and turn to his dishonor or the chiefs were more likely to obey menelaus or he had too much business of the war upon his hands and wanted leisure more than the other  xx verse  0  oilean ajax first ajax oileus says eustathius is the first that comes being brought by his love to the other ajax as it is natural for one friend to fly to the assistance of another to which we may add he might very probably come first because he was the swiftest of all the heroes  xxi verse     jove pouring darkness homer who in all his former descriptions of battles is so fond of mentioning the luster of the arms here shades them in darkness perhaps alluding to the clouds of dust that were raised or to the throng of combatants or else to denote the loss of greece in patroclus or lastly that as the heavens had mourned sarpedon in showers of blood so they might patroclus in clouds of darkness eustathius  xxii verse     panope renowned panope was a small town twenty stadia from chaeronea on the side of mount parnassus and it is hard to know why homer gives it the epithet of renowned and makes it the residence of schedius king of the phocians when it was but nine hundred paces in circuit and had no palace nor gymnasium nor theater nor market nor fountain nothing in short that ought to have been in a town which is the residence of a king pausanias in phocic gives the reason of it he says that as phocis was exposed on that side to the inroads of the boeotians schedius made use of panope as a sort of citadel or place of arms dacier  xxiii verse     he seemed like aged periphas the speech of periphas to aeneas hints at the double fate and the necessity of means it is much like that of st paul after he was promised that no body should perish he says except these abide ye cannot be saved  xxiv verse     in one thick darkness etc the darkness spread over the body of patroclus is artful upon several accounts first a fine image of poetry next a token of jupiters love to a righteous man but the chief design is to portract the action which if the trojans had seen the spot must have been decided one way or other in a very short time besides the trojans having the better in the action must have seized the body contrary to the intention of the author there are innumerable instances of these little niceties and particularities of conduct in homer  xxv verse     meanwhile the sons of nestor in the rear etc it is not without reason homer in this place makes particular mention of the sons of nestor it is to prepare us against he sends one of them to achilles to tell him the death of his friend  xxvi verse   0 as when a slaughtered bulls yet reeking hide homer gives us a most lively description of their drawing the body on all sides and instructs us in the ancient manner of stretching hides being first made soft and supple with oil and though this comparison be one of those mean and humble ones which some have objected to yet it has also its admirers for being so expressive and for representing to the imagination the most strong and exact idea of the subject in hand eustathius  xxvii verse     not pallas self etc homer says in the original  minerva could not have found fault though she were angry upon which eustathius ingeniously observes how common and natural it is for persons in anger to turn critics and find faults where there are none  xxviii verse     to make proud ilion bend was more than heaven had promised to his friend perhaps to him in these words the poet artfully hints at achilless death he makes him not absolutely to flatter himself with the hopes of ever taking troy in his own person however he does not say this expressly but passes it over as an ungrateful subject eustathius  xxix verse     the rest in pity to her son concealed here says the same author we have two rules laid down for common use one not to tell our friends all their mischances at once it being often necessary to hide part of them as thetis does from achilles the other not to push men of courage upon all that is possible for them to do thus achilles though he thought patroclus able to drive the trojans back to their gates yet he does not order him to do so much but only to save the ships and beat them back into the field  homers admonishing the reader that achilless mother had concealed the circumstance of the death of his friend when she instructed him in his fate and that all he knew was only that troy could not be taken at that time this is a great instance of his care of the probability and of his having the whole plan of the poem at once in his head for upon the supposition that achilles was instructed in his fate it was a natural objection how came he to hazard his friend if he was ignorant on the other hand of the impossibility of troys being taken at that time he might for all he knew be robbed by his friend of whose valor he had so good an opinion of that glory which he was unwilling to part with  xxx verse     the pensive steeds of great achilles etc it adds a great beauty to a poem when inanimate things act like animate thus the heavens tremble at jupiters nod the sea parts it self to receive neptune the groves of ida shake beneath junos feet etc as also to find animate or brute creatures addressed to as if rational so hector encourages his horses and one of achilless is endued not only with speech but with foreknowledge of future events here they weep for patroclus and stand fixed and unmovable with grief thus is this hero universally mourned and every thing concurs to lament his loss eustathius  as to the particular fiction of the horses weeping it is countenanced both by naturalists and historians aristotle and pliny write that these animals often deplore their masters lost in battle and even shed tears for them so solinus c    aelian relates the like of elephants when they are carried from their native country de animal lib  0 c    suetonius in the life of caesar tells us that several horses which at the passage of the rubicon had been consecrated to mars and turned loose on the banks were observed for some days after to abstain from feeding and to weep abundantly proximis diebus equorum greges quos in trajiciendo rubicone flumine marti consecrarat ac sine custode vagos dimiserat comperit pabulo pertinacissime abstinere ubertimque flere cap     virgil could not forbear copying this beautiful circumstance in those fine lines on the horse of pallas post bellator equus positis insignibus aethon it lacrymans guttisque humectat grandibus ora   xxxi verse     at distance from the scene of blood if the horses had not gone aside out of the war homer could not have introduced so well what he designed to their honor so he makes them weeping in secret as their master achilles used to do and afterward coming into the battle where they are taken notice of and pursued by hector eustathius  xxxii verse     or fixed as stands a marble courser etc homer alludes to the custom in those days of placing columns upon tombs on which columns there were frequently chariots with two or four horses this furnished homer with this beautiful image as if these horses meant to remain there to serve for an immortal monument to patroclus dacier  i believe m dacier refines too much in this note homer says   and seems to turn the thought only on the firmness of the column and not on the imagry of it which would give it an air a little too modern like that of shakespeare she sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief  be it as it will this conjecture is ingenious and the whole comparison is as beautiful as just the horses standing still to mourn for their master could not be more finely represented than by the dumb sorrow of images standing over a tomb perhaps the very posture in which these horses are described their heads bowed down and their manes falling in the dust has an allusion to the attitude in which those statues on monuments were usually represented there are basreliefs that favor this conjecture  xxxiii verse     the sun shall see troy conquer it is worth observing with what art and economy homer conducts his fable to bring on the catastrophe achilles must hear patrocluss death hector must fall by his hand this can not happen if the armies continue fighting about the body of patroclus under the walls of troy therefore to change the face of affairs jupiter is going to raise the courage of the trojans and make them repulse and chase the greeks again as far as their fleet this obliges achilles to go forth though without arms and thereby every thing comes to an issue dacier  xxxiv verse     scarce their weak drivers there was but one driver since alcimedon was alone upon the chariot and automedon was got down to fight but in poetry as well as in painting there is often but one moment to be taken hold on hector sees alcimedon mount the chariot before automedon was descended from it and thereupon judging of their intention and seeing them both as yet upon the chariot he calls to aeneas he terms them both drivers in mockery because he saw them take the reins one after the other as if he said that chariot had two drivers but never a fighter it is one single moment that makes this image in reading the poets one often falls into great perplexities for want of rightly distinguishing the point of time in which they speak dacier  the art of homer in this whole passage concerning automedon is very remarkable in finding out the only proper occasion for so renowned a person as the charioteer of achilles to signalize his valor  xxxv verse     in vain brave youths with glorious hopes ye burn in vain advance not fated to return these beautiful anticipations are frequent in the poets who affect to speak in the character of prophets and men inspired with the knowledge of futurity thus virgil to turnus nescia mens hominum fati  turno tempus erit etc   so tasso cant    when argante had vowed the destruction of tancred o vani giuramenti ecco contrari seguir tosto gli effetti a l alta speme e cader questi in teneon pari estinto sotto colui ch ei fa gia preso e vinto   and milton makes the like apostrophe to eve at her leaving adam before she met the serpent  she to him engaged to be returned by noon amid the bower and all things in best order to invite noontide repast or afternoons repose o much deceived much failing hapless eve thou never from that hour in paradise foundst either sweet repast or sound repose   xxxvi verse     so burns the vengesul hornet etc it is literally in the greek she inspired the hero with the boldness of a fly there is no impropriety in the comparison this animal being of all others the most persevering in its attacks and the most difficult to be beaten off the occasion also of the comparison being the resolute persistance of menelaus about the dead body renders it still the more just but our present idea of the fly is indeed very low as taken from the littleness and insignificancy of this creature however since there is really no meanness in it there ought to be none in expressing it and i have done my best in the translation to keep up the dignity of my author  xxxvii verse     by hector loved his comrade and his guest podes the favorite and companion of hector being killed on this occasion seems a parallel circumstance to the death of achilless favorite and companion and was probably put in here on purpose to engage hector on a like occasion with achilles  xxxviii verse     some hero too must be dispatched etc it seems odd that they did not sooner send this message to achilles but there is some apology for it from the darkness and difficulty of finding a proper person it was not every body that was proper to send but one who was a particuar friend to achilles who might condole with him such was antilochus who is sent afterward and who besides had that necessary qualification of being  eustathius  xxxix verse     if grecce must perish we thy will obey but let us perish in the face of day this thought has been looked upon as one of the sublimest in homer longinus represents it in this manner the thickest darkness had on a sudden covered the grecian army and hindered them from fighting when ajax not knowing what course to take cries out oh jove disperse this darkness which covers the greeks and if we must perish let us perish in the light this is a sentiment truly worthy of ajax he does not pray for life that had been unworthy a hero but because in that darkness he could not employ his valor to any glorious purpose and vexed to stand idle in the field of battle he only prays that the day may appear as being assured of putting an end to it worthy his great heart though jupiter himself should happen to oppose his efforts  m l abbe terasson in his dissertation on the iliad endeavors to prove that longinus has misrepresented the whole context and sense of this passage of homer the fact says he is that ajax is in a very different situation in homer from that wherein longinus describes him he has not the least intention of fighting he thinks only of finding out some fit person to send to achilles and this darkness hindering him from seeing such an one is the occasion of his prayer accordingly it appears by what follows that as soon as jupiter has dispersed the cloud ajax never falls upon the enemy but in consequence of his former thought orders menelaus to look for antilochus to dispatch him to achilles with the news of the death of his friend longinus continues this author had certainly forgot the place from whence he took this thought and it is not the first citation from homer which the ancients have quoted wrong thus aristotle attributes to calypso the words of ulysses in the twelfth book of the odysseis and confounds together two passages one of the second the other of the fifteenth book of the iliad  ethic ad nicom l   c   and l   c    and thus cicero ascribed to agamemnon a long discourse of ulysses in the second iliad  de divinatione l   and cited as ajaxs the speech of hector in the seventh see aul gellius l    c   one has no cause to wonder at this since the ancients having homer almost by heart were for that very reason the more subject to mistake in citing him by memory  to this i think one may answer that granting it was partly the occasion of ajaxs prayer to obtain light in order to send to achilles which he afterward does yet the thought which longinus attributes to him is very consistent with it and the last line expresses nothing else but an heroic desire rather to die in the light than escape with safety in the darkness  but indeed the whole speech is only meant to paint the concern and distress of a brave general the thought of sending a messenger is only a result from that concern and distress and so but a small circumstance which cannot be said to occasion the prayer  mons boileau has translated this passage in two lines grand dieu chasse la nuit qui nous couvre les yeux et combats contre nous a la clarte des cieux and mr la motte yet better in one grand dieu rends nous le jour and combats contre nous but both these as dacier very justly observes are contrary to homers sense he is far from representing ajax of such a daring impiety as to bid jupiter combat against him but only makes him ask for light that if it be his will the greeks shall perish they may perish in open day   says he that is abandon us withdraw from us your assistance for those who are deserted by jove must perish infallibly this decorum of homer ought to have been preserved  xl verse     the mildest manners and the gentlest heart this is a fine elogium of patroclus homer dwells upon it on purpose lest achilless character should be mistaken and shows by the praises he bestows here upon goodness that achilless character is not commendable for morality achilless manners entirely opposite to those of patroclus are not morally good they are only poetically so that is to say they are well marked and discover beforehand what resolutions that hero will take as has been at large explained upon aristotles poeticks dacier  xli verse     the youthful warrior heard with silent woe homer ever represents an excess of grief by a deep horror silence weeping and not enquiring into the manner of the friends death nor could antilochus have expressed his sorrow in any manner so moving as silence eustathius  xlii verse     to brave laodocus his arms he flung antilochus leaves his armor not only that he might make the more haste but as the ancients conjecture that he might not be thought to be absent by the enemies and that seeing his armor on some other person they might think him still in the fight eustathius  xliii verse     but hope not warriors for achilles aid unarmed   this is an ingenious way of making the valor of achilles appear the greater who though without arms goes forth in the next book contrary to the expectation of ajax and menelaus dacier  xliv verse     etc this heap of images which homer throws together at the end of this book makes the same action appear with a very beautiful variety the description of the burning of a city is short but very lively that of ajax alone bringing up the rear guard and shielding those that bore the body of patroclus from the whole trojan host gives a prodigious idea of ajax and as homer has often hinted makes him just second to achilles the image of the beam paints the great stature of patroclus that of the hill dividing the stream is noble and natural  he compares the ajaxes to a boar for their fierceness and boldness to a long bank that keeps off the course of the waters for their standing firm and immovable in the battle those that carry the dead body to mules dragging a vast beam through rugged paths for their laboriousness the body carried to a beam for being heavy and inanimate the trojans to dogs for their boldness and to water for their agility and moving backwards and forwards the greeks to a flight of starlings and jays for their timorousness and swiftness eustathius  the eighteenth book of the iliad the argument the grief of achilles and new armor made him by vulcan the news of the death of patroclus is brought to achilles by antilochus thetis hearing his lamentations comes with all her seanymphs to comfort him the speeches of the mother and son on this occasion iris appears to achilles by the command of juno and orders him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments the sight of him turns the fortune of the day and the body of patroclus is carried off by the greeks the trojans call a council where hector and polydamas disagree in their opinions but the advice of the former prevails to remain encamped in the field the grief of achilles over the body of patroclus  thetis goes to the palace of vulcan to obtain new arms for her son the description of the wonderful works of vulcan and lastly that noble one of the shield of achilles  the latter part of the nine and twentieth day and the night ensuing take up this book the scene is at achilless tent on the seashore from whence it changes to the palace of vulcan  the eighteenth book of the iliad thus like the rage of fire the combat burns and now it rises now it sinks by turns meanwhile where hellesponts broad waters flow stood nestors son the messenger of woe there sat achilles shaded by his sails on hoisted yards extended to the gales pensive he sat for all that fate designed rose in sad prospect to his boding mind thus to his soul he said ah what constrains the greeks late victors now to quit the plains is this the day which heaven so long ago ordained to sink me with the weight of woe so thetis warned when by a trojan hand the bravest of the myrmidonian band should lose the light fulfilled is that decree fallen is the warrior and patroclus he in vain i charged him soon to quit the plain and warned to shun hectorean force in vain thus while he thinks antilochus appears and tells the melancholy tale with tears sad tidings son of peleus thou must hear and wretched i the unwilling messenger dead is patroclus for his corpse they fight his naked corpse his arms are hectors right a sudden horror shot through all the chief and wrapped his senses in the cloud of grief cast on the ground with furious hands he spread the scorching ashes over his graceful head his purple garments and his golden hairs those he deforms with dust and these he tears on the hard soil his groaning breast he threw and rolled and groveld as to earth he grew the virgin captives with disordered charms won by his own or by patroclus arms rushed from the tents with cries and gathering round beat their white breasts and

part the tides while the long pomp the silver wave divides approaching now they touched the trojan land then two by two ascended up the strand the immortal mother standing close beside her mournful offspring to his sighs replied along the coast their mingled clamours ran and thus the silverfooted dame began why mourns my son thy latepreferrd request the god has granted and the greeks distressed why mourns my son thy anguish let me share reveal the cause and trust a parents care he deeply groaning  to this cureless grief not even the thundrers favor brings relief patroclus  ah  say goddess

the glorious load cursed be that day when all the powers above thy charms submitted to a mortal love oh had thou still a sister of the main pursued the pleasures of the watery reign and happier peleus less ambitious led a mortal beauty to his equal bed ever the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb had caused such sorrows past and woes to come for soon alas that wretched offspring slain new woes new

the tempest to the tented shore the horse the foot with equal fury joined poured on the rear and thundered close behind and like a flame through fields of ripened corn the rage of hector over the ranks was born thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew thrice to the skies the trojan clamours flew as often the ajaces his assault sustain but checked he turns repulsed attacks again with fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires nor yields a step nor form his post retires so watchful sheperds strive to force in vain the hungry lion from a carcass slain even yet patroclus had he born away

spoke and past in air the hero rose her aegis pallas over his shoulders throws around his brows a golden cloud she spread a stream of glory flamed above his head as when from some beleagurd town arise the smokes highcurling to the shaded skies seen from some island over the main afar when men distressed hang out the sign of war soon as the sun in ocean hides his rays thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze with longprojected beams the seas are bright and heavens high arch reflects the ruddy light so from achilles head the splendours rise reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies forth marched the chief and distant from the crowd high on the rampart raised his voice aloud with her own shout minerva swells the sound troy starts astonished and the shores rebound as the loud trumpets brazen mouth from far with shrilling clangor sounds the alarm of war struck from the walls the echoes float on high and the round bulwarks and thick towers reply so high his brazen voice the hero reared hosts drop their arms and trembled as they heard and back the chariots roll and coursers bound and steeds and men lie mingled on the ground aghast they see the living lightenings play and turn their eye balls from the flashing ray thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised and thrice they fled confounded and amazed twelve in the tumult wedged untimely rushed on their own spears by their own chariots crushed while shielded from the darts the greeks obtain the longcontended carcass of the slain a lofty bier the breathless warrior bears around his sad companions melt in tears but chief achilles bending down his head pours unavailing sorrows over the dead whom late triumphant with his steeds and car he sent refulgent to the field of war unhappy change now senseless pale he found stretched forth and gashd with many a gaping wound meantime unwearied with his heavenly way in oceans waves the unwilling light of day quench his red orb at junos high command and from their labors eased the achaian band the frighted trojans panting from the war their steeds unharnessd from the weary car a sudden council called each chief appeared in haste and standing for to sit they feared twas now no season for prolonged debate they saw achilles and in him their fate silent they stood polydamas at last skilled to discern the future by the past the son of panthus thus expressed his fears the friend of hector and of equal years the self same night to both a being gave one wise in council one in action brave in free debate my friends your sentence speak for me i move before the morning break to raise our camp too dangerous here our post far from troy walls and on a naked coast i deemed not greece so dreadful while engaged in mutual feuds her king and hero raged then while we hoped our armies might prevail we boldly campd beside a thousand sail i dread pelides now his rage of mind not long continues to the shores confined nor to the fields where long in equal fray contending nations won and lost the day for troy for troy shall henceforth be the strife and the hard contest not for fame but life haste then to ilion while the favoring night detains those terrors keeps that arm from fight if but the morrows sun behold us here that arm those terrors we shall feel not fear and hearts that now disdain shall leap with joy if heaven permits them then to enter troy let not my fatal prophecy be true nor what i tremble but to think ensue whatever be our fate yet let us try what force of thought and reason can supply let us on counsel for our guard depend the town her gates and bulwarks shall defend when morning dawns our wellappointed powers arrayed in arms shall line the lofty towers let the fierce hero then when fury calls vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls or fetch a thousand circles round the plain till his spent coursers seek the fleet again so may his rage be tired and labored down and dogs shall tear him ever he sack the town return said hector fired with stern disdain what coop whole armies in our walls again was it not enough ye valiant warriors say nine years imprisoned in those towers ye lay wide over the world was ilion famed of old for brass exhaustless and for mines of gold but while inglorious in her walls we stayed sunk were her treasures and her stores decayed the phrygians now her scattered spoils enjoy and proud maeonia wastes the fruits of troy great jove at length my arms to conquest calls and shuts the grecians in their wooden walls dare thou dispirit whom the gods incite flies any trojan i shall stop his flight to better counsel then attention lend take due refreshment and the watch attend if there be one whose riches cost him care forth let him bring them for the troops to share it is better genrously bestowed on those than left the plunder of our countrys foes soon as the morn the rosy welkin warms fierce on yon navy will we pour our arms if great achilles rise in all his might his be the danger i shall stand the fight honor ye gods or let me gain or give and live he glorious whosoeer shall live mars is our common lord alike to all and often the victor triumphs but to fall the shouting host in loud applauses joined so pallas robbed the many of their mind to their own sense condemned and left to choose the worse advice the better to refuse while the long night extends her sable reign around patroclus mourned the grecian train stern in superior grief pelides stood those slaughtring arms so used to bathe in blood now clasp his claycold limbs then gushing start the tears and sighs burst from his swelling heart the lion thus with dreadful anguish stung roars through the desert and demands his young when the grim savage to his rifled den too late returning snuffs the track of men and over the vales and over the forest bounds his clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds so grieves achilles and impetuous vents to all his myrmidons his loud laments in what vain promise gods did i engage when to console menaetius feeble age i vowed his muchloved offspring to restore charged with rich spoils to fair opuntias shore but mighty jove cuts short with just disdain the long long views of poor designing man one fate the warrior and the friend shall strike and troys black sands must drink our blood alike me too a wretched mother shall deplore an aged father never see me more yet my patroclus yet a space i stay then swift pursue thee on the darksome way ever thy dear relics in the grave are laid shall hectors head be offered to thy shade that with his arms shall hang before thy shrine and twelve the noblest of the trojan line slain by this hand sad sacrifice expire their lives effusd around thy flaming pyre thus let me lie till then thus closely pressed bathe thy cold face and sob upon thy breast while trojan captives here thy mourners stay weep all the night and murmur all the day spoils of my arms and thine when wasting wide our swords kept time and conquered side by side he spoke and bid the sad attendants round cleanse the pale corse and wash each honored wound a massy caldron of stupendous frame they brought and placed it over the rising flame then heap the lighted wood the flame divides beneath the vase and climbs around the sides in its wide womb they pour the rushing stream the boiling water bubbles to the brim the body then they bathe with pious toil embalm the wounds anoint the limbs with oil high on a bed of state extended laid and decent covered with a linen shade last over the dead the milkwhite linen threw that done their sorrows and their sighs renew meanwhile to juno in the realms above his wife and sister spoke almighty jove at last thy will prevails great peleus son rises in arms such grace thy greeks have won say for i know not is their race divine and thou the mother of that martial line what words are these the imperial dame replies while anger flashed from her majestic eyes succor like this a mortal arm might lend and such success mere human wit attend and shall not i the second power above heavens queen and consort of the thundering jove say shall not i one nations fate command not wreak my vengeance on one guilty land so they meanwhile the silverfooted dame reached the vulcanian dome eternal frame high eminent amid the works divine where heavens farbeaming brazen mansions shine there the lame architect the goddess found obscure in smoke his forges flaming round while bathed in sweat from fire to fire he flew and puffing loud the roaring bellows blew that day no common task his labor claimed full twenty tripods for his hall he framed that placed on living wheels of massy gold wondrous to tell instinct with spirit rolled from place to place around the blessed abodes selfmovd obedient to the beck of gods for their fair handles now oerwrought with flowers in molds prepared the glowing ore he pours just as responsive to his thought the frame stood prompt to move the azure goddess came charis his spouse a grace divinely fair with purple fillets round her braided hair observed her entering her soft hand she pressed and smiling thus the watery queen addressed what goddess this unusual favor draws all hail and welcome whatsoever the cause till now a stranger in a happy hour approach and taste the dainties of the bower high on a throne with stars of silver graced and various artifice the queen she placed a footstool at her feet then calling said vulcan draw near it is thetis asks your aid thetis replied the god our powers may claim an ever dear and ever honored name when my proud mother hurled me from the sky my awkward form it seems displeased her eye she and eurynome my griefs redrest tnd soft received me on their silver breast even then these arts employed my infant thought chains bracelets pendants all their toys i wrought nine years kept secret in the dark abode secure i lay concealed from man and god deep in a cavernd rock my days were led the rushing ocean murmured over my head now since her presence glads our mansion say for such desert what service can i pay vouchsafe o thetis at our board to share the genial rites and hospitable fare while i my labors of the forge forego and bid the roaring bellows cease to blow then from his anvil the lame artist rose wide with distorted legs oblique he goes and stills the bellows and in order laid locks in their chest his instruments of trade then with a sponge the sooty workman dressed his brawny arms imbrownd and hairy breast with his huge scepter graced and red attire came halting forth the sovereign of the fire the monarchs steps two female forms uphold that moved and breathed in animated gold to whom was voice and sense and science given of works divine such wonders are in heaven on these supported with unequal gait he reached the throne where pensive thetis sat there placed beside her on the shining frame he thus addressed the silverfooted dame thee welcome goddess what occasion calls so long a stranger to these honored walls it is thine fair thetis the command to lay and vulcans joy and duty to obey to whom the mournful mother thus replies the crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes oh vulcan say was ever breast divine so pierced with sorrows so overwhelmed as mine of all the goddesses did jove prepare for thetis only such a weight of care i only i of all the watery race by force subjected to a mans embrace who sinking now with age and sorrow pays the mighty fine imposed on length of days sprung from my bed a godlike hero came the bravest sure that ever bore the name like some fair plant beneath my careful hand he grew he flourished and he graced the land to troy i sent him but his native shore never ah never shall receive him more even while he lives he wastes with secret woe nor i a goddess can retard the blow robbed of the prize the grecian suffrage gave the king of nations forced his royal slave for this he grieved and till the greeks oppressed required his arm he sorrowd unredrest large gifts they promise and their elders send in vain  he arms not but permits his friend his arms his steeds his forces to employ he marches combats almost conquers troy then slain by phoebus  hector had the name at once resigns his armor life and fame but thou in pity by my prayer be won grace with immortal arms this shortlived son and to the field in martial pomp restore to shine with glory till he shines no more to her the artistgod thy griefs resign secure what vulcan can is ever thine o could i hide him from the fates as well or with these hands the cruel stroke repel as i shall forge most envied arms the gaze of wondering ages and the worlds amaze thus having said the father of the fires to the black labors of his forge retires soon as he bade them blow the bellows turned their iron mouths and where the furnace burned resounding breathed at once the blast expires and twenty forges catch at once the fires just as the god directs now loud now low they raise a tempest or they gently blow in hissing flames huge silver bars are rolled and stubborn brass and tin and solid gold before deep fixed the eternal anvils stand the ponderous hammer loads his better hand his left with tongs turns the vexed metal round and thick strong strokes the doubling vaults rebound then first he formed thimmense and solid shield rich various

newmade brides are led with torches flaming to the nuptial bed the youthful dancers in a circle bound to the soft flute and citterns silver sound through the fair streets the matrons in a row stand in

mars made bold gold were the gods their radiant garments gold and gold their armor these the squadron led august divine superior by the head a place for ambush fit they found and stood covered with shields beside a silver flood two spies at distance lurk and watchful seem if sheep or oxen seek the winding stream soon the white flocks proceeded over the plains and steers slowmoving and two shepherd swains behind them piping on their reeds they go nor fear an ambush nor suspect a foe in arms the glittering squadron rising round rush sudden hills of slaughter heap the ground whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains and all amidst them dead the shepherd wains the bellowing oxen the besiegers hear they rise take horse approach and meet the war they fight they fall beside the silver flood the waving silver seemed to blush with blood there tumult there contention stood confessed one reared a dagger at a captives breast one held a living foe that freshly bled with newmade wounds another dragged a dead now here now there the carcasses they tore fate stalked amidst them grim with human gore and the whole war came out and met the eye and each bold figure seemed to live or die a field deep furrowed next the god designed the third time labored by the sweating hind the shining shares full many plowmen guide and turn their crooked yokes on every side still as at either end

sheaves here thicken up the ground with sweeping stroke the mowers strew the lands the gathrers follow and collect in bands and last the children in whose arms are born too short to gripe them the

heads fair maids and blooming youths that smiling bear the purple product of thautumnal year to these a youth awakes the warbling strings whose tender lay the fate of linus sings in measured dance behind him move the train tune soft the voice and answer to the strain here herds of oxen march erect and bold rear high their horns and seem to low in gold and speed to meadows on whose sounding shores a rapid torrent through the rushes roars four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand and nine sour dogs complete the rustic band two lions rushing from the wood appeared and seized a bull the master of the herd he roared in vain the dogs the men withstood they tore his flesh and drank the sable blood the dogs often cheered in vain desert the prey dread the grim terrors and at distance bay next this the eye the art of vulcan leads deep through fair forests and a length of meads and stalls and folds and scattered cotts between and fleecy flocks that whiten all the scene a figured dance succeeds such once was seen in lofty gnossus for the cretan queen formed by daedalean art a comely band of youths and maidens bounding hand in hand the maids in soft cymarrs of linen dressed the

and herds of cattle    sheep    the dance    saml gribelin junr sculp   observations on the eighteenth book i verse   thus like the rage of fire etc this phrase is usual in our author to signify a sharp battle fought with heat and fury on both parts such an engagement like a flame preying upon all sides and dying the sooner the fiercer it burns eustathius  ii verse   on hoisted yards the epithet  in this place has a more than ordinary sgnification it implies that the sailyards were hoisted up and achilless ships on the point to set sail this shows that it was purely in compliance to his friend that he permitted him to succor the greeks he meant to leave em as soon as patroclus returned he still remembered what he told the ambassadors in the ninth book   0 to morrow you shall see my fleet set sail accordingly this is the day appointed and he is fixed to his resolution this circumstance wonderfully strengthens his implacable character  iii verse   pensive he sat homer in this artful manner prepares achilles for the fatal message and gives him these forebodings of his misfortunes that they might be no less than he expected  his expressions are suitable to his concern and delivered confusedly i bad him says he after he had saved the ships and repulsed the trojans to return back and not engage himself too far here he breaks off when he should have added but he was so unfortunate as to forget my advice as he is reasoning with himself antilochus comes in which makes him leave the sense imperfect eustathius  iv verse    fulfilled is that decree slain is the warrior and patroclus he it may be objected that achilles seems to contradict what had been said in the foregoing book that thetis concealed from her son the death of patroclus in her prediction whereas here he says that she had foretold he should lose the bravest of the thessalians there is nothing in this but what is natural and common among mankind and it is still more agreeable to the hasty and inconsiderate temper of achilles not to have made that reflection till it was too late prophecies are only marks of divine prescience not warnings to prevent human misfortunes for if they were they must hinder their own accomplishment  v verse    sad tidings son of peleus this speech of antilochus ought to serve as a model for the brevity with which so dreadful a piece of news ought to be delivered for in two verses it comprehends the whole affair the death of patroclus the person that killed him the contest for his body and his arms in the possession of the enemy besides it should be observed that grief has so crowded his words that in these two verses he leaves the verb  they fight without its nominative the greeks or trojans homer observes this brevity upon all the like occasions the greek tragic poets have not always imitated this discretion in great distresses there is nothing more ridiculous than a messenger who begins a long story with pathetic descriptions he speaks without being heard for the person to whom he addresses himself has no time to attend him the first word which discovers to him his misfortune has made him deaf to all the rest eustathius  vi verse    a sudden horror etc a modern french writer has drawn a parallel of the conduct of homer and virgil in relation to the deaths of patroclus and of pallas the latter is killed by turnus as the former by hector turnus triumphs in the spoils of the one as hector is clad in the arms of the other aeneas revenges the death of pallas by that of turnus as achilles the death of patroclus by that of hector the grief of achilles in homer on the score of patroclus is much greater than that of aeneas in virgil for the sake of pallas achilles gives himself up to despair with a weakness which plato could not pardon in him and which can only be excused on account of the long and close friendship between em that of aeneas is more discreet and seems more worthy of a hero it was not possible that aeneas could be so deeply interested for any man as achilles was interested for patroclus for virgil had no color to kill ascanius who was little more than a child besides that his heros interest in the war of italy was great enough of itself not to need to be animated by so touching a concern as the fear of losing his son on the other hand achilles having but very little personal concern in the war of troy as he had told agamemnon in the beginning of the poem and knowing besides that he was to perish there required some very pressing motive to engage him to persist in it after such disgusts and insults as he had received it was this which made it necessary for these two great poets to treat a subject so much in their own nature alike in a manner so different but as virgil found it admirable in homer he was willing to approach it as near as the economy of his work would permit  vii verse    cast on the ground etc this is a fine picture of the grief of achilles we see on the one hand the posture in which the hero receives the news of his friends death he falls upon the ground he rends his hair he snatches the ashes and casts them on his head according to the manner of those times but what much enlivens it in this place is his sprinkling embers instead of ashes in the violence of his passion on the other side the captives are running from their tents ranging themselves about him and answering to his groans beside him stands antilochus fetching deep sighs and hanging on the arms of the hero for fear his despair and rage should cause some desperate attempt upon his own life there is no painter but will be touched with this image  viii verse    the virgin captives the captive maids lamented either in pity for their lord or in gratitude to the memory of patroclus who was remarkable for his goodness and affability or under these pretenses mourned for their own misfortunes and slavery eustathius  ix verse    like some fair plant beneath my careful hand this passage where the mother compares her son to a tender plant raised and preserved with care has a most remarkable resemblance to that in the psalms thy children like branches of olive trees round thy table psalm      x verse  00     the two speeches of achilles to thetis it is not possible to imagine more lively and beautiful strokes of nature and passion than those which our author ascribes to achilles throughout these admirable speeches they contain all that the truest friend the most tender son and the most generous hero could think or express in this delicate and affecting circumstance he shows his excess of love to his mother by wishing he had never been born or known to the world rather than she should have endured so many sufferings on his account he shows no less love for his friend in resolving to revenge his death upon hector though his own would immediately follow we see him here ready to meet his fate for the sake of his friend and in the odysseis we find him wishing to live again only to maintain his fathers honor against his enemies thus he values neither life nor death but as they conduce to the good of his friend and parents or the increase of his glory  after having calmly considered the present state of his life he deliberately embraces his approaching fate and comforts himself under it by a reflection on those great men whom neither their illustrious actions nor their affinity to heaven could save from the general doom a thought very natural to him whose business it was in peace to sing their praises and in war to imitate their actions achilles like a man passionate of glory takes none but the finest models he thinks of hercules who was the son of jupiter and who had filled the universe with the noise of his immortal actions these are the sentiments of a real hero eustathius  xi verse     let me  but oh ye gracious powers etc achilless words are these now since i am never to return home and since i lie here an useless person losing my best friend and exposing the greeks to so many dangers by my own folly i who am superior to them all in battle  here he breaks off and says  may contention perish everlastingly etc achilles leaves the sentence thus suspended either because in his heat he had forgot what he was speaking of or because he did not know how to end it for he should have said  since i have done all this i will perish to revenge him nothing can be finer than this sudden execration against discord and revenge which breaks from the hero in the deep sense of the miseries those passions had occasioned him  achilles could not be ignorant that he was superior to others in battle and it was therefore no fault in him to say so but he is so ingenuous as to give himself no farther commendation than what he undoubtedly merited confessing at the same time that many exceeded him in speaking unless one may take this as said in contempt of oratory not unlike that of virgil orabunt caussas melius  etc   xii verse     let me this instant i shall have time enough for inglorious rest when i am in the grave but now i must act like a living hero i shall indeed lie down in death but at the same time rise higher in glory eustathius  xiii verse     that all shall know achilles there is a great stress on  and  they shall soon find that their victories have been owing to the long absence of a hero and that hero achilles upon which the ancients have observed that since achilless anger there past in reality but a few days to which it may be replied that so short a time as this might well seem long to achilles who thought all unactive hours tedious and insupportable and if the poet himself had said that achilles was long absent he had not said it because a great many days had past but because so great a variety of incidents had happened in that time eustathius  xiv verse      this promise of thetis to present her son with a new suit of armor was the most artful method of hindering him from putting immediately in practice his resolutions of fighting which according to his violent manners he must have done therefore the interposition of thetis here was absolutely necessary it was dignus vindice nodus  xv verse     who sends thee goddess etc achilles is amazed that a moment after the goddess his mother had forbid him fighting he should receive a contrary order from the gods therefore he asks what god sent her dacier  xvi verse     arms i have none it is here objected against homer that since patroclus took achilles armor achilles could not want arms while he had those of patroclus but besides that patroclus might have given his armor to his squire automedon the better to deceive the trojans by making them take automedon for patroclus as they took patroclus for achilles this objection may be very solidly answered by saying that homer has prevented it since he made achilless armor fit patrocluss body not without a miracle which the gods wrought in his favor furthermore it does not follow that because the armor of a large man fits one that is smaller the armor of a little man should fit one that is larger eustathius  xvii verse   0 except the mighty telamonian shield achilles seems not to have been of so large a stature as ajax yet his shield it is likely might be fit enough for him because his great strength was sufficient to wield it this passage i think might have been made use of by the defenders of the shield of achilles against the critics to show that homer intended the buckler of his hero for a very large one and one would think he put it into this place just a little before the description of that shield on purpose to obviate that objection  xviii verse     but as thou art unarmd a hero so violent and so outrageous as achilles and who had just lost the man he loved best in the world is not likely to refuse showing himself to the enemy for the single reason of having no armor grief and despair in a great soul are not so prudent and reserved but then on the other side he is not to throw himself in the midst of so many enemies armed and flushed with victory homer gets out of this nice circumstance with great dexterity and gives to achilless character every thing he ought to give it without offending either against reason or probability he judiciously feigns that juno sent this order to achilles for juno is the goddess of royalty who has the care of princes and kings and who inspires them with the sense of what they owe to their dignity and character dacier  xix verse     let but achilles over yon trench appear there cannot be a greater instance how constantly homer carried his whole design in his head as well as with what admirable art he raises one great idea upon another to the highest sublime than this passage of achilless appearance to the army and the preparations by which we are led to it in the thirteenth book when the trojans have the victory they check their pursuit of it in the mere thought that achilles sees them in the sixteenth they are put into the utmost consternation at the sight of his armor and chariot in the seventeenth menelaus and ajax are in despair on the consideration that achilles cannot succor them for want of armor in the present book beyond all expectation he does but show him unarmed and the very sight of him gives the victory to greece how extremely noble is this gradation  xx verse     the smokes highcurling for fires in the day appear nothing but smoke and in the night flames are visible because of the darkness and thus it is said in exodus that god led his people in the day with a pillar of smoke and in the night with a pillar of fire per diem in columna nubis and per noctem in columna ignis dacier  xxi verse     seen from some island homer makes choice of a town placed in an island because such a place being besieged has no other means of making its distress known than by signals of fire whereas a town upon the continent has other means to make known to its neighbors the necessity it is in dacier  xxii verse     as the loud trumpets etc i have already observed that when the poet speaks as from himself he may be allowed to take his comparisons from things which were not known before his time here he borrows a comparison from the trumpet as he has elsewhere done from saddlehorses though neither one nor the other were used in greece at the time of the trojan war virgil was less exact in this respect for he describes the trumpet as used in the sacking of troy exoritur clamorque virum clangorque tubarum and celebrates misenus as the trumpeter of aeneas but as virgil wrote at a time more remote from those heroic ages perhaps this liberty may be excused but a poet had better confine himself to customs and manners like a painter and it is equally a fault in either of them to ascribe to times and nations any thing with which they were unacquainted  one may add an oservation to this note of m dacier that the trumpets not being in use at that time makes very much for homers purpose in this place the terror raised by the voice of his hero is much the more strongly imagd by a sound that was unusual and capable of striking more from its very novelty  xxiii verse     if but the morrows sun etc polydamas says in the original if achilles comes to morrow in his armor there seems to lie an objection against this passage for polydamas knew that achilless armor was won by hector he must also know that no other mans armor would fit him how then could he know that new arms were made for him that very night those who are resolved to defend homer may answer it was by his skill in prophecy but to me this seems to be a slip of our authors memory and one of those little nods which horace speaks of  xxiv verse     the speech of hector hector in this severe answer to polydamas takes up several of his words and turns them another way  polydamas had said  to morrow by break of day let us put on our arms and defend the castles and citywalls to which hector replies  to morrow by break of day let us put on our arms not to defend our selves at home but to fight the greeks before their own ships  polydamas speaking of achilles had said  etc if he comes after we are within the walls of our city twill be the worse for him for he may drive round the city long enough before he can hurt us to which hector answers if achilles should come  etc twill be the worse for him as you say because i will fight him  says hector in reply to polydamass saying  but hector is not so far gone in passion or pride as to forget himself and accordingly in the next lines he modestly puts it in doubt which of them shall conquer eustathius  xxv verse   0 sunk were her treasures and her stores decayed as well by reason of the convoys which were necessarily to be sent for with ready money as by reason of the great allowances which were to be given to the auxiliary troops who came from phrygia and maeonia hectors meaning is that since all the riches of troy are exhausted it is no longer necessary to spare themselves or shut themselves up within their walls dacier  xxvi verse     if there be one etc this noble and generous proposal is worthy of hector and at the same time very artful to ingratiate himself with the soldiers eustathius farther observes that it is said with an eye to polydamas as accusing him of being rich and of not opening the advice he had given for any other end than to preserve his great wealth for riches commonly make men cowards and the desire of saving them has often occasioned men to give advice very contrary to the public welfare  xxvii verse     in what vain promise the lamentation of achilles over the body of patroclus is exquisitely touched it is sorrow in the extreme but the sorrow of achilles it is nobly ushered in by that simile of the grief of the lion an idea which is fully answered in the savage and bloody conclusion of this speech one would think by the beginning of it that achilles did not know his fate till after his departure from opuntium and yet how does that agree with what is said of his choice of the short and active life rather than the long and inglorious one or did not he flatter himself sometimes that his fate might be changed this may be conjectured from several other passages and is indeed the most natural solution  xxviii verse  0  cleanse the pale corse etc this custom of washing the dead is continued amongst the greeks to this day and it is a pious duty performed by the dearest friend or relation to see it washed and anointed with a perfume after which they cover it with linen exactly in the manner here related  xxix verse     jupiter and juno virgil has coppyd the speech of juno to jupiter ast ego quae divum incedo regina etc but it is exceeding remarkable that homer should upon every occasion make marriage and discord inseparable it is an unalterable rule with him to introduce the husband and wife in a quarrel  xxx verse   0 full twenty tripods tripods were vessels supported on three feet with handles on the sides they were of several kinds and for several uses some were consecrated to sacrifices some used as tables some as seats others hung up as ornaments on walls of houses or temples these of vulcan have an addition of wheels which was not usual which intimates them to be made with clockwork mons dacier has commented very well on this passage if vulcan says he had made ordinary tripods they had not answered the greatness power and skill of a god it was therefore necessary that his work should be above that of men to effect this the tripods were animated and in this homer does not deviate from the probability for every one is fully persuaded that a god can do things more difficult than these and that all matter will obey him what has not been said of the statues of daedalus plato writes that they walked alone and if they had not taken care to tie them they would have got loose and run from their master if a writer in prose can speak hyperbollically of a man may not homer do it much more of a god nay this circumstance with which homer has embellished his poem would have had nothing too surprising though these tripods had been made by a man for what may not be done in clockwork by an exact management of springs this criticism is then ill grounded and homer does not deserve the ridicule they would cast on him  the same author applies to this passage of homer that rule of aristotle poetic chap    which deserves to be alleged at large on this occasion  when a poet is accused of saying any thing that is impossible we must examine that impossibility either with respect to poetry with respect to that which is best or with respect to common fame first with regard to poetry the probable impossible ought to be preferred to the possible which bath no verisimilitude and which would not be believed and it is thus that zeuxis painted his pieces secondly with respect to that which is best we see that a thing is most excellent and more wonderful this way and that the originals ought always to surpass lastly in respect to fame it is proved that the poet need only follow common opinion all that appears absurd may be also justified by one of these three ways or else by the maxim we have already laid down that it is probable that a great many things may happen against probability  a late critic has taken notice of the conformity of this passage of homer with that in the first chapter of ezekiel the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels when those went these went and when those stood these stood and when those were listed up the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels  xxxi verse   0 a footstool at her feet it is at this day the usual honor paid amongst the greeks to a visiter of supeperior quality to set them higher than the rest of the company and put a footstool under their feet see note    on book    this with innumerable other customs are still preserved in the eastern nations  xxxii verse   0 vulcan draw near it is thetis asks your aid the story the ancients tell of platos application of this verse is worth observing that great philosopher had in his youth a strong inclination to poetry and not being satisfied to compose little pieces of gallantry and amor he tried his forces in tragedy and epic poetry but the success was not answerable to his hopes he compared his performance with that of homer and was very sensible of the difference he therefore abandoned a sort of writing wherein at best he could only be the second and turned his views to an other wherein he despaired not to become the first his anger transported him so far as to cast all his verses into the fire but while he was burning them he could not help citing a verse of the very poet who had caused his chagrin it was the present line which homer has put into the mouth of charis when thetis demands arms for achilles  plato only inserted his own name instead of that of thetis vulcan draw near it is plato asks your aid if we credit the ancients it was the coffeehouse his own poetry gave him that raised in him all the indignation he afterward expressed against the art itself in which say they he behaved like those lovers who speak ill of the beauties whom they cannot prevail upon fraguier parall de hom and de platon  xxxiii verse     thetis replied the god our powers may claim etc vulcan throws by his work to perform thetiss request who had laid former obligations upon him the poet in this example giving us an excellent precept that gratitude should take place of all other concerns  the motives which should engage a god in a new travel in the nightime upon a suit of armor for a mortal ought to be strong and therefore artfully enough put upon the foot of gratitude besides they afford at the same time a noble occasion for homer to retail his theology which he is always very fond of  the allegory of vulcan or fire according to heraclides is this his father is jupiter or the ether his mother juno or the air from whence he fell to us whether by lightning or otherwise he is said to be lame that is to want support because he cannot subsist without the continual subsistence of fuel the aetherial fire homer calls sol or jupiter the inferior vulcan the one wants nothing of perfection the other is subject to decay and is restored by accession of materials vulcan is said to fall from heaven because at first when the opportunity of obtaining fire was not so frequent men prepared instruments of brass by which they collected the beams of the sun or else they gained it from accidental lightning that set fire to some combustible matter vulcan had perished when he fell from heaven unless thetis and eurynome had received him that is unless he had been preserved by falling into some convenient receptacle or subterranean place and so was afterward distributed for the common necessities of mankind to understand these strange explications it must be known that thetis is derived from  to lay up and eurynome from  and  a wide distribution they are called daughters of the ocean because the vapors and exhalations of the sea forming themselves into clouds find nourishment for lightnings  xxxiv verse     two semale forms that moved and breathed in animated gold it is very probable that homer took the idea of these from the statues of daedalus which might be extant in his time the ancients tell us they were made to imitate life in rolling their eyes and in all other motions from whence indeed it should seem that the excellency of daedalus consisted in what we call clockwork or the management of moving figures by springs rather than in sculpture or imagery and accordingly the fable of his fitting wings to himself and his son is formed entirely upon the foundation of the former  xxxv verse     robbed of the prize etc thetis to compass her design recounts every thing to the advantage of her son she therefore suppresses the episode of the embassy the prayers that had been made use of to move him and all that the greeks had suffered after the return of the ambassadors and artfully puts together two very distant things as if they had followed each other in the same moment he declined says she to succor the greeks but he sent patroclus now between his refusing to help the greeks and his sending patroclus terrible things had fallen out but she suppresses them for fear of offending vulcan with the recital of achilless inflexible obduracy and thereby create in that god an aversion to her son eustathius  xxxvi verse     then slain by phoebus hector had the name it is a passage worth taking notice of that brutus is said to have consulted the sorts homericae and to have drawn one of these lines wherein the death of patroclus is ascribed to apollo after which unthinkingly he gave the name of that god for the word of battle this is remarked as an unfortunate omen by some of the ancients though i forget where i met with it  xxxvii verse     the father of the fires etc the ancients says eustathius have largely celebrated the philosophical mysteries which they imagined to be shadowed under these descriptions especially damo supposed the daughter of pythagoras whose explication is as follows thetis who receives the arms means the apt order and disposition of all things in the creation by the fire and the wind raised by the bellows are meant air and fire the most active of all the elements the emanations of the fire are those golden maids that waited on vulcan the circular shield is the world being of a sphaerical figure the gold the brass the silver and the tin are the elements gold is fire the firm brass is earth the silver is air and the soft tin water and thus far say they homer speaks a little obscurely but afterward he names em expressly  to which for the fourth element you must add vulcan who makes the shield the extreme circle that run round the shield which he calls splendid and threefold is the zodiac threefold for its breadth within which all the planets move splendid because the sun passes always through the midst of it the silver handle by which the shield is fastened at both extremities is the axis of the world imagined to pass through it and upon which it turns the five folds are those parallel circles that divide the world the polar the tropicks and the equator  heraclides ponticus thus pursues the allegory homer says he makes the working of his shield that is the world to be begun by night as indeed all matter lay undistinguished in an original and universal night which is called chaos by the poets  to bring the matter of the shield to separation and form vulcan presides over the work or as we may say an essential warmth all things says heraclitus being made by the operation of fire  and because the architect is at this time to give a form and ornament to the world he is making it is not rashly that he is said to be married to one of the graces on the broad shield the makers hand engraves the earth and seas beneath the pole above the sun unwearied and the circled moon thus in the beginning of the world he first lays the earth as the foundation of a building whose vacancies are filled up with the flowings of the sea then he spreads out the sky for a kind of divine roof over it and lights the elements now separated from their former confusion with the sun the moon and all those stars that crown the skies with fire   where by the word crown which gives the idea of roundness he again hints at the figure of the world and though he could not particularly name the stars like aratus who professed to write upon them yet he has not omitted to mention the principal from hence he passes to represent two allegorical cities one of peace the other of war empedocles seems to have taken from homer his assertion that all things had their original from strife and friendship  all these refinements not to call em absolute whimsies i leave just as i found em to the readers judgment or mercy  xxxviii verse     nor bends his blazing forehead to the main the critics have made use of this passage to prove that homer was ignorant of astronomy since he believed that the bear was the only constellation which never bathed itself in the ocean that is to say that did not set and was always visible for say they this is common to other constellations of the artick circle as the lesser bear the dragon the greatest part of cepheus etc to salve homer aristotle answers that he calls it the only one to show that it is the only one of those constellations he had spoken of or that he has put the only for the principal or the most known strabo justifies this after another manner in the beginning of his first book under the name of the bear and the chariot homer comprehends all the artick circle for there being several other stars in that circle which never set he could not say that the bear was the only one which did not bath itself in the ocean wherefore those are deceived who accuse the poet of ignorance as if he knew one bear only when there are two for the lesser was not found out in his time the phoenicians were the first who observed it and made use of it in their navigation and the figure of that sign passed from them to the greeks the same thing happened in regard to the constellation of berenices hair and that of canopus which received those names very lately and as aratus says well there are several other stars which have no names crates was then in the wrong to endeavor to correct this passage in putting  for  for he tries to avoid that which there is no occasion to avoid heraclitus did better who put the bear for the artick circle as homer has done the bear says he is the limit of the rising and setting of the stars now it is the artic circle and not the bear which is that limit it is therefore evident that by the word bear which he calls the wagon and which he says observes orion he understands the artick circle that by the ocean he means the horizon where the stars rise and set and by those words which turns in the same place and does not bath itself in the ocean he shows that the artick circle is the most northern part of the horizon etc dacier on arist  mons terasson combats this passage with great warmth but it will be a sufficient vindication of our author to say that some other constellations which are likewise perpetually above the horizon in the latitude where homer writ were not at that time discovered and that whether homer knew that the bears not setting was occasioned by the latitude and that in a smaller latitude it would set is of no consequence for if he had known it it was still more poetical not to take notice of it  xxxix verse     two cities etc in one of these cities are represented all the advantages of peace and it was impossible to have chosen two better emblems of peace than marriages and justice it is said this city was athens for marriages were first instituted there by cecrops and judgment upon murder was first founded there the ancient state of attica seems represented in the neighboring fields where the ploughers and reapers are at work and a king is overlooking them for triptolemus who reigned there was the first who sowed corn this was the imagination of agallias cercyreus as we find him cited by eustathius  xl verse     the fine discharged murder was not always punished with death or so much as banishment but when some fine was paid the criminal was suffered to remain in the city so iliad        if a brother bleed on just atonement we remit the deed a sire the slaughter of his son forgives the price of blood discharged the murderer lives   xli verse   0 the prize of him who best adjudgd the right eustathius informs us that it was anciently the custom to have a reward given to that judge who pronounced the best sentence m dacier opposes this authority and will have it that this reward was given to the person who upon the decision of the suit appeared to have the justest cause the difference between these two customs in the reason of the thing is very great for the one must have been an encouragement to justice the other a provocation to dissension it were to be wanting in a due reverence to the wisdom of the ancients and of homer in particular not to choose the former sense and i have the honor to be confirmed in this opinion by the ablest judge as well as the best practiser of equity my lord harcourt at whose seat i translated this book  xlii verse     another part a prospect different far etc the same agallias cited above would have this city in war to be meant of eleusina but upon very slight reasons what is wonderful is that all the accidents and events of war are set before our eyes in this short compass the several scenes are excellently disposed to represent the whole affair here is in the space of thirty lines a siege a sally an ambush the surprise of a convoy and a battle with scarce a single circumstance proper to any of these omitted  xliii verse     a field deepfurrowd etc here begin the descriptions of rural life in which homer appears as great a master as in the great and terrible parts of poetry one would think he did this on purpose to rival his contemporary hesiod on those very subjects to which his genius was particularly bent upon this occasion i must take notice of that greek poem which is commonly ascribed to hesiod under the title of  some of the ancients mention such a work as hesiods but that amounts to no proof that this is the same which indeed is not an express poem upon the shield of hercules but fragment of the story of that hero what regards the shield is a manifest copy from this of achilles and consequently it is not of hesiod for if he was not more ancient he was at least contemporary with homer and neither of them could be supposed to borrow so shamelesly from the other not only the plan of entire descriptions as those of the marriage the harvest the vineyard the ocean round the margin etc but also whole verses together those of the parca in the battle are repeated word for word      and indeed half the poem is but a sort of cento composed out of homers verses the reader needs only cast an eye on these two descriptions to see the vast difference of the original and the copy and i dare say he will readily agree with the sentiment of monsieur dacier in applying to them that famous verse of sannazarius illum hominem dices hunc posuisse deum   xliv verse id i ought not to forget the many apparent allusions to the descriptions on this shield which are to be found in those pictures of peace and war the city and country in the eleventh book of milton who was doubtless fond of any occasion to show how much he was charmed with the beauty of all these lively images he makes his angel paint those objects which he shows to adam in the colors and almost the very strokes of homer such is that passage of the harvestfield his eye he opened and beheld a field part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves newreapd the other part sheepwalks and folds in midst an altar as the landmark stood rustic of grassy sord etc that of the marriages they light the nuptial torch and bid invoke hymen then first to marriage rites invoked with feast and music all the tents resound but more particularly the following lines are in a manner a translation of our author one way a band select from forage drives a herd of beeves fair oxen and fair kine from a fat meadowground or fleecy flock ewes and their bleating lambs across the plain their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly but call in aid which makes a bloody fray with cruel tournament the squadrons join where cattle pasturd late now scattered lies with carcasses and arms thensanguind field deserted  others to a city strong lay siege encamped by battery scale and mine assaulting others from the wall defend with dart and javelin stones and sulfurous fire on each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds in other part the sceptered heralds call to council in the city gates anon greyheaded men and grave with warriors mixed assemble and harangues are heard    xlv verse     the rustic monarch of the field dacier takes this to be a piece of ground given to a hero in reward of his services it was in no respect unworthy such a person in those days to see his harvest got in and to overlook his reapers it is very conformable to the manners of the ancient patriarchs such as they are described to us in the holy scriptures  xlvi verle     the fate of linus there are two interpretations of this verse in the original that which i have chosen is confirmed by the testimony of herodotus lib   and pausanias boeoticis linus was the most ancient name in poetry the first upon record who invented verse and measure among the grecians he past for the son of apollo or mercury and was praeceptor to hercules thamyris and orpheus there was a solemn custom among the greeks of bewailing annually the death of their first poet pausanias informs us that before the yearly sacrifice to the muses on mount helicon the obsequies of linus were performed who had a statue and altar erected to him in that place homer alludes to that custom in this passage and was doubtless fond of paying this respect to the old father of poetry virgil has done the same in that fine celebration of him eclog   tum canit errantem permessi ad flumina gallum utque viro phoebi chorus assurrexerit omnis ut linus haec illi divino carmine pastor floribus atque apio crines ornatus amaro dixerit  etc and again in the fourth eclog non me carminibus vincet nec thracius orpheus nec linus huic matter quamvis atque huic pater adsit orpheo calliopea lino formosus apollo   xlvii verse     a figured dance there were two sorts of dances the pyrrhick and the common dance homer has joined both in this description we see the pyrrhick or military is performed by the youths who have swords on the other by the virgins crowned with garlands  here the ancient scholiasts say that whereas before it was the custom for men and women to dance separately the contrary practice was afterward brought in by seven youths and as many virgins who were saved by theseus from the labyrinth and that this dance was taught them by daedalus to which homer here alludes see dion halic hist l   c     it is worth observing that the grecian dance is still performed in this manner in the oriental nations the youths and maids dance in a ring beginning slowly by degrees the music plays a quicker time till at last they dance with the utmost swiftness and toward the conclusion they sing as it is said here in a general chorus  observations on the shield of achilles the poet intending to show in its full luster his genius for description makes choice of this interval from action and the leisure of the night to display that talent at large in the famous buckler of achilles his intention was no less than to draw the picture of the whole world in the compass of this shield we first see the universe in general the heavens are spread the stars are hung up the earth is stretched forth the seas are poured round we next see the world in a nearer and more particular view the cities delightful in peace or formidable in war the labors of the country and the fruit of those labors in the harvests and the vintages the pastoral life in its pleasures and its dangers in a word all the occupations all the ambitions and all the diversions of mankind this noble and comprehensive design he has executed in a manner that challenged the admiration of all the ancients and how right an idea they had of this grand design may be judged from that verse of ovid met    where he calls it  clypeus vasti coelatus imagine mundi it is indeed astonishing how after this the arrogance of some moderns could unfortunately choose the noblest part of the noblest poet for the object of their blind criticisms  i design to give the reader the sum of what has been said on this subject first a reply to the loose and scattered objections of the critics by m dacier then the regular plan and distribution of the shield by mons boivin and lastly i shall attempt what has not yet been done to consider it as a work of painting and prove it in all respects conformable to the most just ideas and established rules of that art  i it is the fate says m dacier of these arms of achilles to be still the occasion of quarrels and disputes julius scaliger was the first who appeared against this part and was followed by a whole herd these object in the first place that it is impossible to represent the movement of the figures and in condemning the manner they take the liberty to condemn also the subject which they say is trivial and not well understood it is certain that homer speaks of the figures on this buckler as if they were alive and some of the ancients taking his expressions to the strictness of the letter did really believe that they had all sorts of motion eustathius showed the absurdity of that sentiment by a passage of homer himself that poet says he to show that his figures are not animated as some have pretended by an excessive affection for the prodigious took care to say that they moved and fought as if they were living men the ancients certainly founded this ridiculous opinion on a rule of aristotle for they thought the poet could not make his description more admirable and mavelous than in making his figures animated since as aristotle says the original should always excel the copy that shield is the work of a god it is the original of which the engraving and painting of men is but an imperfect copy and there is nothing impossible to the gods but they did not perceive that by this homer would have fallen into an extravagant admirable which would not have been probable therefore it is without any necessity eustathius adds that it is possible all those figures did not stick close to the shield but that they were detached from it and moved by springs in such a manner that they appeared to have motion as aeschylus has feigned something like it in his seven captains against thebes but without having recourse to that c0onjecture we can show that there is nothing more simple and natural than the description of that shield and there is not one word which homer might not have said of it if it had been the work of a man for there is a great deal of difference between the work itself and the description of it  let us examine the particulars for which they blame homer they say he describes two towns on his shield which speak different languages it is the latin translation and not homer that says so the word  is a common epithet of men and which signifies only that they have an articulate voice these towns could not speak different languages since as the ancients have remarked they were athens and eleusina both which spoke the same language but though that epithet should signify which spoke different languages there would be nothing very surprising for virgil said what homer it seems must not victae longo ordine gentes quam variae linguis  aen   if a painter should put into a picture one town of france and another of flanders might not one say they were two towns which spoke different languages  homer they tell us says in another place that we hear the harangues of two pleaders this is an unfair exaggeration he only says two men pleaded that is were represented pleading was not the same said by pliny of nicomachus that he had painted two greeks which spoke one after another can we express ourselves otherwise of these two arts which though they are mute yet have a language or in explaining a painting of raphael or poussin can we prevent animating the figures in making them speak conformably to the design of the painter but how could the engraver represent those young shepherds and virgins that dance first in a ring and then in setts or those troops which were in ambuscade this would be difficult indeed if the workman had not the liberty to make his persons appear in different circumstances all the objections against the young man who sings at the same time that he plays on the harp the bull that roars whilst he is devoured by a lion and against the musical consorts are childish for we can never speak of painting if we banish those expressions pliny says of apelles that he painted clytus on horseback going to battle and demanding his helmet of his squire of aristides that he drew a beggar whom we could almost understand pene cum voce of ctesilochus that he had painted jupiter bringing forth bacchus and crying out like a woman and muliebriter ingemiscentem and of nicearchus that he had drawn a piece in which hercules was seen very melancholy for having been a fool herculem tristem insaniae poenitentia no one sure will condemn those ways of expression which are so common the same author has said much more of apelles he tells us he painted those things which could not be painted as thunder pinxit quae pingi non possunt and of timanthus that in all his works there was something more understood than was seen and though there was all the art imaginable yet there was still more ingenuity than art atque in omnibus ejus operibus intelligitur plus semper quam pingitur and cum ars summa sit ingenium tamen ultra artem est if we take the pains to compare these expressions with those of homer we shall find him altogether excusable in his manner of describing the buckler  we come now to the matter if this shield says a modern critic had been made in a wiser age it would have been more correct and less charged with objects there are two things which cause the censurers to fall into this false criticism the first is that they think the shield was no broader than the brims of a hat whereas it was large enough to cover a whole man the other is that they did not know the design of the poet and imagined this description was only the whimsy of an irregular wit who did it by chance and not following nature for they never so much as entered into the intention of the poet nor knew the shield was designed as a representation of the universe  it is happy that virgil has made a buckler for aeneas as well as homer for achilles the latin poet who imitated the greek one always took care to accommodate those things which time had changed so as to render them agreeable to the palate of his readers yet he has not only charged his shield with a great deal more work since he paints all the actions of the romans from ascanius to augustus but has not avoided any of those manners of expression which offend the critics we see there the wolf of romulus and remus who gives them her dugs one after another mulcere alternos and corpora fingere lingua the rape of the sabines and the war which followed it subitoque novum consurgere bellum metius torn by four horses and tullus who draws his entrails through the forest porsenna commanding the romans to receive tarquin and besieging rome the geese flying to the porches of the capitol and giving notice by their cries of the attack of the gauls atque hic auratis volitans argenteus anser porticibus gallos in limine adesse canebat we see the salian dance hell and the pains of the damned and farther off the place of the blessed where cato presides we see the famous battle of actium where we may distinguish the captains agrippa with the gods and the winds favorable and anthony leading on all the forces of the east egypt and the bactrians the fight begins the sea is red with blood cleopatra gives the signal for a retreat and calls her troops with a systrum patrio vocat agmina systro the gods or rather the monsters of egypt fight against neptune venus minerva mars and apollo we see anthonys fleet beaten and the nile sorrowfully opening his bosom to receive the conquered cleopatra looks pale and almost dead at the thought of that death she had already determined nay we see the very wind iapis which hastens her flight we see the three triumphs of augustus that prince consecrates three hundred temples the altars are filled with ladies offering up sacrifices augustus sitting at the entrance of apollos temple receives presents and hangs them on the pillars of the temple while all the conquered nations pass by who speak different languages and are differently equipped and armed  incedunt victae longo ordine gentes quam variae linguis habitu tum vestis and armis nothing can better justify homer or show the wisdom and judgment of virgil he was charmed with achilless shield and therefore would give the same ornament to his poem but as homer had painted the universe he was sensible that nothing remained for him to do he had no other way to take than that of prophecy and show what the descendant of his hero should perform and he was not afraid to go beyond homer because there is nothing improbable in the hands of a god if the critics say that this is justifying one fault by another i desire they would agree among themselves for scaliger who was the first that condemned homers shield admires virgils but suppose they should agree twould be foolish to endeavor to persuade us that what homer and virgil have done by the approbation of all ages is not good and to make us think that their particular taste should prevail over that of all other men nothing is more ridiculous than to trouble ones self to answer men who show so little reason in their criticisms that we can do them no greater favor than to ascribe it to their ignorance  thus far the objections are answered by mons dacier since when some others have been started as that the objects represented on the buckler have no reference to the poem no agreement with thetis who procured it vuloan who made it or achilles for whom it was made  to this it is replied that the representation of the sea was agreeable enough to thetis that the spheres and celestial fires were so to vulcan though the truth is any piece of workmanship was equally fit to come from the hands of this god and that the images of a town besieged a battle and an ambuscade were objects sufficiently proper for achilles but after all where was the necessity that they should be so they had at least been as fit for one hero as for another and aeneas as virgil tells us knew not what to make of the figures on his shield rerumque ignarus imagine gaudet   ii but still the main objection and that in which the vanity of the moderns has triumphed the most is that the shield is crowded with such a multiplicity of figures as could not possibly be represented in the compass of it the late dissertation of mons boivin has put an end to this cavil and the reader will have the pleasure to be convinced of it by ocular demonstration in the print annexed  this author supposes the buckler to have been perfectly round he divides the unequal surface into four concentrick circles  the circle next the center contains the globe of the earth and the sea in miniature he gives this circle the dimension of three inches  the second circle is allotted for the heavens and the stars he allows the space of ten inches between this and the former circle  the third shall be eight inches distant from the second the space between these two circles shall be divided into twelve compartiments each of which makes a picture of ten or eleven inches deep  the fourth circle makes the margin of the buckler and the interval between this and the former being of three inches is sufficient to represent the waves and currents of the ocean  all these together make but four foot in the whole in diameter the print of these circles and divisions will serve to prove that the figures will neither be crowded nor confused if disposed in the proper place and order  as to the size and figure of the shield it is evident from the poets that in the time of the trojan war there were shields of an extraordinary magnitude the buckler of ajax is often compared by homer to a tower and in the sixth iliad that of hector is described to cover him from the shoulders to the ankles         in the second verse of the description of this buckler of achilles it is said that vulcan cast round it a radiant circle       which proves the figure to have been round but if it be alleged that  as well signifies oval as circular it may be answered that the circular figure better agrees to the spheres represented in the center and to the course of the ocean at the circumference  we may very well allow four foot diameter to this buckler as one may suppose a larger size would have been too unwieldy so a less would not have been sufficient to cover the breast and arm of a man of a stature so large as achilles  in allowing four foot diameter to the whole each of the twelve compartiments may be of ten or eleven inches in depth which will be enough to contain without any confusion all the objects which homer mentions indeed in this print each compartiment being but of one inch the principal figures only are represented but the reader may easily imagine the advantage of nine or ten inches more however if the critics are not yet satisfied there is room enough it is but taking in the literal sense the words  with which homer begins his description and the buckler may be supposed engraven on both sides which supposition will double the size of each piece the one side may serve for the general description of heaven and earth and the other for all the particulars  iii it having been now shown that the shield of homer is blameless as to its design and disposition and that the subject so extensive as it is may be contracted within the due limits not being one vast unproportiond heap of figures but divided into twelve regular compartiments what remains is to consider this piece as a complete idea of painting and a sketch for what one may call an universal picture this is certainly the light in which it is chiefly to be admired and in which alone the critics have neglected to place it  there is reason to believe that homer did in this as he has done in other arts even in mechanics that is comprehend whatever was known of it in his time if not as is highly probable from thence extend his ideas yet farther and give a more enlarged notion of it accordingly it is very observable that there is scarce a species or branch of this art which is not here to be found whether history battelpainting landscape architecture fruits flowers animals etc  i think it possible that painting was arrived to a greater degree of perfection even at that early period than is generally supposed by those who have written upon it pliny expressly says that it was not known in the time of the trojan war the same author and others represent it in a very imperfect state in greece in or near the days of homer they tell us of one painter that he was the first who begun to shadow and of another that he filled his outlines only with a single color and that laid on every where alike but we may have a higher notion of the art from those descriptions of statues carvings tapestrys sculptures upon armor and ornaments of all kinds which every where occur in our author as well as from what he says of their beauty the relievo and their emulation of life itself if we consider how much it is his constant practice to confine himself to the custom of the times whereof he writ it will be hard to doubt but that painting and sculpture must have been then in great practice and repute  the shield is not only described as a piece of sculpture but of painting the outlines may be supposed engraved and the rest enameled or inlaid with variouscolourd metals the variety of colors is plainly distinguished by homer where he speaks of the blackness of the newopend earth of the several colors of the grapes and vines and in other places the different metals that vulcan is feigned to cast into the furnace were sufficient to afford all the necessary colors but if to those which are natural to the metals we add also those which they are capable of receiving from the operation of fire we shall find that vulcan had as great a variety of colors to make use of as any modern painter that enamelling or fixing colors by fire was practiced very anciently may be conjectured from what diodorus reports of one of the walls of babylon built by semiramis that the bricks of it were painted before they were burned so as to represent all sorts of animals lib   chap   now it is but natural to infer that men had made use of ordinary colors for the representation of objects before they learnt to represent them by such as are given by the operation of fire one being much more easy and obvious than the other and that sort of painting by means of fire being but an imitation of the painting with a pencil and colors the same inference will be farther enforced from the works of tapestry which the women of those times interweaved with many colors as appears from the description of that veil which hecuba offers to minerva in the sixth iliad and from a passage in the twenty second where andromache is represented working flowers in a piece of this kind they must certainly have known the use of the colors themselves for painting before they could think of dying threads with those colors and weaving those threads close to one another in order only to a more laborious imitation of a thing so much more easily performed by a pencil this observation i owe to the abbe fraguier  it may indeed be thought that a genius so vast and comprehensive as that of homer might carry his views beyond the rest of mankind and that in this buckler of achilles he rather designed to give a scheme of what might be performed than a description of what really was so and since he made a god the artist he might excuse himself from a strict confinement to what was known and practiced in the time of the trojan war let this be as it will it is certain that he had whether by learning or by strength of genius though the latter be more glorious for homer a full and exact idea of painting in all its parts that is to say in the invention the composition the expression etc  the invention is shown in finding and introducing in every subject the greatest the most significant and most suitable objects accordingly in every single picture of the shield homer constantly finds out either those objects which are naturally the principal those which most conduce to show the subject or those which set it in the liveliest and most agreeable light these he never fails to dispose in the most advantageous manners situations and oppositions  next we find all his figures differently characterized in their expressions and attitudes according to their several natures the gods for instance are distinguished in air habit and proportion from men in the fourth picture masters from servants in the eighth and so of the rest  nothing is more wonderful than his exact observation of the contrast not only between figure and figure but between subject and subject the city in peace is a contrast to the city in war between the siege in the fourth picture and the battle in the sixth a piece of paisage is introduced and rural scenes follow after the country too is represented in war in the fifth as well as in peace in the seventh eighth and ninth the very animals are shown in these two different states in the tenth and the eleventh where the subjects appear the same he contrastes them some other way thus the first picture of the town in peace having a predominant air of gaiety in the dances and pomps of the marriage the second has a character of earnestness and solicitude in the dispute and pleadings in the pieces of rural life that of the plowing is of a different character from the harvest and that of the harvest from the vintage in each of these there is a contrast of the labor and mirth of the country people in the first some are plowing others taking a cup of good liquor in the next we see the reapers working in one part and the banquet prepared in another in the last the labor of the vineyard is relieved with music and a dance the persons are no less varied old and young men and women there being women in two pictures together namely the eighth and ninth it is remarkable that those in the latter are of a different character from the former they who dress the supper being ordinary women the others who carry baskets in the vineyard young and beautiful virgins and these again are of an inferior character to those in the twelfth piece who are distinguished as people of condition by a more elegant dress there are three dances in the buckler and these too are varied that at the wedding is in a circular figure that of the vineyard in a row that in the last picture a mingled one lastly there is a manifest contrast in the colors nay even in the backgrounds of the several pieces for example that of the plowing is of a dark tinct that of the harvest yellow that of the pasture green and the rest in like manner  that he was not a stranger to aerial perspective appears in his expressly marking the distance of object from object he tells us for instance that the two spies lay a little remote from the other figures and that the oak under which was spread the banquet of the reapers stood apart what he says of the valley sprinkled all over with cottages and flocks appears to be a description of a large country in perspective and indeed a general argument for this may be drawn from the number of figures on the shield which could not be all expressed in their full magnitude and this is therefore a sort of proof that the art of lessening them according to perspective was known at that time  what the critics call the three unities ought in reason as much to be observed in a picture as in a play each should have only one principal action one instant of time and one point of view in this method of examination also the shield of homer will bear the test he has been more exact than the greatest painters who have often deviated from one or other of these rules whereas when we examine the detail of each compartiment it will appear  first that there is but one principal action in each picture and that no supernumerary figures or actions are introduced this will answer all that has been said of the confusion and crowd of figures on the shield by those who never comprehended the plan of it  secondly that no action is represented in one piece which could not happen in the same instant of time this will overthrow the objection against so many different actions appearing in one shield which in this case is much as absurd as to object against so many of raphaels cartons appearing in one gallery  thirdly it will be manifest that there are no objects in any one picture which could not be seen in one point of view hereby the abbe terassons whole criticism will fall to the ground which amounts but to this that the general objects of the heavens stars and sea with the particular prospects of towns fields etc could never be seen all at once homer was incapable of so absurd a thought nor could these heavenly bodies had he intended them for a picture have ever been seen together from one point for the constellations and the full moon for example could never be seen at once with the sun but the celestial bodies were placed on the boss as the ocean at the margin of the shield these were no parts of the painting but the former was only an ornament to the projection in the middle and the latter a frame round about it in the same manner as the divisions projections or angles of a roof are left to be ornamented at the discretion of the painter with foliage architecture grotesque or what he pleases however his judgment will be still more commendable if he contrives to make even these extrinsical parts to bear some allusion to the main design it is this which homer has done in placing a sort of sphere in the middle and the ocean at the border of a work which was expressly intended to represent the universe  i proceed now to the detail of the shield in which the words of homer being first translated an attempt will be made to show with what exact order all that he describes may enter into the composition according to the rules of painting  the shield of achilles divided into its several parts the boss of the shield verse      etc here vulcan represented the earth the heaven the sea the indefatigable course of the sun the moon in her full all the celestial signs that crown olympus the pleiades the hyades the great orion and the bear commonly called the wain the only constellation which never bathing itself in the ocean turns about the pole and observes the course of orion  the sculpture of these resembled somewhat of our terrestrial and celestial globes and took up the center of the shield it is plain by the huddle in which homer expresses this that he did not describe it as a picture for a point of sight  the circumference is divided into twelve compartiments each being a separate picture as follow  first compartiment a town in peace  etc he engraved two cities in one of them were represented nuptials and festivals the spouses from their bridal chambers were conducted through the town by the light of torches every mouth sung the hymeneal song the youths turned rapidly about in a circular dance the flute and the lyre resounded the women every one in the street standing in the porches beheld and admired  in this picture the brides preceded by torchbearers are on the foreground the dance in circles and musicians behind them the street in perspective on either side the women and spectators in the porches etc dispersed through all the architecture  second compartiment an assembly of people  etc there was seen a number of people in the marketplace and two men disputing warmly the occasion was the payment of a fine for a murder which one affirmed before the people he had paid the other denied to have received both demanded that the affair should be determined by the judgment of an arbiter the acclamations of the multitude favored sometimes the one party sometimes the other  here is a fine plan for a masterpiece of expression any judge of painting will see our author has chosen that cause which of all others would give occasion to the greatest variety of expression the father the murderer the witnesses and the different passions of the assembly would afford an ample field for this talent even to raphael himself  third compartiment the senate  etc the heralds ranged the people in order the reverend elders were seated on seats of polished stone in the sacred circle they rose up and declared their judgment each in his turn with the scepter in his hand two talents of gold were laid in the middle of the circle to be given to him who should pronounce the most equitable judgment  the judges are seated in the center of the picture one who is the principal figure standing up as speaking another in an action of rising as in order to speak the ground about em a prospect of the forum filled with auditors and spectators  fourth compartiment a town in war  etc the other city was besieged by two glittering armies they were not agreed whether to sack the town or divide all the booty of it into two equal parts to be shared between them meantime the besieged secretly armed themselves for an ambuscade their wives children and old men were posted to defend the walls the warriors marched from the town with pallas and mars at their head the deities were of gold and had golden armours by the glory of which they were distinguished above the men as well as by their superior stature and more elegant proportions  this subject may be thus disposed the town pretty near the eye across the whole picture with the old men on the walls the chiefs of each army on the foreground their different opinions for putting the town to the sword or sparing it on account of the booty may be expressed by some having their hands on their swords and looking up to the city others stopping them or in an action of persuading against it behind in prospect the townsmen may be seen going out from the back gates with the two deities at their head  homer here gives a clear instance of what the ancients always practiced the distinguishing the gods and goddesses by characters of majesty or beauty somewhat superior to nature we constantly find this in their statues and to this the modern masters owe the grand taste in the perfection of their figures  fifth compartiment an ambuscade  etc being arrived at the river where they designed their ambush the place where the cattle were watered they disposed themselves along the bank covered with their arms two spies lay at a distance from them observing when the oxen and sheep should come to drink they came immediately followed by two shepherds who were playing on their pipes without any apprehension of their danger  this quiet picture is a kind of repose between the last and the following active pieces here is a scene of a river and trees under which lie the soldiers next the eye of the spectator on the farther bank are placed the two spies on one hand and the flocks and shepherds appear coming at a greater distance on the other  sixth compartiment the battle  etc the people of the town rushed upon them carried off the oxen and sheep and killed the shepherds the besiegers sitting before the town heard the outcry and mounting their horses arrived at the bank of the river where they stopped and encountered each other with their spears discord tumult and fate raged in the midst of them there might you see cruel destiny dragging a dead soldier through the battle two others she seized alive one of which was mortally wounded the other not yet hurt the garment on her shoulders was stained with human blood the figures appeared as if they lived moved and fought you would think they really dragged off their dead  the sheep and two shepherds lying dead upon the foreground a battelpiece fills the picture the allegorical figure of the parca or destiny is the principal this had been a noble occasion for such a painter as rubens who has with most happiness and learning imitated the ancients in these fictitious and symbolical persons  seventh compartiment tillage  the next piece represented a large field a deep and fruitful soil which seemed to have been three times plowed the laborers appeared turning their plows on every side as soon as they came to a lands end a man presented them a bowl of wine cheared with this they returned and worked down a new furrow desirous to hasten to the next lands end the field was of gold but looked black behind the plows as if it had really been turned up the surprising effect of the art of vulcan  the plowmen must be represented on the foreground in the action of turning at the end of the furrow the invention of homer is not content with barely putting down the figures but enlivens them prodigiously with some remarkable circumstance the giving a cup of wine to the plowmen must occasion a fine expression in the faces  eighth compartiment the harvest  etc next he represented a field of corn in which the reapers worked with sharp sickles in their hands the corn fell thick along the furrows in equal rows three binders were employed in making up the sheaves the boys attending them gathered up the loose swarths and carried them in their arms to be bound the lord of the field standing in the midst of the heaps with a scepter in his hand rejoices in silence his officers at a distance prepare a feast under the shade of an oak and hold an ox ready to be sacrificed while the women mix the flower of wheat for the reapers supper  the reapers on the foreground with their faces toward the spectators the gatherers behind and the children on the farther ground the master of the field who is the chief figure may be set in the middle of the picture with a strong light upon him in the action of directing and pointing with his scepter the oak with the servants under it the sacrifice etc on a distant ground would altogether make a beautiful grouppe of great variety  ninth compartiment the vintage  etc he then engraved a vineyard laden with its grapes the vineyard was gold but the grapes black and the props of them silver a trench of a dark metal and a palisade of tin encompassed the whole vineyard there was one path in it by which the laborers in the vineyard passed young men and maids carried the fruit in woven baskets in the middle of them a youth played on the lyre and charmed them with his tender voice as he sung to the strings or as he sung the song of linus the rest striking the ground with their feet in exact time followed him in a dance and accompanied his voice with their own  the vintage scarce needs to be painted in any colors but homers the youths and maids toward the eye as coming out of the vineyard the enclosure pales gate etc on the foreground there is something inexpressibly riant in this piece above all the rest  tenth compartiment animals  etc he graved a herd of oxen marching with their heads erected these oxen inlaid with gold and tin seemed to bellow as they quitted their stall and run in haste to the meadows through which a rapid river rolled with resounding streams amongst the rushes four herdsmen of gold attended them followed by nine large dogs two terrible lions seized a bull by the throat who roared as they dragged him along the dogs and the herdsmen ran to his rescue but the lions having torn the bull devoured his entrails and drank his blood the herdsmen came up with their dogs and heartend them in vain they durst not attack the lions but standing at some distance barked at them and shunned them  we have next a fine piece of animals tame and savage but what is remarkable is that these animals are not coldly brought in to be gazed upon the herds dogs and lions are put into action enough to exercise the warmth and spirit of rubens or the great taste of julio romano  the lions may be next the eye one holding the bull by the throat the other tearing out his entrails a herdsman or two heartening the dogs all these on the foreground on the second ground another grouppe of oxen that seem to have been gone before tossing their heads and running other herdsmen and dogs after em and beyond them a prospect of the river  eleventh compartiment sheep  etc the divine artist then engraved a large flock of white sheep feeding along a beautiful valley innumerable folds cottages and enclosed shelters were scattered through the prospect  this is an entire landscape without human figures an image of nature solitary and undisturbed the deepest repose and tranquillity is that which distinguishes it from the others  twelfth compartiment the dance  etc the skilful vulcan then designed the figure and various motions of a dance like that which daedalus of old contrived in gnossus for the fair ariadne there the young men and maidens danced hand in hand the maids were dressed in linen garments the men in rich and shining stuffs the maids had flowery crowns on their heads the men had swords of gold hanging from their sides in belts of silver here they seemed to run in a ring with active feet as swiftly as a wheel runs round when tried by the hand of the potter there they appeared to move in many figures and sometimes to meet sometimes to wind from each other a multitude of spectators stood round delighted with the dance in the middle two nimble tumblers exercised themselves in feats of activity while the song was carried on by the whole circle  this picture includes the greatest number of persons homer himself has groupd them and marked the manner of the composition this piece would excel in the different airs of beauty which might be given to the young men and women and the graceful attitudes in the various manners of dancing on which account the subject might be fit for guido or perhaps could be no where better executed than in our own country  the border of the shield  etc then laslly he represented the rapid course of the great ocean which he made to roll its waves round the extremity of the whole circumference  this as has been said before was only the frame to the whole shield and is therefore but slightly touched upon without any mention of particular objects  i ought not to end this essay without vindicating myself from the vanity of treating of an art which i love so much better than i understand but i have been very careful to consult both the best performers and judges in painting i cannot neglect this occasion of saying how happy i think myself in the favor of the most distinguished masters of that art sir godsrey kneller in particular allows me to tell the world that he entirely agrees with my sentiments on this subject and i cannot help wishing that he who gives this testimony to homer would ennoble so great a design by his own execution of it vulcan never wrought for thetis with more readiness and affection than sir godfrey has done for me and so admirable a picture of the whole universe could not be a more agreeable present than he has obliged me with in the portraits of some of those persons who are to me the dearest objects in it  the nineteenth book of the iliad the argument the reconciliation of achilles and agamemnon thetis brings to her son the armor made by vulcan she preserves the body of his friend from corruption and commands him to assemble the army to declare his resentment at an end agamemnon and achilles are solemnly reconciled the speeches presents and ceremonies on that occasion achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of ulysses the presents are conveyed to the tent of achilles where briseis laments over the body of patroclus the hero obstinately refuses all repast and gives himself up to lamentations for his friend minerva descends to strengthen him by the order of jupiter he arms for the fight his appearance described he addresses himself to his horses and reproaches them with the death of patroclus one of them is miraculously endued with voice and inspired to prophecy his fate but the hero not astonished by that prodigy rushes with fury to the combat  the thirtieth day the scene is on the seashore  the nineteenth book of the iliad soon as aurora heaved her orient head above the waves that blushed with early red with newborn day to gladden mortal sight and gild the courts of heaven with sacred light the immortal arms the goddessmother bears swift to her son her son she finds in tears stretched over patroclus corse while all the rest their sovreigns sorrows in their own expressed a ray divine her heavenly presence shed and thus his hand softtouching thetis said suppress my son this rage of grief and know it was not man but heaven that gave the blow behold what arms by vulcan are bestowed arms worthy thee or fit to grace a god then drops the radiant burden on the ground clang the strong arms and ring the shores around back shrink the myrmidons with dread surprise and from the broad effulgence turn their eyes unmoved the hero kindles at the show and feels with rage divine his bosom glow from his fierce eye balls living flames expire and flash incessant like a stream of fire he turns the radiant gift and feeds his mind on all the immortal artist had designed goddess he cried these glorious arms that shine with matchless art confess the hand divine now to the bloody battle let me bend but ah the relics of my slaughtered friend in those wide wounds through which his spirit fled shall flies and worms obscene pollute the dead that unavailing care be laid aside the azure goddess to her son replied whole years untouched uninjurd shall remain fresh as in life the carcass of the slain but go achilles as affairs require before the grecian peers renounce thine ire then uncontrolled in boundless war engage and heaven with strength supply the mighty rage then in the nostrils of the slain she poured nectareous drops and rich ambrosia showered over all the corse the flies forbid their prey untouched it rests and sacred from decay achilles to the strand obedient went the shores resounded with the voice he sent the heroes heard and all the naval train that tend the ships or guide them over the main alarmed transported at the wellknown sound frequent and full the great assembly crowned studious to see that terror of the plain long lost to battle shine in arms again tydides and ulysses first appear lame with their wounds and leaning on the spear these on the sacred seats of council placed the king of men atrides came the last he too sore wounded by agenors son achilles rising in the midst begun oh monarch better far had been the fate of thee of me of all the grecian state if ever the day when by mad passion swayed rash we contended for the blackeyd maid preventing dian had dispatched her dart and shot the shining mischief to the heart then many a hero had not pressed the shore nor troys glad fields been fattend with our gore long long shall greece the woes we caused bewail and sad posterity repeat the tale but this no more the subject of debate is past forgotten and resigned to fate why should alas a mortal man as i burn with a fury that can never die here then my anger ends let war succeed and even as greece has bled let ilion bleed now call the hosts and try if in our sight troy yet shall dare to camp a second night i deem their mightiest when this arm he knows shall scape with transport and with joy repose he said his finished wrath with loud acclaim the greeks accept and shout pelides name when thus not rising from his lofty throne in state unmoved the king of men begun hear me ye sons of greece with silence

great ruler felt her venomed dart deceived by junos wiles and female art for when alcmenas nine long months were run and jove expected his immortal son to gods and goddesses the unruly joy he showed

word adjourned to their black vessels all the greeks returned achilles sought his tent his train before marched onward bending with the gifts they bore those in the tents the squires industrious spread the foaming coursers to the stalls they led to their new seats the female captives move briseis radiant as the queen of love slow as she past beheld with sad survey where gashd with cruel wounds patroclus lay prone on the body fell the heavenly fair beat her sad breast and tore her golden hair allbeautiful in grief her humid eyes shining with tears she lifts and thus she cries ah youth for ever dear for ever kind once tender friend of my distracted mind i left thee fresh in life in beauty gay now find thee cold inanimated clay what woes my wretched race of life attend sorrows on sorrows never doomed to end the first loved consort of my virgin bed before these eyes in fatal battle bled my three brave brothers in one mournful day all trod the dark irremeable way thy friendly hand upreard me from the plain and dried my sorrows for a husband slain achilles care you promised i should prove the first the dearest partner of his love that rites divine should ratify the band and make me empress in his native land accept these grateful tears for thee they flow for thee that ever felt anothers woe her sister captives echoed groan for groan nor mourned patroclus fortunes but their own the leaders pressed the chief on every side unmoved he heard them and with sighs denied if yet achilles have a friend whose care is bent to please him this request forbear till yonder sun descend ah let me pay to grief and anguish one abstemious day he spoke and from the warriors turned his face yet still the brotherkings of atreus race nestor idomeneus ulysses sage and phoenix strive to calm his grief and rage his rage they calm not nor his grief control he groans he raves he sorrows from his soul thou too patroclus thus his heart he vents have spread thinviting banquet in our tents thy sweet society thy winning care often stayed achilles rushing to the war but now alas to deaths cold arms resigned what banquet but revenge can glad my mind what greater sorrow could afflict my breast what more if hoary peleus were deceast who now perhaps in pthia dreads to hear his sons sad fate and drops a tender tear what more should neoptolemus the brave my only offspring sink into the grave if yet that offspring lives i distant far of all neglectful wage a hateful war i could not this this cruel stroke attend fate claimed achilles but might spare his friend i hoped patroclus might survive to rear my tender orphan with a parents care from scyros isle conduct him over the main and glad his eyes with his paternal reign the lofty palace and the large domain for peleus breaths no more the vital air or drags a wretched life of age and care but till the news of my sad fate invades his hastening soul and sinks him to the shades sighing he said his grief the heroes joined each stole a tear for what he left behind their mingled grief the sire of heaven surveyed and thus with pity to his blueeyd maid is then achilles now no more thy care and do thou thus desert the great in war lo where yon sails their canvas wings extend all comfortless he sits and wails his friend ever thirst and want his forces have oppressed haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast he spoke and sudden as the word of jove shot the descending goddess from above so swift through ether the shrill harpye sings the wide air floating to her ample wings to great achilles she her flight addressed and poured divine ambrosia in his breast with nectar sweet refection of the gods then swift ascending sought the bright abodes now issued from the ships the warrior train and like a deluge poured upon the plain as when the piercing blasts of boreas blow and scatter over the fields the driving snow from dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies whose dazzling luster whitens all the skies so helms succeeding helms so shields from shields catch the quick beams and brighten all the fields broadglittring breastplates spears with pointed rays mix in one stream reflecting blaze on blaze thick beats the center as the coursers bound with splendour flame the skies and laugh the fields around full in the midst high towering over the rest his limbs in arms divine achilles dressed arms which the father of the fire bestowed forged on the eternal anvils of the god grief and revenge his furious heart inspire his glowing eye balls roll with living fire he grinds his teeth and furious with delay oerlooks thembattled host and hopes the bloody day the silver cuishes first his thighs infold then over his breast was braced the hollow gold the brazen sword a various baldrick tied that starrd with gems hung glittering at his side and like the moon the broad refulgent shield blazed with long rays and gleamd athwart the field so to nightwandring sailors pale with fears wide over the watery waste a light appears which on the farseen mountain blazing high streams from some lonely watchtowr to the sky with mournful eyes they gaze and gaze again loud howls the storm and drives them over the main next his high head the helmet graced behind the sweepy crest hung floating in the wind like the red star that from his flaming hair shakes down diseases pestilence and war so streamed the golden honors from his head trembled the sparkling plumes and the loose glories shed the chief beholds himself with wondering eyes his arms he poises and his motions tries buoyed by some inward force he seems to swim and feels a pinion lifting every limb and now he shakes his great paternal spear ponderous and huge which not a greek could rear from pelions cloudy top an ash entire old chiron felled and shaped it for his sire a spear which stern achilles only wields the death of heroes and the dread of fields automedon and alcimus prepare the immortal coursers and the radiant car the silver traces sweeping at their side their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied the ivory studded reins returned behind waved over their backs and to the chariot joined the charioteer then whirled the lash around and swift ascended at one active bound all bright in heavenly arms above his squire achilles mounts and sets the field on fire not brighter phoebus in thaethereal way flames from his chariot and restores the day high over the host all terrible he stands and thunders to his steeds these dread commands xanthus and balius of podarges strain unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain be swift be mindful of the load ye bear and learn to make your master more your care through falling squadrons bear my slaughtring sword nor as ye left patroclus leave your lord the generous xanthus as the words he said seemed sensible of woe and drooped his head trembling he stood before the golden wain and bowed to dust the honors of his mane when strange to tell so juno willed he broke eternal silence and portentous spoke achilles yes this day at least we bear thy rage in safety through the files of war but come it will the fatal time must come nor ours the fault but god decrees thy doom not through our crime or slowness in the course fell thy patroclus but by heavenly force the bright farshooting god who gilds the day confessed we saw him tore his arms away no  could our swiftness over the winds prevail or beat the pinions of the western gale all were in vain  the fates thy death demand due to a mortal and immortal hand then ceased for ever by the furies tied his fateful voice thintrepid chief replied with unabated rage  so let it be portents and prodigies are lost on me i know my fates to die to see no more my much loved parents and my native shore  enough  when heaven ordains i sink in night now perish troy he said and rushed to fight observations on the nineteenth book observations on the nineteenth book i verse    behold what arms etc it is not poetry only which has had this idea of giving divine ams to a hero we have a very remarkable example of it in our holy books in the second of maccabees chap    judas sees in a dream the prophet jeremiah bringing to him a sword as from god though this was only a dream or a vision yet still it is the same idea this example is likewise so much the more worthy of observation as it is much later than the age of homer and as thereby it is seen that the same way of thinking continued a long time amongst the oriental nations dacier  ii verse  0 shall flies and worms obscene pollute the dead the care which achilles takes in this place to drive away the flies from the dead body of patroclus seems to us a mean employment and a care unworthy of a hero but that office was regarded by homer and by all the greeks of his time as a pious duty consecrated by custom and religion which obliged the kindred and friends of the deceased to watch his corpse and prevent any corruption before the solemn day of his funerals it is plain this devoir was thought an indispensable one since achilles could not discharge himself of it but by imposing it upon his mother it is also clear that in those times the preservation of a dead body was accounted a very important matter since the goddesses themselves nay the most delicate of the goddesses made it the subject of their utmost attention as thetis preserves the body of patroclus and chases from it those insects that breed in the wounds and cause putrefaction so venus is employed day and night about that of hector in driving away the dogs to which achilles had exposed it apollo on his part covers it with a thick cloud and preserves its freshness amidst the greatest heats of the sun and this care of the deities over the dead was looked upon by men as a fruit of their piety  there is an excellent remark upon this passage in bossus admirable treatise of the epic poem lib   c  0 to speak says this author of the arts and sciences as a poet ought we should veil them under names and actions of persons fictitious and allegorical homer will not plainly say that salt has the virtue to preserve dead bodies and prevent the flies from engendering worms in them he will not say that the sea presented achilles a remedy to preserve patroclus from putrefaction but he will make the sea a goddess and tell us that thetis to comfort achilles engaged to perfume the body with an ambrosia which should keep it a whole year from corruption it is thus homer teaches the poets to speak of arts and sciences this example shows the nature of the things that flies cause putrefaction that salt preserves bodies from it but all this is told us poetically the whole is reduced into action the sea is made a person who speaks and acts and this prosopopoeia is accompanied with passion tenderness and affection in a word there is nothing which is not according to aristotles precept endued with manners  iii verse    preventing dian had dispatched her dart and shot the shining mischief to the heart achilles wishes briseis had died before she had occasioned so great calamities to his countrymen i will not say to excuse him that his virtue here overpowers his love but that the wish is not so very barbarous as it may seem by the phrase to a modern reader it is not that diana had actually killed her as by a particular stroke or judgment from heaven it means no more than a natural death as appears from this passage in odyss    when age or sickness have unnervd the strong apollo comes and cynthia comes along they bend the silver bows for sudden ill and every shining arrow flies to kill and he does not wish her death now after she had been his mistress but only that she had died before he knew or loved her  iv verse    she jove s dread daughter this speech of agamemnon consisting of little else than the long story of jupiters casting discord out of heaven seems odd enough at first sight and does not indeed answer what i believe every reader expects at the conference of these two princes without excusing it from the justness and proper application of the allegory in the present case i think it a piece of artifice very agreeable to the character of agamemnon which is a mixture of haughtiness and cunning he cannot prevail with himself any way to lessen the dignity of the royal character of which he every where appears jealous something he is obliged to say in public and not brooking directly to own himself in the wrong he slurs it over with this tale with what stateliness is it that he yields i was misled says he but i was misled like jupiter we invest you with our powers take our troops and our treasures our royal promise shall be fulfilled but be you pacified  v verse    she jove s dread daughter fated to infest the race of mortals   it appears from hence that the ancients owned a demon created by god himself and totally taken up in doing mischief  this fiction is very remarkable in as much as it proves that the pagans knew that a demon of discord and malediction was in heaven and afterward precipitated to earth which perfectly agrees with holy history st justin will have it that homer attained to the knowledge thereof in egypt and that he had even read what isaiah writes chap    how art thou fallen from heaven o lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the nations but our poet could not have seen the prophecy of isaiah because he lived  00 or   0 years before that prophet and this anteriority of time makes this passage the more observable homer therein bears authentic witness to the truth of the story of an angel thrown from heaven and gives this testimony above an  00 years before one of the greatest prophets spoke of it dacier  vi verse     to keep or send the presents be thy care achilles neither refuses nor demands agamemnons presents the first would be too contemptuous and the other would look too selfish it would seem as if achilles fought only for pay like a mercenary which would be utterly unbecoming a hero and dishonorable to that character homer is wonderful as to the manners spond dac  vii verse     the stern aeacides replies the greek verse is  which is repeated very frequently throughout the iliad it is a very just remark of a french critic that what makes it so much taken notice of is the rumbling sound and length of the word  this is so true that if in a poem or romance of the same length as the iliad we should repeat the hero answered full as often we should never be sensible of that repetition and if we are not shocked at the like frequency of those expressions in the aeneid sic ore refert talia voce resert talia dicta dabat vix ea fatus erat etc it is only because the sound of the latin words does not fill the ear like that of the greek   the discourse of the same critic upon these sort of repetitions in general deserves to be transcribed that useless nicety says he of avoiding every repetition which the delicacy of later times has introduced was not known to the first ages of antiquity the books of moses abound with them far from condemning their frequent use in the most ancient of all the poets we should look upon them as the certain character of the age in which he lived they spoke so in his time and to have spoken otherwise had been a fault and indeed nothing is in itself so contrary to the true sublime as that painful and frivolous exactness with which we avoid to make use of a proper word because it was used before it is certain that the romans were less scrupulous as to this point you have often in a single page of tully the same word five or six times over if it were really a fault it is not to be conceived how an author who so little wanted variety of expressions as homer could be so very negligent herein on the contrary he seems to have affected to repeat the same things in the same words on many occasions  it was from two principles equally true that among several people and in several ages two practices entirely different took their rise moses homer and the writers of the first times had found that repetitions of the same words recalled the ideas of things imprinted them much more strongly and rendered the discourse more intelligible upon this principle the custom of repeating words phrases and even entire speeches insensibly established itself both in prose and in poetry especially in narrations  the writers who succeeded them observed even from homer himself that the greatest beauty of style consisted in variety this they made their principle they therefore avoided repetitions of words and still more of whole sentences they endeavored to vary their transitions and found out new turns and manners of expressing the same things  either of these practices is good but the excess of either vicious we should neither on the one hand through a love of simplicity and clearness continually repeat the same words phrases or discourses nor on the other for the pleasure of variety fall into a childish affectation of expressing every thing twenty different ways though it be never so natural and common  nothing so much cools the warmth of a piece or puts out the fire of poetry as that perpetual care to vary incessantly even in the smallest circumstances in this as in many other points homer has despised the ungrateful labor of too scrupulous a nicety he has done like a great painter who does not think himself obliged to vary all his pieces to that degree as not one of em shall have the least resemblance to another if the principal figures are entirely different we easily excuse a resemblance in the landscapes the skies or the draperies suppose a gallery full of pictures each of which represents a particular subject in one i see achilles in fury menacing agamemnon in another the same hero with regret delivers up briseis to the heralds in a third it is still achilles but achilles overcome with grief and lamenting to his mother if the air the gesture the countenance the character of achilles are the same in each of these three pieces if the ground of one of these be the same with that of the others in the composition and general design whether it be landscape or architecture then indeed one should have reason to blame the painter for the uniformity of his figures and grounds but if there be no sameness but in the folds of a few draperies in the structure of some part of a building or in the figure of some tree mountain or cloud it is what no one would regard as a fault the application is obvious homer repeats but they are not the great strokes which he repeats not those which strike and fix our attention they are only the little parts the transitions the general circumstances or familiar images which recur naturally and upon which the reader but casts his eye carelessly such as the descriptions of sacrifices repasts or embarquements such in short as are in their own nature much the same which it is sufficient just to show and which are in a manner incapable of different ornaments  viii verse     strength is derived from spirits etc this advice of ulysses that the troops should refresh themselves with eating and drinking was extremely necessary after a battle of so long continuance as that of the day before and achilless desire that they should charge the enemy immediately without any reflection on the necessity of that refreshment was also highly natural to his violent character this forces ulysses to repeat that advice and insist upon it so much which these critics did not see into who through a false delicacy are shocked at his insisting so warmly on eating and drinking indeed to a common reader who is more fond of heroic and romantic than of just and natural images this at first sight may have an air of ridicule but i will venture to say there is nothing ridiculous in the thing itself nor mean and low in homers manner of expressing it and i believe the same of this translation though i have not softened or abated of the idea they are so offended with  ix verse  0  pale lies my friend etc it is in the greek lies extended in my tent with his face turned toward the door  that is to say as the scholiast has explained it having his feet turned toward the door for it was thus the greeks placed their dead in the porches of their houses as likewise in italy in portam rigidos calces extendit persius  recepitque ad limina gressum corpus ubi exanimi positum pallantis acetes servabat senior  thus we are told by suetonius of the body of augustus  equester ordo suscepit urbique intulit atque in vestibulo domus collocavit  x verse     though vast the heaps etc ulyssess expression in the original is very remarkable he calls  straw or chaff such as are killed in the battle and he calls  the crop such as make their escape this is very conformable to the language of holy scripture wherein those who perish are called chaff and those who are saved are called corn dacier  xi verse      none shall dare expect a second summons to the war this is very artful ulysses to prevail upon achilles to let the troops take repast and yet in some sort to second his impatience gives with the same breath orders for battle by commanding the troops to march and expect no farther orders thus though the troops go to take repast it looks as if they do not lose a moments time but are going to put themselves in array of battle dacier  xii verse   0 rolls the victim into the main for it was not lawful to eat the flesh of the victims that were sacrificed in confirmation of oaths such were victims of malediction eustathius  xiii verse     hear ye greeks etc achilles to let them see that he is entirely appeased justifies agamemnon himself and enters into the reasons with which that prince had colored his fault but in that justification he perfectly well preserves his character and illustrates the advantage he has over that king who offended him dacier  xiv verse  0  etc the lamentation of briseis over patroclus this speech says dionysius of halicarnassus is not without its artifice while briseis seems only to be deploring patroclus she represents to achilles who stands by the breach of the promises he had made her and upbraids him with the neglect he had been guilty of in resigning her up to agamemnon he adds that achilles hereupon acknowledges the justice of her complaint and makes answer that his promises should be performed it was a slip in that great criticks memory for the verse he cites is not in this part of the author  part    xv verse     achilles care you promised etc in these days when our manners are so different from those of the ancients and we see none of those dismal catastrophes which laid whole kingdoms waste and subjected princesses and queens to the power of the conqueror it will perhaps seem astonishing that a princess of briseiss birth the very day that her father brothers and husband were killed by achilles should suffer her self to be comforted and even flattered with the hopes of becoming the spouse of their murderer but such were the manners of those times as ancient history testifies and a poet represents them as they were but if there was a necessary for justifying them it might be said that slavery was at that time so terrible that in truth a princess like briseis was pardonable to choose rather to become achilless wife than his slave dacier  xvi verse     nor mourned patroclus fortunes but their own homer adds this touch to heighten the character of briseis and to show the difference there was between her and the other captives briseis as a wellborn princess really bewailed patroclus out of gratitude but the others by pretending to bewail him wept only out of interest dacier  xvii verse     thou too patroclus etc this lamentation is finely introduced while the generals are persuading him to take some refreshment it naturally awakens in his mind the remembrance of patroclus who had so often brought him food every morning before they went to battle this is very natural and admirably well conceals the art of drawing the subject of his discourse from the things that present themselves spondanus  xviii verse     i hoped patroclus might survive etc patroclu was young and achilles who had but a short time to lives hoped that after his death his dear friend would be as a father to his son and put him into the possession of his kingdom neoptolemus would in patroclus find peleus and achilles whereas when patroclus was dead he must be an orphan indeed homer is particularly admirable for the sentiments and always follows nature dacier  xix verse     so helms succeeding helms so shields from shields catch the quick beams and brighten all the fields it is probable the reader may think the words shining splendid and others derived from the luster of arms too frequent in these books my author is to answer for it but it may be alleged in his excuse that when it was the custom for every soldier to serve in armor and when those arms were of brass before the use of iron became common these image of luster were less avoidable and more necessarily frequent in descriptions of this nature  xx verse     achilles arming himself etc there is a wonderful pomp in this description of achilless arming himself every reader without being pointed to it will see the extreme grandeur of all these images but what is particular is in what a noble scale they rise one above another and how the hero is set still in a stronger point of light than before till he is at last in a manner covered over with glories he is at first likened to the moonlight then to the flames of a beacon then to a comet and lastly to the sun it self  xxi verse   0 then strange to tell so juno willed he broke eternal silence and portentous spoke it is remarked in excuse of this extravagant fiction of a horse speaking that homer was authorized herein by fable tradition and history livy makes mention of two oxen that spoke on different occasions and recites the speech of one which was roma cave tibi pliny tells us these animals were particularly gifted this way l   c    est frequens in prodigiis priscorum bovem locutum besides homer had prepared us for expecting something miraculous from these horses of achilles by representing them to be immortal we have seen em already sensible and weeping at the death of patroclus and we must add to all this that a goddess is concerned in working this wonder it is juno that does it oppian alludes to this in a beautiful passage of his first book not having the original by me i shall quote what i believe is no less beautiful mr fentons translation of it of all the prone creation none display a friendlier sense of mans superior sway some in the silent pomp of grief complain for the brave chief by doom of battle slain and when young peleus in his rapid car rushed on to rouse the thunder of the war with human voice inspired his steed deplored the fate impending dreadful over his lord cyneg lib    spondanus and dacier fail not to bring up balaams ass on this occasion but methinks the commentators are at too much pains to discharge the poet from the imputation of extravagant fiction by accounting for wonders of this kind i am afraid that next to the extravagance of inventing them is that of endeavoring to reconcile such fictions to probability would not one general answer do better to say once for all that the abovecited authors lived in the age of wonders the taste of the world has been generally turned to the miraculous wonders were what the people would have and what not only the poets but the priests gave em  xxii verse     then ceased for ever by the furies tied his fateful voice  the poet had offended against probability if he had made juno take away the voice for juno which signifies the air is the cause of the voice besides the poet was willing to intimate that the privation of the voice is a thing so dismal and melancholy that none but the furies can take upon them so cruel an employment eustathius  the twentieth book of the iliad the argument the battle of the gods and the acts of achilles jupiter upon achilless returning to the battle calls a council of the gods and permits them to assist either party the terrors of the combat described when the deities are engaged apollo encourages aeneas to meet achilles after a long conversation these

achilles pursues the trojans with a great slaughter  the same day continues the scene is in the field before troy  the twentieth book of the iliad thus round pelides breathing and blood greece

against pelides he directs his course phoebus impells and phoebus gives him force restrain his bold career at least to attend our favored hero let some power descend to guard his life and add to his renown we the great armament of heaven came down hereafter let him fall as fates design that spun so short his lifes illustrious line but lest some adverse god now cross his way give him to know what powers assist this day for how shall mortal stand the dire alarms when heavens refulgent host appear in arms thus she and thus the god whose force can make the solid globes eternal basis shake against the might of man so feeble known why should celestial powers exert their own suffice from yonder mount to view the scene and leave to war the fates of mortal men but if the armipotent or god of light obstruct achilles or commence the fight thence on the gods of troy we swift descend full soon i doubt not shall the conflict end and these in ruin and confusion hurled yield to our conquering arms the lower world thus having said the tyrant of the sea coerulean neptune rose and led the way advanced upon the field there stood a mound of earth congested walled and trenchd around in elder times to guard alcides made the work of trojans with minervas aid whattime a vengeful monster of the main swept the wide shore and drove him to the plain here neptune and the gods of greece repair with clouds encompassed and a veil of air the adverse powers around apollo laid crown the fair hills that silver simois shade in circle close each heavenly party sat intent to form the future scheme of fate but mix not yet in fight though jove on high gives the loud signal and the heavens reply meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground the trampled center yields a hollow sound steeds cased in mail and chiefs in armor bright the gleamy champain glows with brazen light amid both hosts a dreadful space appear there great achilles bold aeneas here with towering strides aeneas first advanced the nodding plumage on his helmet danced spread over his breast the fencing shield he bore and as he moved his javelin flamed before not so pelides furious to engage he rushed impetuous such the lions rage who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes though all in arms the peopled city rise stalks careless on with unregarding pride till at the length by some brave youth defied to his bold spear the savage turns alone he murmurs fury with an hollow groan he grins he foams he rolls his eyes around lashed by his tail his heaving sides resound he calls up all his rage he grinds his teeth resolved on vengeance or resolved on death so fierce achilles on aeneas flies so stands aeneas and his force defies ever yet the stern encounter joined begun the seed of thetis thus to venus son why comes aeneas through the ranks so far seeks he to meet achilles arm in war in hope the realms of priam to enjoy and prove his merits to the throne of troy grant that beneath thy lance achilles dies the partial monarch may refuse the prize sons he has many those thy pride may quell and it is his fault to love those sons too well or in reward of thy victorious hand has troy proposed some spacious tract of land an ample forest or a fair domain of hills for vines and arable for grain even this perhaps will hardly prove thy lot but can achilles be so soon forgot once as i think you saw this brandished spear and then the great aeneas seemed to fear with hearty haste from idas mount he fled nor till he reached lyrnessus turned his head her lofty walls not long our progress stayed those pallas jove and we in ruins laid in grecian chains her captive race were cast it is true the great aeneas fled too fast defrauded of my conquest once before what then i lost the gods this day restore go while thou may avoid the threatened fate fools stay to feel it and are wise too late to this anchises son such words employ to one that fears thee some unwarlike boy such we disdain the best may be defied with mean reproaches and unmanly pride unworthy the high race from which we came proclaimed so loudly by the voice of fame each from illustrious fathers draws his line each goddessborn half human half divine thetis this day or venus offspring dies and tears shall trickle from celestial eyes for when two heroes thus derived contend it is not in words the glorious strife can end if yet thou farther seek to learn my birth a tale resounded through the spacious earth hear how the glorious origin we prove from ancient dardanus the first from jove dardanias walls he raised for ilion then the city

mares his spacious pastures bred three thousand foals beside their mothers fed boreas enamored of the sprightly train concealed his godhead in a flowing mane with voice dissembled to his loves he neighd and coursd the dappled beauties over the mead hence sprung twelve others of unrivaled kind swift as their mother mares and father wind these lightly skimming when they swept the plain nor plied

excel us in this wordy war like us they stand encompassed with the crowd and vent their anger impotent and loud cease then  our business in the field of fight is not to question but to prove our might to all those insults thou have offered here receive this answer it is my flying spear he spoke with all his force the javelin flung fixed deep and loudly in the buckler rung far on his outstretchd arm pelides held to meet the thundering lance his dreadful shield that trembled as it stuck nor void of fear saw ever it fell thimmeasurable spear his fears were vain impenetrable charms secured the temper of thaetherial arms through two strong plates the point its passage held but stopped and rested by the third repelled five plates of various metal various mold composed the shield of brass each outward fold of tin each inward and the middle gold there stuck the lance then rising ever he threw the forceful spear of great achilles flew and pierced the dardan shields extremest bound where the shrill brass returned a sharper sound through the thin verge the pelian weapon glides and the slight covering of expanded hydes aeneas his contracted body bends and over him high the riven targe extends sees through its parting plates the upper air and at his back perceives the quivering spear a fate so near him chills his soul with fright and swims before his eyes the manycolourd light achilles rushing in with dreadful cries draws his broad blade and at aeneas flies aeneas rouzing as the foe came on with force collected heaves a mighty stone a mass enormous which in modern days no two of earths degenerate sons could raise but oceans god whose earthquakes rock the ground saw the distress and moved the powers around lo on the brink of fate aeneas stands an instant victim to achilles hands by phoebus urged but phoebus has bestowed his aid in vain the man oerpowrs the god and can ye see this righteous chief atone with guiltless blood for vices not his own to all the gods his constant vows were paid sure though he wars for troy he claims our aid fate wills not this nor thus can jove resign the future father of the dardan line the first great ancestor obtained his grace and still his love descends on all the race for priam now and priams faithless kind at length are odious to thallseeing mind on great aeneas shall devolve the reign and sons succeeding sons the

all that gods can bind have sworn destruction to the trojan kind not even an instant to protract their fate or save one member of the sinking state till her last flame be quenched with her last gore and even her crumbling ruins are no more the king of ocean to the fight descends through all the whistling darts his course he bends swift interposed between the warriors flies and casts thick darkness over achilles eyes from great aeneas shield the spear he drew and at its masters feet the weapon threw that done with force divine he snatched on high the dardan prince and bore him through the sky smoothgliding without step above the heads of warring heroes and of bounding steeds till at the battels utmost verge they light where the slow caucons close the rear of fight the godhead there his heavenly form confessed with words like these the panting chief addressed what power o prince with force inferior far urged thee to meet achilles arm in war henceforth beware nor antedate thy doom defrauding fate of all thy fame to come but when the day decreed for come it must shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust let then the furies of that arm be known secure no grecian force transcends thy own with that he left him wondering as he lay then from achilles chased the mist away sudden returning with the stream of light the scene of war came rushing on his sight then thus amazed what wonders strike my mind my spear that parted on the wings of wind laid here before me and the dardan lord that fell this instant vanished from my sword i thought alone with mortals to contend but powers celestial sure this foe defend great as he is our arm he scarce will try content for once with all his gods to fly now then let others bleed  this said aloud he vents his fury and inflames the crowd o greeks he cries and every rank alarms join battle man to man and arms to arms it is not in me though favored by the sky to mow whole troops and make whole armies fly no god can singly such a host engage not mars himself nor great minervas rage but whatsoever achilles can inspire whatever of active force or acting fire whatever this heart can prompt or hand obey all all achilles greeks is yours to day through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear and thin the squadrons with my single spear he said nor less elate with martial joy the godlike hector warmed the troops of troy trojans to war think hector leads you on nor dread the vaunts of peleus haughty son deeds must decide our fate even those with words insult the brave who tremble at their swords the weakest atheistwretch all heaven defies but shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire not though his heart were steel his hands were fire that fire that steel your hector should withstand and brave that vengeful heart that dreadful hand thus breathing rage through all the hero said a wood of lances rises round his head clamors on clamors tempest all the air they join they throng they thicken to the war but phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun the single fight with thetis godlike son more safe to combat in the mingled band nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand he hears obedient to the god of light and plunged within the ranks awaits the fight then fierce achilles shouting to the skies on troys whole force with boundless fury flies first falls iphytion at his armys head brave was the chief and brave the host he led from great otrynteus he derived his blood his mother was a nais of the flood beneath the shades of tmolus crowned with snow from hydes walls he ruled the lands below fierce as he springs the sword his head divides the parted visage falls on equal sides with loudresounding arms he strikes the plain while thus achilles glories over the slain lie there otryntides the trojan earth receives thee dead though gygae boast thy birth those beauteous fields where hyllus waves are rolled and plenteous hermus swells with tides of gold are thine no more  the insulting hero said and left him sleeping in eternal shade the rolling wheels of greece the body tore and dashed their axles with no vulgar gore demoleon next antenors offspring laid breathless in dust the price of rashness paid the impatient steel with fulldescending sway forced through his brazen helm its furious way resistless drove the battered skull before and dashed and mingled all the brains with gore this sees hippodamas and seized with fright deserts his chariot for a swifter flight the lance arrests him an ignoble wound the panting trojan rivets to the ground he groans away his soul not louder roars at neptunes shrine on helices high shores the victim bull the rocks rebellow round and ocean listens to the grateful sound then fell on polydore his vengeful rage the youngest hope of priams stooping age whose feet for swiftness in the race surpast of all his sons the dearest and the last to the forbidden field he takes his flight in the first folly of a youthful knight to vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain but vaunts not long with all his swiftness slain struck where the crossing belts unite behind and golden rings the double backplate joined forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel and on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell the rushing entrails poured upon the ground his hands collect and darkness wraps him round when hector viewed all ghastly in his gore thus sadly slain the unhappy polydore a cloud of sorrow overcast his sight his soul no longer brookd the distant fight full in achilles dreadful front he came and shook his javelin like a waving flame the son of peleus sees with joy possessed his heart highbounding in his rising breast and lo the man on whom black fates attend the man that slew achilles in his friend no more shall hectors and pelides spear turn from each other in the walks of war  then with revengeful eyes he scanned him over come and receive thy fate he spoke no more hector undaunted thus such words employ to one that dreads thee some unwarlike boy such we could give defying and defied mean intercourse of obloquy and pride i know thy force to mine superior far but heaven alone confers success in war mean as i am the gods may guide my dart and give it entrance in a braver heart then parts the lance but pallas heavenly breath far from achilles wafts the winged death the bidden dart again to hector flies and at the feet of its great master lies achilles closes with his hated foe his heart and eyes with flaming fury glow but present to his aid apollo shrouds the favored hero in a veil of clouds thrice struck pelides with indignant heart thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart the spear a fourth time buried in the cloud he foams with fury and exclaims aloud wretch thou have escaped again once more thy flight has saved thee and the partial god of light but long thou shall not thy just fate withstand if any power assist achilles hand fly then inglorious but thy flight this

while yet he trembled at his knees and cried the ruthless falchion opened his tender side the panting liver pours a flood of gore that drowns his bosom till he pants no more through mulius head then drove the impetuous spear the warrior falls transfixed from ear to ear thy life echeclus next the sword bereaves deep through his front the ponderous falchion cleaves warmed in the brain the smoking weapon lies the purple death comes floating over his eyes then brave deucalion died the dart was flung where the knit nerves the plaint elbow strung he dropped his arm an unassisting weight and stood all impotent expecting fate full on his neck the falling falchion sped from his broad shoulders hewed his crested head forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies and sunk in dust the corpse extended

expiring on the ground his prostrate master reind the steeds around his back scarce turned the pelian javelin gored and stretched the servant over his dying lord as when a flame the winding valley fills and runs on crackling shrubs between the hills then over the stubble up the mountain flies fires the high woods and blazes to the skies this way and that the spreading torrent roars so sweeps the hero through the wasted shores around him wide immense destruction pours and earth is deluged with the sanguine showers as with autumnal harvests covered over and thick bestrown lies ceres sacred floor when round and round with neverwearyd pain the trampling steers beat out thunnumberd grain so the fierce coursers as the chariot rolls tread down whole ranks and crush out heros souls dashed from their hoofs while over the dead they fly black bloody drops the smoking chariot die the spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore and thick the groaning axles dropped with gore high over the scene of death achilles stood all grim with dust all horrible in blood yet still insatiate still with rage on flame such is the lust of neverdying fame observations on the twentieth book observations on the twentieth book i verse   then jove to themis gives command etc the poet is now to bring his hero again into action and he introduces him with the utmost pomp and grandeur the gods are assembled only upon this account and jupiter permits several deities to join with the trojans and hinder achilles from overruling destiny itself  the circumstance of sending themis to assemble the gods is very beautiful she is the goddess of justice the trojans by the rape of helen and by repeated perjuries having broken her laws she is the properest messenger to summon a synod to bring them to punishment eustathius  proclus has given a farther explanation of this themis or justice says he is made to assemble the gods round jupiter because it is from him that all the powers of nature take their virtue and receive their orders and jupiter sends them to the relief of both parties to show that nothing falls out but by his permission and that neither angels nor men nor the elements act but according to the power which is given them  ii verse    all but old ocean eustathius gives two reasons why oceanus was absent from this assembly the one is because he is fabled to be the original of all the gods and it would have been a piece of indecency for him to see the deities who were all his descendents war upon one another by joining adverse parties the other reason he draws from the allegory of oceanus which signifies the element of water and consequently the whole element could not ascend into the ether but whereas neptune the rivers and the fountains are said to have been present this is no way impossible if we consider it in an allegorical sense which implies that the rivers seas and fountains supply the air with vapors and by that means ascend into the ether  iii verse    celestial powers descend and as your minds direct your succor lend to either host   eustathius informs us that the ancients were very much divided upon this passage of homer some have criticized it and others have answered their criticism but he reports nothing more than the objection without transmitting the answer to us those who condemned homer said jupiter was for the trojans he saw the greeks were the strongest so permitted the gods to declare themselves and go to the battle but therein that god is deceived and does not gain his point for the gods who favor the greeks being stronger than those who favor the trojans the greeks will still have the same advantage i do not know what answer the partisans of homer made but for my part i think this objection is more ingenious than solid jupiter does not pretend that the trojans should be stronger than the greeks he has only a mind that the decree of destiny should be executed destiny had refused to achilles the glory of taking troy but if achilles fights singly against the trojans he is capable of forcing destiny as homer has already elsewhere said that there had been brave men who had done so whereas if the gods took part tho those who followed the grecians were stronger than those who were for the trojans the latter would however be strong enough to support destiny and to hinder achilles from making himself master of troy this was jupiters sole view thus is this passage far from being blameable it is on the contrary very beautiful and infinitely glorious for achilles dacier  iv verse     or ilion s sacred wall may fall this day though fate forbid the fall mons de la motte criticizes on this passage as thinking it absurd and contradictory to homers own system to imagine that what fate had ordained should not come to pass jupiter here seems to fear that troy will be taken this very day in spite of destiny  m boivin answers that the explication hereof depends wholly upon the principles of the ancient pagan theology and their doctrine concerning fate it is certain according to homer and virgil that which destiny had decreed did not constantly happen in the precise time marked by destiny the fatal moment was not to be retarded but might be hastened for example that of the death of dido was advanced by the blow she gave herself her hour was not then come  nec fato merita nec morte peribat sed misera ante diem  every violent death was accounted  that is before the fated time or which is the same thing against the natural order turbato mortalitatis ordine as the romans expressed it and the same might be said of any misfortunes which men drew upon themselves by their own ill conduct see the   th note on lib    in a word it must be allowed that it was not easy in the pagan religion to form the juses ideas upon a doctrine so difficult to be cleared and upon which it is no great wonder if a poet should not always be perfectly consistent with himself when it has puzzeld such a number of divines and philosophers  v verse    on adverse parts the warring gods engage heavens awful queen etc eusahius has a very curious remark upon this division of the gods in homer which m dacier has entirely borrowed as indeed no commentator ever borrowed more or acknowledged less than she has every where done from eustathius this division says he is not made at random but founded upon very solid reasons drawn from the nature of those two nations he places on the side of the greeks all the gods who preside over arts and sciences to signify how much in that respect the greeks excelled all other nations juno pallas neptune mercury and vulcan are for the greeks juno not only as the goddess who presides over marriage and who is concerned to revenge an injury done to the nuptial bed but likewise as the goddess who represents monarchical government which was better established in greece than any where else pallas because being the goddess of war and wisdom she ought to assist those who are wronged besides the greeks understood the art of war better than the barbarians neptune because he was an enemy to the trojans upon account of laomedons persidiousness and because most of the greeks being come from the islands or peninsulas they were in some sort his subjects mercury because he is a god who presides over stratagems of war and because troy was taken by that of the wooden horse and lastly vulcan as the declared enemy of mars and of all adulterers and as the father of arts  vi verse    mars fieryhelmd the laughter loving dame the reasons why mars and venus engage for the trojans are very obvious the point in hand was to favor ravishers and debauchees but the same reason you will say does not serve for apollo diana and latona it is urged that apollo is for the trojans because of the darts and arrows which were the principal strength of the barbarians and diana because she presided over dancing and those barbarians were great dancers and latona as influenced by her children xanthus being a trojan river is interested for his country eustathius  vii verse    above the sire of gods etc the images says longinus which homer gives of the combat of the gods have in em something prodigiously great and magnificent we see in these verses the earth opened to its very center hell ready to disclose itself the whole machine of the world upon the point to be destroyed and overturned to show that in such a conflict heaven and hell all things mortal and immortal the whole creation in short was engaged in this battle and all the extent of nature in danger non secus ac si qua penitus vi terra dehiscens infernas reseret seeds and regna recludat pallida diis invisa superque immane barathrum cernatur trepidentque immisso lumine manes virgil  madam dacier rightly observes that this copy is inferior to the original on this account that virgil has made a comparison of that which homer made an action this occasions an infinite difference which is easy to be perceived  one may compare with this noble passage of homer the battle of the gods and giants in hesiods theogony which is one of the sublimest parts of that author and miltons battle of the angels in the sixth book the elevation and enthusiasm of our great countryman seems owing to this original  viii verse    first silver shafted phoebus took the plain etc with what art does the poet engage the gods in this conflict neptune opposes apollo which implies that things moist and dry are in continual discord pallas fights with mars which signifies that rashness and wisdom always disagree juno is against diana that is nothing more differs from a marriage state than celibacy vulcan engages xanthus that is fire and water are in perpetual variance thus we have a fine allegory concealed under the veil of excellent poetry and the reader receives a double satisfaction at the same time from beautiful verses and an instructive moral eustathius  ix verse     already have i met etc eustathius remarks that the poet lets no opportunity pass of inserting into his poem the actions that preceded the tenth year of the war especially the actions of achilles the hero of it in this place he brings in aeneas extolling the bravery of his enemy and confessing himself to have formerly been vanquished by him at the same time he preserves a piece of ancient history by inserting into the poem the heros conquest of pedasus and lyrnessus  x verse     from ida s woods he chased us  but jove assisting i survived it is remarkable that aeneas owed his safety to his flight from achilles but it may seem strange that achilles who was so famed for his swiftness should not be able to overtake him even with minerva for his guide eustathius answers that this might proceed from the better knowledge aeneas might have of the ways and defiles achilles being a stranger and aeneas having long kept his fathers flocks in those parts  he farther observes that the word  discovers that it was in the night that achilles pursued aeneas  xi verse     advanced upon the field there stood a mound etc it may not be unnecessary to explain this passage to make it understood by the reader the poet is very short in the description as supposing the fact already known and hastens to the combat between achilles and aeneas this is very judicious in homer not to dwell on a piece of history that had no relation to his action when he has raised the readers expectation by so pompous an introduction and made the gods themselves his spectators  the story is as follows laomedon having defrauded neptune of the reward he promised him for the building the walls of troy neptune sent a monstrous whale to which laomedon exposed his daughter hesione but hercules having undertaken to destroy the monster the trojans raised an intrenchment to defend hercules from his pursuit this being a remarkable piece of conduct in the trojans it gave occasion to the poet to adorn a plain narration with fiction by ascribing the work to pallas the goddess of wisdom eustathius  xii verse   0 here neptune and the gods etc i wonder why eustathius and all other commentators should be silent upon this recess of the gods it seems strange at the first view that so many deities after having entered the scene of action should perform so short a part and immediately become themselves spectators i conceive the reason of this conduct in the poet to be that achilles has been inactive during the greatest part of the poem and as he is the hero of it ought to be the chief character in it the poet therefore withdraws the gods from the field that achilles may have the whole honor of the day and not act in subordination to the deities besides the poem now draws to a conclusion and it is necessary for homer to enlarge upon the exploits of achilles that he may leave a noble idea of his valor upon the mind of the reader  xiii verse     etc the conversation of achilles and aeneas i shall lay before the reader the words of eustathius in defense of this passage which i confess seems to me to be faulty in the poet the reader says he would naturally expect some great and terrible achievements should ensue from achilles upon his first entrance upon action the poet seems to prepare us for it by his magnificent introduction of him into the field but instead of a storm we have a calm he follows the same method in this book as he did in the third where when both armies were ready to engage in a general conflict he ends the day in a single combat between two heroes thus he always agreeably surprises his readers besides the admirers of homer reap a farther advantage from this conversation of the heroes there is a chain of ancient history as well as a series of poetical beauties  madam daciers excuse is very little better and to show that this is really a fault in the poet i believe i may appeal to the taste of every reader who certainly finds himself disappointed our expectation is raised to see gods and heroes engage when suddenly it all sinks into such a combat in which neither party receive a wound and what is more extraordinary the gods are made the spectators of so small an action what occasion was there for thunder earthquakes and descending deities to introduce a matter of so little importance neither is it any excuse to say he has given us a piece of ancient history we expected to read a poet not an historian in short after the greatest preparation for action imaginable he suspends the whole narration and from the heat of a poet cools at once into the simplicity of an historian  xiv verse     the natives were content to till the shady foot of ida s fountful hill    plato and strabo understand this passage as favoring the opinion that the mountainous parts of the world were first inhabited after the universal deluge and that mankind by degrees descended to dwell in the lower parts of the hills which they would have the word  signify and only in greater process of time ventured into the valleys virgil however seems to have taken this word in a sense something different where he alludes to this passage aen    0   nondum ilium et arces pergameae steterant habitabant vallibus imis   xv verse     three thousand mares etc the number of the horses and mares of ericthonius may seem incredible were we not assured by herodotus that there were in the stud of cyrus at one time besides those for the service of war eight hundred horses and six thousand six hundred mares eustathius  xvi verse     boreas enamored etc homer has the happiness of making the least circumstance considerable the subject grows under his hands and the plainest matter shines in his dress of poetry another poet would have said these horses were as swift as the wind but homer tells you that they sprung from boreas the god of wind and thence drew their swiftness  xvii verse   0 these lightly skimming as they swept the plain the poet illustrates the swiftness of these horses by describing them as running over the standing corn and surface of waters without making any impression virgil has imitated these lines and adapts what homer says of these horses to the swiftness of camilla aen    0  illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret gramina nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas vel mare per medium fluctu supensa tumenti ferret iter celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas the reader will easily perceive that virgils is almost a literal translation he has imitated the very run of the verses which flow nimbly away in dactyls and as swift as the wind they describe  i cannot but observe one thing in favor of homer that there can no greater commendation be given to him than by considering the conduct of virgil who though undoubtedly the greatest poet after him seldom ventures to vary much from his original in the passages he takes from him as in a despair of improving and contented if he can but equal them  xviii verse   0 to bear the cup of jove to be a cup bearer has in all ages and nations been reckoned an honorable employment sappho mentions it in honor of her brother larichus that he was cup bearer to the nobles of mitylene the son of menelaus executed the same office hebe and mercury served the gods in the same station  it was the custom in the pagan worship to employ noble youths to pour the wine upon the sacrifice in this office ganymede might probably attend upon the altar of jupiter and from thence was fabled to be his cup bearer eustath  xix verse     but oceans god etc the conduct of the poet in making aeneas owe his safety to neptune in this place is remarkable neptune is an enemy to the trojans yet he dares not suffer so pious a man to fall lest jupiter should be offended this shows says eustathius that piety is always under the protection of god and that favors are sometimes conferred not out of kindness but to prevent a greater detriment thus neptune preserves aeneas lest jupiter should revenge his death upon the grecians  xx verse     and can ye see this righteous chief etc though aeneas is represented a man of great courage yet his piety is his most shining character this is the reason why he is always the care of the gods and they favor him constantly through the whole poem with their immediate protection  it is in this light that virgil has presented him to the view of the reader his valor bears but the second place in the aeneis in the ilias indeed he is drawn in miniature and in the aeneis in full length but there are the same features in the copy which are in the original and he is the same aeneas in rome as he was in troy  xxi verse     on great aeneas shall devolve the reign and sons succeeding sons the line sustain the story of aeneas his founding the roman empire gave virgil the finest occasion of paying a complement to augustus and his countrymen who were fond of being thought the descendants of troy he has translated these two lines literally and put them in the nature of a prophecy as the favorers of the opinion of aeneass sailing into italy imagine homers to be    hic domus aeneae cunctis dominabitur oris et nati natorum and qui nascentur ab illis there has been a very ancient alteration made as strabo observes in these two lines by substituting  in the room of  it is not improbable but virgil might give occasion for it by his cunctis dominabitur oris  eustathius does not entirely discountenance this story if it be understood says he as a prophecy the poet might take it from the sibylline oracles he farther remarks that the poet artfully interweaves into his poem not only the things which happened before the commencement and in the prosecution of the trojan war but other matters of importance which happened even after that war was brought to a conclusion thus for instance we have here a piece of history not extant in any other author by which we are informed that the house of aeneas succeeded to the crown of troas and to the kingdom of priam eustathius  this passage is very considerable for it ruins the famous chimaera of the roman empire and of the family of the caesars who both pretended to deduce their original from venus by aeneas alleging that after the taking of troy aeneas came into italy and this pretension is hereby actually destroyed this testimony of homer ought to be looked upon as an authentic act the fidelity and verity whereof cannot be questioned neptune as much an enemy as he is to the trojans declares that aeneas and after him his posterity shall reign over the trojans would homer have put this prophecy in neptunes mouth if he had not known that aeneas did not leave troy that he reigned therein and if he had not seen in his time the descendants of that prince reign there likewise that poet wrote   0 years or thereabouts after the taking of troy and what is very remarkable he wrote in some of the towns of ionia that is to say in the neighborhood of phrygia so that the time and place give such a weight to his deposition that nothing can invalidate it all that the historians have written concerning aeneass voyage into italy ought to be considered as a romance made on purpose to destroy all historical truth for the most ancient is posterior to homer by many ages before dionysius of halicarnassus some writers being sensible of the strength of this passage of homer undertook to explain it so as to reconcile it with this fable and they said that aeneas after having been in italy returned to troy and left his son ascanius there dionysius of halicarnassus little satisfied with this solution which did not seem to him to be probable has taken another method he would have it that by these words he shall reign over the trojans homer meant he shall reign over the trojans whom he shall carry with him into italy is it not possible says he that aeneas should reign over the trojans whom he had taken with him though settled elsewhere  that historian who wrote in rome itself and in the very reign of augustus was willing to make his court to that prince by explaining this passage of homer so as to favor the chimaera he was possessed with and this is a reproach that may with some justice be cast on him for poets may by their fictions flatter princes and welcome it is their trade but for historians to corrupt the gravity and severity of history to substitute fable in the place of truth is what ought not to be pardoned strabo was much more religious for though he wrote his books of geography toward the beginning of tiberiuss reign yet he had the courage to give a right explication to this passage of homer and to aver that this poet said and meant that aeneas remained at troy that he reigned therein priams whole race being extinguished and that he left the kingdom to his children after him lib    you may see this whole matter discussed in a letter from the famous m bochart to m de segrais who has prefixed it to his remarks upon the translation of virgil  xxii verse     where the slow caucons close the rear the caucones says eustathius were of paphlagonian extract and this perhaps was the reason why they are not distinctly mentioned in the catalogue they being included under the general name of paphlagonians though two lines are quoted which are said to have been left out by some transcriber and immediately followed this  which verses are these  or as others read it   or according to others  but i believe these are not homers lines but the addition of some transcriber and it is evident by consulting the passage from which they are said to have been curtailed that they would be absurd in that place for the second line is actually there already and as these caucons are said to live upon the banks of the parthenius so are the paphlagonians in the abovementioned passage it is therefore more probable that the caucons are included in the paphlagonians  xxiii verse      not louder roars at neptune s shrine on helice s high shores etc in helice a town of achaia three quarters of a league from the gulf of corinth neptune had a magnificent temple where the ionians offered every year to him a sacrifice of a bull and it was with these people an auspicious sign and a certain mark that the sacrifice would be accepted if the bull bellowed as it was led to the altar after the ionic migration which happened about   0 years after the taking of troy the ionians of asia assembled in the fields of priene to celebrate the same festival in honor of heliconian neptune and as those of priene valued themselves upon being originally of helice they chose for the king of the sacrifice a young prienian it is needless to dispute from whence the poet has taken his comparison for as he lived a  00 or   0 years after the ionic migration it cannot be doubted but he took it in the asian ionia and at priene itself where he had doubtless often assisted at that sacrifice and been witness of the ceremonies therein observed this poet always appears strongly addicted to the customs of the ionians which makes some conjecture that he was an ionian himself eustathius dacier  xxiv verse     then fell on polydore his vengeful rage euripides in his hecuba has followed another tradition when he makes polydorus the son of priam and of hecuba and makes him slain by polymnestor king of thrace after the taking of troy for according to homer he is not the son of hecuba but of laothoe as he says in the following book and is slain by achilles virgil too has rather chosen to follow euripides than homer  xxv verse     full in achilles dreadful front he came the great judgment of the poet in keeping the character of his hero is in this place very evident when achilles was to engage aeneas he holds a long conference with him and with patience bears the reply of aeneas had he pursued the same method with hector he had departed from his character anger is the prevailing passion in achilles he left the field in a rage against agamemnon and entered it again to be revenged of hector the poet therefore judiciously makes him take fire at the sight of his enemy he describes him as impatient to kill him he gives him a haughty challenge and that challenge is comprehended in a single line his impatience to be revenged would not suffer him to delay it by a length of words  xxvi verse     but present to his aid apollo it is a common observation that a god should never be introduced into a poem but where his presence is necessary and it may be asked why the life of hector is of such importance that apollo should rescue him from the hand of achilles here and yet suffer him to fall so soon after eustathius answers that the poet had not yet sufficiently exalted the valor of achilles he takes time to enlarge upon his achievements and rises by degrees in his character till he completes both his courage and resentment at one blow in the death of hector and the poet adds he pays a great complement to his favorite countryman by showing that nothing but the intervention of a god could have saved aeneas and hector from the hand of achilles  xxvii verse      no prayer no moving art ever bent that fierce inexorable heart i confess it is a satisfaction to me to observe with what art the poet pursues his subject the opening of the poem professes to treat of the anger of achilles that anger draws on all the great events of the story and homer at every opportunity awakens the reader to an attention to it by mentioning the effects of it so that when we see in this place the hero deaf to youth and compassion it is what we expect mercy in him would offend because it is contrary to his character homer proposes him not as a pattern for imitation but the moral of the poem which he designed the reader should draw from it is that we should avoid anger since it is ever pernicious in the event  xxix verse   0 the trampling steers beat out the unnumberd grain in greece instead of threshing the corn as we do they caused it to be trod out by oxen this was likewise practiced in judaea as is seen by the law of god who forbad the jews to muzzle the ox who trod out the corn non ligabis os bovis terentis in area fruges tuas deuteron    dacier  the self same practice is still preserved among the turks and modern greeks  xxx the similes at the end it is usual with our author to heap his similes very thick together at the conclusion of a book he has done the same in the seventeenth it is the natural discharge of a vast imagination heated in its progress and giving itself vent in this crowd of images  i cannot close the notes upon this book without observing the dreadful idea of archilles which the poet leaves upon the mind of the reader he drives his chariot over shields and mangled heaps of slain the wheels the axletree and the horses are stained with blood the heros eyes burn with fury and his hands are red with slaughter a painter might form from this passage the picture of mars in the fullness of his terrors as well as phidias is said to have drawn from another that of jupiter in all his majesty  the twentyfirst book of the iliad the argument the battle in the river scamander the trojans fly before achilles some toward the town others to the river scamander he falls upon the latter with great slaughter takes twelve captives alive to sacrifice to the manes of patroclus and kills lycaon and asteropaeus scamander attacks him with all his waves neptune and pallas assist the hero simois joins scamander at length vulcan by the instigation of juno almost dries up the river this combat ended the other gods engage each other meanwhile achilles continues the slaughter drives the rest into troy agenor only makes a stand and is conveyed away in a cloud by apollo who to delude achilles takes upon him agenors shape and while he pursues him in that disguise gives the trojans an opportunity of retiring into their city  the same day continues the scene is on the banks and in the stream of scamander  the twentyfirst book of the iliad and now to xanthus gliding stream they drove xanthus immortal progeny of jove the river here divides the flying train part to the town fly diverse over the plain where late their troops triumphant bore the fight now chased and trembling in ignoble flight these with a gathered mist saturnia shrouds and rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds part plunge into the stream old xanthus roars the flashing billows beat the whitened shores with cries promiscuous all the banks resound and here and there in eddies whirling round the flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drowned as the scorched locusts from their fields retire while fast behind them runs the blaze of fire driven from the land before the smoky cloud the clustring legions rush into the flood so plunged in xanthus by achilles force roars the resounding surge with men and horse his bloody lance the hero casts aside which spreading tamrisks on the margin hide then like a god the rapid billows braves armed with his sword highbrandishd over the waves now down he plunges now he whirls it round deep groan the waters with the dying sound repeated wounds the redning river died and the warm purple circled on the tide swift through the foamy flood the trojans fly and close in rocks or winding caverns lie so the huge dolphin tempesting the main in shoals before him fly the scaly train confusedly heaped they seek their inmost caves or pant and heave beneath the floating waves now tired with slaughter from the trojan band twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land with their rich belts their captive arms constrains late their proud ornaments but now their chains these his attendants to the ships conveyed sad victims destined to patroclus shade then as once more he plunged amid the flood the young lycaon in his passage stood the son of priam whom the heros hand but late made captive in his fathers land as on a fig tree top his sounding steel lopped the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel to lemnos isle he sold the royal slave where jasons son the price demanded gave but kind eetion touching on the shore the ransomed prince to fair arisbe bore ten days were past since in his fathers reign he felt the sweets of liberty again the next that god whom men in vain withstand gives the same youth to the same conquering hand now never to return and doomed to go a sadder journey to the shades below his wellknown face when great achilles eyed the helm and vizor he had cast aside with wild affright and dropped upon the field his useless lance and unavailing shield as trembling panting from the stream he fled and knocked his faultring knees the hero said ye mighty gods what wonders strike my view is it in vain our conquering arms subdue sure i shall see yon heaps of trojans killed rise from the shades and brave me on the field as now the captive whom so late i bound and sold to lemnos stalks on trojan ground not him the seas unmeasured deeps detain that bar such numbers from their native plain lo he returns try then my flying spear try if the grave can hold the wanderer if earth at length this active prince can seize earth whose strong grasp has held down hercules thus while he spoke the trojan pale with fears approached and sought his knees with suppliant tears loath as he was to yield his youthful breath and his soul shivering at the approach of death achilles raised the spear prepared to wound he kissed his feet extended on the ground and while above the spear suspended stood longing to dip its thristy point in blood one hand embraced them close one stopped the dart while thus these melting words attempt his heart thy wellknown captive great achilles see once more lycaon trembling at thy knee some pity to a suppliants name afford who shared the gifts of ceres at thy board whom late thy conquering arm to lemnos bore far from his father friends and native shore a hundred oxen were his price that day now sums immense thy mercy shall repay scarce respited from woes i yet appear and scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here lo jove again submits me to thy hands again her victim cruel fate demands i sprung from priam and laothoe fair old altes daughter and lelegias heir who held in pedasus his famed abode and ruled the fields where silver satnio flowed two sons alas unhappy sons she bore for ah one spear shall drink each brothers gore and i succeed to slaughtered polydore how from that arm of terror shall i fly some demon urges it is my doom to die if ever yet soft pity touched thy mind ah think not me too much of hectors kind not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath with his who wrought thy loved patroclus death these words attended with a shower of tears the youth addressed to unrelenting ears talk not of life or ransom he replies patroclus dead whoever meets me dies in vain a single trojan sues for grace but least the sons of priams hateful race die then my friend what boots it to deplore the great the good patroclus is no more he far thy better was foredoomd to die and thou do thou bewail mortality see thou not me whom natures gifts adorn sprung from a hero from a goddess born the day shall come which nothing can avert when by the spear the arrow or the dart by night or day by force or by design impending death and certain fate are mine die then  he said and as the word he spoke the fainting stripling sunk before the stroke his hand forgot its grasp and left the spear while all his trembling frame confessed his fear sudden achilles his broad sword displayed and buried in his neck the reeking blade prone fell the youth and panting on the land the gushing purple died the thirsty sand the victor to the stream the carcass gave and thus insults him floating on the wave lie there lycaon let the fish surround thy bloated corse and suck thy goary wound there no sad mother shall thy funrals weep but swift scamander roll thee to the deep whose every wave some watery monster brings to feast unpunished on the fat of kings so perish troy and all the trojan line such ruin theirs and such compassion mine what boots ye now scamanders worshipped stream his earthly honors and immortal name in vain your immolated bulls are slain your living coursers glut his gulphs in vain thus he rewards you with this bitter fate thus till the grecian vengeance is complete thus is atoned patroclus honored shade and the short absence of achilles paid these boastful words provoke the raging god with fury swells the violated flood what means divine may yet the power employ to check achilles and to rescue troy meanwhile the hero springs in arms to dare the great asteropeus to mortal war the son of pelagon whose lofty line flows from the source of axius stream divine fair peribaeas love the god had crowned with all his refluent waters circled round on him achilles rushed he fearless stood and shook two spears advancing from the flood the flood impelled him on pelides head tavenge his waters choked with heaps of dead near as they drew achilles thus began what art thou boldest of the race of man who or from whence unhappy is the sire whose son encounters our resistless ire o son of peleus what avails to trace replied the warrior our illustrious race from rich paeonias valleys i command armed with protended spears my native band now shines the tenth bright morning since i came in aid of ilion to the fields of fame axius who swells with all the neighboring rills and wide around the floated region fills begot my sire whose spear such glory won now lift thy arm and try that heros son threatening he said the hostile chiefs advance at once asteropeus discharged each lance for both his dextrous hands the lance could wield one struck but pierced not the vulcanian shield one razed achilles hand the spouting blood spun forth in earth the fastened weapon stood like lightning next the pelian javelin flies its erring fury hissed along the skies deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear even to the middle eathed and quiverd there then from his side the sword pelides drew and on his foe with doubled fury flew the foe thrice tugged and shook the rooted wood repulsive of his might the weapon stood the fourth he tries to break the spear in vain bent as he stands he tumbles to the plain his belly opened with a ghastly wound the reeking entrails pour upon the ground beneath the heros feet he panting lies and his eye darkens and his spirit flies while the proud victor thus triumphing said his radiant armor tearing from the dead so ends thy glory such the fate they prove who strive presumptuous with the sons of jove sprung from a river did thou boast thy line but great saturnius is the source of mine how durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny of peleus aeacus and jove am i the race of these superior far to those as he that thunders to the stream that flows what rivers can scamander might have shown but jove he dreads nor wars against his son even achelous might contend in vain and all the roaring billows of the main the eternal ocean from whose fountains flow the seas the rivers and the springs below the thundering voice of jove abhors to hear and in his deep abysses shakes with fear he said then from the bank his javelin tore and left the breathless warrior in his gore the floating tides the bloody carcass lave and beat against it wave succeeding wave till rolled between the banks it lies the food of curling eels and fishes of the flood all scattered round the stream their mightiest slain thamazd paeonians scour along the plain he vents his fury on the flying crew thrasius astypylus and mnesus slew mydon thersilochus with aenius fell and numbers more his lance had plunged to hell but from the bottom of his gulphs profound scamander spoke the shores returned the sound o first of mortals for the gods are thine in valor matchless and in force divine if jove have given thee every trojan head it is not on me thy rage should heap the dead see my choked streams no more their course can keep nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep turn then impetuous from our injured flood content thy slaughters could amaze a god in human form confessed before his eyes the river thus and thus the chief replies o sacred stream thy word we shall obey but not till troy the destined vengeance pay not till within her towers the perjured train shall pant and tremble at our arms again not till proud hector guardian of her wall or stain this lance or see achilles fall he said and drove with fury on the foe then to the godhead of the silver bow the yellow flood began o son of jove was not the mandate of the sire above full and express that phoebus should employ his sacred arrows in defense of troy and make her conquer till hyperions fall in awful darkness hide the face of all he spoke in vain  the chief without dismay ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way then rising in his rage above the shores from all his deeps the bellowing river roars huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast and round the banks the ghastly dead are tossed while all before the billows ranged on high a watery bulwark screen the bands who fly now bursting on his head with thundering sound the falling deluge whelms the hero round his loaded shield bends to the rushing tide his feet upborn scarce the strong flood divide sliddring and staggring on the border stood a spreading elm that overhung the flood he seized a bending bough his steps to stay the plant uprooted to his weight gave way heaving the bank and undermining all loud flash the waters to the rushing fall of the thick foliage the large trunk displayed bridgd the rough flood across the hero stayed on this his weight and raised upon his hand leaped from the chanel and regained the land then blackened the wild waves the murmur rose the god pursues a huger billow throws and bursts the bank ambitious to destroy the man whose fury is the fate of troy he like the warlike eagle speeds his pace swiftest and strongest of thaerial race far as a spear can fly achilles springs at every bound his clanging armor rings now here now there he turns on every side and winds his course before the following tide the waves flow after wheresoeer he wheels and gather fast and murmur at his heels so when a peasant to his garden brings soft rills of water from the bubbling springs and calls the floods from high to bless his bowers and feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers soon as he clears whatever their passage staid and marks their future current with his spade swift over the rolling pebbles down the hills louder and louder purl the falling rills before him scattering they prevent his pains and shine in mazy wandrings over the plains still flies achilles but before his eyes still swift scamander rolls wherever he flies not all his speed escapes the rapid floods the first of men but not a match for gods often as he turned the torrent to oppose and bravely try if all the powers were foes so often the surge in watery mountains spread beats on his back or bursts upon his head yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves and still indignant bounds above the waves tired by the tides his knees relax with toil washed from beneath him slides the slimy soil when thus his eyes on heavens expansion thrown forth bursts the hero with an angry groan is there no god achilles to befriend no power tavert his miserable end prevent oh jove this ignominious date and make my future life the sport of fate of all heavens oracles believed in vain but most of thetis must her son complain by phoebus darts she prophesied my fall in glorious arms before the trojan wall oh had i died in fields of battle warm stretched like a hero by a heros arm might hectors spear this dauntless bosom rend and my swift soul overtake my slaughtered friend ah no achilles meets a shameful fate oh how unworthy of the brave and great like some vile swain whom on a rainy day crossing a ford the torrent sweeps away an unregarded carcass to the sea neptune and pallas haste to his relief and thus in human form address the chief the power of ocean first forbear thy fear o son of peleus lo thy gods appear behold from jove descending to thy aid propitious neptune and the blueeyd maid stay and the furious flood shall cease to rave it is not thy fate to glut his angry wave but thou the counsel heaven suggests attend nor breathe from combat nor thy sword suspend till troy receive her flying sons till all her routed squadrons pant behind their wall hector alone shall stand his fatal chance and hectors blood shall smoke upon thy lance thine is the glory doomed thus spoke the gods then swift ascended to the bright abodes stung with new ardor thus by heaven impelled he springs impetuous and invades the field over all thexpanded plain the waters spread heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead floating midst scattered arms while casques of gold and turned up bucklers glittered as they rolled high over the surging tide by leaps and bounds he wades and mounts the parted wave resounds not a whole river stops the heros course while pallas fills him with immortal force with equal rage indignant xanthus roars and lifts his billows and oerwhelms his shores then thus to simois haste my brother flood and check this mortal that controuls a god our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight and ilion tumble from her towry height call then thy subject streams and bid them roar from all thy fountains swell thy watery store with broken rocks and with a load of dead charge the black surge and pour it on his head mark how resistless through the floods he goes and boldly bids the warring gods be foes but nor that force nor form divine to sight shall ought avail him if our rage unite whelmed under our dark gulphs those arms shall lie that blaze so dreadful in each trojan eye and deep beneath a sandy mountain hurled immersed remain this terror of the world such ponderous ruin shall confound the place no greek shall ever his perished relics grace no hand his bones shall gather or inhume these his cold rites and this his watery tomb he said and on the chief descends amain increased with gore and swelling with the slain then murmuring from his beds he boils he raves and a foam whitens on the purple waves at every step before achilles stood the crimson surge and deluged him with blood fear touched the queen of heaven she saw dismayed she called aloud and summoned vulcans aid rise to the war the insulting flood requires thy wasteful arm assemble all thy fires while to their aid by our command enjoined rush the swift eastern and the western wind these from old ocean at my word shall blow pour the red torrent on the watery foe corses and arms to one bright ruin turn and hissing rivers to their bottoms burn go mighty in thy rage display thy power drink the whole flood the crackling trees devour scorch all the banks and till our voice reclaim exert thunwearyd furies of the flame the power ignipotent her word obeys wide over the plain he pours the boundless blaze at once consumes the dead and dries the soil and the shrunk waters in their chanel boil as when autumnal boreas sweeps the sky and instant blows the watered garden dry so looked the field so whitened was the ground while vulcan breathed the fiery blast around swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys along the margin winds the running blaze the trees in flaming rows to ashes turn the flowery lotos and the tamrisk burn broad elm and cypress rising in a spire the watery willows hiss before the fire now glow the waves the fishes pant for breath the eels lie twisting in the pangs of death now flounce aloft now dive the scaly fry or gasping turn their bellies to the sky at length the river reared his languid head and thus shortpanting to the god he said o vulcan oh what power resists thy might i faint i sink unequal to the fight  i yield  let ilion fall if fate decree  ah  bend no more thy fiery arms on me he ceased wide conflagration blazing round the bubbling waters yield a hissing sound as when the flames beneath a caldron rise to melt the fat of some rich sacrifice amid the fierce embrace of circling fires the waters foam the heavy smoke aspires so boils the imprisoned flood forbid to flow and choked with vapors feels his bottom glow to juno then imperial queen of air the burning river sends his earnest prayer ah why saturnia must thy son engage me only me with all his wastfull rage on other gods his dreadful arm employ for mightier gods assert the cause of troy submissive i desist if thou command but ah withdraw this alldestroying hand hear then my solemn oath to yield to fate unaided ilion and her destined state till greece shall gird her with destructive flame and in one ruin sink the trojan name his warm entreaty touched saturnias ear she bade thignipotent his rage forbear recall the flame nor in a mortal cause infest a god thobedient flame withdraws again the branching streams begin to spread and soft remurmur in their wonted bed while these by junos will the strife resign the warring gods in fierce contention join rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms with horrid clangor shock thaetherial arms heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound and wide beneath them groans the rending ground jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries and views contending gods with careless eyes the power of battles lifts his brazen spear and first assaults the radiant queen of war what moved thy madness thus to disunite ethereal minds and mix all heaven in fight what wonder this when in thy frantic mood thou drovst a mortal to insult a god thy impious hand tydides javelin bore and madly bathed it in celestial gore he spoke and smote the loudresounding shield which bears joves thunder on its dreadful field the adamantine aegis of her sire that turns the glancing bolt and forked fire then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand a stone the limit of the neighboring land there fixed from eldest times black craggy vast this at the heavenly homicide she cast thundering he falls a mass of monstrous size and sevn broad acres covers as he lies the stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound loud over the fields his ringing arms resound the scornful dame her conquest views with smiles and glorying thus the prostrate god reviles have thou not yet insatiate fury known how far minervas force transcends thy own juno whom thou rebellious dare withstand corrects thy folly thus by pallas hand thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace and partial aid to troys perfidious race the goddess spoke and turned her eyes away that beaming round diffused celestial day joves cyprian daughter stooping on the land lent to the wounded god her tender hand slowly he rises scarcely breathes with pain and propt on her fair arm forsakes the plain this the bright empress of the heavens surveyed and scoffing thus to wars victorious maid lo what an aid on marss side is seen the smiles and loves unconquerable queen mark with what insolence in open view she moves let pallas if she dares pursue minerva smiling heard the pair oertook and slightly on her breast the wanton struck she unresisting fell her spirits fled on earth together lay the lovers spread and like these heros be the fate of all  minerva cries who guard the trojan wall to grecian gods such let the phrygian be so dread so fierce as venus is to me then from the lowest stone shall troy be moved  thus she and juno with a smile approved meantime to mix in more than mortal fight the god of ocean dares the god of light what sloth has seized us when the fields around ring with conflicting powers and heaven returns the sound shall ignominious we with shame retire no deed performed to our olympian sire come prove thy arm for first the war to wage suits not my greatness or superior age rash as thou art to prop the trojan throne forgetful of my wrongs and of thy own and guard the race of proud laomedon have thou forgot how at the monarchs prayer we shared the lengthened labors of a year troy walls i raised for such were joves commands and yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves along fair idas vales and pendent groves but when the circling seasons in their train brought back the grateful day that crowned our pain with menace stern the fraudful king defied our latent godhead and the prize denied mad as he was he threatened servile bands and doomed us exiles far in barbarous lands incensed we heavnward fled with swiftest wing and destined vengeance on the perjured king do thou for this afford proud ilion grace and not like us infest the faithless race like us their present future sons destroy and from its deep foundations heave their troy apollo thus to combat for mankind ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind for what is man calamitous by birth they owe their life and nourishment to earth like yearly leaves that now with beauty crowned smile on the sun now wither on the ground to their own hands commit the frantic scene nor mix immortals in a cause so mean then turns his face farbeaming heavenly fires and from the senior power submiss retires him thus retreating artemis upbraids the quiverd huntress of the sylvan shades and is it thus the youthful phoebus flies and yields to oceans hoary sire the prize how vain that martial pomp and dreadful show of pointed arrows and the silver bow now boast no more in yon celestial bower thy force can match the great earthshaking power silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid not so saturnia bore the vaunting maid but furious thus what insolence has driven thy pride to face the majesty of heaven what though by jove the female plague designed fierce to the feeble race of womankind the wretched matron feels thy piercing dart thy sexes tyrant with a tygers heart what though tremendous in the woodland chase thy certain arrows pierce the savage race how dares thy rashness on the powers divine employ those arms or match thy force with mine learn hence no more unequal war to wage  she said and seized her wrists with eager rage these in her left hand locked her right untied the bow the quiver and its plumy pride about her temples flies the busy bow now here now there she winds her from the blow the scattering arrows rattling from the case drop round and idly mark the dusty place swift from the field the baffled huntress flies and scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes so when the falcon wings her way above to the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove not fated yet to die there safe retreats yet still her heart against the marble beats to her latona hasts with tender care whom hermes viewing thus declines the war how shall i face the dame who gives delight to him whose thunders blacken heaven with night go matchless goddess triumph in the skies and boast my conquest while i yield the prize he spoke and past latona stooping low collects the scattered shafts and fallen bow that glittering on the dust lay here and there dishonored relics of dianas war then swift pursued her to the blessed abode where all confused she sought the sovereign god weeping she grasped his knees the ambrosial vest shook with her sighs and panted on her breast the sire superior smiled and bade her show what heavenly hand had caused his daughters woe abashed she names his own imperial spouse and the pale crescent fades upon her brows thus they above while swiftly gliding down apollo enters ilions sacred town the guardian god now trembled for her wall and feared the greeks though fate forbade her fall back to olympus from the wars alarms return the shining bands of gods in arms some proud in triumph some with rage on fire and take their thrones around thaethereal sire through blood throdeath achilles still proceeds over slaughtered heroes and over rolling steeds as when avenging flames with fury driven on guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven the pale inhabitants some fall some fly and the red vapors purple all the sky so raged achilles death and dire dismay and toils and terrors filled the dreadful day high on a turret hoary priam stands and marks the waste of his destructive hands views from his arm the trojans scattered flight and the near hero rising on his sight no stop no check no aid with feeble pace and settled sorrow on his aged face fast as he could he sighing quits the walls and thus descending on the guards he calls you to whose care our city gates belong set wide your portals to the flying throng for lo he comes with unresisted sway he comes and desolation marks his way but when within the walls our troops take breath lock fast the brazen bars and shut out death thus charged the reverend monarch wide were flung the opening folds the sounding hinges rung phoebus rushed forth the flying bands to meet struck slaughter back and covered the retreat on heaps the trojans crowd to gain the gate and gladsome see their last escape from fate thither all parched with thirst a heartless train hoary with dust they beat the hollow plain and gasping panting fainting labor on with heavier strides that lengthen towered the town enraged achilles follows with his spear wild with revenge insatiable of war then had the greeks eternal praise acquired and troy inglorious to her walls retired but apollo he the god who darts ethereal flame shot down to save her and redeem her fame to young agenor force divine he gave  antenors offspring haughty bold and brave in aid of him beside the beech he sat and wrapped in clouds restrained the hand of fate when now the generous youth achilles spies thick beats his heart the troubled motions rise so ere a storm the waters heave and roll he stops and questions thus his mighty soul what shall i fly this terror of the plain like others fly and be like others slain vain hope to shun him by the selfsame road yon line of slaughtered trojans lately trod no with the common heap i scorn to fall  what if they passed me to the trojan wall while i decline to yonder path that leads to idas forests and surrounding shades so may i reach concealed the cooling flood from my tired body wash the dust and blood as soon as night her dusky veil extends return in safety to my trojan friends what if  but wherefore all this vain debate stand i to doubt within the reach of fate even now perhaps ever yet i turn the wall the fierce achilles sees me and i fall such is his swiftness it is in vain to fly and such his valor that who stands must die however it is better fighting for the state here and in public view to meet my fate yet sure he too is mortal he may feel like all the sons of earth the force of steel one only soul informs that dreadful frame and joves sole favor gives him all his fame he said and stood collected in his might and all his beating bosom claimed the fight so from some deepgrown wood a panther starts roused from his thicket by a storm of darts untaught to fear or fly he hears the sounds of shouting hunters and of clamorous hounds though struck though wounded scarce perceives the pain and the barbd javelin stings his breast in vain on their whole war untamed the savage flies and tears his hunter or beneath him dies not less resolved antenors valiant heir confronts achilles and awaits the war disdainful of retreat highheld before his shield a broad circumference he bore then graceful as he stood in act to throw the lifted javelin thus bespoke the foe how proud achilles glories in his fame and hopes this day to sink the trojan name beneath her ruins know that hope is vain a thousand woes a thousand toils remain parents and children our just arms employ and strong and many are the sons of troy great as thou art even thou may stain with gore these phrygian fields and press a foreign shore he said with matchless force the javelin flung smote on his knee the hollow cuishes rung beneath the pointed steel but safe from harms he stands impassive in the ethereal arms then fiercely rushing on the daring foe his lifted arm prepares the fatal blow but jealous of his fame apollo shrouds the godlike trojan in a veil of clouds safe from pursuit and shut from mortal view dismissed with fame the favored youth withdrew meanwhile the god to cover their escape assumes agenors habit voice and shape flies from the furious chief in this disguise the furious chief still follows where he flies now over the fields they stretch with lengthened strides now urge the course where swift scamander glides the god now distant scarce a stride before tempts his pursuit and wheels about the shore while all the flying troops their speed employ and pour on heaps into the walls of troy no stop no stay no thought to ask or tell who escaped by flight or who by battle fell twas tumult all and violence of flight and sudden joy confused and mixed affright pale troy against achilles shuts her gate and nations breathe delivered from their fate observations on the twentyfirst book observations on the twentyfirst book i this book is entirely different from all the foregoing though it be a battle it is entirely of a new and surprising kind diversified with a vast variety of imagery and description the scene is totally changed he paints the combat of his hero with the rivers and describes a battle amidst an inundation it is observable that though the whole war of the iliad was upon the banks of these rivers homer has artfully left out the machinery of rivergods in all the other battles to aggrandize this of his hero there is no book of the poem that has more force of imagination or in which the great and inexhausted invention of our author is more powerfully exerted after this description of an inundation there follows a very beautiful contrast in that of the drought the part of achilles is admirably sustained and the new strokes which homer gives to his picture are such as are derived from the very source of his character and finish the entire draught of this hero  how far all that appears wonderful or extravagant in this episode may be reconciled to probability truth and natural reason will be considered in a distinct note on that head the reader may find it on      ii verse   xanthus immortal progeny of jove the river is here said to be the son of jupiter on account of its being supplied with waters that fall from jupiter that is from heaven eustathius  iii verse    as the scorched locusts etc eustathius observes that several countries have been much infested with armies of locusts and that to prevent their destroying the fruits of the earth the countrymen by kindling large fires drove them from their fields the locusts to avoid the intense heat were forced to cast themselves into the water from this observation the poet draws his allusion which is very much to the honor of achilles since it represents the trojans with respect to him as no more than so many insects  the same commentator takes notice that because the island of cyprus in particular was used to practice this method with the locusts some authors have conjectured that homer was of that country but if this were a sufficient reason for such a supposition he might be said to be born in almost all the countries of the world since he draws his observations from the customs of them all  we may hence account for the innumerable armies of these locusts mentioned among the plagues of egypt without having recourse to an immediate creation as some good men have imagined whereas the miracle indeed consists in the wonderful manner of bringing them upon the egyptians i have often observed with pleasure the similitude which many of homers expressions bear with the holy scriptures and that the oldest writer in the world except moses often speaks in the idiom of moses thus as the locusts in exodus are said to be driven into the seas so in homer they are forced into a river  iv verse  0 so the huge dolphin etc it is observable with what justness the author diversifies his comparisons according to the different scenes and elements he is engaged in achilles has been hitherto on the land and compared to land animals a lion etc now he is in the water the poet derives his images from thence and likens him to a dolphin eustathius  v verse    now tired with slaughter this is admirably well suited to the character of achilles his rage bears him headlong on the enemy he kills all that oppose him and stops not till nature itself could not keep pace with his anger he had determined to reserve twelve noble youths to sacrifice them to the manes of patroclus but his resentment gives him no time to think of them till the hurry of his passion abates and he is tired with slaughter without this circumstance i think an objection might naturally be raised that in the time of a pursuit achilles gave the enemy too much leisure to escape while he busied himself with tying these prisoners though it is not absolutely necessary to suppose he did this with his own hands  vi verse    twelve chosen youths this piece of cruelty in achilles has appeared shocking to many and indeed is what i think can only be excused by considering the ferocious and vindictive spirit of this hero it is however certain that the cruelties exercised on enemies in war were authorized by the military laws of those times nay religion itself became a sanction to them it is not only the fierce achilles but the pious and religious aeneas whose very character is virtue and compassion that reserves several young unfortunate captives taken in battle to sacrifice them to the manes of his favorite hero aen  0      sulmone creatos quattuor hic juvenes totidem quos educat ufens viventes rapit inferias quos immolet umbris captivoque rogi perfundat sanguine flammas and aen       vinxerat and post terga manus quos mitteret umbris inferias caeso sparsuros sanguine flammam and what is very particular the latin poet expresses no disapprobation of the action which the grecian does in plain terms speaking of this in iliad            vii verse    the young lycaon etc homer has a wonderful art and judgment in contriving such incidents as set the characteristick qualities of his heroes in the highest point of light there is hardly any in the whole iliad more proper to move pity than this circumstance of lycaon or to raise terror than this view of achilles it is also the finest picture of them both imaginable we see the different attitude of their persons and the different passions which appeared in their countenances at first achilles stands erect with surprise in his looks at the sight of one whom he thought it impossible to find there while lycaon is in the posture of a suppliant with looks that plead for compassion with one hand holding the heros lance and his knee with theother afterward when at his death he lets go the spear and places himself on his knees with his arms extended to receive the mortal wound how lively and how strongly is this painted i believe every one perceives the beauty of this passage and allows that poetry at least in homer is truly a speaking picture  viii verse    etc the speeches of lycaon and achilles it is impossible for any thing to be better imagined than these two speeches that of lycaon is moving and compassionate that of achilles haughty and dreadful the one pleads with the utmost tenderness the other denies with the utmost sternness one would think it impossible to amass so many moving arguments in so few words as those of lycaon he forgets no circumstance to soften his enemys anger he flatters the memory of patroclus is afraid of being thought too nearly related to hector and would willingly put himself upon him as a suppliant and consequently as an inviolable person but achilles is immovable his resentment makes him deaf to entreaties and it must be remembered that anger not mercy is his character  i must confess i could have wished achilles had spared him there are so many circumstances that speak in his favor that he deserved his life had he not asked it in terms a little too abject  there is an air of greatness in the conclusion of the speech of achilles which strikes me very much he speaks very unconcernedly of his own death and upbraids his enemy for asking life so earnestly a life that was of so much less importance than his own  ix verse     the day shall come  when by the spear the arrow or the dart this is not spoken at random but with an air of superiority when achilles says he shall fall by an arrow a dart or a spear he insinuates that no man will have the courage to approach him in a close fight or engage him hand to hand eustathius  x verse     your living coursers glut his gulphs in vain it was an ancient custom to cast living horses into the sea and into rivers to honor as it were by these victims the rapidity of their streams this practice continued a long time and history supplies us with examples of it aurelius victor says of pompey the younger cum mari feliciter uteretur neptuni se filium confessus est eumque bobus auratis and equo placavit he offered oxen in sacrifice and threw a living horse into the sea as appears from dion which is perfectly conformable to this of homer eustath dacier  xi verse     with fury swells the violated flood the poet has been preparing us for the episode of the river xanthus ever since the beginning of the last book and here he gives us an account why the river wars upon achilles it is not only because he is a river of troas but as eustathius remarks because it is in defense of a man that was descended from a brotherriver god he was angry too with achilles on another account because he had choked up his current with the bodies of his countrymen the trojans  xii verse     from rich paeonia s  etc in the catalogue pyraechmes is said to be commander of the paeonians where they are described as bowmen but here they are said to be armed with spears and to have asteropaens for their general eustathius tells us some critics asserted that this line in the cat      followed  but i see no reason for such an assertion homer has expressly told us in this speech that it was but ten days since he came to the aid of troy he might be made general of the paeonians upon the death of pyraechmes who was killed in the sixteenth book why also might not the paeonians as well as teucer excel in the management both of the bow and the spear  xiii verse     deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear even to the middle eathed   it was impossible for the poet to give us a greater idea of the strength of achilles than he has by this circumstance his spear pierced so deep into the ground that another hero of great strength could not disengage it by repeated efforts but immediately after achilles draws it with the utmost ease how prodigious was the force of that arm that could drive at one throw a spear half way into the earth and then with a touch release it  xiv verse     now bursting on his head etc there is a great beauty in the versification of this whole passage in homer some of the verses run hoarse full and sonorous like the torrent they describe others by their broken cadences and sudden stops image the difficulty labor and interruption of the heros march against it the fall of the elm the tearing up of the bank the rushing of the branches in the water are all put into such words that almost every letter corresponds in its sound and echoes to the sense of each particular  xv verse     bridgd the rough flood across   if we had no other account of the river xanthus but this it were alone sufficient to show that the current could not be very wide for the poet here says that the elm stretched from bank to bank and as it were made a bridge over it the suddenness of this inundation perfectly well agrees with a narrow river  xvi verse     leaped from the chanel eustathius recites a criticism on this verse in the original the word  signifies stagnum palus a standingwater now this is certainly contrary to the idea of a river which always implies a current to solve this says that author some have supposed that the tree which lay across the river stopped the flow of the waters and forced them to spread as it were into a pool others dissatisfied with this solution think that a mistake is crept into the text and that instead of  should be inserted  but i do not see the necessity of having recourse to either of these solutions for why may not the word  signify here the chanel of the river as it evidently does in the    th verse and nothing being more common than to substitute a part for the whole why may not the chanel be supposed to imply the whole river  xvii verse   0 as when a peasant to his garden brings etc this changing of the character is very beautiful no poet ever knew like homer to pass from the vehement and the nervous to the gentle and the agreeable such transitions when properly made give a singular pleasure as when in music a master passes from the rough to the tender demetrius phalereus who only praises this comparison for its clearness has not sufficiently recommended its beauty and value virgil has transferred it into his first book of the georgicks  0  deinde satis fluvium inducit rivosque sequentes et cum exustus ager morientibus aestuat herbis ecce supercilio clivosi tramitis undam elicit illa cadens raucum per levia murmur saxa ciet scatebrisque arentia temperat arva dacier  xviii verse     oh had i died in fields of battle warm etc nothing is more agreeable than this wish to the heroic character of achilles glory is his prevailing passion he grieves not that he must die but that he should die unlike a man of honor virgil has made use of the same thought in the same circumstance where aeneas is in danger of being drowned aen       o terque quaterque beati queis ante ora patrum trojae sub moenibus altis contigit oppetere o danaum fortissime gentis tydide mean iliacis occumbere campis non potuisse tuaque animam hanc effundere dextra   lucan in the fifth book of his pharsalia representing caesar in the same circumstance has i think yet farther the character of ambition and a boundless thirst of glory in his hero when after he has repined in the same manner with achilles he acquiesces at last in the reflection of the glory he had already acquired  licet ingentes abruperit actus festinata dies fatis sat magna peregi arctoas domui gentes inimica subegi arma manu vidit magnum mihi roma secundum and only wishes that his obscure fate might be concealed in the view that all the world might still fear and expect him  lacerum retinete cadaver fluctibus in mediis desint mihi busta rogusque dum metuar semper terraque expecter ab omni   xix verse  0  while vulcan breathed the fiery blast around it is in the original      the epithet given to vulcan in this verse as well as in the    th  has no sort of allusion to the action described for what has his wisdom or knowledge to do with burning up the river xanthus this is usual in our author and much exclaimed against by his modern antagonists whom mr boileau very well answers it is not so strange in homer to give these epithets to persons upon occasions which can have no reference to them the same is frequent in modern languages in which we call a man by the name of saint when we speak of any action of his that has not the least regard to his sanctity as when we say for example that st paul held the garments of those who stoned st stephen  xx verse     as when the flames beneath a caldron rise it is impossible to render literally such passages with any tolerable beauty these ideas can never be made to shine in english some particularities cannot be preserved but the greek language gives them luster the words are noble and musical    all therefore that can be expected from a translator is to preserve the meaning of the simile and embellish it with some words of affinity that carry nothing low in the sense or sound  xxi verse     and soft remurmur in their native bed here ends the episode of the riverfight and i must here lay before the reader my thoughts upon the whole of it which appears to be in part an allegory and in part a true history nothing can give a better idea of homers manner of enlivening his inanimate machines and of making the plainest and simplest incidents noble and poetical than to consider the whole passage in the common historical sense which i suppose to be no more than this there happened a great overflow of the river xanthus during the seige which very much incommoded the assailants this gave occasion for the fiction of an engagement between achilles and the rivergod xanthus calling simois to assist him implies that these two neighboring rivers joined in the inundation pallas and neptune relieve achilles that is pallas or the wisdom of achilles found some means to divert the waters and turn them into the sea wherefore neptune the god of it is feigned to assist him jupiter and juno by which are understood the aerial regions consent to aid achilles this may signify that after this great flood their happened a warm dry windy season which assuaged the waters and dried the ground and what makes this in a manner plain is that juno which signifies the air promises to send the north and west winds to distress the river xanthus being consumed by vulcan that is dried up with heat prays to juno to relieve him what is this but that the drought having almost drunk up his streams he has recourse to the air for rains to resupply his current or perhaps the whole may signify no more than that achilles being on the farther side of the river plunged himself in to pursue the enemy that in this adventure he run the risk of being drowned that to save himself he laid hold on a fallen tree which served to keep him afloat that he was still carried down the stream to the place where was the confluence of the two rivers which is expressed by the one calling the other to his aid and that when he came nearer the sea  neptune he found means by his prudence pallas to save himself from his danger  if the reader still should think the fiction of rivers speaking and fighting is too bold the objection will vanish by considering how much the heathen mythology authorizes the representation of rivers as persons nay even in old historians nothing is more common than stories of rapes committed by rivergods and the fiction was no way unpresidented after one of the same nature so well known as the engagement between hercules and the river achelous  xxii verse     jove as his sport the dreadful scene descries and views contending gods with careless eyes i was at a loss for the reason why jupiter is said to smile at the discord of the gods till i found it in eustathius jupiter says he who is the lord of nature is well pleased with the war of the gods that is of earth sea and air etc because the harmony of all beings arises from that discord thus earth is opposite to water air to earth and water to them all and yet from this opposition arises that discordant concord by which all nature subsists thus heat and cold moist and dry are in a continual war yet upon this depends the fertility of the earth and the beauty of the creation so that jupiter who according to the greeks is the soul of all may well be said to smile at this contention  xxiii verse     the power of battles etc the combat of mars and pallas is plainly allegorical justice and wisdom demanded that an end should be put to this terrible war the god of war opposes this but is worsted eustathius says that this holds forth the opposition of rage and wisdom and no sooner has our reason subdued one temptation but another succeeds to reinforce it thus venus succors mars the poet seems farther to insinuate that reason when it resists a temptation vigorously easily overcomes it so it is with the utmost facility that pallas conquers both mars and venus he adds that pallas retreated from mars in order to conquer him this shows us that the best way to subdue a temptation is to retreat from it  xxiv verse     then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand a stone etc   the poet has described many of his heroes in former parts of his poem as throwing stones of enormous bulk and weight but here he rises in his image he is describing a goddess and has found a way to make that action excel all human strength and be equal to a deity  virgil has imitated this passage in his twelfth book and applied it to turnus but i cannot help thinking that the action in a mortal is somewhat extravagantly imagined what principally renders it so is an addition of two lines to this simile which he borrows from another part of homer only with this difference that whereas homer says no two men could raise such a stone virgil extends it to twelve  saxum circumspicit ingens saxum antiquum ingens campo quod forte jacebat limes agro positus litem ut discerneret arvis there is a beauty in the repetition of saxum ingens in the second line it makes us dwell upon the image and gives us leisure to consider the vastness of the stone the other two lines are as follow vix illud lecti bis sex cervice subirent qualia nunc hominum producit corpora tellus may i be allowed to think they are not so well introduced in virgil for it is just after turnus is described as weakened and oppressed with his fears and ill omens it exceeds probability and turnus methinks looks more like a knight errant in a romance than an hero in an epick poem  xxv verse  0  the god of ocean and the god of light the interview between neptune and apollo is very judiciously in this place enlarged upon by our author the poem now draws to a conclusion the trojans are to be punished for their perjury and violence homer accordingly with a poetical justice sums up the evidence against them and represents the very founder of troy as an injurious person there have been several references to this story since the beginning of the poem but he forbore to give it at large till near the end of it that it might be fresh upon the memory and show the trojans deserve the punishment they are about to suffer  eustathius gives the reason why apollo assists the trojans though he had been equally with neptune affronted by laomedon this proceeded from the honors which apollo received from the posterity of laomedon troy paid him no less worship than cilla or tenedos and by these means won him over to a forgiveness but neptune still was slighted and consequently continued an enemy to the whole race  the same author gives us various opinions why neptune is said to have built the trojan wall and to have been defrauded of his wages some say that laomedon sacrilegiously took away the treasures out of the temples of apollo and neptune to carry on the fortifications from whence it was fabled that neptune and apollo built the walls others will have it that two of the workmen dedicated their wages to apollo and neptune and that laomedon detained them so that he might in some sense be said to defraud the deities themselves by withholding what was dedicated to their temples  the reason why apollo is said to have kept the herds of laomedon is not so clear eustathius observes that all plagues first seize upon the fourfooted creation and are supposed to arise from this deity thus apollo in the first book sends the plague into the grecian army the ancients therefore made him to preside over cattle that by preserving them from the plague mankind might be safe from infectious diseases others tell us that this employment is ascribed to apollo because he signifies the sun now the sun clothes the pastures with grass and herbs so that apollo may be said himself to feed the cattle by supplying them with food upon either of these accounts laomedon may be said to be ungrateful to that deity for raising no temple to his honor  it is observable that homer in this story ascribes the building of the wall to neptune only i should conjecture the reason might be that troy being a seaport town the chief strength of it depended upon its situation so that the sea was in a manner a wall to it upon this account neptune may not improbably be said to have built the wall  xxvi verse     for what is man etc the poet is very happy in interspersing his poem with moral sentences in this place he steals away his reader from war and horror and gives him a beautiful admonition of his own frailty shall i says apollo contend with thee for the sake of man man who is no more than a leaf of a tree now green and flourishing but soon withered away and gone the son of sirach has an expression which very much resembles this ecclus xiv    as the green leaves upon a thick tree some fall and some grow so is the generation of flesh and blood one comes to an end and one is born  xxvii verse     and from the senior god submiss retires two things hinder homer from making neptune and apollo fight first because having already described the fight between vulcan and xanthus he has nothing farther to say here for it is the same conflict between humidity and dryness secondly apollo being the same with destiny and the ruin of the trojans being concluded upon and decided that god can no longer defer it dacier  xxviii verse     the female plague  fierce to the feeble race of womankind etc the words in the original are though jupiter has made you a lion to women the meaning of this is that diana was terrible to that sex as being the same with the moon and bringing on the pangs of childbirth or else that the ancients attributed all sudden deaths of women to the darts of diana as of men to those of apollo which opinion is frequently alluded to in homer eustathius  xxix verse   0 whom hermes viewing thus declines the war it is impossible that mercury should encounter latona such a fiction would be unnatural he being a planet and she representing the night for the planets owe all their luster to the shades of the night and then only become visible to the world eustathius  xxx verse     she said and seized her wrists etc i must confess i am at a loss how to justify homer in every point of these combats of the gods when diana and juno are to fight juno calls her an impudent bitch  when they fight she boxes her soundly and sends her crying and trembling to heaven as soon as she comes thither jupiter falls a laughing at her indeed the rest of the deities seem to be in a merry vein during all the action pallas beats mars and laughs at him jupiter sees them in the same merry mood juno when she had cuffd diana is not more serious in short unless there be some depths that i am not able to fathom homer never better deserved than in this place the censure past upon him by the ancients that as he raised the characters of his men up to gods so he sunk those of gods down to men  yet i think it but reasonable to conclude from the very absurdity of all this supposing it had no hidden meaning or allegory that there must therefore certainly be some nor do i think it any inference to the contrary that it is too obscure for us to find out the remoteness of our times must necessarily darken yet more and more such things as were mysteries at first not that it is at all impossible notwithstanding their present darkness but they might then have been very obvious as it is certain allegories ought to be disguised but not obscured an allegory should be like a veil over a beautiful face so fine and transparent as to show the very charms it covers  xxxi verse  0  as when avenging flames with fury driven on guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven this passage may be explained two ways each very remarkable first by taking this fire for a real fire sent from heaven to punish a criminal city of which we have example in holy writ hence we find that homer had a notion of this great truth that god sometimes exerts his judgments on whole cities in this signal and terrible manner or if we take it in the other sense simply as a fire thrown into a town by the enemies who assault it and only expressed thus by the author in the same manner as jeremy makes the city of jerusalem say when the chaldaeans burnt the temple the lord from above has sent fire into my bones lament i    yet still thus much will appear understood by homer that the fire which is cast into a city comes not properly speaking from men but from god who delivers it up to their fury dacier  xxxii verse     high on a turret hoary priam etc the poet still raises the idea of the courage and strength of his hero by making priam in a terror that he should enter the town with the routed troops for if he had not surpassed all mortals what could have been more desirable for an enemy than to have let him in and then destroyed him  here again there was need of another machine to hinder him from entering the city for achilles being vastly speedier than those he pursued he must necessarily overtake some of them and the narrow gates could not let in a body of troops without his mingling with the hindmost the story of agenor is therefore admirably contrived and apollo who was to take care that the fatal decrees should be punctually executed interposes both to save agenor and troy for achilles might have killed agenor and still entered with the troops if apollo had not diverted him by the pursuit of that phantom agenor opposed himself to achilles only because he could not do better for he sees himself reduced to a dilemma either ingloriously to perish among the fugitives or hide himself in the forest both which were equally unsafe therefore he is purposely inspired with a generous resolution to try to save his countrymen and as the reward of that service is at last saved himself  xxxiii verse     what shall i fly etc this is a very beautiful soliloquy of agenor such a one as would naturally arise in the soul of a brave man going upon a desperate enterprise he weighs every thing in the balance of reason he sets before himself the baseness of flight and the courage of his enemy till at last the thirst of glory preponderates all other considerations from the conclusion of this speech it is evident that the story of achilles his being invulnerable except in the heel is an invention of latter ages for had he been so there had been nothing wonderful in his character eustathius  xxxiv verse  0  meanwhile the god to cover their escape etc the poet makes a double use of this fiction of apollos deceiving achilles in the shape of agenor by these means he draws him from the pursuit and gives the trojans time to enter the city and at the same time brings agenor handsomely off from the combat the moral of this fable is that destiny would not yet suffer troy to fall  eustathius fancies that the occasion of the fiction might be this agenor fled from achilles to the banks of xanthus and might there conceal himself from the pursuer behind some covert that grew on the shores this perhaps might be the whole of the story so plain a narration would have passed in the mouth of an historian but the poet dresses it in fiction and tells us that apollo or destiny concealed him in a cloud from the sight of his enemy  the same author farther observes that achilles by an unseasonable piece of vainglory in pursuing a single enemy gives time to a whole army to escape he neither kills agenor nor overtakes the trojans  finis
