a treatise concerning the principles of human knowledge  part i  wherein the chief causes of error and difficulty in the sciences with the grounds of skepticism atheism and irreligion are inquired into  by george berkeley m a fellow of trinitycollege dublin  dvblin printed by aaron rhames for jeremy pepyat bookseller in skinnerrow    0  to the right honorable thomas earl of pembroke etc knight of the most noble order of the garter and one of the lords of her majestys most honorable privy council my lord you will perhaps wonder that an obscure person who has not the honor to be known to your lordship should presume to address you in this manner but that a man who has written something with a design to promote useful knowledge and religion in the world should make choice of your lordship for his patron will not be thought strange by any one that is not altogether unacquainted with the present state of the church and learning and consequently ignorant how great an ornament and support you are to both yet nothing could have induced me to make you this present of my poor endeavors were i not encouraged by that candor and native goodness which is so bright a part in your lordships character i might add my lord that the extraordinary favor and bounty you have been pleased to show toward our society gave me hopes you would not be unwilling to countenance the studies of one of its members these considerations determined me to lay this treatise at your lordships feet and the rather because i was ambitious to have it known that i am with the truest and most profound respect on account of that learning and virtue which the world so justly admires in your lordship  my lord your lordships most humble and most devoted servant george berkeley  the preface what i here make public has after a long and scrupulous inquiry seemed to me evidently true and not unuseful to be known particularly to those who are tainted with skepticism or want a demonstration of the existence and immateriality of god or the natural immortality of the soul whether it be so or no i am content the reader should impartially examine since i do not think my self any farther concerned for the success of what i have written than as it is agreeable to truth but to the end this may not suffer i make it my request that the reader suspend his judgment till he has once at least read the whole through with that degree of attention and thought which the subject matter shall seem to deserve for as there are some passages that taken by themselves are very liable nor could it be remedied to gross misinterpretation and to be charged with most absurd consequences which nevertheless upon an entire perusal will appear not to follow from them so likewise tho the whole should be read over yet if this be done transiently it is very probable my sense may be mistaken but to a thinking reader i flatter my self it will be throughout clear and obvious as for the characters of novelty and singularity which some of the following notions may seem to bear it is i hope needless to make any apology on that account he must surely be either very weak or very little acquainted with the sciences who shall reject a truth that is capable of demonstration for no other reason but because it is newly known and contrary to the prejudices of mankind thus much i thought fit to premise in order to prevent if possible the hasty censures of a sort of men who are too apt to condemn an opinion before they rightly comprehend it  errata page lin  0    for one read own       for should r

abstract in one sense as when i consider some particular parts or qualities separated from others with which tho they are united in some object yet it is possible they may really exist without them but i deny that i can abstract from one another or conceive separately those qualities which it is impossible should exist so separated or that i can frame a general notion by abstracting from particulars in the manner aforesaid which two last are the proper acceptations of abstraction  introduction   philosophy being nothing else but the study of wisdom and truth it may with reason be expected that those who have spent most time and pains in it should enjoy a greater calm and serenity of mind a greater clearness and evidence of knowledge and be less disturbed with doubts and difficulties than other men yet so it is we see the illiterate bulk of mankind that walk the highroad of plain common sense and are governed by the dictates of nature for the most part easy and undisturbed to them nothing that is familiar appears unaccountable or difficult to comprehend they complain not of any want of evidence in their senses and are out of all danger of becoming skeptics but no sooner do we depart from sense and instinct to follow the light of a superior principle to reason meditate and reflect on the nature of things but a thousand scruples spring up in our minds concerning those things which before we seemed fully to comprehend prejudices and errors of sense do from all parts discover themselves to our view and endeavoring to correct these by reason we are insensibly drawn into uncouth paradoxes difficulties and inconsistences which multiply and grow upon us as we advance in speculation till at length having wandered through many intricate mazes we find our selves just where we were or which is worse sit down in a forelorn skepticism    the cause of this is thought to be the obscurity of things or the natural weakness and imperfection of our understandings it is said the faculties we have are few and those designed by nature for the support and pleasure of life and not to penetrate into the inward essence and constitution of things besides the mind of man being finite when it treats of things which partake of infinity it is not to be wondered at if it run into absurdities and contradictions out of which it is impossible it should ever extricate it self it being of the nature of infinite not to be comprehended by that which is finite    but perhaps we may be too partial to our selves in placing the fault originally in our faculties and not rather in the wrong use we make of them it is a hard thing to suppose that right deductions from true principles should ever end in consequences which cannot be maintained or made consistent we should believe that god has dealt more bountifully with the sons of men than to give them a strong desire for that knowledge which he had placed quite out of their reach this were not agreeable to the wonted indulgent methods of providence which whatever appetites it may have implanted in the creatures does usually furnish em with such means as if rightly made use of will not fail to satisfy them upon the whole i am inclined to think that the far greater part if not all of those difficulties which have hitherto amused philosophers and blocked up the way to knowledge are entirely owing to our selves that we have first raised a dust and then complain we cannot see    my purpose therefore is to try if i can discover what those principles are which have introduced all that doubtfulness and uncertainty those absurdities and contradictions into the several sects of philosophy insomuch that the wisest men have thought our ignorance incurable conceiving it to arise from the natural dullness and limitation of our faculties and surely it is a work well deserving our pains to make a strict inquiry concerning the first principles of human knowledge to sift and examine them on all sides especially since there may be some grounds to suspect that those lets and difficulties which stay and embarrass the mind in it is search after truth do not spring from any darkness and intricacy in the objects or natural defect in the understanding so much as from false principles which have been insisted on and might have been avoided    how difficult and discouraging soever this attempt may seem when i consider what a number of very great and extraordinary men have gone before me in the like designs yet i am not without some hopes upon the consideration that the largest views are not always the clearest and that he who is shortsighted will be obliged to draw the object nearer and may perhaps by a close and narrow survey discern that which had escaped far better eyes    in order to prepare the mind of the reader for the easier conceiving what follows i thought it proper to premise somewhat by way of introduction concerning the nature and abuse of language but the unraveling this matter leads me in some measure to anticipate my design by taking notice of what seems to have had a chief part in rendering speculation intricate and perplexed and to have occasioned innumerable errors and difficulties in almost all parts of knowledge and that is the opinion that the mind has a power of framing abstract ideas or notions of things he who is not a perfect stranger to the writings and disputes of philosophers must needs acknowledge that no small part of them are spent about abstract ideas these are in a more especial manner thought to be the object of those sciences which go by the name of logic and metaphysics and of all that which passes under the notion of the most abstracted and sublime learning in all which one shall scarce find any question handled in such a manner as does not suppose their existence in the mind and that it is well acquainted with them    it is agreed on all hands that the qualities or modes of things do never really exist each of them apart by it self and separated from all others but are mixed as it were and blended together several in the same object but we are told the mind being able to consider each quality singly or abstracted from those other qualities with which it is united does by that means frame to it self abstract ideas for example there is perceived by sight an object extended colored and moved this mixed or compound idea the mind resolving into it is simple constituent parts and viewing each by it self exclusive of the rest does frame the abstract ideas of extension color and motion not that it is possible for color or motion to exist without extension but only that the mind can frame to it self by abstraction the idea of color exclusive of extension and of motion exclusive of both color and extension    again the mind having observed that in the particular extensions perceived by sense there is something common and alike in all and some other things peculiar as this or that figure or magnitude which distinguish them one from another it considers apart or singles out by it self that which is common making thereof a most abstract idea of extension which is neither line surface nor solid nor has any figure or magnitude but is an idea entirely prescinded from all these so likewise the mind by leaving out of the particular colors perceived by sense that which distinguishes them one from another and retaining that only which is common to all makes an idea of color in abstract which is neither red nor blue nor white etc and in like manner by considering motion abstractedly not only from the body moved but likewise from the figure it describes and all particular directions and velocities the abstract idea of motion is framed which equally corresponds to all particular motions whatsoever that may be perceived by sense    and as the mind frames to it self abstract ideas of qualities or modes so does it by the same precision or mental separation attain abstract ideas of the more compounded beings which include several coexistent qualities for example the mind having observed that peter james and john etc resemble each other in certain common agreements of shape and other qualities leaves out of the complex or compounded idea it has of peter james etc that which is peculiar to each retaining only what is common to all and so makes an abstract idea wherein all the particulars equally partake abstracting entirely from and cutting off all those circumstances and differences which might determine it to any particular existence and after this manner it is said we come by the abstract idea of man or if you please humanity or humane nature wherein it is true there is included color because there is no man but has some color but then it can be neither white nor black nor any particular color because there is no one particular color wherein all men partake so likewise there is included stature but then it is neither tall stature nor low stature nor yet middle stature but something abstracted from all these and so of the rest moreover there being a great variety of other creatures that partake in some parts but not all of the complex idea of man the mind leaving out those parts which are peculiar to men and retaining those only which are common to all the living creatures frames the idea of animal which abstracts not only from all particular men but also all birds beasts fishes and insects the constituent parts of the abstract idea of animal are body life sense and spontaneous motion by body is meant body without any particular shape or figure there being no one shape or figure common to all animals without covering either of hair or feathers or scales etc nor yet naked hair feathers scales and nakedness being the distinguishing properties of particular animals and for that reason left out of the abstract idea upon the same account the spontaneous motion must be neither walking nor flying nor creeping it is nevertheless a motion but what that motion is it is not easy to conceive   0 whether others have this wonderful faculty of abstracting their ideas they best can tell for my self i dare be confident i have it not i have indeed a faculty of imagining or representing to my self the ideas of those particular things i have perceived and of variously compounding and dividing them i can imagine a man with two heads or the upper parts of a man joined to the body of a horse i can consider the hand the eye the nose each by it self abstracted or separated from the rest of the body but then whatever hand or eye i imagine it must have some particular shape and color likewise the idea of man that i frame to my self must be either of a white or a black or a tawny a straight or a crooked a tall or a low or a middlesized man i cannot by any effort of thought conceive the abstract idea above described and it is equally impossible for me to form the abstract idea of motion distinct from the body moving and which is neither swift nor slow curvilinear nor rectilinear and the like may be said of all other abstract general ideas whatsoever and there is grounds to think most men will acknowledge themselves to be in my case the generality of men which are simple and illiterate never pretend to abstract notions it is said they are difficult and not to be attained without pains and study we may therefore reasonably conclude that if such there be they are confined only to the learned     i proceed to examine what can be alleged in defense of the doctrine of abstraction and try if i can discover what it is that inclines the men of speculation to embrace an opinion so remote from common sense as that seems to be there has been a late excellent and deservedly esteemed philosopher who no doubt has given it very much countenance by seeming to think the having abstract general ideas is what puts the widest difference in point of understanding betwixt man and beast the having of general ideas  says he is that which puts a perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes and is an excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no means attain unto for it is evident we observe no footsteps in them of making use of general signs for universal ideas from which we have reason to imagine that they have not the faculty of abstracting or making general ideas since they have no use of words or any other general signs and a little after therefore i think we may suppose that it is in this that the species of brutes are discriminated from men and it is that proper difference wherein they are wholly separated and which at last widens to so wide a distance for if they have any ideas at all and are not bare machines as some would have em we cannot deny em to have some reason it seems as evident to me that they do some of em in certain instances reason as that they have sense but it is only in particular ideas just as they receive them from their senses they are the best of em tied up within those narrow bounds and have not as i think the faculty to enlarge em by any kind of abstraction essay on hum vnderst b   c     0 and    i readily agree with this learned author that the faculties of brutes can by no means attain to abstraction but then if this be made the distinguishing property of that sort of animals i fear a great many of those that pass for men must be reckoned into their number the reason that is here assigned why we have no grounds to think brutes have abstract general ideas is that we observe in em no use of words or any other general signs which is built on this supposition viz that the making use of words implys the having general ideas from which it follows that men who use language are able to abstract or generalize their ideas that this is the sense and arguing of the author will further appear by his answering the question he in another place puts since all things that exist are only particulars how come we by general terms his answer is words become general by being made the signs of general ideas essay on hum vnderst b   c     to this i cannot assent being of opinion that a word becomes general by being made the sign not of an abstract general idea but of several particular ideas any one of which it indifferently suggests to the mind for example when it is said the change of motion is proportional to the impressed force or that whatever has extension is divisible these propositions are to be understood of motion and extension in general and nevertheless it will not follow that they suggest to my thoughts an idea of motion without a body moved or any determinate direction velocitie etc or that i must conceive an abstract general idea of extension which is neither line surface nor solid neither great nor small black white nor red etc it is only implied that whatever motion i consider whether it be swift or slow perpendicular horizontal or oblique or in whatever object the axiom concerning it holds equally true as does the other of every particular extension it matters not whether line surface or solid whether of this or that magnitude or figure etc     by observing how ideas become general we may the better judge how words are made so and here it is to be noted that i do not deny absolutely there are general ideas but only that there are any abstract general ideas for in the passages we have quoted wherein there is mention of general ideas it is always supposed that they are formed by abstraction after the manner set forth in sect viii and ix now if we will annex a meaning to our words and speak only of what we can conceive i believe we shall acknowledge that an idea which considered in it self is particular becomes general by being made to represent or stand for all other particular ideas of the same sort to make this plain by an example suppose a geometrician is demonstrating the method of cutting a line in two equal parts he draws for instance a black line of an inch in length this which in it self is a particular line is nevertheless with regard to it is signification general since as it is there used it represents all particular lines whatsoever so that what is demonstrated of it is demonstrated of all lines or in other words of a line in general and as that particular line becomes general by being made a sign so the name line which taken absolutely is particular by being a sign is made general and as the former owes its generality not to its being the sign of an abstract or general line but of all particular right lines that may possibly exist so the latter must be thought to derive its generality from the same cause namely the various particular lines which it indifferently denotes     to give the reader a yet clearer view of the nature of abstract ideas and the uses they are thought necessary to i shall add one more passage out of the essay on human understanding which is as follows abstract ideas are not so obvious or easy to children or the yet unexercised mind as particular ones if they seem so to grown men it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so for when we nicely reflect upon them we shall find that general ideas are fictions and contrivances of the mind that carry difficulty with them and do not so easily offer themselves as we are apt to imagine for example does it not require some pains and skill to form the general idea of a triangle which is yet none of the most abstract comprehensive and difficult for it must be neither oblique nor rectangle neither equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once in effect it is something imperfect that cannot exist an idea wherein some parts of several different and inconsistent ideas are put together it is true the mind in this imperfect state has need of such ideas and makes all the haste to them it can for the convenience of communication and enlargement of knowledge to both which it is naturally very much inclined but yet one has reason to suspect such ideas are marks of our imperfection at least this is enough to show that the most abstract and general ideas are not those that the mind is first and most easily acquainted with nor such as its earliest knowledge is conversant about b   c     if any man has the faculty of framing in his mind such an idea of a triangle as is here described it is in vain to pretend to dispute him out of it nor would i go about it all i desire is that the reader would fully and and certainly inform himself whether he has such an idea or no and this methinks can be no hard task for any one to perform what more easy than for any one to look a little into his own thoughts and there try whether he has or can attain to have an idea that shall correspond with the description that is here given of the general idea of a triangle which is neither oblique nor rectangle equilateral equicrural nor scalenon but all and none of these at once     much is here said of the difficulty that abstract ideas carry with them and the pains and skill requisite to the forming them and it is on all hands agreed that there is need of great toil and labor of the mind to emancipate our thoughts from paticular objects and raise them to those sublime speculations that are conversant about abstract ideas from all which the natural consequence should seem to be that so difficult a thing as the forming abstract ideas was not necessary for communication which is so easy and familiar to all sorts of men but we are told if they seem obvious and easy to grown men it is only because by constant and familiar use they are made so now i would fain know at what time it is men are employed in surmounting that difficulty and furnishing themselves with those necessary helps for discourse it cannot be when they are grown up for then it seems they are not conscious of any such painstaking it remains therefore to be the business of their childhood and surely the great and multiplied labor of framing abstract notions will be found a hard task for that tender age is it not a hard thing to imagine that a couple of children cannot prate together of their sugarplumbs and rattles and the rest of their little trinkets till they have first tacked together numberless inconsistencies and so framed in their minds abstract general ideas and annexed them to every common name they make use of     nor do i think them a whit more needful for the enlargement of knowledge than for communication it is i know a point much insisted on that all knowledge and demonstration are about universal notions to which i fully agree but then it does not appear to me that those notions are formed by abstraction in the manner premised universality so far as i can comprehend not consisting in the absolute positive nature or conception of any thing but in the relation it bears to the particulars signified or represented by it by virtue whereof it is that things names or notions being in their own nature particular are rendered universal thus when i demonstrate any proposition concerning triangles it is to be supposed that i have in view the universal idea of a triangle which ought not to be understood as if i could frame an idea of a triangle which was neither equilateral nor scalenon etc but only that the particular triangle i consider whether of this or that sort it matters not does equally stand for and represent all rectilinear triangles whatsoever and is in that sense universal all which seems very plain and not to include any difficulty in it     but here it will be demanded how we can know any proposition to be true of all particular triangles except we have first seen it demonstrated of the abstract idea of a triangle which equally agrees to all for because a property may be demonstrated to agree to some one particular triangle it will not thence follow that it equally belongs to any other triangle which in all respects is not the same with it for example having demonstrated that the three angles of an isosceles rectangular triangle are equal to two right ones i cannot therefore conclude this affection agrees to all other triangles which have neither a right angle nor two equal sides it seems therefore that to be certain this proposition is universally true we must either make a particular demonstration for every particular triangle which is impossible or once for all demonstrate it of the abstract idea of a triangle in which all the particulars do indifferently partake and by which they are all equally represented to which i answer that though the idea i have in view whilst i make the demonstration be for instance that of an isosceles rectangular triangle whose sides are of a determinate length i may nevertheless be certain it extends to all other rectilinear triangles of what sort or bigness soever and that because neither the right angle nor the equality nor determinate length of the sides are at all concerned in the demonstration it is true the diagram i have in view includes all these particulars but then there is not the least mention made of em in the proof of the proposition it is not said the three angles are equal to two right ones because one of them is a right angle or because the sides comprehending it are of the same length which sufficiently shows that the right angle might have been oblique and the sides unequal and for all that the demonstration have held good and for this reason it is that i conclude that to be true of any obliquangular or scalenon which i had demonstrated of a particular rightangled equicrural triangle and not because i demonstrated the proposition of the abstract idea of a triangle     it were an endless as well as an useless thing to trace the schoolmen those great masters of abstraction through all the manifold inextricable labyrinths of error and dispute which their doctrine of abstract natures and notions seems to have led em into what bickerings and controversies and what a learned dust have been raised about those matters and what mighty advantage has been from thence derived to mankind are things at this day too clearly known to need being insisted on and it had been well if the ill effects of that doctrine were confined to those only who make the most avowed profession of it when men consider the great pains industry and parts that have for so many ages been laid out on the cultivation and advancement of the sciences and that notwithstanding all this the far greater part of them remain full of darkness and uncertainty and disputes that are like never to have an end and even those that are thought to be supported by the most clear and cogent demonstrations contain in them paradoxes which are perfectly irreconcilable to the understandings of men and that taking altogether a very small portion of them does supply any real benefit to mankind otherwise than by being an innocent diversion and amusement i say the consideration of all this is apt to throw them into a despondency and perfect contempt of all study but this may perhaps cease upon a view of the false principles that have obtained in the world amongst all which there is none methinks has a more wide and extended sway over the thoughts of speculative men than that we have been endeavoring to overthrow     i come now to consider the source of this prevailing notion and that seems to me to be language and surely nothing of less extent than reason it self could have been the source of an opinion so universally received the truth of this appears as from other reasons so also from the plain confession of the ablest patrons of abstract ideas who acknowledge that they are made in order to naming from which it is a clear consequence that if there had been no such thing as speech or universal signs there never had been any thought of abstraction see b   c      and elsewhere of the essay on human understanding but let us examine the manner wherein words have contributed to the origin of that mistake first then it is thought that every name has or ought to have one only precise and settled signification which inclines men to think there are certain abstract determinate ideas that constitute the true and only immediate signification of each general name and that it is by the mediation of these abstract ideas that a general name comes to signify any particular thing whereas in truth there is no such thing as one precise and definite signification annexed to any general name they all signifying indifferently a great number of particular ideas all which does evidently follow from what has been already said and will clearly appear to any one by a little reflection to this i doubt not it will be objected that every name that has a definition is is thereby restrained to one certain signification e g a triangle is defined to be a plain surface comprehended by three right lines by which that name is limited to denote one certain idea and no other to which i answer that in the definition it is not said whether the surface be great or small black or white etc nor whether the sides are long or short equal ot unequal nor with what angles they are inclined to each other in all which there may be great variety and consequently there is no one settled idea which limits the signification of the word triangle it is one thing for to keep a name constantly to the same definition and another to make it stand every where for the same idea the one is necessary the other useless and impracticable     but to give a farther account how words came to produce the doctrine of abstract ideas it must be observed that it is a received opinion that language has no other end but the communicating our ideas and that every significant name stands for an idea this being so and it being withal certain that names which yet are not thought altogether insignificant do not always mark out particular conceivable ideas it is straightway concluded that they stand for abstract notions that there are many names in use amongst speculative men which do not always suggest to others determinate particular ideas or in truth any thing at all is what no body will deny and a little attention will discover that it is not necessary even in the strictest reasonings significant names which stand for ideas should every time they are used excite in the understanding the ideas they are made to stand for in reading and discoursing names being for the most part used as letters are in algebra in which tho a particular quantity be marked by each letter yet to proceed right it is not requisite that in every step each letter suggest to your thoughts that particular quantity it was appointed to stand for   0 besides the communicating of ideas marked by words is not the chief and only end of language as is commonly supposed there are other ends as the raising of some passion the exciting to or deterring from an action the putting the mind in some particular disposition to which the former is in many cases barely subservient and sometimes entirely omitted when these can be obtained without it as i think does not infrequently happen in the familiar use of language i entreat the reader to reflect with himself and see if it does not often happen either in hearing or reading a discourse that the passions of fear love hatred admiration disdain etc arise immediately in his mind upon the perception of certain words without any ideas coming between at first indeed the words might have ocasiond ideas that were fitting to produce those emotions but if i mistake not it will be found that when language is once grown familiar the hearing of the sounds or sight of the characters is often immediately attended with those passions which at first were wont to be produced by the intervention of ideas that are now quite omitted may we not for example be affected with the promise of a good thing tho we have not an idea of what it is or is not the being threatened with danger sufficient to excite a dread tho we think not of any particular evil likely to befall us nor yet frame to our selves an idea of danger in abstract if any one shall join ever so little reflection of his own to what has been said i believe it will evidently appear to him that general names are often used in the propriety of language without the speakers designing them for marks of ideas in his own which he would have em raise in the mind of the hearer even proper names themselves do not seem always spoken with a design to bring into our view the ideas of those individuals that are supposed to be marked by them for example when a schoolman tells me aristotle has said it all i conceive he means by it is to dispose me to embrace his opinion with the deference and submission which custom has annexed to that name and this effect is often so instantly produced in the minds of those who are accustomed to resign their judgment to the authority of that philosopher as it is impossible any idea either of his person writings or reputation should go before so close and immediate a connection may custom establish betwixt the very word aristotle and the motions of assent and reverence in the minds of some men innumerable examples of this kind may be given but why should i insist on those things which every ones experience will i doubt not plentifully suggest unto him     we have i think shown the impossibility of abstract ideas we have considered what has been said for them by their ablest patrons and endeavored to show they are of no use for those ends to which they are thought necessary and lastly we have traced them to the source from whence they flow which appears evidently to be language it cannot be denied that words are of excellent use in that by their means all that stock of knowledge which has been purchased by the joint labors of inquisitive men in all ages and nations may be drawn into the view and made the possession of one single person but most parts of knowledge have been so strangely perplexed and darkened by the abuse of words and general ways of speech wherein they are delivered that it may almost be made a question whether language has contributed more to the hindrance or advancement of the sciences since therefore words are so apt to impose on the understanding i am resolved in my inquiries to make as little use of them as possibly i can whatever ideas i consider i shall endeavor to take them bare and naked into my view keeping out of my thoughts so far as i am able those names which long and constant use has so strictly united with them from which i may expect to derive the following advantages     first i shall be sure to get clear of all controversies purely verbal the springing up of which weeds in almost all the sciences has been a main hindrance to the growth of true and sound knowledge secondly this seems to be a sure way to extricate my self out of that fine and subtle net of abstract ideas which has so miserably perplexed and entangled the minds of men and that with this peculiar circumstance that by how much the finer and more curious was the wit of any man by so much the deeper was he like to be ensnared and faster held therein thirdly so long as i confine my thoughts to my own ideas divested of words i do not see how i can easily be mistaken the objects i consider i clearly and adequately know i cannot be deceived in thinking i have an idea which i have not it is not possible for me to imagine that any of my own ideas are alike or unlike that are not truly so to discern the agreements or disagreements there are between my ideas to see what ideas are included in any compound idea and what not there is nothing more requisite than an attentive perception of what passes in my own understanding     but the attainment of all these advantages does presuppose an entire deliverance from the deception of words which i dare hardly promise my self so difficult a thing it is to dissolve an union so early begun and confirmed by so long a habit as that betwixt words and ideas which difficulty seems to have been very much increased by the doctrine of abstraction for so long as men thought abstract ideas were annexed to their words it does not seem strange that they should use words for ideas it being found an impracticable thing to lay aside the word and retain the abstract idea in the mind which in it self was perfectly inconceivable this seems to me the principal cause why those men who have so emphatically recommended to others the laying aside all use of words in their meditations and contemplating their bare ideas have yet failed to perform it themselves of late many have been very sensible of the absurd opinions and insignificant disputes which grow out of the abuse of words and in order to remedy these evils they advise well that we attend to the ideas signified and draw off our attention from the words which signify them but how good soever this advice may be they have given others it is plain they could not have a due regard to it themselves so long as they thought the only immediate use of words was to signify ideas and that the immediate signification of every general name was a determinate abstract idea     but these being known to be mistakes a man may with greater ease prevent his being imposed on by words he that knows he has no other than particular ideas will not puzzle himself in vain to find out and conceive the abstract idea annexed to any name and he that knows names do not always stand for ideas will spare himself the labor of looking for ideas where there are none to be had it were therefore to be wished that every one would use his utmost endeavors to obtain a clear view of the ideas he would consider separating from them all that dress and encumbrance of words which so much contribute to blind the judgment and divide the attention in vain do we extend our view into the heavens and pry into the entrails of the earth in vain do we consult the writings of learned men and trace the dark footsteps of antiquity we need only draw the curtain of words to behold the fairest tree of knowledge whose fruit is excellent and within the reach of our hand     unless we take care to clear the first principles of knowledge from the embarras and delusion of words we may make infinite reasonings upon them to no purpose we may draw consequences from consequences and be never the wiser the farther we go we shall only lose our selves the more irrecoverably and be the deeper entangled in difficulties and mistakes whoever therefore designs to read the following sheets i do entreat him that he would make my words the occasion of his own thinking and endeavor to attain the same train of thoughts in reading that i had in writing them by this means it will be easy for him to discover the truth or falsity of what i say he will be out of all danger of being deceived by my words and i do not see how he can be led into an error by considering his own naked undisguised ideas  of the principles of human knowledge part i   it is evident to any one who takes a survey of the objects of human knowledge that they are either ideas actually imprinted on the senses or else such as are perceived by attending to the passions and operations of the mind or lastly ideas formed by help of memory and imagination either compounding dividing or barely representing those originally perceived in the aforesaid ways by sight i have the ideas of light and colors with their several degrees and variations by touch i perceive hard and soft heat and cold motion and resistance etc and of all these more and less either as to quantity or degree smelling furnishes me with odors the palate with tastes and hearing conveys sounds to the mind in all their variety of tone and composition and as several of these are observed to accompany each other they come to be marked by one name and so to be reputed as one thing thus for example a certain color taste smell figure and consistence having been observed to go together are accounted one distinct thing signified by the name apple other collections of ideas constitute a stone a tree a book and the like sensible things which as they are pleasing or disagreeable excite the passions of love hatred joy grief etc    but besides all that endless variety of ideas or objects of knowledge there is likewise something which knows or perceives them and exercises diverse operations as willing imagining remembering etc about them this perceiving active being is what i call mind spirit soul or my self by which words i do not denote any one of my ideas but a thing entirely distinct from them wherein they exist or which is the same thing whereby they are perceived for the existence of an idea consists in being perceived    that neither our thoughts nor passions nor ideas formed by the imagination exist without the mind is what every body will allow and to me it is no less evident that the various sensations or ideas imprinted on the sense however blended or combined together that is whatever objects they compose cannot exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving them i think an intuitive knowledge may be obtained of this by any one that shall attend to what is meant by the term exist when applied to sensible things the table i write on i say exists i e i see and feel it and if i were out of my study i should say it existed meaning thereby that if i was in my study i might perceive it or that some other spirit actually does perceive it there was an odor i e it was smelt there was a sound i e it was heard a color or figure and it was perceived by sight or touch this is all that i can understand by these and the like expressions for as to what is said of the absolute existence of unthinking things without any relation to their being perceived that is to me perfectly unintelligible their esse is percipi nor is it possible they should have any existence out of the minds or thinking things which perceive them    it is indeed an opinion strangely prevailing amongst men that houses mountains rivers and in a word all sensible objects have an existence natural or real distinct from their being perceived by the understanding but with how great an assurance and acquiescence soever this principle may be entertained in the world yet whoever shall find in his heart to call it in question may if i mistake not perceive it to involve a manifest contradiction for what are the forementioned objects but the things we perceive by sense and what i pray you do we perceive besides our own ideas or sensations and is it not plainly repugnant that any one of these or any combination of them should exist unperceived    if we thoroughly examine this tenent it will perhaps be found at bottom to depend on the doctrine of abstract ideas for can there be a nicer strain of abstraction then to distinguish the existence of sensible objects from their being perceived so as to conceive them existing unperceived light and colors heat and cold extension and figures in a word the things we see and feel what are they but so many sensations notions ideas or impressions on the sense and is it possible to separate even in thought any of these from perception for my part i might as easily divide a thing from it self i may indeed divide in my thoughts or conceive apart from each other those things which perhaps i never perceived by sense so divided thus i imagine the trunk of a human body without the limbs or conceive the smell of a rose without thinking on the rose it self so far i will not deny i can abstract if that may properly be called abstraction which extends only to the conceiving separately such objects as it is possible may really exist or be actually perceived asunder but my conceiving or imagining power does not extend beyond the possibility of real existence or perception hence as it is impossible for me to see or feel any thing without an actual sensation of that thing so is it impossible for me to conceive in my thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct from the sensation or perception of it in truth the object and the sensation are the same thing and cannot therefore be abstracted from each other    some truths there are so near and obvious to the mind that a man need only open his eyes to see em such i take this important one to be viz that all the choir of heaven and furniture of the earth in a word all those bodies which compose the mighty frame of the world have not any subsistence without a mind that their esse is to be perceived or known that consequently so long as they are not actually perceived by me or do not exist in my mind or that of any other created spirit they must either have no exsistence at all or else subsist in the mind of some eternal spirit it being perfectly unintelligible and involving all the absurdity of abstraction to attribute to any single part of them an existence independent of a spirit to make this appear with all the light and evidence of an axiom it seems sufficient if i can but awaken the reflection of the reader that he may take an impartial view of his own meaning and turn his thoughts upon the subject it self free and disengaged from all embarras of words and prepossession in favor of received mistakes    from what has been said it is evident there is not any other substance than spirit or that which perceives but for the fuller demonstration of this point let it be considered the sensible qualities are color figure motion smell taste etc i e the idea perceived by sense now for an idea to exist in an unperceiving thing is a manifest contradiction for to have an idea is all one as to perceive that therefore wherein color figure etc exist must perceive them hence it is clea there can be no unthinking substance or substratum of those ideas    but say you tho the ideas themselves do not exist without the mind yet there may be things like them whereof they are copies or resemblances which things exist without the mind in an unthinking substance i answer an idea can be like nothing but an idea a color or figure ca be like nothing but another color o figure if we look but never so little into our thoughts we shall find it impossible for us to conceive a likeness except only between our ideas again i ask whether those supposed originals or external things of which our ideas are the pictures or representations be themselves perceivable or no if they are then they are ideas and we have gained our point but if you say they are not i appeal to any one whether it be sense to assert a color is like something which is invisible hard or soft like something which is intangible and so of the rest    some there are who make a distinction betwixt primary and secondary qualities by the former they mean extension figure motion rest solidity or impenetrability and number by the latter they denote all other sensible qualities as colors sounds tastes etc the ideas we have of these they acknowledge not to be the resemblances of any thing existing without the mind or unperceived but they will have our ideas of the primary qualities to be patterns or images of things which exist without the mind in an unthinking substance which they call matter by matter therefore we are to understand an inert senseless substance in which extension figure motion etc do actually subsist but it is evident from what we have already shown that extension figure and notion are only ideas existing in the mind and that an idea can be like nothing but another idea and that consequently neither they nor their archetypes can exist in an unperceiving substance hence it is plain that the very notion of what is called matter or corporeal substance involves a contradiction in it insomuch that i should not think it necessary to spend more time in exposing it is absurdity but because the tenent of the existence of matter seems to have taken so deep a root in the minds of philosophers and draws after it so many ill consequences l choose rather to be thought prolix and tedious than omit any thing that might conduce to the full discovery and extirpation of that prejudice   0 they who assert that figure motion and the rest of the primary or original qualities do exist without the mind in unthinking substances do at the same time acknowledge that colors sounds heat cold etc do not which they tell us are sensations existing in the mind alone that depend on and are occasioned by the different size texture motion etc of the minute particles of matter this they take for an undoubted truth which they can demonstrate beyond all exception now if it be certain that those original qualities are inseparably united with the other sensible qualities and not even in thought capable of being abstracted from them it plainly follows that they exist only in the mind but i desire any one to reflect and try whether he can by any abstraction of thought conceive the extension and motion of a body without all other sensible qualities for my own part i see evidently that it is not in my power to frame an idea of a body extended and moving but i must withal give it some color or other sensible quality which is acknowlegd to exist only in the mind in short extension figure and motion abstracted from all other qualities are inconceivable where therefore the other sensible qualities are there must these be also i e in the mind and no where else     again great and small swift and slow are allowed to exist no where without the mind being entirely relative and changing as the frame or position of the organs of sense varies the extension therefore which exists without the mind is neither great nor small the motion neither swift nor slow that is they are nothing at all but say you they are extension in general and motion in general thus we see how much the tenent of extended moveable substances existing without the mind depends on that strange doctrine of abstract ideas and here i cannot but remark how nearly the vague and indeterminate description of matter or corporeal substance which the modern philosophers are run into by their own principles resembles that antiquated and so much ridiculed notion of materia prima to be met with in aristotle and his followers without extension solidity cannot be conceived since therefore it has been shown that extension exists not in an unthinking substance the same must also be true of solidity     that number is entirely the creature of the mind even tho the other qualities be allowed to exist without will be evident to whoever considers that the same thing bears a different denomination of number as the mind views it with different respects thus the same extension is one or three or thirty six according as the mind considers it with reference to a yard a foot or an inch number is so visibly relative and dependent on mens understanding that it is strange to think how any one should give it an absolute existence without the mind we say one book one page one line etc all these are equally unites tho some contain several of the others and in each instance it is plain the unite relates to some particular combination of ideas arbitrarily put together by the mind     unity i know some will have to be a simple or uncompounded idea accompanying all other ideas into the mind that i have any such idea answering the word unity i do not find and if i had methinks i could not miss finding it on the contrary it should be the most familiar to my understanding since if is said to accompany all other ideas and to be perceived by all the ways of sensation and reflection to say no more it is an abstract idea     i shall farther add that after the same manner as modern philosophers prove colors tastes etc to have no existence in matter or without the mind the same thing may be likewise proved of all other sensible qualities whatsoever thus for instance it is said that heat and cold are affections only of the mind and not at all patterns of real beings existing in the corporeal substances which excite them for that the same body which appears cold to one hand seems warm to another now why may we not as well argue that figure and extension are not patterns or resemblances of qualities existing in matter because to the same eye at different stations or eyes of a different texture at the same station they appear various and cannot therefore be the images of any thing settled and determinate without the mind again it is proved that sweetness is not really in the sapid thing because the thing remaining unaltered the sweetness is changed into bitter as in case of a fever or otherwise vitiated palate is it not as reasonable to say that motion is not without the mind since if the succession of ideas in the mind become swifter the motion it is acknowledged shall appear slower without any external alteration     in short let any one consider those arguments which are thought manifestly to prove that colors tastes etc exist only in the mind and he shall find they may with equal force be brought to prove the same thing of extension figure and motion tho it must be confessed this method of arguing does not so much prove that there is no extension color etc in an outward object as that we do not know by sense which is the true extension or color of the object but the arguments foregoing plainly show it to be impossible that any color or extension at all or other sensible quality whatsoever should exist in an unthinking subject without the mind or in truth that there should be any such thing as an outward object     but let us examine a little the received opinion it is said extension is a mode or accident of matter and that matter is the substratum that supports it now i desire that you would explain to me what is meant by matters supporting extension say you i have no idea of matter and therefore cannot explain it i answer tho you have no positive yet if you have any meaning at all you must at least have a relative idea of matter tho you know not what it is yet you must be supposed to know what relation it bears to accidents and what is meant by its supporting them it is evident support cannot here be taken in its usual or literal sense as when we say that pillars support a building in what sense therefore must it be taken for my part i am not able to discover any sense at all that can be applicable to it     if we inquire into what the most accurate philosophers declare themselves to mean by material substance we shall find them acknowledge they have no other meaning annexed to those sounds but the idea of being in general together with the relative notion of its supporting accidents the general idea of being appears to me the most abstract and incomprehensible of all other and as for its supporting accidents this as we have just now observed cannot be understood in the common sense of those words it must therefore be taken in some other sense but what that is they do not explain so that when i consider the two parts or branches which make the signification of the words material substance i am convinced there is no distinct meaning annexed to them but why should we trouble our selves any farther in discussing this material substratum or support of figure and motion etc does it not suppose they have an existence without the mind and is not this a direct repugnancy and altogether inconceivable     but tho it were possible that solid figured moveable substances may exist without the mind corresponding to the ideas we have of bodies yet how is it possible for us to know this either we must know it by sense or by reason as for our senses by them we have the knowledge only of our sensations ideas or those things that are immediately perceived by sense call em what you will but they do not inform us that things exist without the mind or unperceived like to those which are perceived this the materialists themselves acknowledge it remains therefore that if we have any knowledge at all of external things it must be by reason inferring their existence from what is immediately perceived by sense but i do not see what reason can induce us to believe the existence of bodies without the mind from what we perceive since the very patrons of matter themselves do not pretend there is any necessary connection betwixt them and our ideas i say it is granted on all hands and what happens in dreams frenzys and the like puts it beyond dispute that it is possible we might be affected with all the ideas we have now tho there were no bodies existing without resembling them hence it is evident the supposition of external bodies is not necessary for the producing our ideas since it is granted they are produced sometimes and might possibly be produced always in the same order we see them in at present without their concurrence     but tho we might possibly have all our sensations without them yet perhaps it may be thought easier to conceive and explain the manner of their production by supposing external bodies in their likeness rather than otherwise and so it might be at least probable there are such things as bodies that excite their ideas in our minds but neither can this be said for tho we give the materialists their external bodies they by their one confession are never the nearer knowing how our ideas are produced since they own themselves unable to comprehend in what manner body can act upon spirit or how it is possible it should imprint any idea in the mind hence it is evident the production of ideas or sensations in our minds can be no reason why we should suppose matter or corporeal substances since that is acknowlegd to remain equally inexplicable with or without this supposition if therefore it were possible for bodies to exist without the mind yet to hold they do so must needs be a very precarious opinion since it is to suppose without any reason at all that god has created innumerable beings that are entirely useless and serve to no manner of purpose   0 in short tho there were external bodies it is impossible we should ever come to know it and if there were not we should have the very same reasons to think there were that we have now suppose what no one can deny possible an intelligence to be affected with the same train of sensations or ideas that you are imprinted in the same order and with like vividness in his mind i ask whether that intelligence has not all the reason to believe the existence of corporeal substances represented by his ideas and exciting them in his mind that you can possibly have for believing the same thing of this there can be no question which one consideration were enough to make any reasonable person suspect the strength of whatever arguments he may think himself to have for the existence of bodies without the mind     where it necessary to add any farther proof against the existence of matter after what has been said i could instance several of those errors and difficulties not to mention impieties which have sprung from that tenent it has occasioned numberless controversies and disputes in philosophy and not a few of far greater moment in religion but i shall not enter into the detail of them in this place as well because i think arguments a posteriori are unnecessary for confirming what has been if i mistake not sufficiently demonstrated a priori as because i shall hereafter find occasion to speak somewhat of them     i am afraid i have given cause to think i am needlessly prolix in handling this subject for to what purpose is it to dilate on that which may be demonstrated with the utmost evidence in a line or two to any one that is capable of the least reflection it is but looking into your own thoughts and so trying whether you can conceive it possible for a sound or figure or motion or color to exist without the mind or unperceived this easy trial may perhaps make you see that what you contend for is a downright contradiction insomuch that i am content to put the whole upon this issue if you can but conceive it possible for one extended moveable substance or in general for any one idea or any thing like an idea to exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it i shall readily give up the cause and as for all that compages of external bodies you contend for i shall grant you its existence tho you cannot either give me any reason why you believe it exists or assign any use to it when it is supposed to exist i say the bare possibility of your opinions being true shall pass for an argument that it is so     but say you surely there is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees for instance in a park or books existing in a closet and no body by to perceive them i answer you may so there is no difficulty in it but what is all this i beseech you more than framing in your mind certain ideas which you call books and trees and at the same time omitting to frame the idea of any one that may perceive them but do not you your self perceive or think of them all the while this therefore is nothing to the purpose it only shows you have the power of imagining or forming ideas in your mind but it does not show that you can conceive it possible the objects of your thought may exist without the mind to make out this it is necessary that you conceive them existing unconceivd or unthought of which is a manifest repugnancy when we do our utmost to conceive the existence of external bodies we are all the while only contemplating our own ideas but the mind taking no notice of it self is deluded to think it can and does conceive bodies existing unthought of or without the mind tho at the same time they are apprehended by or exist in it self a little attention will discover to any one the truth and evidence of what is here said and make it unnecessary to insist on any other proofs against the existence of material substance     could men but forbear to amuse themselves with words we should i believe soon come to an agreement in this point it is very obvious upon the least inquiry into our own thoughts to know whether it be possible for us to understand what is meant by the absolute existence of sensible objects in themselves or without the mind to me it is evident those words mark out either a direct contradiction or else nothing at all and to convince others of this i know no readier or fairer way than to entreat they would calmly attend to their own thoughts and if by this attention the emptiness or repugnancy of those expressions does appear surely nothing more is requisite for their conviction it is on this therefore that i insist viz that the absolute existence of unthinking things are words without a meaning or which include a contradiction this is what i repeat and inculcate and earnestly recommend to the attentive thoughts of the reader     all our ideas sensations notions or the things which we perceive by whatsoever names they may be distinguished are visibly inactive there is nothing of power or agency included in them so that one idea or object of thought cannot produce or make any alteration in another to be satisfied of the truth of this there is nothing else requisite but a bare observation of our ideas for since they and every part of them exist only in the mind it follows that there is nothing in them but what is perceived but whoever shall attend to his ideas whether of sense or reflection will not perceive in them any power or activity there is therefore no such thing contained in them a little attention will discover to us that the very being of an idea implies passiveness and inertness in it insomuch that it is impossible for an idea to do any thing or strictly speaking to be the cause of any thing neither can it be the resemblance or pattern of any active being as is evident from sect viii whence it plainly follows that extension figure and motion cannot be the cause of our sensations to say therefore that these are the effects of powers resulting from the configuration number motion size etc of corpuscles must certainly be false     we perceive a continual succession of ideas some are anew excited others are changed or totally disappear there is therefore some cause of these ideas whereon they depend and which produces and changes them that this cause cannot be any quality or idea or combination of ideas is clear from the preceding section it must therefore be a substance but it has been shown that there is no corporeal or material substance it remains therefore that the cause of ideas is an incorporeal active substance or spirit     a spirit is one simple undivided active being as it perceives ideas it is called the understanding and as it produces or otherwise operates about them it is called the will hence there can be no idea formed of a soul or spirit for all ideas whatever being passive and inert vid sect xxv they cannot represent unto us by way of image or likeness that which acts a little attention will make it plain to any one that to have an idea which shall be like that active principle of motion and change of ideas is absolutely impossible such is the nature of spirit or that which acts that it cannot be of it self perceived but only by the effects which it produces if any man shall doubt of the truth of what is here delivered let him but reflect and try if he can frame the idea of any power or active being and whether he has ideas of two principal powers marked by the names will and understanding distinct from each other as well as from a third idea of substance or being in general with a relative notion of its supporting or being the subject of the aforesaid powers which is signified by the name soul or spirit this is what some hold but so far as i can see the words will understanding mind soul spirit do not stand for different ideas or in truth for any idea at all but for something which is very different from ideas and which being an agent cannot be like unto or represented by any idea whatsoever     i find i can excite ideas in my mind at pleasure and vary and shift the scene as often as i think fit it is no more than willing and straightway this or that idea arises in my fancy and by the same power it is obliterated and makes way for another this making and unmaking of ideas does very properly denominate the mind active thus much is certain and grounded on experience but when we talk of unthinking agents or of exciting ideas exclusive of volition we only amuse our selves with words     but whatever power i may have over my own thoughts i find the ideas actually perceived by sense have not a like dependence on my will when in broad daylight i open my eyes it is not in my power to choose whether i shall see or no or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves to my view and so likewise as to the hearing and other senses the ideas imprinted on them are not creatures of my will there is therefore some other will or spirit that produces them   0 the ideas of sense are more strong lively and distinct than those of the imagination they have likewise a steddiness order and coherence and are not excited at random as those which are the effects of human wills often are but in a regular train or series the admirable connection whereof sufficiently testifies the wisdom and benevolence of its author now the set rules or established methods wherein the mind we depend on excites in us the ideas of sense are called the laws of nature and these we learn by experience which teaches us that such and such ideas are attended with such and such other ideas in the ordinary course of things     this gives us a sort of foresight which enables us to regulate our actions for the benefit of life and without this we should be eternally at a loss we could not know how to act any thing that might procure us the least pleasure or remove the least pain of sense that food nourishes sleep refreshes and fire warms us that to sow in the seedtime is the way to reap in the harvest and in general that to obtain such or such ends such or such means are conducive all this we know not by discovering any necessary connection between our ideas but only by the observation of the settled laws of nature without which we should be all in uncertainty and confusion and a grown man no more know how to manage himself in the affairs of life than an infant just born     and yet this consistent uniform working which so evidently displays the goodness and wisdom of that governing spirit whose will constitutes the laws of nature is so far from leading our thoughts to him that it rather sends em a wandering after second causes for when we perceive certain ideas of sense constantly followed by other ideas and we know this is not of our own doing we forthwith attribute power and agency to the ideas themselves and make one the cause of another than which nothing can be more absurd and unintelligible thus for example having observed that when we perceive by sight a certain round luminous figure we at the same time perceive by touch the idea or sensation called heat we do from thence conclude the sun to be the cause of heat and in like manner perceiving the motion and collision of bodies to be attended with sound we are inclined to think the latter the effect of the former     the ideas imprinted on the senses by the author of nature are called real things and those excited in the imagination being less regular vivid and constant are more properly termed ideas or images of things which they copy and represent but then our sensations be they never so vivid and distinct are nevertheless ideas i e they exist in the mind or are perceived by it as truly as the ideas of its own framing the ideas of sense are allowed to have more reality in them i e to be more strong orderly and coherent than the creatures of the mind but this is no argument that they exist without the mind they are also less dependent on the spirit or thinking substance which perceives them in that they are excited by the will of another and more powerful spirit yet still they are ideas and certainly no idea whether faint or strong can exist otherwise than in a mind perceiving it     before we proceed any farther it is necessary we spend some time in answering objections which may probably be made against the principles we have hitherto laid down in doing of which if i seem too prolix to those of quick apprehensions i desire i may be excused since all men do not equally apprehend things of this nature and i am willing to be understood by every one first then it will be objected that by the foregoing principles all that is real and substantial in nature is banished out of the world and instead thereof a chimerical scheme of ideas takes place all things that exist exist only in the mind that is they are purely notional what therefore becomes of the sun moon and stars what must we think of houses rivers mountains trees stones nay even of our own bodies are all these but so many chimeras and illusions on the fancy to all which and whatever else of the same sort may be objected i answer that by the principles premised we are not deprived of any one thing in nature whatever we see feel hear or any wise conceive or understand remains as secure as ever and is as real as ever there is a rerum natura and the distinction between realities and chimeras retains its full force this is evident from sect xxix xxx and xxxiii where we have shown what is meant by real things in opposition to chimeras or ideas of our own framing but then they both equally exist in the mind and in that sense are alike ideas     i do not argue against the existence of any one thing that we can apprehend either by sense or reflection that the things i see with my eyes and touch with my hands do exist really exist i make not the least question the only thing whose existence we deny is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance and in doing of this there is no damage done to the rest of mankind who i dare say will never miss it the atheist indeed will want the color of an empty name to support his impiety and the philosophers may possibly find they have lost a great handle for trifling and disputation but that is all the harm that i can see done     if any man thinks we detract from the existence or reality of things he is very far from understanding what has been premised in the plainest terms i could think of take here an abstract of what has been said there are spiritual substances minds or human souls which will or excite ideas in themselves at pleasure but these are faint weak and unsteady in respect of others they perceive by sense which being impressed upon them according to certain rules or laws of nature speak themselves the effects of a mind more powerful and wise than human spirits these latter are said to have more reality in them than the former by which is meant that they are more affecting orderly and distinct and that they are not fictions of the mind perceiving them and in this sense the sun that i see by day is the real sun and that which i imagine by night is the idea of the former in the sense here given of reality it is evident that every vegetable star mineral and in general each part of the mundane system is as much a real being by our principles as by any other whether others mean any thing by the term reality different from what i do i entreat them to look into their own thoughts and see     it will be urged that thus much at least is true viz that we take away all corporeal substances to this my answer is that if the word substance be taken in the vulgar sense for a combination of sensible qualities such as extension solidity weight etc this we cannot be accused of taking away but if it be taken in a phylosophic sense for the support of accidents or qualities without the mind then indeed i acknowledge that we take it away if one may be said to take away that which never had any existence not even in the imagination     but after all say you it sounds very harsh to say we eat and drink ideas and are clothed with ideas i acknowledge it does so the word idea not being used in common discourse to signify the several combinations of sensible qualities which are called things and it is certain that any expression which varies from the familiar use of language will seem harsh and ridiculous but this does not concern the truth of the proposition which in other words is no more than this viz we are fed and clothed with those things which we perceive immediately by our senses the hardness or softness the color taste warmth figure etc which combined together constitute the several sorts of victuals and apparel have been shown to exist only in the mind that perceives them and this is all that is meant by calling em ideas which word if it was as ordinarily used as thing would sound no harsher nor more ridiculous than it i am not for disputing about the propriety but the truth of the expression if therefore you agree with me that we eat and drink and are clad with the immediate objects of sense which cannot exist unperceived or without the mind i shall readily grant it is more proper or conformable to custom that they should be called things rather than ideas     if it be demanded why i make use of the word idea and do not rather in compliance with custom call them things i answer i do it for two reasons first because the term thing in contradistinction to idea is generally supposed to denote somewhat existing without the mind secondly because thing has a more comprehensive signification than idea including spirits or thinking things as well as ideas since therefore the objects of sense exist only in the mind and are withal thoughtless and inactive i chose to mark them by the word idea which implies those properties   0 but say what we can some one perhaps may be apt to reply he will still believe his senses and never suffer any arguments how plausible soever to prevail over the certainty of them be it so assert the evidence of sense as high as you please we are willing to do the same that what i see hear and feel does exist i e is perceived by me i no more doubt than i do of my own being but i do not see how the testimony of sense can be alleged as a proof for the existence of any thing which is not perceived by sense we are not for having any man turn skeptic and disbelieve his senses on the contrary we give them all the stress and assurance imaginable nor are there any principles more opposite to scepticisim than those we have laid down as shall be hereafter clearly shown     secondly it will be objected that there is a great difference betwixt real fire for instance and the idea of fire betwixt dreaming or imagining ones self burnt and actually being so if you suspect it to be only the idea of fire which you see do but put your hand into it and you will be convinced with a witness this and the like may be urged in opposition to our tenants to all which the answer is evident from what has been already said and i shall only add in this place that if real fire be very different from the idea of fire so also is the real pain that it occasions very different from the idea of the same pain and yet no body will pretend that real pain either is or can possibly be in an unperceiving thing or without the mind any more than its idea     thirdly it will be objected that we see things actually without or at a distance from us and which consequently do not exist in the mind it being absurd that those things which are seen at the distance of several miles should be as near to us as our own thoughts in answer to this i desire it may be considered that in a dream we do often perceive things as existing at a great distance off and yet for all that those things are acknowlegd to have their existence only in the mind     but for the fuller clearing of this point it may be worth while to consider how it is that we perceive distance and things placed at a distance by sight for that we should in truth see external space and bodies actually existing in it some nearer others farther off seems to carry with it some opposition to what has been said of their existing no where without the mind the consideration of this difficulty it was that gave birth to my essay toward a new theory of vision which was published not long since wherein it is shown that distance or outness is neither immediately of it self perceived by sight nor yet apprehended or judged of by lines and angles or any thing that has a necessary connection with it but that it is only suggested to our thoughts by certain visible ideas and sensations attending vision which in their own nature have no manner of similitude or relation either with distance or things placed at a distance but by a connection taught us by experience they came to signify and suggest them to us after the same manner that words of any language suggest the ideas they are made to stand for insomuch that a man born blind and afterward made to see would not at first sight think the things he saw to be without his mind or at any distance from him vid sect xli of the forementioned treatise     the ideas of sight and touch make two species entirely distinct and heterogeneous the former are marks and prognostics of the latter that the proper objects of sight neither exist without the mind nor are the images of external things was shown even in that treatise tho throughout the same the contrary be supposed true of tangible objects not that to suppose that vulgar error was necessary for establishing the notion therein laid down but because it was beside my purpose to examine and refute it in a discourse concerning vision so that in strict truth the ideas of sight when we apprehend by them distance and things placed at a distance do not suggest or mark out to us things actually existing at a distance but only admonish us what ideas of touch will be imprinted in our minds at such and such distances of time and in consequence of such or such actions it is i say evident from what has been said in the foregoing parts of this treatise and in sect cxlvii and elsewhere of the essay concerning vision that visible ideas are the language whereby the governing spirit on whom we depend informs us what tangible ideas he is about to imprint upon us in case we excite this or that motion in our own bodies but for a fuller information in this point i refer to the essay it self     fourthly it will be objected that from the foregoing principles it follows things are every moment annihilated and created anew the objects of sense exist only when they are perceived the trees therefore are in the garden or the chairs in the parlour no longer than while there is some body by to perceive them upon shutting my eyes all the furniture in the room is reduced to nothing and barely upon opening em it is again created in answer to all which i refer the reader to what has been said in sect iii iv etc and desire he will consider whether he means any thing by the actual existence of an idea distinct from its being perceived for my part after the nicest inquiry i could make i am not able to discover that any thing else is meant by those words and i once more entreat the reader to sound his own thoughts and not suffer himself to be imposed on by words if he can conceive it possible either for his ideas or their archetypes to exist without being perceived then i give up the cause but if he cannot he will acknowledge it is unreasonable for him to stand up in defense of he knows not what and pretend to charge on me as an absurdity the not assenting to those propositions which at bottom have no meaning in them     it will not be amiss to observe how far the received principles of philosophy are themselves chargeable with those pretended absurdities it is thought strangely absurd that upon closing my eyelids all the visible objects round me should be reduced to nothing and yet is not this what philosophers commonly acknowledge when they agree on all hands that light and colors which alone are the proper and immediate objects of sight are mere sensations that exist no longer than they are perceived again it may to some perhaps seem very incredible that things should be every moment creating yet this very notion is commonly taught in the schools for the schoolmen tho they acknowledge the existence of matter and that the whole mundane fabric is framed out of it are nevertheless of opinion that it cannot subsist without the divine conservation which by them is expounded to be a continual creation     farther a little thought will discover to us that tho we allow the existence of matter or corporeal substance yet it will unavoidably follow from the principles which are now generally admitted that the particular bodies of what kind soever do none of them exist whilst they are not perceived for it is evident from sect xi etc that the matter philosophers contend for is an incomprehensible somewhat which has none of those particular qualities whereby the bodies falling under our senses are distinguished one from another but to make this more plain it must be remarked that the infinite divisibility of matter is now universally allowed at least by the most approved and considerable philosophers who on the received principles demonstrate it beyond all exception hence it follows there is an infinite number of parts in each particle of matter which are not perceived by sense the reason therefore that any particular body seems to be of a finite magnitude or exhibits only a finite number of parts to sense is not because it contains no more since in it self it contains an infinite number of parts but because the sense is not acute enough to discern them in proportion therefore as the sense is rendered more acute it perceives a greater numof parts in the object ie the object appears greater and its figure varies those parts in its extremities which were before unperceivable appearing now to bound it in very different lines and angles from those perceived by an obtuser sense and at length after various changes of size and shape when the sense becomes infinitely acute the body shall seem infinite during all which there is no alteration in the body but only in the sense each body therefore considered in it self is infinitely extended and consequently void of all shape or figure from which it follows that tho we should grant the existence of matter to be never so certain yet it is withal as certain the materialists themselves are by their own principles forced to acknowledge that neither the particular bodies perceived by sense nor any thing like them exists without the mind matter i say and each particle thereof is according to them infinite and shapeless and it is the mind that frames all that variety of bodies which compose the visible world any one whereof does not exist longer than it is perceived     but after all if we consider it the objection proposed in sect xlv will not be found reasonably charged on the principles we have premised so as in truth to make any ojection at all against our notions for tho we hold indeed the objects of sense to be nothing else but ideas which cannot exist nperceivd yet we may not hence conclude they have no existence except only while they are perceived by us since there may be some other spirit that perceives them tho we do not wherever bodies are said to have no existence without the mind i would not be understood to mean this or that particular mind but all minds whatsoever it does not therefore follow from the foregoing principles that bodies are annihilated and created every moment or exist not at all during the intervals between our perception o them     fifthly it may perhaps be objected that if extension and figure exist only in the mind it follows that the mind is extended and figured since extension is a mode or attribute which to speak with the schools is predicated of the subject in which it exists answer those qualities are in the mind only as they are perceived by it that not by way of mode or attribute bu only by way of idea and it no more folows the soul or mind is extended because extension exists in it alone than it does that it is red or blue because those colors are on all hands acknowlegd to exist in it and no where else as to what philosophers say of subject and mode that seems very groundless and unintelligible for instance in this proposition a die is hard extended and square they will have it that the word die denotes a subject or substance distinct from the hardness extension and figure which are predicated of it and in which they exist this i cannot comprehend to me a die seems to be nothing distinct from those things which are termed its modes or accidents and to say a die is hard extended and square is not to attribute those qualities to a subject distinct from and supporting them but only an explication of the meaning of the word die   0 sixthly you will say there have been a great many things explained by matter and motion take away these and you destroy the whole corpuscular philosophy and undermine those mechanical principles which have been applied with so much success to account for the phenomenon in short whatever advances have been made either by ancient or modern philosophers in the study of nature do all proceed on the supposition that corporeal substance or matter does really exist to this i answer that there is not any one phenomenon explained on that supposition which may not as well be explained without it as might easily be made appear by an induction of particulars to explain the phenomena is all one as to show why upon such and such occasions we are affected with such and such ideas but how matter should operate on a spirit or produce any idea in it is what no philosopher will pretend to explain it is therefore evident there can be no use of matter in natural philosophy besides they who attempt to account for things do it not by corporeal substance but by figure motion etc which are in truth no more than mere ideas and therefore cannot be the cause of any thing as has been already shown vid sect xxv     seventhly it will upon this be demanded whether it does not seem absurd to take away natural causes and ascribe every thing to the immediate operation of spirits we must no longer say upon these principles that fire heats or water cools but that a spirit heats etc would not a man be deservedly laughed at who should talk after this manner i answer he would so in such things we ought to think with the learned and speak with the vulgar they who to demonstration are convinced of the truth of the copernican system do nevertheless say the sun rises the sun sets or comes to the meridian and if they affected a contrary style in common talk it would without doubt appear very ridiculous a little reflection on what is here said will make it manifest that the common use of language would receive no manner of alteration or disturbance from the admission of our tenants     in the ordinary affairs of life any phrases may be retained so long as they excite in us proper sentiments or dispositions to act in such a manner as is necessary for our wellbeing how false soever they may be if taken in a strict and speculative sense nay this is unavoidable since propriety being regulated by custom language is suited to the received opinions which are not always the truest hence it is impossible even in the most rigid philosophic reasonings so far to alter the bent and genius of the tongue we speak as never to give a handle for cavillers to pretend difficulties and inconsistencies but a fair and ingenuous reader will collect the sense from the scope and tenor and connection of a discourse making allowances for those unaccurate modes of speech which use has made inevitable     as to the opinion that there are no corporeal causes this has been heretofore maintained by some of the schoolmen as it is of late by others among the modern philosophers who tho they allow matter to exist yet will have god alone to be the immediate efficient cause of all things these men saw that amongst all the objects of sense there was none which had any power or activity included in it and that by consequence this was likewise true of whatever bodies they supposed to exist without the mind like unto the immediate objects of sense but then that they should suppose an innumerable multitude of created beings which they acknowledge are not capable of producing any one effect in nature and which therefore are made to no manner of purpose since god might have done every thing as well without them this i say tho we should allow it possible must yet be a very unaccountable and extravagant supposition     in the eighth place the universal concurrent assent of mankind may be thought by some an invincible argument in behalf of matter or the existence of external things must we suppose the whole world to be mistaken and if so what cause can be assigned of so widespread and predominant an error i answer first that upon a narrow inquiry it will not perhaps be found so many as is imagined do really believe the existence of matter or things without the mind strictly speaking to believe that which involves a contradiction or has no meaning in it is impossible and whether the foregoing expressions are not of that sort i refer it to the impartial examination of the reader in one sense indeed men may be said to believe that matter exists i e they act as if the immediate cause of their sensations which affects them every moment and is so nearly present to them were some senseless unthinking being but that they should clearly apprehend any meaning marked by those words and form thereof a settled speculative opinion is what i am not able to conceive this is not the only instance wherein men impose upon themselves by imagining they believe those propositions they have often heard tho at bottom they have no meaning in them     but secondly tho we should grant a notion to be never so universally and steadfastly adhered to yet this is but a weak argument of its truth to whoever considers what a vast number of prejudices and false opinions are every where embraced with the utmost tenaciousness by the unreflecting which are the fargreater part of mankind there was a time when the antipodes and motion of the earth were looked upon as monstrous absurdities even by men of learning and if it be considered what a small proportion they bear to the rest of mankind we shall find that at this day those notions have gained but a very inconsiderable footing in the world     but it is demanded that we assign a cause of this prejudice and account for its obtaining in the world to this i answer that men knowing they perceived several ideas whereof they themselves were not the authors as not being excited from within nor depending on the operation of their wills this made em maintain those ideas or objects of perception had an existence independent of and without the mind without ever dreaming that a contradiction was involved in those words but philosphers having plainly seen that the immediate objects of perception do not exist without the mind they in some degree corrected the mistake of the vulgar but at the same time run into another which seems no less absurd viz that there are certain objects really existing without the mind or having a subsistence distinct from being perceived of which our ideas are only images or resemblance imprinted by those objects on the mind and this notion of the philosophers ows its origin to the same cause with the former namely their being conscious that they were not the authors of their own sensations which they evidently knew were imprinted from without and which therefore must have some cause distinct from the minds on which they are imprinted     but why they should suppose the ideas of sense to be excited in us by things in their likeness and not rather have recourse to spirit which alone can act may be accounted for first because they were not aware of the repugnancy there is as well in supposing things like unto our ideas existing without as in attributing to them power or activity secondly because the supreme spirit which excites those ideas in our minds is not marked out and limited to our view by any particular finite collection of sensible ideas as human agents are by their size complexion limbs motions etc and thirdly because his operations are regular and uniform whenever the course of nature is interrupted by a miracle men are ready to own the presence of a superior agent but when we see things go on in the ordinary course they do not excite in us any reflection their order and concatenation tho it be an argument of the greatest wisdom power and goodness in their creator is yet so constant and familiar to us that we do not think em the immediate effects of a free spirit especially since inconstancy and mutability in acting tho it be an imperfection is looked on as a mark of freedom     tenthly it will be objected that the notions we advance are inconsistent with several sound truths in philosophy and mathematics for example the motion of the earth is now universally admitted by astronomers as a truth grounded on the clearest and most convincing reasons but on the foregoing principles there can be no such thing for motion being only an idea it follows that if it be not perceived it exists not but the motion of the earth is not perceived by sense i answer that tenent if rightly understood will be found to agree with the principles we have premised for the question whether the earth moves or no amounts in reality to no more than this viz whether we have reason to conclude from what has been observed by astronomers that if we were placed in such and such circumstances and such or such a position and distance both from the earth and sun we should perceive the former to move among the choir of the planets and appearing in all respects like one of them and this by the established rules of nature which we have no reason to mistrust is reasonably collected from the phenomenon     we may from the experience we have had of the train and succession of ideas in our minds often make i will not say uncertain conjectures but sure and well grounded predictions concerning the ideas we shall be affected with pursuant to a great train of actions and be enabled to pass a right judgment of what would have appeared to us in case we were placed in circumstances very different from those we are in at present herein consists the knowledge of nature which may preserve its use and certainty very consistently with what has been said it will be easy to apply this to whatever objections of the like sort may be drawn from the magnitude of the stars or any other discoveries in astronomy or nature   0 in the eleventh place it will be demanded to what purpose serves that curious organization of plants and the admirable mechanism in the parts of animals might not vegetables grow and shoot forth leaves and blossoms and animals perform all their motions as well without as with all that variety of internal parts so elegantly contrived and put together which being ideas have nothing powerful or operative in them nor have any necessary connection with the effects ascribed to them if it be a spirit that immediately produces every effect by a fiat or act of his will we must think all that is fine and artificial in the works whether of man or nature to be made in vain by this doctrine tho an artist has made the spring and wheels and every movement of a watch and adjusted them in such a manner as he knew would produce the motions he designed yet he must think all this done to no purpose and that it is an intelligence which directs the index and points to the hour of the day if so why may not the intelligence do it without his being at the pains of making the movements and putting them together why does not an empty case serve as well as another and how comes it to pass that whenever there is any fault in the going of a watch there is some corresponding disorder to be found in the movements which being mended by a skilful hand all is right again the like may be said of all the clockwork of nature great part whereof is so wonderfully fine and subtle as scarce to be discerned by the best microscope in short it will be asked how upon our principles any tolerable account can be given or any final cause assigned of an innumerable multitude of bodies and machines framed with the most exquisite art which in the common philosophy have very apposite uses assigned them and serve to explain abundance of phenomenon     to all which i answer first that tho there were some difficulties relating to the administration of providence and the uses by it assigned to the several parts of nature which i could not solve by the foregoing principles yet this objection could be of small weight against the truth and certainty of those things which may be proved a priori with the utmost evidence and rigor of demonstration secondly but neither are the received principles free from the like difficulties for it may still be demanded to what end god should take those roundabout methods of effecting things by instruments and machines which no one can deny might have been effected by the mere command of his will without all that apparatus nay if we narrowly consider it we shall find the objection may be retorted with greater force on those who hold the existence of those machines without the mind for it has been made evident that solidity bulk figure motion etc have no activity or efficacy in them so as to be capable of producing any one effect in nature vid sect xxv whoever therefore supposes them to exist allowing the supposition possible when they are not perceived does it manifestly to no purpose since the only use that is assigned to them as they exist unperceived is that they produce those perceivable effects which in truth cannot be ascribed to any thing but spirit     but to come nigher the difficulty it must be observed that tho the fabrication of all those parts and organs be not absolutely necessary to the producing any effect yet it is necessary to the producing of things in a constant regular way according to the laws of nature there are certain general laws that run through the whole chain of natural effects these are learned by the observation and study of nature and are by men applied as well to the framing artificial things for the use and ornament of life as to the explaining the various phenomenon which explication consists only in showing the conformity any particular phenomenon has to the general laws of nature or which is the same thing in discovering the uniformity there is in the production of natural effects as will be evident to whoever shall attend to the several instances wherein philosophers pretend to account for appearances that there is a great and conspicuous use in these regular constant methods of working observed by the supreme agent has been shown in sect xxxi and it is no less visible that a particular size figure motion and disposition of parts are necessary tho not absolutely to the producing any effect yet to the producing it according to the standing mechanical laws of nature thus for instance it cannot be denied that god or the intelligence that sustains and rules the ordinary course of things might if he were minded to produce a miracle cause all the motions on the dialplate of a watch tho no body had ever made the movements and put them in it but yet if he will act agreeably to the rules of mechanism by him for wise ends established and maintained in the creation it is necessary that those actions of the watchmaker whereby he makes the movements and rightly adjusts them precede the production of the aforesaid motions as also that any disorder in them be attended with the perception of some corresponding disorder in the movements which being once corrected all is right again     it may indeed on some occasions be necessary that the author of nature display his overruling power in producing some appearance out of the ordinary series of things such exceptions from the general rules of nature are proper to surprise and awe men into an acknowledgment of the of the divine being but then they are to be used but seldom otherwise there is a plain reason why they should fail of that effect besides god seems to choose the convincing our reason of his attributes by the works of nature which discover so much harmony and contrivance in their make and are such plain indications of wisdom and beneficence in their author rather than to astonish us into a belief of his being by anomalous and surprising events     to set this matter in a yet clearer light i shall observe that what has been objected in sect lx amounts in reality to no more than this ideas are not any how and at random produced there being a certain order and connection between them like to that of cause and effect there are also several combinations of them made in a very regular and artificial manner which seem like so many instruments in the hand of nature that being hid as it were behind the scenes have a secret operation in producing those appearances which are seen on the theater of the world being themselves discernible only to the curious eye of the philosopher but since one idea cannot be the cause of another to what purpose is that connection and since those instruments being barely inefficacious perceptions in the mind are not subservient to the production of natural effects it is demanded why they are made or in other words what reason can be assigned why god should make us upon a close inspection into his works behold so great variety of ideas so artfully laid together and so much according to rule it not being imaginable that he would be at the expense if one may so speak of all that art and regularity to no purpose     to all which my answer is first that the connection of ideas does not imply the relation of cause and effect but only of a mark or sign with the thing signified the fire which i see is not the cause of the pain i suffer upon my approaching it but the mark that forewarns me of it in like manner the noise that i hear is not the effect of this or that motion or collision of the ambient bodies but the sign thereof secondly the reason why ideas are formed into machines i e artificial and regular combinations is the same with that for combining letters into words that a few original ideas may be made to signify a great number of effects and actions it is necessary they be variously combined together and to the end their use be permanent and universal these combinations must be made by rule and with wise contrivance by this means abundance of information is conveyed unto us concerning what we are to expect from such and such actions and what methods are proper to be taken for the exciting such and such ideas which in effect is all that i conceive to be distinctly meant when it is said that by discerning the figure texture and mechanism of the inward parts of bodies whether natural or artificial we may attain to know the several uses and properties depending thereon or the nature of the thing     hence it is evident that those things which under the notion of a cause cooperating or concurring to the production of effects are altogether inexplicable and run us into great absurdities may be very naturally explained and have a proper and obvious use assigned em when they are considered only as marks or signs for our information and it is the searching after and endeavoring to understand this language if i may so call it of the author of nature that ought to be the employment of the natural philosopher and not the pretending to explain things by corporeal causes which doctrine seems to have too much estranged the minds of men from that active principle that supreme and wise spirit in whom we live move and have our being     in the twelfth place it may perhaps be objected that tho it be clear from what has been said that there can be no such thing as an inert senseless extended solid figured moveable substance existing without the mind such as philosophers describe matter yet if any man shall leave out of his idea of matter the positive ideas of extension figure solidity and motion and say that he means only by that word an inert senseless substance that exists without the mind or unperceived which is the occasion of our ideas or at the presence whereof god is pleased to excite ideas in us it does not appear but that matter taken in this sense may possibly exist in answer to which i say first that it seems no less absurd to suppose a substance without accidents than it is to suppose accidents without a substance but secondly tho we should grant this unknown substance may possibly exist yet where can it be supposed to be that it exists not in the mind is agreed and that it exists not in place is no less certain since all place or extension exists only in the mind as has been already proved it remains therefore that it exists no where at all     let us examine a little the description that is here given us of matter it neither acts nor perceives nor is perceived for this is all that is meant by saying it is an inert senseless unknown substance which is a definition entirely made up of negatives excepting only the relative notion of its standing under or supporting but then it must be observed that it supports nothing at all and how nearly this comes to the description of a nonentity i desire may be considered but say you it is the unknown occasion at the presence of which ideas are excited in us by the will of god now i would fain know how any thing can be present to us which is neither perceivable by sense nor reflection nor capable of producing any idea in our minds nor is at all extended nor has any form nor exists in any place the words to be present when thus applied must needs be taken in some abstract and strange meaning and which i am not able to comprehend     again let us examine what is meant by occasion so far as i can gather from the common use of language that word signifies either the agent which produces any effect or else something that is observed to accompany or go before it in the ordinary course of things but when it is applied to matter as above described it can be taken in neither of those senses for matter is said to be passive and inert and so cannot be an agent or efficient cause it is also unperceivable as being devoid of all sensible qualities and so cannot be the occasion of our perceptions in the latter sense as when the burning my finger is said to be the occasion of the pain that attends it what therefore can be meant by calling matter an occasion this term is either used in no sense at all or else in some very distant from its received signification   0 you will perhaps say that matter tho it be not perceived by us is nevertheless perceived by god to whom it is the occasion of exciting ideas in our minds for say you since we observe our sensations to be imprinted in an orderly and constant manner it is but reasonable to suppose there are certain constant and regular occasions of their being produced that is to say that there are certain permanent and distinct parcels of matter corresponding to our ideas which tho they do not excite them in our minds or any wise immediately affect us as being altogether passive and unperceivable to us they are nevertheless to god by whom they are perceived as it were so many occasions to remind him when and what ideas to imprint on our minds that so things may go on in a constant uniform manner     in answer to this i observe that as the notion of matter is here stated the question is no longer concerning the existence of a thing distinct from spirit and idea from perceiving and being perceived but whether there are not certain ideas of i know not what sort in the mind of god which are so many marks or notes that direct him how to produce sensations in our minds in a constant and regular method much after the same manner as a musician is directed by the notes of music to produce that harmonious train and composition of sound which is called a tune tho they who hear the music do not perceive the notes and may be entirely ignorant of them but this notion of matter which after all is the only intelligible one that i can pick from what is said of unknown occasions seems too extravagant to deserve a confutation besides it is in effect no objection against what we have advanced viz that there is no senseless unperceived substance     if we follow the light of reason we shall from the constant uniform method of our sensations collect the goodness and wisdom of the spirit who excites them in our minds but this is all that i can see reasonably concluded from thence to me i say it is evident that the being of a spirit infinitely wise good and powerful is abundantly sufficient to explain all the appearances of nature but as for inert senseless matter nothing that i perceive has any the least connection with it or leads to the thoughts of it and i would fain see any one explain any the meanest phenomenon in nature by it or show any manner of reason tho in the lowest rank of probability that he can have for its existence or even make any tolerable sense or meaning of that supposition for as to its being an occasion we have i think evidently shown that with regard to us it is no occasion it remains therefore that it must be if at all the occasion to god of exciting ideas in us and what this amounts to we have just now seen     it is worth while to reflect a little on the motives which induced men to suppose the existence of material substance that so having observed the gradual ceasing and expiration of those motives or reasons we may proportionably withdraw the assent that was grounded on them first therefore it was thought that color figure motion and the rest of the sensible qualities or accidents did really exist without the mind and for this reason it seemed needful to suppose some unthinking substratum or substance wherein they did exist since they could not be conceived to exist by themselves afterward in process of time men being convinced that colors sounds and the rest of the sensible secondary qualities had no existence without the mind they stripped this substratum or material substance of those qualities leaving only the primary ones figure motion etc which they still conceived to exist without the mind and consequently to stand in need of a material support but it having been shown that none even of these can possibly exist otherwise than in a spirit or mind which perceives them it follows that we have no longer any reason to suppose the being of matter nay that it is utterly impossible there should be any such thing so long as that word is taken to denote an unthinking substratum of qualities or accidents wherein they exist without the mind     but tho it be allowed by the materialists themselves that matter was thought of only for the sake of supporting accidents and the reason entirely ceasing one might expect the mind should naturally and without any reluctance at all quit the belief of what was solely grounded thereon yet the prejudice is riveted so deeply in our thoughts that we can scarce tell how to part with it and are therefore inclined since the thing it self is indefensible at least to retain the name which we apply to i know not what abstracted and indefinite notions of being occasion etc tho without any show of reason at least so far as i can see for what is there i beseech you on our part or what do we perceive amongst all the ideas sensations notions which are imprinted on our minds either by sense or reflection from whence may be inferred the existence of an inert thoughtless unperceived occasion and on the other hand on the part of an allsufficient spirit what can there be that should make us believe or even suspect he is directed by an inert occasion to excite ideas in our minds     it is a very extraordinary instance of the force of prejudice and much to be lamented that the mind of man retains so great a fondness against all the evidence of reason for a stupid thoughtless somewhat by the interposition whereof it would as it were skreen it self from the providence of god and remove it farther off from the affairs of the world but tho we do the utmost we can to secure the belief of matter tho when reason forsakes us we endeavor to support our opinion on the bare possibility of the thing and tho we indulge our selves in the full scope of an imagination not regulated by reason to make out that poor possibility yet the upshot of all is that there certain unknown ideas in the mind of god for this if any thing is all that i conceive to be meant by occasion with regard to god and this at the bottom is no longer contending for the thing but for the name     whether therefore there are such ideas in the mind of god and whether they may be called by the name matter i shall not dispute but if you stick to the notion of an unthinking substance or support of extension motion etc then to me it is most evidently impossible there should be any such thing since it is a plain repugnancy that those qualities should exist in or be supported by an unperceiving substance     but say you tho it be granted that there is no thoughtless support of extension and the other qualities or accidents which we perceive yet there may perhaps be some inert unperceiving substance or substratum of some other qualities as incomprehensible to us as colors are to a man born blind because we have not a sense adapted to them but if we had a new sense we should possibly no more doubt of their existence than a blindman made to see does of the existence of light and colors i answer first if what you mean by the word matter be only the unknown support of unknown qualities it is no matter whether there is such a thing or no since it no way concerns us and for my part i do not see the advantage there is in disputing about we know not what and we know not why     but secondly if we had a new sense it could only furnish us with new ideas or sensations and then we should have the same reason against their existing in an unperceiving substance that has been already offered with relation to figure motion color etc qualities as has been shown are nothing else but sensations or ideas which exist only in a mind perceiving them and this is true not only of the ideas we are acquainted with at present but likewise of all possible ideas whatsoever     but you will insist what if i have no reason to believe the existence of matter what if i cannot assign any use to it or explain any thing by it or even conceive what is meant by that word yet still it is no contradiction to say that matter exists and that this matter is in general a substance or occasion of ideas tho indeed to go about to unfold the meaning or adhere to any particular explication of those words may be attended with great difficulties i answer when words are used without a meaning you may put them together as you please without danger of running into a contradiction you may say for example that twice two is equal to seven so long as you declare you do not take the words of that proposition in their usual acception but for marks of you know not what and by the same reason you may say there is an inert thoughtless substance without accidents which is the occasion of our ideas and we shall understand just as much by one proposition as the other   0 in the last place you will say what if we give up the cause of material substance and stand to it that matter is an unknown somewhat neither substance nor accident spirit nor idea inert thoughtless indivisible immovable unextended existing in no place for say you whatever may be urged against substance or occasion or any other positive or relative notion of matter has no place at all so long as this negative definition of matter is adhered to i answer you may if so it shall seem good use the word matter in the same sense that other men use nothing and so make those terms convertible in your style for after all this is what appears to me to be the result of that difinition the parts whereof when i consider with attention either collectively or separate from each other i do not find that there is any kind of effect or impression made on my mind different from what is excited by term nothing     upon this you will reply that in the foresaid definition is included what does sufficiently distinguish it from nothing the positive abstract idea of quiddity entity or existence i own indeed that those who pretend to the faculty of framing abstract general ideas do talk as if they had such an idea which is say they the most abstract and general notion of all that is to me the most incomprehensible of all others that there are a great variety of spirits of different orders and capacities whose faculties both in number and extent are far exceeding those the author of my being has bestowed on me i see no reason to deny and for me to pretend to determine by my own few stinted narrow inlets of perception what ideas the inexhaustible power of the supreme spirit may imprint upon em were certainly the utmost folly and presumption since there may be for ought that i know innumerable sorts of ideas or sensations as different from one another and from all that i have perceived as colors are from sounds but how ready soever i may be to acknowledge the scantiness of my comprehension with regard to the endless variety of spirits and ideas that may possibly exist yet for any one to pretend to a notion of entity or existence abstracted from spirit and idea from perceiving and being perceived is i suspect a downright repugnancy nnd trifling with words it remains that we consider the objections which may possibly be made on the part of religion     some there are who think that tho the arguments for the real existence of bodies which are drawn from reason be allowed not to amount to demonstration yet the holy scriptures are so clear in the point as will sufficiently convince every good christian that bodies do really exist and are something more than mere ideas there being in holy writ innumerable facts related which evidently suppose the reality of timber and stone mountains and rivers and cities and human bodies etc to which i answer that no sort of writings whatever sacred or profane which use those and the like words in the vulgar acceptance or so as to have a meaning in em are in danger of having their truth called in question by our doctrine that all those things do really exist that there are bodies even corporeal substances when taken in the vulgar sense has been shown to be agreeable to our principles and the difference betwixt things and ideas realities and chimeras has been distinctly explained vid sect xxix xxx xxxiii xxxvi etc and i do not think that either what philosophers call matter or the existence of objects without the mind is any where mentioned in scripture     again whether there be or be not external things it is agreed on all hands that the proper use of words is the marking our conceptions or things only as they are known and perceived by us whence it plainly follows that in the tenants we have laid down there is nothing inconsistent with the right use and significancy of language and that discourse of what kind soever so far as it is intelligible remains undisturbed but all this seems so very manifest from what has been largely set forth in the premises that it is needless to insist any farther on it     but it will be urged that miracles do at least lose much of their stress and import by our principles what must we think of mosess rod was it not really turned into a serpent or was there only a change of ideas in the minds of the spectators and can it be supposed that our savior did no more at the marriage feast in cana than impose on the sight and smell and taste of the guests so as to create in them the appearance or idea only of wine the same may be said of all other miracles which in consequence of the foregoing principles must be looked upon only as so many cheats or illusions of fancy to this i reply that the rod was changed into a real serpent and the water into real wine that this does not in the least contradict what i have elsewhere said will be evident from sect xxxiv and xxxv but this business of real and imaginary has been already so plainly and fully explained and so often referred to and the difficulties about it are so easily answered from what has gone before that it were an affront to the readers understanding to resume the explication of it in this place i shall only observe that if at table all who were present should see and smell and taste and drink wine and find the effects of it with me there could be no doubt of it is reality so that at bottom the scruple concerning real miracles has no place at all on ours but only on the received principles and consequently makes rather for than against what has been said     having done with the objections which i endeavored to propose in the clearest light and gave them all the force and weight i could we proceed in the next place to take a view of our tenants in their consequences some of these appear at first sight as that several difficult and obscure questions on which abundance of speculation has been thrown away are entirely banished from philosophy whether corporeal substance can think whether matter be infinitely divisible and how it operates on spirit these and the like inquiries have given infinite amusement to philosophers in all ages but depending on the existence of matter they have no longer any place on our principles many other advantages there are as well with regard to religion as the sciences which it is easy for any one to deduce from what has been premised but this will appear more plainly in the sequel     from the principles we have laid down it follows human knowledge many naturally be reduced to two heads that of ideas and that of spirits of each of these i shall treat in order and first as to ideas or unthinking things our knowledge of these has been very much obscured and confounded and we have been led into very dangerous errors by supposing a twofold existence of the objects of sense the one intelligible or in the mind the other real and without the mind whereby unthinking things are thought to have a natural subsistence of their own distinct from being perceived by spirits this which if i mistake not has been shown to be a most groundless and absurd notion is the very root of skepticism for so long as men thought that real things subsisted without the mind and that their knowledge was only so far forth real as it was conformable to real things it follows they could not be certain that they had any real knowledge at all for how can it be known that the things which are perceived are conformable to those which are not perceived or exist without the mind     color figure motion extension and the like considered only as so many sensations in the mind are perfectly known there being nothing in them which is not perceived but if they are looked on as notes or images refered to things or archetypes existing without the mind then are we involved all in skepticism we see only the appearances and not the real qualities of things what may be the extension figure or motion of any thing really and absolutely or in it self its impossible for us to know but only the proportion or relation they bear to our senses things remaining the same our ideas vary and which of them or even whether any of them at all represent the true quality really existing in the thing it is out of our reach to determine so that for ought we know all we see hear and feel may be only phantome and vain chimera and not at all agree with the real things existing in rerum natura all this skeptical cant follows from our supposing a difference between things and ideas and that the former have a subsistence without the mind or unperceived it were easy to dilate on this subject and show how the arguments urged by skeptics in all ages depend on the supposition of external objects but this is too obvious to need being insisted on     so long as we attribute a real existence to unthinking things distinct from their being perceived it is not only impossible for us to know with evidence the nature of any real unthinking being but even that it exists hence it is that we see philosophers distrust their senses and doubt of the existence of heaven and earth of every thing they see or feel even of their own bodies and after all their laboring and struggle of thought they are forced to own we cannot attain to any selfevident or demonstrative knowledge of the existence of sensible things but all this doubtfulness which so bewilders and confounds the mind and makes philosophy ridiculous in the eyes of the world vanishes if we annex a meaning to our words and not amuse our selves with the terms absolute external exist etc signifying we know not what for my part i can as well doubt of my own being as of the being of those things which i actually perceive by sense it being a manifest contradiction that any sensible object should be immediately perceived by sight or touch and at the same time have no existence in nature since the very existence of an unthinking being consists in being perceived     nothing seems of more importance toward erecting a firm system of sound and real knowledge which may be proof against the assaults of skepticism than to lay the beginning in a distinct explication of what is meant by thing reality existence for in vain shall we dispute concerning the real existence of things or pretend to any knowledge thereof so long as we have not fixed the meaning of those words thing or being is the most general name of all it comprehends under it two kinds entirely distinct and heterogeneous and which have nothing common but the name viz spirits and ideas the former are active indivisible incorruptible substances the latter are inert fleeting perishable passions or dependent beings which subsist not by themselves but are supported by or exist in minds or spiritual substances   0 ideas imprinted on the senses are real things or do really exist this we do not deny but we deny they can subsist without the minds which perceive them or that they are resemblances of any archetypes existing without the mind since the very being of a sensation or idea consists in being perceived and an idea can be like nothing but an idea again the things perceived by sense may be termed external with regard to their origin in that they are not generated from within by the mind it self but imprinted by a spirit distinct from that which perceives them sensible objects may likewise be said to be without the mind in another sense namely when they exist in some other mind thus when i shut my eyes the things i saw may still exist but it must be in another mind     it were a mistake to think that what is here said derogates in the least from the reality of things it is acknowlegd on the received principles that extension motion and in a word all sensible qualities have need of a support as not being able to subsist by themselves but the objects perceived by sense are allowed to be nothing but combinations of those qualities and consequently cannot subsist by themselves thus far it is agreed on all hands so that in denying the things perceived by sense an existence independent of a substance or support wherein they may exist we detract nothing from the received opinion of their reality and are guilty of no innovation in that respect all the difference is that according to us the unthinking beings perceived by sense have no existence distinct from being perceived and cannot therefore exist in any other substance than those unextended indivisible substances or spirits which act and think and perceive them whereas philosophers vulgarly hold the sensible qualities do exist in an inert extended unperceiving substance which they call matter to which they attribute a natural subsistence exterior to all thinking beings or distinct from being perceived by any mind whatsoever even the eternal mind of the creator wherein they suppose only ideas of the corporeal substances created by him if indeed they allow them to be at all created     for as we have shown the doctrine of matter or corporeal substance to have been the main pillar and support of skepticism so likewise upon the same foundation have been raised all the impious schemes of atheism and irreligion nay so great a difficulty has it been thought to conceive matter produced out of nothing that the most celebrated among the ancient philosophers even of these who maintained the being of a god have thought matter to be uncreated and coeternal with him how great a friend material substance has been to atheists in all ages were needless to relate all their monstrous systems have so visible and necessary a dependence on it that when this cornerstone is once removed the whole fabric cannot choose but fall to the ground insomuch that it is no longer worth while to bestow a particular consideration on the absurdities of every wretched sect of atheists     that impious and profane persons should readily fall in with those systems which favor their inclinations by deriding immaterial substance and supposing the soul to be divisible and subject to corruption as the body which exclude all freedom intelligence and design from the formation of things and instead thereof make a selfexistent stupid unthinking substance the root and origin of all beings that they should hearken to those who deny a providence or inspection of a superior mind over the affairs of the world attributing the whole series of events either to blind chance or fatal necessity arising from the impulse of one body on another all this is very natural and on the other hand when men of better principles observe the enemies of religion lay so great a stress on vnthinking matter and all of them use so much industry and artifice to reduce every thing to it methinks they should rejoice to see them deprived of their grand support and driven from that only fortress without which your epicureans hobbists and the like have not even the shadow of a pretense but become the most cheap and easy triumph in the world     the existence of matter or bodies unperceived has not only been the main support of atheists and fatalists but on the principle does idolatry likewise in all its various forms depend did men but consider that the sun moon and stars and every other object of the senses are only so many sensations in their minds which have no other existence but barely being perceived doubtless they would never fall down and worship their own ideas but rather address their homage to that eternal invisible mind which produces and sustains all things     the same absurd principle by mingling it self with the articles of our faith has occasioned no small difficulties to christians for example about the resurrection how many scruples and objections have been raised by socinians and others but do not the most plausible of them depend on the supposition that a body is denominated the same with regard not to the form or that which is perceived by sense but the material substance which remains the same under several forms take away this material substance about the identity whereof all the dispute is and mean by body what every plain ordinary person means by that word viz that which is immediately seen and felt which is only a combination of sensible qualities or ideas and then their most unanswerable objections come to nothing     matter being once expelled out of nature drags with it so many skeptical and impious notions such an incredible number of disputes and puzling questions which have been thorns in the sides of divines as well as philosophers and made so much fruitless work for mankind that if the arguments we have produced against it are not found equal to demonstration as to me they evidently seem yet i am sure all friends to knowledge peace and religion have reason to wish they were     beside the external existence of the objects of perception another great source of errors and difficulties with regard to ideal knowledge is the doctrine of abstract ideas such as it has been set forth in the introduction the plainest things in the world those we are most intimately acquainted with and perfectly know when they are considered in an abstract way appear strangely difficult and incomprehensible time place and motion taken in particular or concrete are what every body knows but having passed through the hands of a metaphysician they become too abstract and fine to be apprehended by men of ordinary sense bid your servant meet you at such a time in such a place and he shall never stay to deliberate on the meaning of those words in conceiving that particular time and place or the motion by which he is to get thither he finds not the least difficulty but if time be taken exclusive of all those particular actions and ideas that diversifie the day merely for the continuation of existence or duration in abstract then it will perhaps gravel even a philosopher to comprehend it     for my own part whenever i attempt to frame a simple idea of time abstracted from the succession of ideas in my mind which flows uniformly and is participated by all beings i am lost and embrangled in inextricable difficulties i have no notion of it at all only i hear others say it is infinitely divisible and speak of it in such a manner as leads me to harbor odd thoughts of my existence since that doctrine lays one under an absolute necessity of thinking either that he passes away innumerable ages without a thought or else that he is annihilated every moment of his life both which seem equally absurd time therefore being nothing abstracted from the successon of ideas in our minds it follows that the duration of any finite spirit must be estimated by the number of ideas or actions succeeding each other in that same spirit or mind hence it is a plain consequence that the soul always thinks and in truth whoever shall go about to divide in his thoughts or abstract the existence of a spirit from its cogitation will i believe find it no easy task     so likewise when we attempt to abstract extension and motion from all other qualities and consider them by themselves we presently lose sight of em and run into great extravagancies hence spring those odd paradoxes that the fire is not hot nor the wall white etc or that heat and color are in the objects nothing but figure and motion all which depend on a twofold abstraction first it is supposed that extension for example may be abstracted from all other sensible qualities and secondly that the entity of extension may be abstracted from its being perceived but whoever shall reflect and take care to understand what he says will if i mistake not acknowledge that all sensible qualities are alike sensations and alike real that where the extension is there is the color too i e in his mind and that their archetypes can exist only in some other mind and that the objects of sense are nothing but those sensations combined blended or if one may so speak concreted together none of all which can be supposed to exist unperceived and that consequently the wall is as truly white as it is extended and in the same sense   00 what it is for a man to be happy or an object good every one may think he knows but to frame an abstract idea of happiness prescinded from all particular pleasure or of goodness from every thing that is good this is what few can pretend to so likewise a man may be just and virtuous without having precise ideas of justice and virtue the opinion that those and the like words stand for general notions abstracted from all particular persons and actions seems to have rendered morality very difficult and the study thereof of small use to mankind and in effect one may make a great progress in schoolethics without ever being the wiser or better man for it or knowing how to behave himself in the affairs of life more to the advantage of himself or his neighbors than he did before this hint may suffice to let any one see the doctrine of abstraction has not a little contributed toward spoiling the most useful parts of knowledge   0  the two great provinces of speculative science conversant about ideas received from sense are natural philosophy and mathematics with regard to each of these i shall make some observations and first i shall say somewhat of natural philosophy on this subject it is that the skeptics triumph all that stock of arguments they produce to depreciate our faculties and make mankind appear ignorant and low are drawn principally from this head namely that we are under an invincible blindness as to the true and real nature of things this they exaggerate and love to enlarge on we are miserably banterd say they by our senses and amused only with the outside and show of things the real essence the internal qualities and constitution of every the meanest object is hid from our view something there is in every drop of water every grain of sand which it is beyond the power of human understanding to fathom or comprehend but it is evident from what has been shown that all this complaint is groundless and that we are influenced by false principles to that degree as to mistrust our senses and think we know nothing of those things which we perfectly comprehend   0  one great inducement to our pronouncing our selves ignorant of the nature of things is the current opinion that every thing includes within it self the cause of its properties or that there is in each object an inward essence which is the source whence its discernible qualities flow and whereon they depend some have pretended to account for appearances by occult qualities but of late they are mostly resolved into mechanical causes viz the figure motion weight etc of insensible particles whereas in truth there is no other agent or efficient cause than spirit it being evident that motion as well as all other ideas is perfectly inert vid sect xxv hence to endeavor to explain the production of colors sounds etc by figure motion magnitude and the like must needs be labor in vain and accordingly we see the attempts of that kind are not at all satisfactory which may be said in general of those instances wherein one idea or quality is assigned for the cause of another i need not say how many hypotheses and speculations are left out and how much the study of nature is abridged by this doctrine   0  the great mechanical principle now in vogue is attraction that a stone falls to the earth or the sea swells toward the moon may to some appear sufficiently explained thereby but how are we enlightened by being told this is done by attraction is it that that word signifies the manner of the tendency and that it is by the mutual drawing of bodies instead of their being impelled or protruded toward each other but nothing is determined of the manner or action and it may as truly for ought we know be termed impulse or protrusion as attraction again the parts of steel we see cohere firmly together and this also is accounted for by attraction but in this as in the other instances i do not perceive that any thing is signified besides the effect it self for as to the manner of the action whereby it is produced or the cause which produces it these are not so much as aimed at   0  indeed if we take a view of the several phenomenon and compare them together we may observe some likeness and conformity between them for example in the falling of a stone to the ground in the rising of the sea toward the moon in cohesion crystallization etc there is something alike namely an union or mutual approach of bodies so that any one of these or the like phenomenon may not seem strange or surprising to a man woh has nicely observed and compared the effects of nature for that only is thought so which is uncommon or a thing by it self and out of the ordinary course of our observation that bodies should tend toward the center of the earth is not thought strange because it is what we perceive every moment of our lives but that they should have a like gravitation toward the center of the moon may seem odd and unaccountable to most men because it is discerned only in the tides but a philosopher whose thoughts take in a larger compass of nature having observed a certain similitude of appearances as well in the heavens as the earth that argue innumerable bodies to have a mutual tendency toward each other which he denotes by the general name attraction whatever can be reduced to that he thinks justly accounted for thus he explains the tides by the attraction of the terraqueous globe toward the moon which to him does not appear odd or anomalous but only a particular example of a general rule or law of nature   0  if therefore we consider the difference there is betwixt natural philosophers and other men with regard to their knowledge of the phenomenon we shall find it consists not in an exacter knowledge of the efficient cause that produces them for that can be no other than the will of a spirit but only in a greater largeness of comprehension whereby analogies harmonies and agreements are discovered in the works of nature and the particular effects explained i e reduced to general rules vid sect lxii which rules grounded on the analogy and uniformness observed in the production of natural effects are most agreeable and sought after by the mind for that they extend our prospect beyond what is present and near to us and enable us to make very probable conjectures touching things that may have happened at very great distances of time and place as well as to predict things to come which sort of endeavor toward omniscience is much affected by the mind   0  but we should proceed warily in such things for we are apt to lay too great a stress on analogies and to the prejudice of truth humor that eagerness of the mind whereby it is carried to extend its knowledge into general theoremes for example in the business of gravitation or mutual attraction because it appears in many instances some are straightway for pronouncing it universal and that to attract and be attracted by every other body is an essential quality inherent in all bodies whatsoever whereas its evident the fixed stars have no such tendency toward each other and so far is that gravitation from being essential to bodies that in some instances a quite contrary principle seems to show it self as in the perpendicular growth of plants and the elasticity of the air there is nothing necessary or essential in the case but it depends entirely on the will of the governing spirit who causes certain bodies to cleave together or tend toward each other according to various laws whilst he keeps others at a fixed distance and to some he gives a quite contrary tendency to fly asunder just as he sees convenient   0  after what has been premised i think we may lay down the following conclusions first it is plain philosophers amuse themselves in vain when they inquire for any natural efficient cause distinct from a mind or spirit secondly considering the whole creation is the workmanship of a wise and good agent it should seem to become philosophers to employ their thoughts contrary to what some hold about the final causes of things for besides that this would prove a very pleasing entertainment to the mind it might be of great advantage in that it not only discovers to us the attributes of the creator but may also direct us in several instances to the proper uses and applications of things and i must confess i see no reason why pointing out the various ends to which natural things are adapted and for which they were originally with unspeakable wisdom contrived should not be thought one good way of accounting for them and altogether worthy a philosopher thirdly from what has been premised no reason can be drawn why the history of nature should not still be studied and observations and experiments made which that they are of use to mankind and enable us to draw any general conclusions is not the result of any immutable habitudes or relations between things themselves but only of gods goodness and kindness to men in the administration of the world vid sect xxx and xxxi fourthly by a diligent observation of the phenomenon within our view we may discover the general laws of nature and from them deduce the other phenomenon i do not say demonstrate for all deductions of that kind depend on a supposition that the author of nature always operates uniformly and in a constant observance of those rules we take for principles which we cannot evidently know   0  it appears from sect lxvi etc that the steady consistent methods of nature may not unfitly be styled the language of its author whereby he discovers his attributes to our view and directs us how to act for the convenience and felicity of life and to me those men who frame general rules from the phenomenon and afterward derive the phenomenon from those rules seem to be grammarians and their art the grammar of nature two ways there are of learning a language either by rule or by practice a man may be well read in the language of of nature without understanding the grammar of it or being able to say by what rule a thing is so or so and as it is very possible to write improperly through too strict an observance of general grammarrules so in arguing from general laws of nature it is not impossible we may stretch the analogy too far and by that means run into mistakes   0  to carry on the resemblance as in reading other books a wise man will choose to fix his thoughts on the sense and apply it to use rather than lay them out in grammatical remarks on the language so in perusing the volume of nature methinks it is beneath the dignity of the mind to affect an exactness in reducing each particular phenomenon to general rules or show how it follows from them we should propose to our selves nobler views namely to recreate and exalt the mind with a prospect of the beauty order extent and variety of natural things hence by proper inferences to enlarge our notions of the grandeur wisdom and beneficence of the creator and lastly to make the several parts of the creation so far as in us lies subservient to the ends they were designed for gods glory and the sustentation and comfort of our selves and fellow creatures    0 the best grammar of the kind we are speaking of will be easily acknowlegd to be a treatise of mechanics demonstrated and applied to nature by a philosopher of a neighboring nation whom all the world admire i shall not take upon me to make remarks on the performance of that extraordinary person only some things he has advanced so directly opposite to the doctrine we have hitherto laid down that we should be wanting in the regard due to the authority of so great a man did we not take some notice of them in the entrance of that justly admired treatise time space and motion are distinguished into absolute and relative true and apparent mathematical and vulgar which distinction as it is at large explained by the author does suppose those quantities to have an existence without the mind and that they are ordinarily conceived with relation to sensible things to which nevertheless in their own nature they bear no relation at all      as for time as it is there taken in an absolute or abstracted sense for the duration or perseverance of the existence of things i have nothing more to add concerning it after what has been already said on that subject for the rest this celebrated author holds there is an absolute space which being unperceivable to sense remains in it self similar and immovable and relative space to be the measure thereof which being moveable and defined by its situation in respect of sensible bodies is vulgarly taken for immovable space place he defines to be that part of space which is occupied by any body and according as the space is absolute or relative so also is the place absolute motion is said to be the translation of a body from absolute place to absolute place as relative motion is from one relative place to another now because the parts of absolute space do not fall under our senses instead of them we are obliged to use their sensible measures and so define both place and motion with respect to bodies which we regard as immovable but it is said in philosophical matters we must abstract from our senses since it may be that none of those bodies which seem to be quiescent are truly so and the same thing which is moved relatively may be really at rest as likewise one and the same body may be in relative rest and motion or even moved with contrary relative motions at the same time according as its place is variously defined all which ambiguity is to be found in the apparent motions but not at all in the true or absolute which should therefore he alone regarded in philosophy and the true we are told are distinguished from apparent or relative motions by the following properties first in true or absolute motion all parts which preserve the same position with respect to the whole partake of the motions of the whole secondly the place being moved that which is placed therein is also moved so that a body moving in a place which is in motion does participate the motion of its place thirdly true motion is never generated or changed otherwise then by force impressed on the body it self fourthly true motion is always changed by force impressed on the body moved fifthly in circular motion barely relative there is no centrifugal force which nevertheless in that which is true or absolute is proportional to the quantity of motion      but notwithstanding what has been said i must confess it does not appear to me that there can be any motion other than relative so that to conceive motion there must be at least conceived two bodies whereof the distance or position in regard to each other is varied hence if there was one only body in being it could not possibly be moved this to me seems very evident in that the idea i have of motion does necessarily involve relation it whether others can conceive it otherwise a little attention may satisfy them      but though in every motion it be necessary to conceive more bodies than one yet it may be that one only is moved namely that on which the force causing the change in the distance or situation of the bodies is impressed for however some may define relative motion so as to term that body moved which changes its distance from some other body whether the force causing that change were impressed on it or no yet i cannot assent to this for since we are told relative motion is that which is perceived by sense and regarded in the ordinary affairs of life it follows that every man of common sense knows what it is as well as the best philosopher now i ask any one whether in his sense of motion as he walks along the streets the stones he passes over may be said to move because they change distance with his feet to me it appears that tho motion includes a relation of one thing to another yet it is not necessary that each term of the relation be denominated from it as a man may think of somewhat which does not think so a body may be moved to or from another body which which is not therefore it self in motion i mean relative motion for other i am not able to conceive      as the place happens to be variously defined the motion which is related to it varies a man in a ship may be said to be quiescent with relation to the sides of the vessel and yet move with relation to the land or he may move eastward in respect of the one and westward in respect of the other in the common affairs of life men never go beyond the earth to define the place of any body and what is quiescent in respect of that is accounted absolutely to be so but philosophers who have a greater extent of thought and juster notions of the system of things discover even the earth it self to be moved in order therefore to fix their notions they seem to conceive the corporeal world as finite and the utmost unmoved walls or shell thereof to be the place whereby they estimate true motions if we sound our own conceptions i believe we may find all the absolute motion we can frame an idea of to be at bottom no other than relative motion thus defined for as i have already said absolute motion exclusive of all external relation is incomprehensible and to this kind of relative motion all the abovementioned properties causes and effects ascribed to absolute motion will if i mistake not be found to agree as to what is said of the centifugal force that it does not at all belong to circular relative motion i do not see how this follows from the experiment which is brought to prove it see philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica p   in schol def viii for the water in the vessel at that time wherein it is said to have the greatest relative circular motion has i think no motion at all as is plain from the foregoing section      for to denominate a body moved it is requisite first that it change its distance or situation with regard to some other body secondly that the force occasioning that change be impressed on it if either of these be wanting i do not think that agreeably to the sense of mankind or the propriety of language a body can be said to be in motion i grant indeed that it is possible for us to think a body which we see change its distance from some other to be moved though it have no force impressed on it in which sense there may be apparent motion but then it is because the force causing the change of distance is imagined by us to be impressed on that body thought to move which indeed shows we are capable of mistaking a thing to be in motion which is not but does not prove that in the common acceptance of motion a body is moved merely because it changes distance from another since as soon as we are undeceived and find that the moving force was not communicated to it we no longer hold it to be moved so on the other hand when one only body the parts whereof preserve a given position between themselves is imagined to exist some there are who think that it can be moved all manner of ways though without any change of distance or situation to any other bodies which we should not deny if they meant only that it might have an impressed force which upon the bare creation of other bodies would produce a motion of any certain quantity and determination but that an actual motion distinct from the impressed force or power productive of change of place in case there were bodies present whereby to define it can exist in such a single body i must confess i am not able to comprehend      from what has been said it follows that the philosophic consideration of motion does not imply the being of an absolute space distinct from that which is perceived by sense and related to bodies which that it cannot exist without the mind is clear upon the same principles that demonstrate the like of all other objects of sense and perhaps if we inquire narrowly into the matter we shall find we cannot even frame an idea of pure space exclusive of all body this i must confess is above my capacity as being a most abstract idea when i excite a motion in some part of my body if it be free or without resistance i say there is space but if i find a resistance then i say there is body and in proportion as the resistance to motion is lesser or greater i say the space is more or less pure so that when i speak of pure or empty space it is not to be supposed that the word space stands for an idea distinct from or conceivable without body and motion though indeed we are apt to think every noun substantive stands for a distinct idea that may be separated from all others which has occasioned infinite mistakes when therefore supposing all the world to be annihilated besides my own body i say there still remains pure space thereby nothing else is meant but only that i conceive it possible for the limbs of my body to be moved on all sides without the least resistance but if that too were annihilated then there could be no motion and consequently no space some perhaps may think the sense of seeing does furnish em with the idea of pure space but it is plain from what we have elsewhere shown that the ideas of space and distance are not obtained by that sense see the essay concerning vision      what is here laid down seems to put an end to all those disputes and difficulties that have sprung up amongst the learned concerning the nature of pure space but the chief advantage arising from it is that we are freed from that dangerous dilemma to which several who have employed their thoughts on that subject imagine themselves reduced viz of thinking either that real space is god or else that there is something beside god which is eternal uncreated infinite indivisible immutable etc both which may justly be thought pernicious and absurd notions it is certain that not a few divines as well as philosophers of great note have from the difficulty they found in conceiving either limits or annihilation of space concluded it must be divine and some of late have set themselves particularly to show the incommunicable attributes of god agree to it which doctrine how unworthy soever it may seem of the divine nature yet i must confess i do not see how we can get clear of it so long as we adhere to the received opinions      hitherto of natural philosophy we come now to make some inquiry concerning that other great branch of speculative knowledge viz mathematics these how celebrated soever they may be for their clearness and certainty of demonstration which is hardly any where else to be found cannot nevertheless be supposed altogether free from mistakes if so be that in their principles there lurks some secret error which is common to the professors of those sciences with the rest of mankind mathematicians though they deduce their theorems from a great height of evidence yet their first principles are limited by the consideration of quantity and they do not ascend into any inquiry concerning those transcendental maxims which influence all the particular sciences each part whereof mathematics not excepted does consequently participate of the errors involved in them that the principles laid down by mathematicians are true and their way of deduction from those principles clear and incontestable we do not deny but we hold there may be certain erroneous maxims of greater extent than the object of mathematics and for that reason not expressly mentioned though tacitly supposed throughout the whole progress of that science and that the ill effects of those secret unexamind errors are diffused through all the branches thereof to be plain we suspect the mathematicians are no less deeply concerned than other men in the errors arising from the doctrine of abstract general ideas and the existence of objects without the mind      arithmetic has been thought to have for its object abstract ideas of number of which to understand the properties and mutual habitudes is supposed no mean part of speculative knowledge the opinion of the pure and intellectual nature of numbers in abstract has made em in esteem with those philosophers who seem to have affected an uncommon fineness and elevation of thought it has set a price on the most trifling numerical speculations which in practice are of no use but serve only for amusement and has heretofore so far infected the minds of some that they have dreamt of mighty mysteries involved in numbers and attempted the explication of natural things by them but if we narrowly inquire into our own thoughts and consider what has been premised we may perhaps entertain a low opinion of those high flights and abstractions and look on all inquiries about numbers only as so many difficiles nugae so far as they are not subservient to practice and promote the benefit of life    0 unity in abstract we have before considered vid sect xiii from which and what has been said in the introduction it plainly follows there is not any such idea but number being defined a collection of unites we may conclude that if there be no such thing as unity or unite in abstract there are no ideas of number in abstract denoted by the numeral names and figures the theories therefore in arithmetic if they are abstracted from the names and figures as likewise from all use and practice as well as from the particular things numbered can be supposed to have nothing at all for their object hence we may see how entirely the science of numbers is subordinate to practice and how jejune and trifling it becomes when considered as a matter of mere speculation      however since there may be some who deluded by the specious show of discovering abstracted verities waste their time in arithmetical theoremes and problemes which have not any use it will not be amiss if we more fully consider and expose the vanity of that pretense and this will plainly appear by taking a view of arithmetic in its infancy and observing what it was that originally put men on the study of that science and to what scope they directed it it is natural to think that at first men for ease of memory and help of computation made use of counters or in writing of single strokes points or the like each whereof was made to signify an unite i e some one thing of whatever kind they had occasion to reckon afterward they found out the more compendious ways of making one character stand in place of several strokes or points and lastly the notation of the arabians or indians came into use wherein by the repetition of a few characters or figures and varying the signification of each figure according to the the place it obtains all numbers may be most aptly expressed which seems to have been done in imitation of language so that an exact analogy is observed betwixt the notation by figures and names the nine simple figures answering the nine first numeral names and places in the former corresponding to denominations in the latter and agreeably to those conditions of the simple and local value of figures were contrived methods of finding from the given figures or marks of the parts what figures and how placed are proper to denote the whole or vice versa and having found the sought figures the same rule or analogy being observed throughout it is easy to read them into words and so the number becomes perfectly known for then the number of any particular things is said to be known when we know the name or figures with their due arangement that according to the standing analogy belong to them for these signs being known we can by the operations of arithmetic know the signs of any part of the particular sums signified by them and thus computing in signs because of the connection established betwixt them and the distinct multitudes of things whereof one is taken for an unite we may be able rightly to sum up divide and proportion the things themselves that we intend to number      in arithmetic therefore we regard not the things but the signs which nevertheless are not regarded for their own sake but because they direct us how to act with relation to things and dispose rightly of them now agreeably to what we have before observed of words in general  vid sect xix introd it happens here likewise that abstract ideas are thought to be signified by numeral names or characters while they do not suggest ideas of particular things to our minds i shall not at present enter into a more particular dissertation on this subject but only observe that it is evident from what has been said those things which pass for abstract truths and theorems concerning numbers are in reality conversant about no object distinct from particular numerable things except only names and characters which originally came to be considered on no other account but their being signs or capable to represent aptly whatever particular things men had need to compute whence it follows that to study them for their own sake would be just as wise and to as good purpose as if a man neglecting the true use or original intention and subserviency of language should spend his time in impertinent criticisms upon words or reasonings and controversies purely verbal      from numbers we proceed to speak of extension which is the object of geometry the infinite divisibility of finite extension though it is not expressly laid down either as an axiom or theoreme in the elements of that science yet is throughout the same every where supposed and thought to have so inseparable and essential a connection with the principles and demonstrations in geometry that mathematicians never admit it into doubt or make the least question of it and as this notion is the source from whence do spring all those amusing geometrical paradoxes which have such a direct repugnancy to the plain common sense of mankind and are admitted with so much reluctance into a mind not yet debauched by learning so is it the principal occasion of all that nice and extreme subtilty which renders the study of mathematics so very difficult and tedious hence if we can make it appear that no finite extension contains innumerable parts or is infinitely divisible it follows that we shall at once clear the science of geometry from a great number of difficulties and contradictions which have ever been esteemed a reproach to human reason and withal make the attainment thereof a business of much less time and pains then it hitherto has been      every particular finite extension which may possibly be the object of our thought is an idea existing only in the mind and consequently each part thereof must be perceived if therefore i cannot perceive innumerable parts in any finite extension that i consider it is certain they are not contained in it but it is evident that i cannot distinguish innumerable parts in any particular line surface or solid which i either perceive by sense or figure to my self in my mind wherefore i conclude they are not contained in it nothing can be plainer to me than that the extensions i have in view are no other than my own ideas and it is no less plain that i cannot resolve any one of my ideas into an infinite number of other ideas that is that they are not infinitely divisible if by finite extension be meant something distinct from a finite idea i declare i do not know what that is and so cannot affirm or deny any thing of it but if the terms extension parts etc are taken in any sense conceivable i e for ideas then to say a finite quantity or extension consists of parts infinite in number is so manifest and glaring a contradiction that every one at first sight acknowleges it to be so and it is impossible it should ever gain the assent of any reasonable creature who is not brought to it by gentle and slow degrees as a pagan convert to the belief of transubstantiation ancient and rooted prejudices do often pass into principles and those propositions which once obtain the force and credit of a principle are not only themselves but likewise whatevers deducible from them thought privileged from all examination and there is no absurdity so gross which by this means the mind of man may not be prepared to swallow      he whose understanding is prepossest with the doctrine of abstract general ideas may be easily persuaded that whatever be thought of the ideas of sense extension in abstract is infinitely divisible and any one who thinks the objects of sense exist without the mind will not stick to affirm a line but an inch long may contain innumerable parts really existing tho too small to be discerned these errors are grafted as well in the minds of geometricians as of other men and have a like influence on their reasonings and it were no difficult thing to show how the arguments from geometry made use of to support the infinite divisibility of extension are bottomed on them but this if it be thought necessary we may hereafter find a proper place to treat of in a particular manner at present we shall only observe in general whence it is the mathematicians are all so fond and tenacious of that doctrine      it has been observed in another place that the theorems and demonstrations in geometry are conversant about universal ideas vid sect xv introd where it is explained in what sense this ought to be understood namely the particular lines and figures included in the diagram are supposed to stand for innumerable others of different sizes or in other words the geometer considers them abstracting from their magnitude which does not imply that he forms an abstract idea but only that he cares not what the particular magnitude is whether great or small but looks on that as a thing indifferent to the demonstration hence it follows that a line in the scheme but an inch long must be spoken of as though it contained tenthousand parts since it is regarded not in it self but as it is universal and it is universal only in its signification whereby it represents innumerable lines greater than it self in which may be distinguished tenthousand parts or more though there may not in it after this manner the properties of the lines signified are by a very usual figure transferred to the sign and thence through mistake thought to appertain to it considered in its own nature      because there is no number of parts so great but its possible there may be a line containing more the inchline is said to contain parts more than any assignable number which is true not of the inch taken absolutely but only for the things signified by it but men not retaining that distinction in their thoughts slide into a belief that the small particular line described on paper contains in it self parts innumerable there is no such thing as the tenthousandth part of an inch but there is of a mile or diameter of the earth which may be signified by that inch when therefore i delineate a triangle on paper and take one side not above an inch for example in length to be the radius this i consider as divided into  0000 or  00000 parts or more for though the tenthousandth part of that line considered in it self is nothing at all and consequently may be neglected without any error or inconveniency yet these described lines being only marks standing for greater quantities whereof it may be the tenthousandth part is very considerable it follows that to prevent notable errors in practice the radius must be taken of  0000 parts or more      from what has been said the reason is plain why to the end any theorem become universal in its use its necessary we speak of the lines described on paper as though they contained parts which really they do not in doing of which if we examine the matter thoroughly we shall perhaps discover that we cannot conceive an inch it self as consisting of or being divisible into a thousand parts but only some other line which is far greater than an inch and represented by it and that when we say a line is infinitely divisible we mean if we mean any thing a line which is infinitely great what we have here observed seems to be the chief cause why to suppose the infinite divisibility of finite extension has been thought necessary in geometry      the several absurdities and contradictions which flowed from this false principle might one would think have been esteemed so many demonstrations against it but by i know not what logic it is held that proofs a posteriori are not to be admitted against propositions relating to infinity as though it were not impossible even for an infinite mind to reconcile contradictions or as if any thing absurd and repugnant could have a necessary connection with truth or flow from it but whoever considers the weakness of this pretense will think it was contrived on purpose to humor the laziness of the mind which had rather acquiesce in an indolent skepticism than be at the pains to go through with a severe examination of those principles it has ever embraced for true    0 of late the speculations about infinites have run so high and grown to such strange notions as have occasioned no small scruples and disputes among the geometers of the present age some there are of great note who not content with holding that finite lines may be divided into an infinite number of parts do yet farther maintain that each of those infinitesimals is it self subdivisible into an infinity of other parts or infinitesimals of a second order and so on ad infinitum these i say assert there are infinitesimals of infinitesimals of infinitesimals etc without ever coming to an end so that according to them an inch does not barely contain an infinite number of parts but an infinity of an infinity of an infinity ad infinitum of parts others there be who hold all orders of infinitesimals below the first to be nothing at all thinking it with good reason absurd to imagine there is any positive quantity or part of extension which though multiplied infinitely can never equal the smallest given extension and yet on the other hand it seems no less absurd to think the square cube or other power of a positive real root should it self be nothing at all which they who hold infinitesimals of the first order denying all of the subsequent orders are obliged to maintain      have we not therefore reason to conclude they are both in the wrong and that there is in effect no such thing as parts infinitely small or an infinite number of parts contained in any finite quantity but you will say that if this doctrine obtains it will follow the very foundations of geometry are destroyed and those great men who have raised that science to so astonishing an height have been all the while building a castle in the air to this it may be replied that whatever is useful in geometry and promotes the benefit of human life does still remain firm and unshaken on our principles that science considered as practical will rather rereive advantage than any prejudice from what has been said but to set this in a due light and show how lines and figures may be measured and their properties investigated without supposing finite extension to be infinitely divisible may be the proper business of another place for the rest though it should follow that some of the more intricate and subtle parts of speculative mathematics may be pared of without any prejudice to truth yet i do not see what damage will be thence derived to mankind on the contrary i think it were highly to be wished that men of the greatest abilities and most obstinate application would draw off their thoughts from those amusements and employ them in the study of such things as lie nearer the concerns of life or have a more direct influence on the manners      if it be said that several theorems undoubtedly true are discovered by methods in which infinitesimals are made use of which could never have been if their existence included a contradiction in it i answer that upon a thorough examination it will not be found that in any instance it is necessary to make use of or conceive infinitesimal parts of finite lines or even quantities less than the minimum sensibile nay it will be evident this is never done it being impossible and whatever mathematicians may think of fluxions or the differential calculus and the like a little reflection will show them that in working by those methods they do not conceive or imagine lines or surfaces less than what are perceivable to sense they may indeed call those little and almost insensible quantities infinitesimals or infinitesimals of infinitesimals if they please but at bottom this is all they being in truth finite nor does the solution of problemes require the supposing any other but this will be more clearly made out hereafter      by what we have hitherto said it is plain that very numerous and and important errors have taken their rise from those false principles which were impugned in the foregoing parts of this treatise and the opposites of those erroneous tenants at the same time appear to be most fruitful principles from whence do flow innumerable consequences highly advantageous to true philosophy as well as to religion particularly matter or the absolute existence of corporeal objects have been shown to be that wherein the most avowed and pernicious enemies of all knowledge whether human or divine have ever placed their chief strength and confidence and surely if by distinguishing the real existence of unthinking things from their being perceived and allowing them a subsistence of their own out of the minds of spirits no one thing is explained in nature but on the contrary a great many inexplicable difficulties arise if the supposition of matter is barely precarious as not being grounded on so much as one single reason if its consequences cannot endure the light of examination and free inquiry but skreen themselves under the dark and general pretense of infinites being incomprehensible if withal the removal of this matter be not attended with the least evil consequence if it be not even missed in the world but every thing as well nay much easier conceived without it if in fine both skeptics and atheists are for ever silenced upon supposing only spirits and ideas and this scheme of things is perfectly agreeable both to reason and religion methinks we may expect it should be admitted and firmly embraced though it were proposed only as an hypothesis and the existence of matter had been allowed possible which yet i think we have evidently demonstrated that it is not      true it is that in consequence of the foregoing principles several disputes and speculations which are esteemed no mean parts of learning are rejected as useless and in effect conversant about nothing at all but how great a prejudice soever against our notions this may give to those who have already been deeply engaged and made large advances in studies of that nature yet by others we hope it will not be thought any just ground of dislike to the principles and tenants herein laid down that they abridge the labor of study and make human sciences far more clear compendious and attainable than they were before      having dispatched what we intended to say concerning the knowledge of ideas the method we proposed leads us in the next place to treat of spirits with regard to which perhaps human knowledge is not so deficient as is vulgarly imagined the great reason that is assigned for our being thought ignorant of the nature of spirits is our not having an idea of it but surely it ought not to be looked on as a defect in a human understanding that it does not perceive the idea of spirit if it is manifestly impossible there should be any such idea and this if i mistake not has been demonstrated in sect xxvii to which i shall here add that a spirit has been shown to be the only substance or support wherein unthinking beings or ideas can exist but that this substance which supports or perceives ideas should it self be an idea or like an idea is evidently absurd      it will perhaps be said that we want a sense as some have imagined proper to know substances withal which if we had we might know our own soul as we do a triangle to this i answer that in case we had a new sense bestowed upon us we could only receive thereby some new sensations or ideas of sense but i believe no body will say that what he means by the terms soul and substance is only some particular sort of idea or sensation we may therefore infer that all things duly considered it is not more reasonable to think our faculties defective in that they do not furnish us with an idea of spirit or active thinking substance than it would be if we should blame them for not being able to comprehend a round square      from the opinion that spirits are to be known after the manner of an idea or sensation have risen many absurd and heterodox tenants and much skepticism about the nature of the soul it is even probable that this opinion may have produced a doubt in some whether they had any soul at all distinct from their body since upon inquiry they could not find they had an idea of it that an idea which is inactive and the existence whereof consists in being perceived should be the image or likeness of an agent subsisting by it self seems to need no other refutation than barely attending to what is meant by those words but perhaps you will say that though an idea cannot resemble a spirit in its thinking acting or subsisting by it self yet it may in some other respects and it is not necessary that an idea or image be in all respects like the original      i answer if it does not in those mentioned it is impossible it should represent it in any other thing do but leave out the power of willing thinking and perceiving ideas and there remains nothing else wherein the idea can be like a spirit for by the word spirit we mean only that which thinks wills and perceives this and this alone constitutes the signification of that term if therefore it is impossible that any degree of those powers should be represented in an idea or notion it is evident there can be no idea or notion of a spirit      but it will be objected that if there is no idea signified by the terms soul spirit and substance they are wholly insignificant or have no meaning in em i answer those words do mean or signify a real thing which is neither an idea nor like an idea but that which perceives ideas and wills and reasons about them what i am my self that which i denote by the term i is the same with what is meant by soul or spiritual substance but if i should say that i was nothing or that i was an idea or notion nothing could be more evidently absurd than either of these propositions you will perhaps insist that this is only quarrelling at a word and that since the immediate significations of other names are by common consent called ideas no reason can be assigned why that which is signified by the name spirit or soul may not partake in the same appellation i answer all the unthinking objects of the mind agree in that they are entirely passive and their existence consists only in being perceived whereas a soul or spirit is an active being whose existence consists not in being perceived but in perceiving ideas and thinking it is therefore necessary in order to prevent equivocation and confounding natures perfectly disagreeing and unlike that we distinguish between spirit and idea vid sect xxvii    0 in a large sense indeed we may be said to have an idea of spirit that is we understand the meaning of the word otherwise we could not affirm or deny any thing of it moreover as we conceive the ideas that are in the minds of other spirits by means of our own which we suppose to be resemblances of them so we know other spirits by means of our own soul which in that sense is the image or idea of them it having a like respect to other spirits that blueness or heat by me perceived has to those ideas perceived by another      the natural immortality of the soul is a necessary consequence of the foregoing doctrine but before we attempt to prove this it is fit that we explain the meaning of that tenent it must not be supposed that they who assert the natural immortality of the soul are of opinion that it is absolutely incapable of annihilation even by the infinite power of the creator who first gave it being but only that it is not liable to be broken or dissolved by the ordinary laws of nature or motion they indeed who hold the soul of man to be only a thin vital flame or system of animal spirits make it perishing and corruptible as the body since there is nothing more easily dissipated than such a being which it is naturally impossible should survive the ruin of the tabernacle wherein it is enclosed and this notion has been greedily embraced and cherished by the worst part of mankind as the most effectual antidote against all impressions of virtue and religion but it has been made evident that bodies of what frame or texture soever are barely passive ideas in the mind which is more distant and heterogeneous from them than light is from darkness we have shown that the soul is indivisible incorporeal unextended and it is consequently incorruptible nothing can be plainer than that the motions changes decays and dissolutions which we hourly see befall natural bodies and which is what we mean by the course of nature cannot possibly affect an active simple uncompounded substance such a being therefore is indissoluble by the force of nature that is to say the soul of man is naturally immortal      after what has been said it is i suppose plain that our souls are not to be known in the same manner as senseless inactive objects or by way of idea spirits and ideas are things so wholly different that when we say they exist they are known or the like these words must not be thought to signify any thing common to both natures there is nothing alike or common in them and to expect that by any multiplication or enlargement of our faculties we may be enabled to know a spirit as we do a triangle seems as absurd as if we should hope to see a sound this is inculcated because i imagine it may be of moment toward clearing several important questions and preventing some very dangerous errors concerning the nature of the soul      it will not be amiss to add that the doctrine of abstract ideas has had no small share in rendering those sciences intricate and obscure which are particularly conversant about spiritual things men have imagined they could frame abstract notions of the powers and acts of the mind and consider them prescinded as well from the mind or spirit it self as from their respective objects and effects hence a great number of dark and ambiguous terms presumed to stand for abstract notions have been introduced into metaphysics and morality and from these have grown infinite distractions and disputes amongst the learned      but nothing seems more to have contributed toward engaging men in controversies and mistakes with regard to the nature and operations of the mind than the being used to speak of those things in terms borrowed from sensible ideas for example the will is termed the motion of the soul this infuses a belief that the mind of man is as a ball in motion impelled and determined by the objects of sense as necessarily as that is by the stroke of a racket hence arise endless scruples and errors of dangerous consequence in morality all which i doubt not may be cleared and truth appear plain uniform and consistent could but philosophers be prevailed on to depart from some received prejudices and modes of speech and retiring into themselves attentively consider their own meaning but the difficulties arising on this head demand a more particular disquisition than suits with the design of this treatise      from what has been said it is plain that we cannot know the existence of other spirits otherwise than by their operations or the ideas by them excited in us i perceive several motions changes and combinations of ideas that inform me there are certain particular agents like my self which accompany them and concur in their production hence the knowledge i have of other spirits is not immediate as is the knowledge of my ideas but depending on the intervention of ideas by me referred to agents or spirits distinct from my self as effects or concomitant signs      but though there be some things which convince us human agents are concerned in producing them yet it is evident to every one that those things which are called the works of nature i e the far greater part of the ideas or sensations perceived by us are not produced by or dependent on the wills of men there is therefore some other spirit that causes them since it is repugnant that they should subsist by themselves see sect xxix but if we attentively consider the constant regularity order and concatenation of natural things the surprising magnificence beauty and perfection of the larger and the exquisite contrivance of the smaller parts of the creation together with the exact harmony and correspondence of the whole but above all the never enough admired laws of pain and pleasure and the instincts or natural inclinations appetites and passions of animals i say if we consider all these things and at the same time attend to the meaning and import of the attributes one eternal infinitely wise good and perfect we shall clearly perceive that they belong to the aforesaid spirit who works all in all and by whom all things consist      hence it is evident that god is known as certainly and immediately as any other mind or spirit whatsoever distinct from our selves we may even assert that the existence of god is far more evidently perceived than the existence of men because the effects of nature are infinitely more numerous and considerable than those ascribed to human agents there is not any one mark that denotes a man or effect produced by him which does not more strongly evince the being of that spirit who is the author of nature for it is evident that in affecting other persons the will of man has no other object than barely the motion of the limbs of his body but that such a motion should be attended by or excite any idea in the mind of another depends wholly on the will of the creator he alone it is who upholding all things by the word of his power maintains that intercourse between spirits whereby they are able to perceive the existence of each other and yet this pure and clear light which enlightens every one is it self invisible to the greatest part of mankind      it seems to be a general pretense of the unthinking herd that they cannot see god could we but see him say they as we see a man we should believe that he is and believing obey his commands but alas we need only open our eyes to see the sovereign lord of all things with a more full and clear view than we do any one of our fellow creatures not that i imagine we see god as some will have it by a direct and immediate view or see corporeal things not by themselves but by seeing that which represents them in the essence of god which doctrine is i must confess to me incomprehensible but i shall explain my meaning a human spirit or person is not perceived by sense as not being an idea when therefore we see the color size figure and motions of a man we perceive only certain sensations or ideas excited in our own minds and these being exhibited to our view in sundry distinct collections serve to mark out unto us the existence of finite and created spirits like our selves hence it is plain we do not see a man if by man is meant that which lives moves perceives and thinks as we do but only such a certain collection of ideas as directs us to think there is a distinct principle of thought and motion like to our selves accompanying and represented by it and after the same manner we see god all the difference is that whereas some one finite and narrow assemblage of ideas denotes a particular human mind whithersoever we direct our view we do at all times and in all places perceive manifest tokens of the divinity every thing we see hear feel or any wise perceive by sense being a sign or effect of the power of god as is our perception of those very motions which are produced by men      it is therefore plain that nothing can be more evident to any one that is capable of the least reflection than the existence of god or a spirit who is intimately present to our minds producing in them all that variety of ideas or sensations which continually affect us on whom we have an absolute and entire dependence in short in whom we live and move and have our being that the discovery of this great truth which lies so near and obvious to the mind should be attained to by the reason of so very few is a sad instance of the stupidity and inattention of men who tho they are surrounded with such clear manifestations of the deity are yet so little affected by them that they seem as it were blinded with excess of light    0 but you will say has nature no share in the production of natural things and must they be all ascribed to the immediate and sole operation of god i answer if by nature is meant only the visible series of effects or sensations imprinted on our minds according to certain fixed and general laws then it is plain that nature taken in this sense cannot produce any thing at all but if by nature is meant some being distinct from god as well as from the laws of nature and things perceived by sense i must confess that word is to me an empty sound without any intelligible meaning annexed to it nature in this acceptance is a vain chimera introduced by those heathens who had not just notions of the omnipresence and infinite perfection of god but it is more unaccountable that it should be received among christians professing belief in the holy scriptures which constantly ascribe those effects to the immediate hand of god that heathen philosophers are wont to impute to nature the lord he causes the vapors to ascend he makes lightnings with rain he brings forth the wind out of his treasures jerem chap  0 v    he turns the shadow of death into the morning and makes the day dark with night amos chap   v   he visits the earth and makes it soft with showers he blesses the springing thereof and crowns the year with his goodness so that the pastures are clothed with flocks and the valleys are covered over with corn see psalm    but notwithstanding that this is the constant language of scripture yet we have i know not what aversion from believing that god concerns himself so nearly in our affairs fain would we suppose him at a great distance off and substitute some blind unthinking deputy in his stead tho if we may believe saint paul he be not far from every one of us      it will i doubt not be objected that the slow gradual and roundabout methods observed in the production of natural things do not seem to have for their cause the immediate hand of an almighty agent besides monsters untimely births fruits blasted in the blossom rains falling in desert places miseries incident to human life and the like are so many arguments that the whole frame of nature is not immediately actuated and superintended by a spirit of infinite wisdom and goodness but the answer to this objection is in a good measure plain from sect lxii it being visible that the aforesaid methods of nature are absolutely necessary in order to working by the most simple and general rules and after a steady and consistent manner which argues both the wisdom and goodness of god for it does hence follow that the finger of god is not so conspicuous to the resolved and careless sinner which gives him an oppertunity to harden in his impiety and grow ripe for vengeance vid sect lvii such is the artificial contrivance of this mighty machine of nature that whilst its motions and various phenomenon strike on our senses the hand which actuates the whole is it self unperceivable to men of flesh and blood verily says the prophet thou art a god that hidest thy self isaiah chap    ver    but tho the lord conceal himself from the eyes of the sensual and lazy who will not be at the least expense of thought yet to an unbiassed and attentive mind nothing can be more plainly legible than the intimate presence of an allwise spirit who fashions regulates and sustains the whole system of beings secondly it is clear from what we have elsewhere observed that the operating according to general and stated laws is so necessary for our guidance in the affairs of life and letting us into the secret of nature that without it all reach and compass of thought all human sagacity and design could serve to no manner of purpose it were even impossible there should be any such faculties or powers in the mind vid sect xxxi which one consideration abundantly outballances whatever particular inconveniences may thence arise      but we should further consider that the very blemishes and defects of nature are not without their use in that they make an agreeable sort of variety and augment the beauty of the rest of the creation as shades in a picture serve to set off the brighter and more enlightened parts we would likewise do well to examine whether our taxing the waste of seeds and embryos and accidental destruction of plants and animals before they come to full maturity as an imprudence in the author of nature be not the effect of prejudice contracted by our familiarity with impotent and saving mortals in man indeed a thrifty management of those things which he cannot procure without much pains and industry may be esteemed wisdom but we must not imagine that the inexplicably fine machine of an animal or vegetable costs the great creator any more pains or trouble in its production than a pebble does nothing being more evident than that an omnipotent spirit can indifferently produce every thing by a mere fiat or act of his will hence it is plain that the splendid profusion of natural things should not be interpreted weakness or prodigality in the agent who produces them but rather be looked on as an argument of the riches of his power      as for the mixture of pain or uneasiness which is in the world pursuant to the general laws of nature and the actions of finite imperfect spirits this in the state we are in at present is indispensibly necessary to our wellbeing but our prospects are too narrow we take for instance the idea of some one particular pain into our thoughts and account it evil whereas if we enlarge our view so as to comprehend the various ends connexions and dependencies of things on what occasions and in what proportions we are affected with pain and pleasure the nature of human freedom and the design with which we are put into the world we shall be forced to acknowledge that those particular things which considered in themselves appear to be evil have the nature of good when considered as linked with the whole system of beings      from what has been said it will be manifest to any considering person that it is merely for want of attention and comprehensiveness of mind that there are any favorers of atheism or the manichaean heresy to be found little and unreflecting souls may indeed burlesque the works of providence the beauty and order whereof they have not capacity or will not be at the pains to comprehend but those who are masters of any justness and extent of thought and are withal used to reflect can never sufficiently admire the divine traces of wisdom and goodness that shine throughout the economy of nature but what truth is there which glares so strongly on the mind that by an aversion of thought a wilful shutting of the eyes we may not escape seeing it at least with a full and direct view is it therefore to be wondered at if the generality of men who are ever intent on business or pleasure and little used to fix or open the eye of their mind should not have all that conviction and evidence of the being of god which might be expected in reasonable creatures      we should rather admire that men can be found so stupid as to neglect than that neglecting they should be unconvinced of such an evident and momentous truth and yet it is to be feared that too mamy of parts and leisure who live in christian countries are merely through a supine and dreadful negligence sunk into a sort of demyatheism they cannot say there is not a god but neither are they convinced that there is for what else can it be but some lurking infidelity some secret misgivings of mind with regard to the existence and attributes of god which permits sinners to grow and harden in impiety since it is downright impossible that a soul pierced and enlightened with a thorough sense of the omnipresence holiness and justice of that almighty spirit should persist in a remorsless violation of his laws we ought therefore earnestly to meditate and dwell on those important points that so we may attain conviction without all scruple that the eyes of the lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good that he is with us and keeps us in all places whither we go and gives us bread to eat and raiment to put on that he is present and conscious to our innermost thoughts in fine that we have a most absolute and immediate dependence on him a clear view of which great truths cannot choose but fill our hearts with an awful circumspection and holy fear which is the strongest incentive to virtue and the best guard against vice      for after all what deserves the first place in our studies is the consideration of god and our duty which to promote as it was the the main drift and design of my labors so shall i esteem them altogether useless and ineffectual if by what i have said i cannot inspire my readers with a pious sense of the presence of god and having shown the falseness or vanity of those barren speculations which make the chief employment of learned men the better dispose them to reverence and embrace the salutary truths of the gospel which to know and to practice is the highest perfection of human nature  finis
