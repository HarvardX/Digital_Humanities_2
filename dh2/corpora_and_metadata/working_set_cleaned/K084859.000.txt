a short view of the difficulties and discouragements attending those who enter into holy orders  by john latham rector of echingham in sussex   omnia far si potes et debes  juv london printed for w parker at the kings head in st pauls churchyard mdccxxxvi  price   s  the preface i dont question but that a treatise of this nature will be esteemed by a great many at this time when we see such numbers crowding into the pulpit to be either a sinister or vain attempt and already confuted by experience for were the difficulties and discouragements real they may imagine that the effect of them would be quickly seen in the paucity of candidates for holy orders the calamities they may plead of those already in the profession would give warning to others  this observation though it be allowed to hold good in respect of many secular employments and occupations insomuch that when the number of hands exceed the demands or any failure abridge the gains and make it impossible for a great many of those who are concerned in any particular craft to get a comfortable subsistence by it general clamours are presently heard and as if even some contagion had infected it none are willing to engage themselves or any of their family in it yet must it be confessed that hitherto its influence has not affected the ministry neither has the church been deprived of one professor notwithstanding that they have had as reasonable grounds for complaints as any body of men whatsoever  what this is to be imputed to is not so easy to determine i shall seek out no other solution of this matter but what a very learned man has given us  while says he i resided at oxford and saw such a conflux of youth to their annual admissions i have often studied and admired why their parents would under such mean encouragements design their sons for the church and those the most towardly and capable and select geniuss among their children who must needs have emergd in a secular life i congratulated indeed the felicity of your establishment which attracted the choice youth of your nation for such very low pay but my wonder was at the parents who generally have interest maintenance and wealth the first thing in their view till at last one of your state lotteries ceased my astonishment for as in that a few glittering prizes  000  000  0000 pounds among an infinity of blanks drew troops of adventurers who if the whole fund had been equally ticketed out would never have come in so a few dignities in your church prebends deaneries bishoprics are the pious fraud that induces and decoys the parents to risk their childs fortune in it every one hopes his own will get some great prize in the church and never reflects on the thousands of blanks in poor country livings  this lets us into the mystery and at once discovers the reason why the church is so fully stocked with divines the parents hope and expect in a little time to see their children dignified but when upon trial they have found their hopes to have been fallacious it is then that the difficulties and discouragements appear in their true light and what should have been foreseen is by sad experience felt  to prevent the unwary from being surprised and the church from being burdened with those who have no other views but of being supported by it is the design of the ensuing discourse  it is very far from my thoughts or purpose to degrade the office for which i have the greatest reverence and esteem neither would i for the whole world contribute was i able to the detaining sufficient numbers from the service of god and by that means make the church destitute of which at present there seems to be no danger the danger is rather from the reverse for supernumeraries there are at present who might very well be spared for whom since there is no provision there is therefore no occasion for them but now it is too late to remedy an inconvenience so sensibly felt by many  if i could therefore be at all instrumental in diverting for the time to come by laying the difficulties and discouragements before them any from entering into this sacred office who upon serious reflection should be thought unable to encounter with them if i could persuade those to seclude themselves or rather their friends to find out some properer employment for them from whom there can be little hope or probability of their ever being very serviceable to the church and if they alone would offer themselves for admission whose abilities enable them to do service and their pious resolutions prompt them to undertake it in spite of all the hardships they are like to meet with if my endeavors to effect this have but the least success my intention is answered and even if they have not i have still the private satisfaction of meaning well  a short view of the difficulties etc it will be allowed i believe that a more than ordinary influence of divine grace is not expected or requisite as a qualification for the being admitted into holy orders when any offer themselves for these they cannot with any truth affirm that they are moved by any stronger or more sensible impulse of the holy spirit than is common to themselves or to any other good men in the exercise of christian duties nor if they had a mind to deceive others with it could they gain their belief  the inducement which they have allowing for the inward and ordinary motion of the holy ghost which they trust that they have and for some pious resolutions is the consequence of their education and their being brought up and designed for this office even before they themselves knew what it was  our church is neither stocked with miraculous gifts nor pretends to any it suffices without them if those that desire to serve at her altars come recommended for regularity of life and bring along with them a requisite portion of learning which latter small as it is however qualifies according to canon and is generally accepted of by the governors of our church though they have it in their power if they think proper to refuse orders without giving any reason for it but such is the unhappy state of those who have been all along educated for this purpose and this is all too many have to plead that should they be rejected it would be too late to turn their hands to any thing else their fortune which might have enabled them to have done it being already spent and their parents relations and friends being so much concerned in it and their hearts so much set upon it that our right reverend bishops very seldom make use of their authority without some legal impediment  granting then that orders may be sometimes had on pretty easy terms in regard to the article of learning and that therefore a deacon is at length sprung up in the family yet what mighty prospect is there for the youth thus barely furnished if his fortune is now to make and his title is his all which is commonly the case that for the most part leads him into the country to some scanty obscure curacy just enough to keep him alive and happy is it for him that he is thrown into some solitary barbarous place where his audience is so well adapted to his abilities for here he may by weekly labor by plodding and torturing and racking his brains squeeze out something whether coherent or incoherent it is no matter which with much ado by changing and exchanging and the assistance of some necessary though very indifferent helps may be licked into the model of a thing commonly called a sermon from hence the congregation is to learn the importance of religion and oftentimes because they know no better are pleased with and applaud their preacher especially when nature which has been sparing of brains has made amends for that defect in lungs  this you will say is a singular felicity and very lucky for him but if the young theologue should not be satisfied with this but fired with the praises of his congregation should imagine that they are not much mistaken in him and should therefore aspire a little higher how can we conceive which way his ends are to be brought to pass how can we trace him out any further those who have any preferments in their gifts of any considerable value are very often judicious and discerning and if they have no relation or particular friend or dependant to oblige they are then willing to oblige themselves and to show their knowledge of men are generally inclined to prefer one of learning and good accomplishments that from thence some of the credit and reputation of the clerk may be reflected on the patron  this one would think should put a check upon the aspiring thoughts of my young divine or if notwithstanding he will take his level it must be at something which his betters have refused and which if he gets it is because nobody else would accept of it the value of which we may easily guess when even such numbers of learned and very worthy men are so meanly provided for  i should descend further and view him in this his accidental benefice and now in his meridian settled in the world and beginning to think that it is not good for man to be alone but here i shall leave him his condition in this state being much better already described in a ludicrous manner than i can do in a serious one  however as the fault is not to be charged on the unhappy sufferer it being impossible for any one to correct natural defects this should be a warning to parents not to engage their children in this sort of education till their abilities have been impartially weighed by them themselves or which is better without having first had the opinion of those who may be properer judges of them this is however little regarded for too often the most unpromising child of the family is pitched upon and he whom the father thinks to be unfit for any thing else is dedicated to the service of god by which we may guess at the understanding and piety of the father and presage the future misery of the unhappy son and be sure to find him where i before left him contemptible ignorance and stupidity as well as barbarous cruelty to his own child what does it require some extraordinary talent to whoop after bullocks and whistle after sheep a mighty genius to weigh a pound of figs or to measure a yard of tape whilst any thing will serve for the altars of god pity is it and injurious to society that such sordid parents should have the disposal of and authority to ruin their own children but i am heartily tired with this melancholy scene though it be a true description of the unhappy case of many who might perhaps have made very pretty graziers or notable handicrafts  i confess that i have hitherto been dealing in dreggs and drawing out the prospect only of incapables the burdens of the church and very often it is reproach and scandal these therefore may be thought exceptions and the unlucky star reigning at their birth to have been in fault but that every thing goes smoothly on with those whose natural capacities are suitable to the task they undertake i wish it was so and that there were no ruggs in their way but since there are i shall not hide them  to begin with the studies of those who are capable of them for to be capable is nothing without application a power to move without actually putting himself into motion will never bring a man to his journeys end he therefore that designs to take holy orders and would rightly qualify for them so far as to commence a workman that need not be ashamed must with uncommon diligence bend his mind to the study of the three learned languages the latin greek and hebrew for these are the keys to knowledge and he that thinks to open the lock without them will find himself much mistaken as he likewise will if he does not set about these betimes for it has been seldom found that they who begin to learn a language at the meridian or decline of life make any great proficiency or become skilful professors of it but here i must beg not to be misunderstood as if i meant that it was expected of a young student at the age of three and twenty to be a perfect master of these languages i only mean that he ought to make what progress he can in them along with his other studies before he comes for holy orders that hereafter he may go on with the greater ease  and what wearisome days and watchful nights does this undertaking require what deep meditation and recollection to treasure up words in the memory and to store it with the knowledge of things how often must he beat them over separate divide and digest them before he will be ready in calling them forth upon occasion or be able to express himself elegantly clearly and judiciously  little enough for this work is the greatest part of his time and many diversions must he maugre to which youth are naturally inclinable the most ingenious as well as others for the quicker the taste the stronger the appetite and the brightest parts are not always the fittest for application  be that as it will adherence is absolutely necessary and they that set light to it be their natural talents ever so good they will never supply the defects of idleness or gloss over their ignorance which if it does not appear in downright stupidity and dullness it will however show itself in pertness and in palpable blunders and mistakes  fully for this reason must the most promising youth resolve either to be content not to shine in the church or to be industrious  for so far will he be without it from being entitled to any manner of applause and reputation that he will only add one more to the number of possibilities  notwithstanding the truth of this as if idleness wanted patronage and encouragement the learned languages are commonly talked of and represented as dead languages and that by those who for their own sakes should have been silent and concealed their own shame and not have declared their ignorance of them by this expression upon which to put the right genuine interpretation it is that the representers are dead to the languages and to all good intents and purposes in respect of their profession  what the learned languages dead and useless to clergymen to whom is committed the custody of the law and the prophets the gospels and epistles  is there not a peculiar idiom belonging to all languages more particularly to the hebrew tongue and are there not some moral and political words in the greek to which none answer in other languages and which are hardly to be fully expressed in them or can the sense and meaning of any author be so exactly understood in translation as in the original language in which it was wrote  if this is manifestly the case in respect of the holy scriptures what notable commentators should we have without understanding greek or hebrew they would soon verify the parable can the blind lead the blind shall they not both fall into the ditch  to silence therefore this senseless pretense let us for once suppose that a general infatuation had seized on the most learned part of the english clergy and that they were all fallen from their present glory and the reputation which they justly have all over europe for their skill in all parts of learning fallen so far that there was not one of them left who had any manner of knowledge of the greek or hebrew tongues what a fine piece of work would the freethinkers and libertines of this age make with the holy scriptures and consequently religion who though but smatterers in languages yet when they had only ignoramuss to deal with they might interpret as they pleased and slip any thing upon the church for should they affirm that such and such passages in the translation of the holy scriptures were spurious and false and quite contrary to the original and what would be more likely than for them to do this who under such circumstances could contradict them  the church so ably supported with learning as it is at present can scarcely prevent these miscreants making some proselytes amongst the giddy weak and luxurious but take away this support it must of course sink and a torrent of all manner of errors and vices would soon break in like a deluge upon us and if they could prevail so far we should soon have the doctrines of epicurus established by law and fathered upon the scriptures  but the danger from that quarter would not be the only one to be feared for what if the papists should get the custody of the scriptures again i mean of the original languages in which they were wrote might we not in a little time expect to see twelve more new lucrative articles of faith tacked to pope pius his creed they might pawm as they would upon us if they did but pretend that they found them in the original and clamor loudly against our translation as partial and defective for there would be no other remedy than recurring to the original but this would not be in the power of our clergy to do  is it not therefore absolutely necessary for those who wish prosperity to our church and religion and design to engage themselves in the ministry to prepare themselves for it by labor and study as much as may be before they enter upon it and afterward likewise to continue the same and this i would recommend to the timely consideration of both them and their friends whether they think they will be able to undertake this and go through it and even to persevere to the end of their lives or so long as their faculties remain entire  there is nothing to be done without it for the greatest genius cultivated as it ought through the short time of life allotted is not able to reach to or comprehend all parts of science or scarcely to finish or clear up one which takes away all pleas for laziness and baffles the sufficiency of some who perhaps have the least reason of any to pretend to it for was there any allowable excuse to justify this in one the same would allow it to another and so at last to all which would of course draw after it the consequences i a little before repeated one clergyman might plead his right to laziness another his and so all till at length religion would be left to shift for itself  which observation every clergyman who is a wellwisher to true religion ought to apply to himself and to consider though the church at present may thrive well enough upon the stock of learning which the great men of it to their honor possess that it is but a mean and beggarly thing to take shelter under the merits of others for should no emulators of their great accomplishments hereafter arise we should soon see religion brought to a very low ebb and even whilst these great lights remain amongst us what numbers of congregations in the mean season whom their influence cannot reach must suffer and be in the dark unless their guides to whose particular charge they are committed take care to enlighten themselves and then their flock  when the care of souls becomes the undertaking of any their labor and industry ought as far as possible in all respects relating to them to be proportionable to the worth of them nor can the ignorance and meanness of those with whom they are entrusted ever be a reasonable excuse for their own because they are sent on purpose to clear up their blindness and errors and if they dont strive as much as they can to effect this they do but trifle in their office and show themselves unfit for the task they have undertaken  every one therefore that is lawfully allowed to be put in trust with the gospel ought to lay his hand upon his heart and seriously reflect on the duty incumbent on him and if it should happen to be his lot to attend upon the weak in understanding he should on that account be so far from despising them or from thinking that he has then freedom to indulge or that any thing though ever so mean will serve their turns that instead thereof he ought to double his diligence and take more than ordinary pains in showing them the right paths in which they ought to walk this is the duty of a good clergyman and the end of his office and every one that is in earnest will think so and act agreeable thereto  for whatever some may think or even by experience find that there is no necessity for all this pains and trouble since there are easier and shorter ways and in some respects more meritorious of getting at what they may set their heart upon yet let me tell them that many of those ways are dishonest and dishonorable bring contempt upon their order and whilst true merit is wanting make them secretly despised even by those whose designs they are carrying on for nothing is surer than that a good stock of learning integrity and virtue joined with a prudent conduct are the only true recommendations and which alone can command applause respect and esteem  it is by these that the affections of the sober and judicious part of the laity are riveted in the favor and love of the clergy and good opinion of religion and it is by these that even from the profane and injudicious part of them a secret reverence is drawn  all men are apt to admire those of exalted abilities and superior to their own truths displaid and defended by such advocates enter deep into the hearts of the hearers the convictions of their own minds cannot fail of drawing their assent to them and whether the want of such endowments has not very often given occasion both to the contempt of some of the clergy and religion i will leave every one to determine as he pleases  the generality of the better sort of the laity whatever may be thought of them by some neither want learning good sense or kind inclinations they are as quicksighted as any whatever are as good judges of men and pleased with merit whenever they find it but if through neglect or supineness the clergy sink below their proper standard they must not expect to conceal their ignorance and meanness nor think themselves injured if respect is withdrawn from them since when the case is thus they are not unjustly dealt by for the laity then have a right to resentment and to complain their interest is concerned the relation which the clergy stand in to them as spiritual guides will be their justification for if a gentleman might justly censure and contemn his lawyer or physician who should puzzle his title to his estate or endanger his life through blunders much greater reason has he to think meanly of those who are so ill qualified to take care of his soul which is of infinitely greater value but to have done with this  let us then suppose a due application and improvement to have been made and that the young divine sets out in the world with all laudable accomplishments and that he is upon the stock of these alone to make his future fortune being thus prepared i will not send him down into the country to a curacy though that is the lot at first of many worthy and deserving young men but will bring him into the world and place him in the way to preferment amongst the great the rich and distinguished part of mankind and who are likewise able to distinguish merit in others and have power to reward it  let him be fixed then in the metropolis it may be thought that now i have got him here i may design to list him among the city drudges nothing less i can assure you i have more regard for merit  in this desirable and happy situation being stocked with a sufficient portion of learning rhetoric and eloquence it is likely ever long by an artful management of them that he may attract the eyes of his superiors and that they may begin to look upon him as a person that ought to be taken notice of the expected and lucky hour now approaches and the young man is pitched upon perhaps to be chaplain to some great man that a single patron may engross all the merit or if he happens to be more popular than ordinary the united voice of numbers may compliment him with a lectureship in town let us then survey him in both these situations whether he have the one or the other as likewise in their sequel  first then we will suppose him taken into the family of some great man for his chaplain that is as one who is to look after the concerns of religion in the family a spiritual steward who by virtue of his office is as much obliged to take care of my lords spiritual affairs as his temporal steward of his estate and is not to let him or his family without warning or through his neglect squander or keep behind hand too much with heaven and run into arrears because some time or other he may be called to an account for it if he does if we suppose a chaplain without this privilege he is but a cipher and like a piece of old plate in a family which serves only to adorn and grace a sidetable but is of no further use  but fancy for once that my lord should not be in a disposition for prayer and that he may have so much business in this world that he may not have leizure to hear any thing about another and that it would be thought impertinent and be in vain to talk any thing to him about it and that his family willing to imitate so shining an example might think themselves likewise better employed i dont know of any remedy in this case but being content to say grace if he can prevail so far as to do this when my lord dines alone for at public times i suppose it of course it being part of the pomp  o happy change of times for he may not only say grace but sit down at table too and that for the most part as long as others this then has silenced the wits and bilkd them of their satire and they would be glad now the tables are turned to exchange their jokes for some of the desert  no he does not withdraw and creep about like a thief in a corner and watch the table narrowly till some compassionate guest condescends to slide him a sweetmeat but with a modest mein fingers among the rest though it must be confessed that the doubtfulness of his title abates some of his assurance it being rather by courtesy than by right that he takes  at other times if he is a man of some tolerable address he may be permitted to help to spend some of my lords retired hours and here the foundation of his future fortune is to be laid if his conversation pleases and his demeanor strikes his patrons fancy his business is done and happy is it for him if this comes to pass free from encumbrances and no contracted stains pollute his virtue nor any poor female relation of the family or favorite abigail blast his promising hopes  some very good benefice we will suppose then is designed for him and that when it falls he is put into possession of it and that as a good shepherd partly careful of his flock and partly tired with attendance and dependence he goes down and resides upon it  all cares now his wants are supplied may be thought at an end and that he has nothing more to think of along with his duty and his studies but the enjoyment of himself this one would think very reasonable and what might be expected but for all this there may and in all probability will be an unexpected aftergame is he sure of his dues after he has got his benefice that he has a legal and just title to his tithes as clear as any man has to his estate or goods is most certain and likewise as good a remedy for the recovery of them  in short is there not some one or more sturdy covetous peasant in his parish the short character of whom take from dr south who says nothing is so rude and insolent as a wealthy rustic en nostri fundi calamitas the caterpillar that will either eat up part of your tenths or destroy your quiet and put you to difficulties in recovering that which you have a better right to than he has to what is in his old leathern purse at home if this harpy through the negligence want of skill or timidity of your predecessor has set his claws for several years into one part out of three of the tithes in his own occupation by having shuffled him into some easy composition either by having abused his credulity or by any other fraudulent tricking way you may as well venture to take a lamb ravished from your flock out of the mouth of a wolf as to meddle with this old sacrilegious  handle him but ever so gently and he cries out he is pinched and that you are rapacious and greedy and that if you dont take care he will be even with you and it is ten to one but that he is so for a whole volume would hardly contain all the little arts these misers invent at the instigation of their malice to effect this and therefore i shall not trouble you with a history of them  but abating the uneasiness which must sometimes arise from this ill usage yet what a hopeful prospect have you of the success of your ministry what a mighty influence will it be sure in particular to have over this old cormorant who if alone it would not be so much matter but because of his circumstances you cannot expect him to be without dependants and adherents and perhaps a pretty many too for take this for certain that the merits of the cause will not be examined into and it is more likely that the sheep will follow one another even though a scabby one is their leader than that they will follow their shepherd  this then you see may be some check upon your promising hopes of future ease satisfaction and quiet but happy would it be for you was this the only impediment for what if you should find in your parish a pretty large collection of protestant dissenters you may be very sanguine and laugh at this indeed and ask what danger is there from such conscientious men before it is true when you had to deal with one whose conscience avarice had devoured some evil might naturally ensue but in the present case it is not likely for with whom could we wish to have commerce sooner than with men of so much purity i wish your security does not entangle you would you like to have so many spies upon all your actions this you may judge to be so far from being any inconvenience that it will be an incitement to you to have a stricter guard over yourself and by that means draw advantage from what looked untowardly at first but will innocence be always a protection to you or was ever man so innocent as not to be guilty of daily slips these failings then to which human nature subjects us all you may expect to have blazed abroad and perhaps magnified and this too out of religious zeal and in order to make proselytes  for no men are more diligent that way than these our protestant brethren and there is no way more likely for them to gain their ends by than by undermining you in the good opinion of your people for even the vulgar pretend to be judges of mens actions will decide upon them though they are far from being able to judge of the merits of the cause in dispute between the dissenters and us by this means then you see you may in all probability have some of your flock purloind from you and this i am sure you would not very well like for some mortification it must needs be to see them exult and triumph with joy over any of your poor converted sheep though ever so mean and ignorant  but you may imagine that a little wary conduct may place you upon better terms with them and a little condescension bring you nearer together and that you are not too stiff they will like you the better now you begin indeed to be something nearer the matter and to show yourself to be a man of a calm head and promise fair to be popular in time for to become all things to all men is very engaging i suppose then to please them you will in your discourses or writings model the sacraments according to their liking throw down enclosures level the pastors of the church of christ and tell them that the differences between them and us are only nominal this indeed would be obliging might merit their attention a little and would make them begin to think that you was a man of some grace but if this is all you would do they would hardly believe you to be thoroughly in earnest nay they would think that you had more of a courtier in you than a primitive christian for what true value could they have for such a lukewarn advocate as you even if you was a prelate whilst you set fast in your stall and will not surrender it or part of it as well as your principles  they will compare you to a man that looks out of his window from a warm room in cold weather and sees several poor objects starving without and cries out i have a good opinion of you be warm my brethren but will not admit them in as partners to share with him in his good fire  i dont know what can make the dissenters think themselves more treacherously dealt with than such usage since it is directly striking at the root of a darling doctrine of some of them which is that the saints should inherit the earth  this double dealing then will not long serve your turn they will smell you out in time and think you as bad as the rest for if you will only undermine your gospel right but still hold your legal right how are they the nearer to the ends they aim at either then dont be quite so complaisant or be more so and give up all at once and then you will get rid of all your troubles together but if you are not willing to do this i must leave you here to manage as well as you can or if you are tired of it i will bring you into town and view you in a lectureship  some peculiar and winning endowments where so many are concerned must have brought this to pass but what they may be by name i shall not further enquire  i cannot give him better advice in this new station than that of horace  servetur ad imum qualis ab incepto processerit    the same spirit which gained him favor at first must be maintained if he has a mind to keep it  men of all professions of all ranks and conditions will be his audience here and therefore matters must be carried with a very even hand and no reflections levelled no vices publicly reproved though absolutely necessary to be so which any considerable part of his congregation may apply to themselves that is if he has a mind to have the same good graces continued with which he sets out and if he can be withal content to part with his integrity and hazard his future happiness for the sake of them  i have heard but the case is not exactly parallel because it was upon his preaching upon approbation of a man who afterward made a very good figure in the learned world that lost one of these lectureships in town for choosing these words for his text let him that stole steal no more and if i am not mistaken the major part of the electors at that time were vintners and tailors  caution and circumspection are therefore requisite and if a man have a mind to please that saying that the truth ought not to be spoken at all times can never be more applicable than in his present station if it was not for that necessary thing called duty  we have all heard of the court chaplain who thought it ill manners to mention hell and damnation in the kings chapel such harsh words he might imagine would sound oddly in such illustrious ears they might indeed in his opinion be proper enough in some mean inferior congregations where the threatening to send them to the devil might be the only way to keep them from him but the great the rich and powerful it may be he thought would take it amiss at his hands should he alarm them with terrors and threatenings  where there are such numbers of people as are to be seen in some of the churches in the city a great part of whom abound in wealth with which we all of us are too apt to be intoxicated and amongst whom notwithstanding they meet in the same place there are such great diversities in opinion that i dont know a harder task than a lecturer i will say incumbent whom i take to be on the same foot in several respects has to adjust nicely these difficulties and to behave himself with such discretion so as not to offend they indeed that can so moderate matters without sinful and base compliances are unusually happy but if this is not their lot and some are offended only perhaps because they will be so then does the town presently ring with bitter reproaches and invectives and their doors and their purses too are immediately shut and no entrance to be had but upon legal demand  but courage this perhaps may never happen nay more your company may be welcome amongst them wherever there is good cheer to be found and the doctor may be expected to be there to sanctify the feast  here will open to us one of the most ridiculous scenes we have hitherto met with and which will require some management too have you never seen at these invitations a little pert fellow in a laced wastcoat or perhaps plain newly arrived perchance from abroad or perhaps lately redeemed from behind the counter by the death of some relation who had no more sense than to leave the blockhead a plentiful fortune to spend if you have not already seen him it is odds but you will find him at one of these merry meetings  you may go all the world over and not meet with so ridiculous an object as this is unless it be of the same species and shape  this thing who does not know where he is or what he is or how to take one regular step yet being naturally dully pert and perhaps told by his new footman or his old sedentary computing comrades or others that it is high time for him to set up for a gentleman he begins to be of their mind and because a gentleman should have something besides the benevolence of fortune to distinguish him from the herd he therefore sets up for a wit too and what so fit to set out with as with the contempt of religion and the clergy take care of yourself therefore or he will be upon you he will so doctor you about that you will have scarcely time to put one morsel into your mouth without being asked some impertinent question or he will fling at the bottlescrew or nolo episcopari if he has learned to sound the words or some other trifling stale topic which i should be ashamed so much as to mention could i think of these reptiles without it  but hold a little perhaps he may have got the names of some of the articles of faith or some of the ceremonies of the church i mention the names because i can assure you that he knows no more of them or their meaning than he does of one word in the latin or greek or any other language but what his mother or nurse taught him  granting all this yet how do you think to manage with this animal you will say i suppose being a man of learning and sense that you heartily despise him there is reason in this i confess but will this stop his mouth or are there not sometimes in the company some who are as weak and vain as himself and who being void of good sense and good manners may be pleased with his ribaldry and impertinence and may therefore laugh heartily at it or are there not even some sober wise and thinking people in company with you who may nt be entirely averse to this babbling you may think that they have too much wit to be pleased and so they have to be pleased with the man they having the same contemptible opinion of the wretch that you have but are you certain that all this while they dont laugh in their sleeves for to see a proud priest mortified which is the common appellation is very bewitching let it be done how it will  tell me now if you sit altogether easy notwithstanding or whether some of your satisfaction is not abated if it is not you have a mighty frame of spirits for most men though barked at by the most pitiful little mongrill curr are under some concern for their heels and the braying of the ass is disagreeable though every one knows the nature of the beast  this then is an evil which will for ever haunt you in the city nothing is so common as these whifling creatures about town they are as constant at entertainments as flies at the shambles  but you will say are not the great men of our church a sovereign antidote even against all degrees of this sort of vermin do not the hares and bentleys like sunbeams acting on pestilential vapors disperse and make clear all around so far i will agree with you that nothing can be keener than their penns and that they are terrors to all the scribbling part of the fraternity but the bablers are left to the inferior clergy if you can find a remedy for these you will exceed the whole college of physicians for when the pineal gland is disordered they are all at a loss where to cut to make a cure you must therefore at last turn them over amongst the incurables as such virulent scabs in the body politic which dr ward himself was he in your condition would hardly venture to undertake  i must not forget another part of the inferior clergy and those of them too who promise the fairest of any for an exemption i mean those of great families and good fortunes of their own and who are therefore independent  these i confess are as happy as they that have got cloaks in rainy weather when others have none but when the storm hangs heavy over their heads it is odds but they will feel some of the damp  a bungler can never gain credit in any profession nor can a journeyman atone for the masters defects if then they will take as they in conscience ought the duty and service of their function upon themselves they must have the same qualifications with others and use the same labor to attain them or expect to become objects of ridicule and derision and the more too on the account of their distinction  every one will be inquisitive and ask how it comes to pass if they can have any plea for the question that one who might have lived comfortably without the revenues of the church should thrust himself into it only for the sake of them so far then are such from being at liberty to indulge or to be indolent and negligent in their office or in the qualifying for it that they have rather a spurr to it beyond others because they may be supposed to be in the fairest way to the highest preferments of the church to aim at which without all the laudable qualities necessary for them would be a reproach on themselves and if they should get them would be such a stain on the church as none who have any regard to any thing further than themselves would be willing to throw upon it for all those who have a true love for religion or our church wish to see none in the highest stations of it but men remarkable for learning orthodoxy morality and integrity such men alone can be its ornament credit and support who rather cast a luster on their office than their office on them and if such are to be found amongst those of high birth and fortune and they are placed at the head of the church it is still an addition to its glory  our church therefore with open arms embraces youth of rank and distinction who are willing to enter into it and are drawn by the true motive which ought to induce any to it the love which they have for the service of god and religion but we live in an age sunk below the standard of former ages and in which a great many are unacquainted with the history of them i mention this because it is the easiest thing in the world to prove that men of the greatest families in all kingdoms and in all religions have been priests but in our polite and refined times it is accounted by a great many some disgrace and a lessening to a gentleman and it is well for him if he can keep up his former rank after he has taken this character upon himself the cause of this you should enquire after and ask them to give a reason for their opinion it must be this or they have none viz that it is a disgrace to be more immediately employed in the service of the great god of heaven and earth  it is pleasant to observe what a value some brutish senseless clowns set upon themselves i mean by name your rural esquires the useless debauched and dreggy part of them only those of them who have been educated in the stable or dogkennel and whose capacities and habits are agreeable to what they have been brought up to mean and low be not surpised yet forsooth a priest though of family and fortune and adorned with all the fine accomplishments which nature and a generous education can bestow on him must look to himself that he be not elbowed by these and it would be taken very much amiss i can assure him if he should be so bold as to assume the preference or so much as an equality with them  but i shall lastly take a view of those of my brethren of the clergy who are immured in colleges and have at present few of those forementioned difficulties to struggle with and happy would it be for them if they had none to encounter but such is our fate that there is no secure refuge for us  penury we all know is a demon which haunts these walls and well would it be for them if syllogisms and metaphysics could satisfy their appetites and support nature but i am afraid they will be found to be too subtle for that purpose  by far the majority of the fellows of colleges are in circumstances below envy insomuch that it is surprising to find that any should grudge them the poor pittance they enjoy or should think that college lands might be cantoned out to better uses for if learning is the greatest ornament nay support of a nation and if the universities are the fountains from whence are chiefly derived all the benefits which flow down to the nation in general by it if the three learned faculties are from hence so ably supplied that religion in its primitive purity is preached and propagated that justice is with so much skill and impartiality maintained and distributed and also that the preservation of our health and recovery of it is so well provided for we may conclude that none but those who are enemies to mankind in general can be enemies to these learned and venerable bodies  but whilst all these blessings are conveyed from hence a great many of the learned sages residing there and from whom they spring are very poorly rewarded for their great labor and study what they have at present bears no proportion to their merits and if hereafter any thing happens in their favor it is generally too late not till overmuch study has exhausted their spirits and want of health has disabled them from enjoyment  besides their constant and assiduous application to books has taken their thoughts off so much from the world that they are but little acquainted with it insomuch that when they come out into it they are for the most part ill prepared to struggle with the difficulties they are like to meet with they are strangers to all the little tricks and artifices the windings and turnings of those with whom they are likely to have commerce and may not suspect there to be any latent guile in those whose appearance is so mean and unpromising yet though it may appear something like a paradox many a man of the greatest learning sagacity and penetration has been most abominably imposed on and defrauded in worldly traffic by those whose capacities are but little superior to some brutes the thoughts of the one being wholly taken up with higher and more noble contemplations and the others confined only to the invention of little shifts and disguises  it may be expected perhaps now i have finished what i designed in respect of the inferior clergy that i should go on and survey the superior clergy and make some amends for what i have already done but that i shall defer till i have seen the success of this undertaking  the conclusion to confirm the truth of what i have asserted i appeal to observation and experience and call upon living witnesses and sufferers to bear testimony of whom i am afraid that there are too many to be found more by a great many than i could wish and whose calamities i heartily lament whose calamities are owing to ungenerous treatment to a wicked and perverse humor in some of the laity part of whom are seduced by a vicious avarice and covetousness and others by a vain and suspicious dread of emulation or they dont know what and both of them fighting against divine authority and dispensations and defying the armies of the living god  reasons for this we are to expect none neither can any be given for if at least the majority of the clergy without flattery bear characters for abilities in their function inoffensiveness of behavior and integrity of life superior to most men inferior to none what is there to be urged in defense of such barbarous usage envy could it ever cease it should be then when it sees men in distress could slander be ever silent innocence should strike it dumb but wicked and vain men are proof against human and divine admonitions and nothing will reclaim them  however coxcombs of every education being first excluded to their honor will i speak it that the greatest men i dont mean by birth only but who are great in themselves and whose noble natural endowments and innate good dispositions have been improved by a university education are very seldom guilty of ridicule and male treatment or if at any time they give into the first their wit and humor in some measure atones for it there being as much difference between the treatment of these and that of your proud ignorant rich splenetick fellows as there is between the fine hand of a skillful surgeon and the course mangling of a butcher  unreasonably troublesome it is very true that these latter are to their betters but if good could be once brought out of evil and they should serve at last as scarecrows to keep off from the church such as might otherwise be more usefully employed i must confess that i should then have a something more favorable opinion of them than i have hitherto had but if we cannot make this use of them we shall be troubled to account for them and may say as the honest cheesemonger said by the rats i wonder for what use these vermin were made  enough i hope has been said to lessen the number of unskillful traders in divinity and to keep them from venturing when they are sure to meet with storms and to be disappointed of their imaginary gains  nothing however of this nature will affright the pious and ingenious youth from this his designed undertaking he knows that god into whose service he enlists himself is able to protect him and therefore resolves to serve him faithfully and as he hopes to be able to do him better service this way than any other he expects a greater reward for it but not till his service is ended not till the proper time for it comes and therefore waits patiently for it  he calls to mind the dangers oppressions and persecutions of old and even which have all along attended those who have been strictful faithful and diligent in the service of god and as he in no wise expects to be exempted from all of these he is the less surpised and dejected on that account when they happen to him  transported with the glorious figure which the martyrs and sufferers make in the annals of the church he has an honest ambition of being enrolled if called upon amongst their number their characters shining brighter in his eyes than all the glittering trophies of your alexanders and coesars the one having had for their foundation a fervent zeal for the service of god the others a vicious ambition which lead them on to rapine sacrilege and murder  a heathen or infidel may indeed applaud the false glory of the latter but the christian hero views their black crimes with horror and disdains any conquests but in the service of god and the defense of true religion  the ambition of the youth that enters into the ministry with an honest heart is to encourage and promote piety and virtue and all manner of good works and to persuade as many as he can to the practice of them that they may be thereby happy and god from thence be glorified and if this is brought to pass through his means his desires are satisfied and he reflects on himself with greater pleasure and is much happier even amidst calumnies abuses and the pressure of a low fortune than if by base compliances and prophesying smooth things he had attained to the highest dignity not that i think a steadiness in his duty to be an absolute bar to preferment because that with some forementioned qualifications is in my opinion the only true title to it and i hope that the world is not yet so degenerate as generally to think or act otherwise however preferment is not the strongest bias of a truly good clergyman for one who really is so is content without it or pleased with it according as he finds it inconsistent or consistent with his duty the discharge of which is the ultimate end which he aims at in this world and the rudder which directs all his actions could the church be always filled with such she would soon become the praise of the whole earth and all true lovers of our sion will join with me in my hearty wishes that she may never more want such  finis
