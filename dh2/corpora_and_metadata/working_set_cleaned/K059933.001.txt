letters containing a sketch of the politics of france from the thirtyfirst of may      till the twentyeighth of july       letters containing a sketch of the politics of france from the thirtyfirst of may      till the twentyeighth of july      and of the scenes which have passed in the prisons of paris  by helen maria williams  vol i  london printed for g g and j robinson paternosterrow       letter i switzerland september      my dear sir after so long a suspension of our correspondence after a silence like that of death and a separation which for some time past seemed as final as if we had been divided by the limits of that country from whose bourn no traveller returns with what grateful pleasure did i recognize your handwriting with what eagerness did i break he seal of your welcome letter and with what soothing emotions receive the tidings of your welfare and the assurance of your affection your letter was a talisman that served to conjure up a thousand images of sorrows and of joys that are past and which were obliterated by the turbulent sensations of dismay and horror  perhaps it will not be uninteresting to you to receive from me a sketch of the scenes which have passed in paris since the second of june an epoch to be for ever deplored by the friends of liberty which seated a vulgar and sanguinary despot on the ruins of a throne till the memorable   th of july      when liberty bleeding with a thousand wounds revived once more if the picture i send you of those extraordinary events be not well drawn it is at least marked with the characters of truth since i have been the witness of the scenes i describe and have known personally all the principal actors those scenes connected in my mind with all the detail of domestic sorrow with the feelings of private sympathy with the tears of mourning friendship are impressed upon my memory in characters that are indelible they rise in sad succession like the shades of banquos line and pass along my shuddering recollection  after having so long suffered without daring to utter a complaint it will relieve my oppressed spirits to give you an account of our late situation and in so doing i shall feel the same sort of melancholy pleasure as the mariner who paints the horrors of the tempest when he has reached the harbor and sheds a tender tear over his lost companions who have perished in the wreck  ah my dear friend that overwhelming recollection fills my heart with anguish which only they who have suffered can conceive those persons in whose society i most delighted in whose cultivated minds and enlightened conversation i found the sole compensation for what i had lost in leaving my country and my friends  to see them torn from me for ever to know the precise moment in which they were dragged to execution to feel  but let me turn a while from images of horror which i have considered but too deeply and which have cast a sadness over my mind that can never never be dispelled whenever they recur a funereal veil seems to me to be spread over nature and neither the consciousness of present nor the assurance of future safety neither the charms of society nor all the graces nor all the wonders of the scenes i am now contemplating can dissipate the gloom  not long after the reign of robespierre began all passports to leave the country were refused and the arrestation of the english residing in france was decreed by the national convention but the very next day the decree was repealed on the representations of some french merchants who showed its impolicy we therefore concluded that we had no such measures to fear in future and we heard from what we believed to be good authority that if any decree passed with respect to the english it would be that of their being ordered to leave the republic the political clouds in the mean time gathered thick around the hemisphere we heard rumors of severity and terror which seemed like those hollow noises that roll in the dark gulf of the volcano and portend its dangerous eruptions but no one could calculate how far the threatened mischief would extend and how wide a waste of ruin would desolate the land already considerable numbers were imprisoned as suspected  suspected that indefinite word which was tortured into every meaning of injustice and oppression and became what the french call the mot de ralliement the initiative term of captivity and death  one evening when bernardin st pierre the author of the charming little novel of paul and virginia was drinking tea with me and while i was listening to a description he gave me of a small house which he had lately built in the center of a beautiful island of the river that flows by essonne which he was employed in decorating and where he meant to realise some of the lovely scenes which his fine imagination has pictured in the mauritius i was suddenly called away from this fairy land by the appearance of a friend who rushed into the room and with great agitation told us that a decree had just passed in the national convention ordering all the english in france to be put into arrestation in the space of fourandtwenty hours and their property to be consiscated we passed the night without sleep and the following day in anxiety and perturbation not to be described expecting every moment the commissaries of the revolutionary committee and their guards to put in force the mandates of the convention as the day advanced our terror increased in the evening we received information that most of our english acquaintances were conducted to prison at length night came and no commissaries appearing we began to flatter ourselves that being a family of women it was intended that we should be spared for the time was only now arrived when neither sex nor age gave any claim to compassion overcome with fatigue and emotion we went to bed with some faint hopes of exemption from the general calamity of our countrymen these hopes were however but of short duration at two in the morning we were awakened by a loud knocking at the gate of the hotel which we well knew to be the fatal signal of our approaching captivity and a few minutes after the bell of our apartments was rung with violence y sister and myself hurried on our clothes and went with trembling steps to the antichamber when we found two commissaries of the revolutionary committee of our section accompanied by a guard two of whom were placed at the outer door with their swords drawn while the rest entered the room one of these constituted authorities held a paper in his hand which was a copy of the decree of the convention and which he offered to read to us but we declined hearing it and told him we were ready to obey the law seeing us pale and trembling he and his colleague endeavored to comfort us they begged us to compose ourselves they repeated that our arrestation was only part of a general political measure and that innocence had nothing to fear  alas innocence was no longer any plea for safety they took a procesverbal of our names ages the country where we were born the length of time we had lived in france and when this register was finished we were told that we must prepare to depart we were each of us allowed to take as much clean linen as we could tie up in a handkerchief and which was all the property which we could now call our own the rest in consequence of the decree being seized by the nation sometimes under the pressure of a great calamity the most acute sensations are excited by little circumstances which form a part of the whole and serve in the retrospect of memory like certain points in a landscape to call up the surrounding scenery such is the feeling with which i recall the moments when having got out of our apartments we stood upon the staircase surrounded with guards while the commissaries placed the seals on our doors the contrast between the prison where we were going to be led and that home which was now closed against us perhaps for years filled my heart with a pang for which language has no utterance some of the guards were disposed to treat us with rudeness which the commissaries sternly repressed and ordering them to keep at some distance made us lean on their arms for they saw we stood in need of support in our way to the committeeroom we found this place crowded with commissaries and soldiers some sleeping some writing and others amusing themselves with pleasantries of a revolutionary nature to which we listened trembling every halfhour a guard entered conducting english prisoners among whom were no women but ourselves here we passed the long night and at eight in the morning our countrymen were taken to the prison of the madelonettes while we were still detained at the committee we discovered afterward that this was owing to the humanity of the commissaries who arrested us and who sent to the municipality to know if we might not be taken to the luxembourg where we should find good accommodations while at the madelonettes scarcely a bed could be procured all that compassion could dictate all the lenity which it was in the power of these commissaries to display without incurring ten years imprisonment the penalty annexed to leaving us at liberty we experienced humanity from members of a revolutionary committee you will perhaps exclaim in the language of the jews can any good thing come out of nazareth it is certain however strange as it may seem that our two commissaries behaved toward us as if they remembered that we were defenseless women in a land of strangers that we were accused of no crime except that of being born on the soil of england and that if we were punished we had only deserved it by trusting with too easy a belief in that national faith which was now violated by the way when i tell you that we experienced compassion from revolutionary committees you will not suppose i mean to assert that compassionate men formed the majority of their committees the greater part of mankind in all ages even when accustomed to the most elevated rank have abused power how then could it be hoped that unlimited power would not be abused which was confided to men who were for the most part ignorant and unenlightened men who till that period confined to their shops and their manual occupations were suddenly transported into splendid hotels with authority to unlock cabinets blazing with jewels to seize upon heaps of uncounted gold and with a stroke of their pens to disperse as many warrants for imprisonment as caprice envy or mistaken zeal might prompt who were made arbiters of the liberty property and even lives of their fellowcitizens and who were incited nay even compelled to acts of violence under the penalty of being branded with the guilt of moderantism when such was the newestablished system when it required the most daring courage to be humane and when to be cruel was to be safe can you wonder that among the revolutionary committees in general there was not as much pity to be found as would fill the eye of a wren after passing the whole day as we had done the night in the committeeroom orders arrived from the municipality to send us to the former palace now the prison of the luxembourg where we were attended by two guards within each coach while two walked on each side what strange sensations i felt as i passed through the streets of paris and ascended the steps of the luxembourg a sad spectacle to the crowd we were conducted to the range of apartments above the former rooms of state where we were received with the utmost civility by the keeper of the prison benoit a name which many a wretch has blessed for many a sorrow his compassion and gentleness have softened his heart was indeed but ill suited to his office and often he incurred the displeasure of those savages by whom he was employed and who wished their victims to feel the full extent of their calamity unmitigated by any detail of kindness any attention to those little wants which this benevolent person was anxious to remove or those few comforts which he had the power to bestow the barbarians thought it not enough to load their victims with iron unless it entered into their souls but benoit was not to be intimidated into cruelty without deviating from his duty he pursued his steady course of humanity and may the grateful benedictions of the unhappy have ascended for him to heaven  we had a good apartment allotted us which a few weeks before had been inhabited by valaze one of the deputies of the convention who was now transferred to the prison of the conciergerie our apartment with several adjoining had soon after the event of the   st of may been prepared for the imprisonment of the deputies of the cote droit and for that purpose the windows which commanded a fine view of the luxembourggardens had been blocked up to the upper panes which were barred with iron mattrasses were provided for us in this gloomy chamber the door of which was locked by one of our jailors and we had suffered too much fatigue of body as well as disturbance of mind not to find a refuge from sorrow in some hours of profound sleep  letter ii the next morning the sun arose with unusual brightness and with the aid of a table on which i mounted i saw through our grated windows the beautiful gardens of the luxembourg its tall majestic trees had not yet lost their foliage and though they were fallen like our fortunes into the sear the yellow leaf they still presented those rich gradations of coloring which belong to autumn the sun gilded the gothic spires of the surrounding convents which lifted up their tall points above the venerable groves while on the background of the scenery arose the hills of meudon it seemed to me as if the declining season had shed its last interesting graces over the landscape to sooth my afflicted spirit and such was the effect it produced it is scarcely possible to contemplate the beauties of nature without that enthusiastic pleasure which swells into devotion and when such dispositions are excited in the mind resignation to sufferings which in the sacred words of scripture are but for a moment becomes a less difficult duty  the luxembourg had lately been fitted up to receive the crowd of new inhabitants with which it was going to be peopled and every apartment obtained a particular appellation which was inscribed on the outside of the door we were lodged in the chamber of cincinnatus brutus i think was our nextdoor neighbor and socrates had pitched his tent at the distance of a few paces the chamber of indivisibility was allotted to some persons accused of federalism and liberty was written in broad characters over the door of a prisoner who was au secret in close confinement  with respect to great names it has been observed in paris that almost all the illustrious characters of greece and rome have been led to the guillotine  for instance brutus who often while we were in prison came from the municipality with orders from anaxagoras was soon after doomed to an equal fate alike in fortune as alike in fame together with anacharsis agricola aristides phocion sempronius gracchus epaminondas cato the elder and the younger and many other no less celebrated worthies who fell in sad succession under the sword of maximilian the christian name of robespierre   our prison was filled with a multitude of persons of different conditions characters opinions and countries and seemed an epitome of the whole world the mornings were devoted to business and passed in little occupations of which the prisoners sometimes complained but for which perhaps they had reason to be thankful since less leisure was left them to brood over their misfortunes every one had an appointed task in each chamber the prisoners by turns lighted the fires swept the rooms arranged the beds and those who could not afford to have dinner from a tavern or as the rich were yet permitted from their own houses prepared themselves their meals every chamber formed a society subject to certain regulations a new president was chosen every day or every week who enforced its laws and maintained good order in some chambers no person was allowed to sing after ten in others after eleven at night this restriction would perhaps have been superfluous in england in a similar situation but it was highly necessary here since it prevented such of the prisoners as were more lighthearted than the rest from singing all night long to the annoyance of others of their neighbors who might think the music which resounded through the prison during the day fully sufficient the system of equality whatever opposition it met with in the world was in its full extent practiced in the prison united by the strong tie of common calamity the prisoners considered themselves as bound to soften the general evil by mutual kind offices and strangers meeting in such circumstances soon became friends the poor lived not upon the crumbs which fell from the rich mans table but shared the comforts of the repast and here was found a community of the small stock of goods which belonged to the whole without the necessity of a requisition one broom which was the property of a countess was used by twenty delicate hands to sweep the respective apartments and a teakettle with which a friend furnished my mother was literally as dr johnson observed of his own never allowed time to cool but was employed from morning till night in furnishing the english with tea  in the afternoon the prisoners met in an antichamber which commanded a view of the gardens here they formed themselves into groups some conversed others walked up and down the room others gazed from the windows on the walks below where perhaps they recognized a relation or a friend who being denied the privilege of visiting the prison had come to sooth them by a look or tear of sympathy during the first days of our confinement the prisoners were permitted to see their friends and many a striking contrast of gaiety and sorrow did the antichamber then exhibit in one part of the room lively young people were amusing their visitors by a thousand little pleasantries on their own situation in another a husband who was a prisoner was taking leave of his wife who had come to see him and shedding tears over his child who was clinging to his knees or had thrown its arms around his neck and refused to be torn from its father as the number of prisoners increased which they did so rapidly that in less than a week they were augmented from an hundred to a thousand the rules of the prison became more severe and the administrators of the police gave strict orders that no person whatever should be admitted after this period the wives of some of the prisoners came regularly every day bringing their children with them to the terrace of the gardens you often saw the mother weeping and the children stretching out their little hands and pointing to their fathers who stood with their eyes fixed upon the objects of their affection but sometimes a surly sentinel repressed these melancholy effusions of tenderness by calling to the persons in the walk to keep off and make no signs to the prisoners  in the mean time among the crowd that filled the public room were fine gentlemen and fine ladies who had held the highest rank at court some flirting together others making appointments for card parties or music in their own apartments in the evening and others relating to us in pathetic language all they had suffered and all they had lost by the revolution it was impossible not to sympathize in the distresses of some or avoid wondering at the folly of others in whom the strong sense of danger could not overcome the feelings of vanity and who although the tremendous decree had just gone forth making terror the order of the day and knowing that the fatal preeminence of rank was the surest passport to the guillotine could not resist using the proscribed nomenclature of madame la duchess monsieur le comte etc which seemed to issue from their lips like natural melodies to which the ear has long been accustomed and which the voice involuntarily repeats there were however among the captive nobility many persons who had too much good sense not to observe a different conduct who had proved themselves real friends to liberty had made important sacrifices in its cause and who had been led to prison by revolutionary committees on pretenses the most trivial and sometimes from mistakes the most ludicrous such was the fate of the former count and countess of  who had distinguished themselves from the beginning of the revolution by the ardour of their patriotism and the largeness of their civic donations they had hitherto lived undisturbed in their splendid hotel and there they might probably have continued to live a little longer had not the countess in an evil hour sent down to her chateau a fine marble hearth which by some accident was broken on the way the steward sent a letter in which among other things he mentioned that the foyer foyer is the french name for hearth and also for the central point of a system must be repaired at paris the letter was intercepted and read by the revolutionary committee they swore they raged at the dark designs of aristocracy here said they is a daring plot indeed a foyer of counterrevolution and to be repaired at paris we must instantly seize the authors and the accomplices in vain the countess related the story of the hearth and asserted that no conspiracy lurked beneath the marble both herself and her husband were conducted to the maison darret of their section from which we saw them arrive at the luxembourg with about sixty other persons at the hour of midnight after having been led through the streets in procession by the light of an immense number of flambeaux and guarded by a whole battalion these prisoners had at least the consolation of finding themselves in the society of many of their friends and acquaintances for all the polite part of the fauxbourg st germain might be said to be assembled at the luxembourg in mass imprisonment here was however no longer the exclusive distinction of former nobility but was extended to great numbers of the former third estate we had priests physicians merchants shopkeepers actors and actresses french valets and english waitingwomen all assembled together in the public room but in the private apartments benoits benevolent heart taught him the most delicate species of politeness by placing those persons together who were most likely to find satisfaction in each others society  amidst many an eloquent tale of chateaux levelled with the ground and palaces where to borrow an image of desolation from ossian the fox might be seen looking out at the window we sometimes heard the complaints of simple sorrow unallied to greatness but like the notes of the starling so true in time to nature were they chanted that they seized irresistibly on the heart of this kind was a scene which passed sometimes between a poor english woman and her dog which she had brought to keep her company in her captivity she had been housekeeper in a french family and some months before she was imprisoned had sent her daughter who was her only child to her friends in england the poor woman often exclaimed while her face was bathed in tears oh charlotte charlotte i shall never see you again whenever the dog heard the name of charlotte he began to howl in so melancholy a note that it was impossible not to sympathise in his lamentation  the most frightful circumstance which attended our arrestation were the visits of henriot the commandant of the military force of paris this wretch had been one of the executioners on the second of september and was appointed by the commune of paris on the   st of may to take the command of the national guard to point the cannon against the convention to violate the representation of the people and to act the prelude of that dark drama of which france has been the desolated scene and europe the affrighted spectator henriot performed his part so much to the satisfaction of his employers that he was continued in his command and it was a part of his office to visit the prisons and take cae that they were properly guarded the first time i saw him was the day after our confinement he entered on a sudden our apartment brandishing his sword and accompanied by twelve of his officers there was something in his look which did not give you simply the idea of the ferocity which is sometimes to be found among civilized europeans his fierceness seemed to be of that kind which belongs to a cannibal of new zealand and he looked not merely as if he longed to plunge his sabre in our bosoms but to drink a libation of our blood he poured forth a volley of oaths and imprecations called out to know how many guillotines must be erected for the english and did not leave our chamber till one person who was present had fainted with terror in this manner he visited every apartment spreading consternation and dismay and these visits were repeated three or four times in a week whenever the trampling of his horses feet was heard in the courtyard the first prisoner who distinguished the wellknown sound gave the alarm and in one moment the public room was cleared every person flying with the precipitation of fear to his own apartment every noise was instantly hushed a stillness like that of death pervaded the whole dwelling and we remained crouching in our cells like the greeks in the cave of polyphemus till the monster disappeared the visits of the administrators of police though not so terrific as those of henriot were nothing less than soothing brutality as well as terror was the order of the day and those public functionaries whose business it was not only to see that the police of the prison was well regulated but also to hear if the prisoners had any subject of complaint used to make the enquiry in a tone of such ferocity that whatever oppressions might hang on the heart the lips lost the power of giving them utterance the visits of the police generally produced some additional rigor to our confinement and in a short time all access to us whatever was forbidden except by letters which were sent open and delivered to us after being examined by the sentinels there was sometimes room for deep meditation on the strange caprice and vicissitudes of fortune we found the exminister amelot a prisoner in the luxembourg he who during his administration had distributed lettres de cachet with so much liberality tyranny had now changed its instruments and he was become himself the victim of despotism with new insignia the blue ribband had given place to the red cap and de par le roi was transformed into par mesure de surete generale by his order la tude whose history is so well known had been confined thirty years in the bastille he was now enjoying the sweets of liberty and before the prisondoors were shut against strangers came frequently to visit some of his friends in the very room where the minister was imprisoned  amelot in a comfortable apartment and surrounded by society did not bear his confinement with the same firmness as la tude had borne the solitude of his dungeon cheered only by the plaintive sounds of his flute of reeds he was in a short time bereft of his reason and among the wanderings of his imagination used to address letters to all the kings of europe and all the emigrant princes inviting them to sumptuous repasts to which he sometimes proposed admitting the national convention to show that he was above bearing malice  whenever any new prisoners arrived the rest crowded around them and hastened to calm their minds by the most soothing expressions of sympathy not such were the emotions excited by the appearance of maillard who was one of the murderers on the second of september and who had lately been appointed to a command in the revolutionary army from which for some malversations he was now dismissed sent to prison and ordered into close confinement he had taken a very active part in the late transactions and had a few days before his own arrest conducted to prison two fine boys who were the sons of the exminister la tour du pin together with their governor who was a priest they were stepping into a carriage which was to convey them to school when they were seized upon by maillard who taking the youngest a child of eleven years of age by the shoulder said to him in a stern accent il faut dire la verite toute la verite et rien que la verite you must speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth  no sooner was maillard brought into the antichamber while his room was preparing than the little boy recognized his acquaintance and running up to him cried bon jour citoyen maillard  il faut dire la verite toute la verite et rien que la verite  nothing could be more painful than the sensations excited by reading the evening papers which the prisoners were at this time permitted to receive and which were expected with that trembling anxiety with which under present evils we long to look into the promises of futurity the evening paper seemed to us the book of our destiny but there we could trace no soothing characters of hope or mercy every line was stamped with conspiracy vengeance desolation and death and the reading the events of the day left impressions on our minds which often deprived us of sleep we sometimes quitted the crowd in the public room and shutting ourselves up in our own apartment endeavored amidst the evils of this world like sternes monk to look beyond it if such meditation was calculated to wipe away our tears it sometimes made them flow  let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee according to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to die  letter iii the days of my captivity are often brought back to my remembrance by circumstances which seem sufficiently remote from sorrows by that connection of the past with the present which akenside describes so beautifully pleasures of imagination book iii  and you will perhaps think that my imagination is somewhat disordered when i tell you that the lake from the luxuriant banks of which i send you this letter recalls to my mind our apartment in the prison the walls of that apartment were hung with tapestry which described a landscape of romantic beauty on that landscape i often gazed till i almost persuaded myself that the scenery was alive around me so much did i delight in the pleasing illusion how often while my eyes were fixed on that canvass which led my wounded spirit from the cruelty of man to the benignity of god  how often did i wish for the wings of a dove that i might flee away and be at rest to be seated at the foot of those sheltering hills which embosomed some mimic habitations or beneath a mighty elm which rose majestically in the foreground of the piece and spread its thick foliage over a green slope appeared to me the summit of earthly felicity those hills the torrentstream which rolled down their steep sides the shady elm and all the objects on the tapestry are indelibly impressed on my memory and often when i am wandering through the charming scenes of switzerland a country which nature seems to have created more for ornament than use where she has spread over every landscape those lavish graces which in other regions belong only to a few favored spots i have felt my eyes bathed in tears while amidst views of overwhelming greatness some minute object unobserved by others has led my imagination to the tapestry and the prison a few days since i passed along the falls of the tessino rolling through narrow clifs under rocks of the most terrific form in a succession of torrents sweeping after each other down the abrupt descent and broken in their course by enormous fragments torn from the cliffs sometimes raising their scattered surges into thin air and sometimes displaying the prismatic colors on the foam while i was standing on one of those daring bridges that are thrown across the gulf and that tradition calls the work of supernatural agency after the first transport of admiration in which the mind loses all traces of the past or thought of the future had subsided the torrentrill which rushed down the luxembourg tapestry presented itself to my memory while amidst the pendent groves of pine and fir bending along the cliffs and above the sweeping birch which dipped its drooping branches in the surf i discovered a towering elm the form of which resembled the friend of my captivity  but how far have i escaped from my prison  you will forgive this digression my mind is full of those scenes of beauty and grandeur which have calmed my troubled spirit and in which i have found a renovation of existence  i have yet only given you a general outline of our prison but there was one scene of calamity which myself and my family were alone doomed to witness and of which our fellow captives had no share our apartment with two others adjoining was separated from the public room by a little passage and a door which the huissiers carefully locked at night it happened that these apartments were then occupied by two persons in whose society we had passed some of the most agreeable hours of our residence in france these persons were sillery and la source two of the members of the convention who had been long in close confinement and who were now on the point of appearing before th t sanguinary tribunal whence after the most shocking mockery of justice they were inhumanly dragged to the scaffold sillery on account of his infirmities had with much difficulty obtained permission from the police for his servant to be admitted into the prison during the day together with an old female friend who on the plea of his illness had implored leave to attend him as his nurse with that eloquence which belongs to affliction and which sometimes even the most hardened hearts are unable to resist while men assume over our sex so many claims to superiority let them at least bestow on us the palm of constancy and allow that in the fidelity of our attachments we have the right of preeminence those prisons from which men shrunk back with terror and where they often left their friends abandoned left they should be involved in their fate  women in whom the force of sensibility overcame the fears of female weakness demanded and sometimes obtained permission to visit in defiance of all the dangers that surrounded their gloomy walls sillerys friend and his servant being allowed to go in and out of his apartment the door was not kept constantly locked although he and la source were closely confined and not permitted to have any communication with the other prisoners the second night of our abode in the luxembourg when the prisoners had retired to their respective chambers and the keeper had locked the outer door which enclosed our three apartments la source entered our room oh how different was this interview from those meetings of social enjoyment that were embellished by the charms of his conversation always distinguished by a flow of eloquence and animated by that enthusiastic fervor which peculiarly belonged to his character la source was a native of languedoc and united with very superior talents that vivid warmth of imagination for which the southern provinces of france have been renowned since the period when awakened by the genial influence of those luxuriant regions the song of the troubadours burst from the gloom of gothic barbarism liberty in the soul of la source was less a principle than a passion for his bosom beat high with philanthropy and in his former situation as a protestant minister he had felt in a peculiar manner the oppression of the ancient system his sensibility was acute and his detestation of the crimes by which the revolution had been sullied was in proportion to his devoted attachment to its cause la source was polite and amiable in his manners he had a taste for music and a powerful voice and sung as he conversed with all the energy of feeling after the day had passed in the fatigue of public debates he was glad to lay aside the tumult of politics in the evening for the conversation of some literary men whom he met occasionally at our teatable ah how little did we then foresee the horrors of that period when we should meet him in the gloom of a prison a proscribed victim with whom this melancholy interview was beset with danger  we were obliged to converse in whispers while we kept watch successively at the outer door that if any step approached he might instantly fly to his chamber he had much to ask having been three months a close prisoner and knowing little of what was passing in the world and though he seemed to forget all the horrors of his situation in the consolation he derived from these moments of confidential conversation yet he frequently lamented that this last gleam of pleasure which was shed over his existence was purchased at the price of our captivity in the solitude of his prison no voice of friendship no accents of pity had reached his ear and after our arrival he used through the lonely day to count the hours till the prisongates were closed till all was still within its walls and no sound was heard without except at intervals the hoarse cry of the sentinels when he hastened to our apartment the discovery of these visits would indeed have exposed us to the most fatal consequences but our sympathy prevailed over our fears nor could we whatever might be the event refuse our devoted friend this last melancholy satisfaction la source at his second visit was accompanied by sillery the husband of madame de sillery whose writings are so well known in england sillery was about sixty years of age had lived freely like most men of his former rank in france and from this dissipated life had more the appearance of age than belonged to his years his manners retained the elegance by which that class was distinguished which mr burke has denominated the corinthian capital of polished society sillery had a fine taste for drawing and during his confinement displayed the powers of his pencil by tracing beautiful landscapes he also amused himself by reading history and possessing considerable talents for literature had recorded with a rich warmth of coloring the events of the revolution in which he had been a distinguished actor and of which he had treasured up details precious for history with keen regret he told me that he had committed several volumes of manuscript to the flames a sad sacrifice to the omars of the day  the mind of sillery was somewhat less fortified against his approaching fate than that of la source the old man often turned back on the past and wept and sometimes enquired with an anxious look if we believed there was any chance of his deliverance alas i have no words to paint the sensations of those moments  to know that the days of our fellow captives were numbered  that they were doomed to perish  that the bloody tribunal before which they were going to appear was but the pathway to the scaffold  to have the painful task of stifling our feelings while we endeavored to sooth the weakness of humanity by hopes which we knew were fallacious was a species of misery almost insupportable there were moments indeed when the task became too painful to be endured there were moments when shocked by some new incident of terror this cruel restraint gave way to uncontrolable emotion when the tears the sobbings of convulsive anguish would no longer be suppressed and our unfortunate friends were obliged to give instead of receiving consolation  they had in their calamity that support which is of all others the most effectual under misfortune religion was in la source a habit of the mind impressed with the most sublime ideas of the supreme being although the ways of heaven never appeared more dark and intricate than in this triumph of guilt over innocence he reposed with unbounded confidence in that providence in whose hand are the issues of life and death sillery who had a feeling heart found devotion the most soothing refuge of affliction he and la source composed together a little hymn adapted to a sweet solemn air which they called their evening service every night before we parted they sung this simple dirge in a low tone to prevent their being heard in the other apartments which made it seem more plaintive those mournful founds the knell of my departing friends yet thrill upon my heart  i calmez nos allarmes pretez nous les arms source de vrais biens brisez nos liens entende les accens de tes enfans

and with the pang our memory claims our country will avenge our names la source often spoke of his wife with tender regret he had been married only a week when he was chosen a member of the legislative assembly and was obliged to hasten to paris while his wife remained in languedoc to take care of an aged mother when the legislative assembly was dissolved la source was immediately elected a member of the national convention and could find no interval in which to visit his native spot or his wife whom he saw no more in his meditations on the chain of political events he mentioned one little incident which seemed to hang on his mind with a sort of superstitious feeling a few days after the  0th of august he dined in the fauxbourg of st antoine with several members of the legislative assembly who were the most distinguished for their talents and patriotism they were exulting in the birth of the new republic and the glorious part they were to act as its founders when a citizen of the fauxbourg who had been invited to partake of the repast observed that he feared a different destiny awaited them as you have been the founders of the republic said he you will also be its victims in a short time you will be obliged to impose restraints and duties on the people to whom your enemies and theirs will represent you as having overthrown regal power only to establish your own you will be accused of aristocracy and i foresee he added with much perturbation that you will all perish on the scaffold the company smiled at his singular prediction but during the ensuing winter when the storm was gathering over the political horizon la source recalled the prophecy and sometimes reminded vergniaud of the man of the fauxbourg st antoine vergniaud had little heeded the augur but a few days previous to the   st of may when the convention was for the first time besieged la source said again to vergniaud well what think you of the prophet of the fauxbourg the prophet of the fauxbourg answered vergniaud was in the right  the morning now arrived when la source and sillery together with nineteen other members of the convention were led before the revolutionary tribunal when the guards who were to conduct them arrived the other prisoners crowded to the public room to see them pass and we shut ourselves up in our own apartment they returned about five in the evening soon after which their counsel arrived and we had no opportunity of seeing them till midnight when they related to us what had passed the conduct of the judges and the aspect of the jury were calculated to banish every gleam of hope from the bosoms of the prisoners the former permitted with reluctance any thing to be urged in their defense and the latter listened with impatience casting upon their victims looks of atrocity in which they might easily read their fate yet in spite of these unhappy omens our friends returned from the tribunal with their minds much elevated la source described in his eloquent language the noble enthusiasm of liberty the ardent love of their country the heroical contempt of death which animated his colleagues whom he had not seen for some time since they had been transferred to the conciergerie while himself and sillery had obtained permission to remain at the luxembourg upon the certificates of their physicians that they were too ill to be removed without danger la source declared that ancient history offered no model of public virtue beyond that which was exhibited by his friends at the tribunal and who in their prison blending with the fortitude of romans the gaiety of frenchmen and being confined in one apartment passed the short interval of life which was left in conversation and cheerful repasts which were usually concluded with patriotic songs you said vergniaud to la source when they met at the tribunal you perhaps will find something to regret in the loss of life you have a glimpse of the gardens of the luxembourg which may remind you that there is something beautiful in nature but we who live in human shambles who every day see fresh victims dragged to execution we are become so familiarized with death that we look on it with unconcern  a few days before this sanguinary trial ended the administration of the police sent orders that the englishwomen confined in the luxembourg should be removed the next day to a convent in the fauxbourg st antoine with what keen regret la source and sillery received this intelligence a thousand and a thousand times they thanked us for the dangers we had risqued in receiving them and for the sympathy which had soothed the last hours of their existence  a thousand times they declared that if it were yet possible their lives might be preserved they should consider themselves for ever bound to us by the most sacred ties of gratitude and friendship but they felt alas how small was the chance that we should meet again in this world sillery cut off a lock of his white hairs which he begged i would preserve for his sake and la source gave me the same relick they embraced us with much emotion they prayed that the blessing of god might be upon us we mingled our tears together and parted to meet no more   let me before i conduct you to our new prison give you a short account of the political events and their causes which after bringing those members of the convention to the scaffold who were most fitted by their talents to defend liberty and by their moral qualities to make it beloved ended in such a system of cruelty and crimes that it can be only by a long perseverance in public virtue that france can make reparation to humanity or retrieve her character among the nations  letter iv the republican party of the legislative assembly had it is well known very early projected many alterations in the new constitution they had observed with great inquietude the changes which had taken place at the close of the first national assembly when its labors underwent a revision previously to the acceptance of the constitution by the executive power and when they found that those who had hitherto been the most strenuous opponents of the court suddenly became its most zealous advocates and friends  though this party formed the minority of the legislative assembly its influence by means of the popular societies was very extensive but when the struggle took place between the court and the republican party both of which were at length agreed in the overthrow of the new constitution with which each was for different reasons equally dissatisfied the party was joined by many who in this destruction of the regal authority had no other end in view than the establishment of their own  the society of the jacobins which had been for a long time the rival and at length the conqueror of the throne was deserted immediately after the victory by almost all those who had contributed to gain it they imagined that every domestic enemy was annihilated when the first decree of the convention changed the monarchy into a republic and though symptoms of discontent discovered themselves among some who thought that the change had been too hastily decided on and symptoms of a more dangerous and fatal tendency to the welfare of the government had already appeared among others yet those to whom the people had given their confidence were not sufficiently aware of the instability of popular favor and the precarious tenure by which they held it the commune of paris claimed an equal right to share with the jacobins the honors of the triumph over royalty but dissatisfied with the little credit given to the services it had rendered during the struggle it took advantage of the imbecility of the legislative assembly then expiring and had already erected itself into a rival power before the convention had opened its first debates the pretense of making extraordinary exertions to oppose the march of the enemy toward paris had led the commune amidst a multiplicity of other acts of rebellion to arrogate the functions of the representatives of the people and having at the fatal period of the massacre of september humbled the legislative assembly to the dust they thought that the same daring conduct would give them the same superiority over the national convention but in this calculation they were deceived robespierre and his adherents who had hitherto directed their counsels now aspired to higher destinies and though solicitous to make the commune an auxiliary in their designs were unwilling that it should become their rival in the new election of representatives all those were excluded who had been influenced by the court or who had opposed from purer motives the republican party although this party gained a considerable reinforcement by the new election yet the dread of returning royalty with all the severity of the old system had operated so powerfully on the minds of the people of the departments that many deputies were chosen whose pretensions to this trust arose more from the strength of their lungs than of their talents and whose harangues made up in noise what they wanted in argument while the still greater dread of the return of those horrors which the commune had just been exercising had so intimidated the citizens of paris that a part of their deputation to the convention at the head of which was robespierre triumphing over the fears they had excited took their seats rather as the conquerors than the representatives of the people the conduct of the officers of the municipality however called aloud for punishment it was impossible for the convention to suffer the crimes they had committed and the still greater atrocities which they had meditated to pass unnoticed the councilgeneral of the commune were called to the bar but escaped justice by dissembled professions of repentance and the promise of delivering up those who had led them to the commission of such enormities had the convention while its rival was thus subdued proceeded to distinguish between those who had been the chiefs of the conspiracy and those who had been the dupes of their imposture they would have done a great act of national justice and would have crushed any farther attempts against the national honor but as this humiliation of the commune was a contrivance to escape examination of which the conspirators who directed its operations and who had been chosen since to the convention were afraid the assembly deceived by this artifice had no sooner granted the pardon they implored than the faction emboldened by impunity perceived that with audacity and perseverance they might yet attain the end to which they aspired while robespierre sat in the commune his object was probably to frame a government of municipalities of which paris was to be the chief and himself the dictator but this enterprise being encompassed with difficulty since the people had determined to have a national convention he afterward changed his measures and began to meditate a plan of making the convention itself of which he was now a member serve as the instrument of his usurpation  with this view he and his disorganizing faction in the convention assumed the direction of the municipality and as the society of the jacobins was deserted by the republicans who thought its services no longer necessary the name and the place were seized on by the conspirators and filled with intriguing and ambitious men whose hopes of sharing in the plunder or the power induced them to become accomplices in the guilt  while the municipality labored to win over the sections of paris the jacobins made proselytes to their system of anarchy by their affiliations and correspondence in the departments and before the existing government was fully aware of the extent of the conspiracy or could collect sufficient energy to counteract it the faction had gained a most alarming ascendency and although they formed a very small minority in the convention their influence both in the executive part of the government and amongst the constituted authorities was sufficient to outweigh that of the representation itself every concession made to the conspirators served only to increase the insolence of their demands and although the most eloquent members of the convention guadet vergniaud pethion louvet brissot and la source gave incessant warnings of the progress of the anarchists toward the dissolution of all order in the state yet like cassandra they were believed only when the prophecies were fulfilled yes says la source there exists a faction which seeks to crush the convention and raise the dictatorship on its ruins this is the faction which has issued its arbitrary mandates which has ordered the arrest of eight of my colleagues who sat in the legislative assembly which has paid robbers to plunder and assassins to murder and which has had the audacity to lay to the charge of the people the crimes which itself has perpetrated were i in going from this place to fall under the poniards of these traitors i should die satisfied in having lifted up the veil which conceals them a little longer and i will unmask them altogether guadet often detailed the conspiracy of the jacobins and the municipality and with bursts of honest indignation against these shameless traitors implored the convention to save the republic by dissolving the society and reelecting the commune vergniaud with more than usual eloquence pourtrayed the conspirators louvet gave a clear and admirable detail of their attempts to assassinate the convention in the conspiracy of the  0th of march and brissot unveiled their treason not only in the convention and in his journal but in different publications of which his address to his constituents published in may      will furnish interesting matter for history   however criminal this band of conspirators who have exercised a despotism more hideous than history has ever presented may appear or whatever be the regrets we feel for those virtuous friends of liberty who fell the victims of their rage the historian more impartial than the friend will not fail to animadvert on the negligence of which in some instances they were guilty and above all in carelessly throwing aside by the desertion of the jacobin society the means which they had obtained of informing the public mind and directing its will  but before we carry our censures too far we must recollect that they had to contend against men hardened in crimes and inaccessible to shame who found refuge from the detection of their guilt in the protection of their party and who returned the thunder of the patriots in the convention by their noisy vociferations at the jacobins and the commune  the first attempt made on the national representation by the commune of paris and the jacobins ought to have been punished as an act of rebellion against the sovereignty of the people but an illjudged application of the principles of individual liberty a too delicate regard for the rights of persons led on the majority of the convention to the permission of offenses of which they took no measures to stop the progress till the conspiracy had acquired such strength as made every exertion against it ineffectual  the treason of dumourier had furnished the faction with new resources for calumny against the republican party with some of whom he had formerly been connected for as the faction was in the constant habit of denouncing indiscriminately every agent of the republic the completion of one prophecy gave an air of credit to the rest the conspirators accused the republicans of being accomplices in dumouriers treason the republicans have retorted the charge on some of their adversaries with the most unquestionable evidence but we need not here recur to conspiracies either of jacobins or girondists to discern the motives of dumouriers conduct he has endeavored to explain it himself in his memoirs to which if any credit ought to be given the girondists will be absolved from all share in his treason but their innocence in this respect as well as their political integrity in every other is now established beyond the reach of calumny and detraction  although the conspirators had acquired considerable influence from the assistance given them by the commune and the jacobins they perceived that the object which they had in view would never fully be attained till they had gained so absolute a control over the convention as to make it like the ancient parliaments the registerers of their imperial edicts to this end all their efforts were directed but while those men still sat within its walls whose virtue and eloquence had hitherto warded off the blow which menaced their country there was little hope of success the prize set before these traitors was too great to suffer them to hesitate about the means of seizing it and having thrown aside all regard to the laws all respect for individual or political liberty they conceived the project of violating the national representation itself and tearing from it the most eloquent and intrepid defenders of its rights to carry their plot into execution it was necessary to cover it with the veil of the wish of the people of whom a few hired desperadoes and other ignorant and seduced persons became the representatives bearing petitions written by the conspirators themselves praying the convention to drive from their seats a certain number whom they marked as unworthy of their confidence or that of the nation the indignation of the convention being roused at these attempts they instituted a commission of enquiry to search into the causes of this conspiracy this commission in pursuance of the powers it had received after mature examination arrested hebert one of the municipal chiefs and gave notice to the convention that they were prepared to make their report the conspirators seeing that their crimes were on the point of being brought to light the discovery of which would annihilate their project threw off the mask and brought forward the commune of paris to demand not only the dismission of the commission which the convention had created but the arrestation of the members who composed it together with the twentytwo deputies of the convention the most eminent for their virtue and talents the convention for several days withstood every effort that was made to shake its firmness the president isnard with all the warmth of honest indignation threatened in the name of the republic the liberticide factioners of the commune that if they dared to proceed to the execution of those designs which their present measures indicated if the national representation should be violated by any of those conspiracies of which they had been the accomplices that paris should be blotted out from the rest of its cities and that the traveller should wander on the banks of the seine enquiring where it once stood  the chiefs of the conspiracy had proceeded too far to be stopped in their career by such considerations as these but they found more intrepidity and firmness in the convention than they expected and therefore determined to employ their last expedient the ringing of the tocsin and the firing of alarm guns had excited the attention of the citizens of paris for two days when on the third the beating to arms informed them that they were going to be put into insurrection the national guard being thus put into insurrection the cause of which was unknown the whole body were conducted to the hall of the convention where henriot the commander of the military force who had been created by the conspirators for that purpose had ordered them to assemble the convention was surrounded till nearly midnight by the military force nor was any member permitted to leave the hall but although besieged the assembly was not yet conquered the day passed in the most frightful tumult and rabaut de st etienne in vain stood at the tribune holding in his hand the report of the commission of twelve upon the conspiracy of the commune together with the proofs of its authenticity his voice was lost in the horrible vociferations of the tribunes and the murmurs of the faction within the hall at length finding all his efforts ineffectual he left the assembly in despair  the assault of the convention on the   st of may though it had produced the most horrible disorder had not forced from the assembly the decree of arrestation but robespierre with his commune his jacobins and his body guard of revolutionary women who were in the van of the attack and stood in the passages of the convention armed with poniards which they pointed at the bosoms of such of the deputies as attempted to leave the hall had gone too far to recede the first of june they employed in preparations for a fresh attack and on the second again the tocsin rung again the whole city was under arms and the convention was again invested by sixty thousand men  it does not appear that all the adherents of the conspirators or rather the different factions in league with them were acquainted with all the means which robespierre marat and the municipality the original authors of the plot meant to employ la croix a member of the mountain who had been repulsed in endeavoring to go out of the hall protested with vehemence against this violation of their liberties and when henriot in receiving orders from the president to draw off his troops replied that as soon as he had executed the orders of the people he would obey those of the convention and threatened that if they refused to deliver up to justice the twentytwo deputies whom he called traitors he would order the cannon to be fired on the hall danton with great indignation imprecated vengeance on the head of the ruffian which some months after at the period of his own fall was in the act of accusation alleged against him as a crime in vain did the convention partaking dantons indignation hope to obtain their liberty by decreeing that the officers of the post next the entrance of the hall should be called to the bar two of them had received no orders and a third informed them that he was himself consigned by a few strangers who did not appear to him acquainted even with military forms these strangers were ordered to the bar but they refused to attend and thus this assembly which talked of nothing less than bringing princes and kings in chains to their feet were made prisoners in their very sanctuary by a few hirelings of whom no other description was given than that they were strangers and wore mustaches this was an indignity not to be borne the president therefore proposed that the assembly in a body should go out of the hall this was decreed and the sentinels seeing themselves likely to be overpowered gave way the deputies paraded in the garden expecting every moment to be massacred but the conspirators who directed their motions led them back again to the hall observing that the convention after so striking a proof could have no doubt of their being at liberty  previously to this mock parade barrere who had been weighing the probabilities of success on either side and examining which party would have the ascendency at length invited the proscribed deputies for the sake of peace and for the good of the state to submit and devote themselves to their country to this admonition three of them acceded but barbaroux asserted that he had no right to give in his dimission nor could he obey any other mandate than that of the people who having invested him with the power had alone the right to take it from him with more vehemence lanjuinais exclaimed that he would remain at his post to his latest breath or till he was torn from it by force his intrepidity provoked the conspirators to rage and tumult citizens said he we have beheld in barbarous countries the people leading human victims to the altar after crowning them with flowers but we never heard that the priests who were about to sacrifice them treated them with insult i repeat that i have no right to lay aside the august character with which the people have honored me therefore expect from me neither selfdimission nor voluntary suspension for a moment this courageous reply to their fury appalled the tyrants and had vergniaud rabaut brissot and others whose names were in the conspirators list been then at their post had they seconded their proscribed colleagues at this critical moment with the thunder of their eloquence the project of the conspirators might easily have been defeated and they might have saved both themselves and the republic while the conspirators were perpetrating this abominable deed they were deliberating in the house of guadet about the means that should be taken to avoid it and deceived by a report which a friend unhappily illinformed conveyed to them that the blood of their colleagues was flowing and believing it to be too late to make any farther struggle they suffered the decree of arrestation to be carried without opposition louvet relates the following singular anecdote we began to breathe again when a man of bourdeaux who had been made prisoner at the battle of nerwinden and afterward exchanged related to guadet his friend that having had an opportunity of forming an intimate acquaintance with one of the officers of the imperial army he had learned from him that cobourgs staffofficers flattered themselves that in a short space of time twentytwo heads would fall in the convention guadet related to me this anecdote with which we amused ourselves but judge of our surprise and the reflections to which it gave rise when some time after m pache came at the head of the pretended sections of paris to present the famous petition which proscribed twentytwo deputies  it is important to observe that this first lift of proscription having been composed of twentytwo members the second list brought some weeks after to the convention by the municipal officers and administrators of paris was still twentytwo though all the names were not the same at the time when the decree of accusation passed marat made some changes by his own sovereign authority he took away some names that of lanthenas for example but he took care to replace them by others and mark well in equal number so that the proscribed were always twentytwo lastly when after the taking of lions the trial of the republican deputies came on pethion buzot guadet salles valady barbaroux and myself were not in their hands the list might consequently have been reduced a third nevertheless it was still complete and the victims led to the scaffold were if not twentytwo at least twentyone this strange identity of numbers at four different periods gave reason to presume that the number of twentytwo heads and always the same number was what the mountain agreed to furnish according to one of its private articles in its treaty with the coalesced powers     had the convention when henrios sent them his mandate ordered him to be instantly put to death their orders if they could have been promulgated out of the precincts of the hall would undoubtedly have been obeyed but the conspirators had taken measures to prevent any such transmission by consigning every officer to his post by filling up every avenue with their agents who had received orders to suffer no communication between the hall and the court or garden and also by closing the gates of the latter so that the people in general knew nothing of what was passing  with many others i saw parts of the execution of this conspiracy i saw the armed force surrounding the hall but was ignorant like the rest of what was passing within i beheld from a window that overlooked the tuilleries the convention in full procession but i could not account for this singular parade nor was it till midnight that i learned the history of the day which some of the deputies related to us among whom was barrere who with eyes full of tears lamented to us the fate of his friends and the total ruin of the republic  that barrere who a few months after provoked and gloried in their murder  liberty however did not see her principles and rights abandoned with impunity but has been terribly avenged from that fatal decree may be dated all the horrors which have cast their sanguinary cloud over the glories of the revolution which have given strength to despots and arguments to slaves the national convention has beheld its members dragged in successive multitudes to the scaffold the parisian guard who submitted to become the passive instruments of this atrocious faction the citizens of paris who bent their necks tamely to the yoke the departments who when they afterward accepted the constitution had the baseness to make no conditions for their imprisoned representatives have seen their fellowcitizens their friends their relations led to death their property violated all social ties shaken virtue every where depressed vice every where triumphant and their country one wide scene of calamity of which the long page of history presents no similar picture even in the proscriptions of sylla or the caprices of caligula louvet in his interesting note says on the  0th of may another plot was to have been executed against the republicans of the convention letters had been forged between them and cobourg the night of the  0th of may the twentytwo were to have been arrested as they entered their respective houses and carried to a house in the fauxbourg montmartre where every thing was prepared for the commission of the intended crimes there each victim was to find a septembriser and they were to be buried in a pit dug in a garden belonging to the house the next day their emigration was to be announced and their forged correspondence with cobourg published the plan was concerted at the house of pache the mayor of paris the committee of twentyone had proof of all these atrocities more than fifty written and subscribed depositions attest the fact a part of these pieces was in the hands of berjoing one of the members of this commission who had put them into the hands of the administrators of calvados but they at the time they made their peace did not fail to give them up to the mountain a more considerable part were in the hands of rabaut st etienne i do not know whether they have been saved   immediately after the insurrection of the  d of june an insidious address was published by the committee of public safety to calm the minds and in their language to enlighten the understanding of the people this address was heard with great indignation by the majority of the convention some of whom protested with vehemence against the state of humiliation to which they were reduced while others to give their dissent a more solemn form assembled and signed individually a protest in which they detailed the events of the  d of june representing in strong colors the despotism which had been exercised the consequences to which it would lead and their resolution to take no part in the deliberations of an assembly whose rights had been so shamefully violated see appendix no i  this protest was signed by seventythree deputies a few days after the arrest of their colleagues but it was not then published since the report promised by the committee of public safety on those who were arrested had not yet been presented and as this report never appeared several members of the committee being in the number of the conspirators the protest was found among the papers of duperret and caused the imprisonment of all those who had signed it  the tidings of the insurrection in paris occasioned much fermentation in the departments who were expected to have demanded of the parisians in a manner more serious than by address or remonstrance why the representatives whom they had committed to their respect and protection were retained as prisoners and regarded as traitors the parisians who had been altogether passive during this struggle were not much moved by these menaces they had beheld with indifference the progress of the contest finding themselves delivered from the oppression of the former government concluding that no tyrant existed except such as bore the name of king and persuaded that that system could never return they were careless whether the plain or the mountain the cote droit or cote gauche held the reins of government this fatal error has been the source of almost all the evils that have desolated the republic for had the parisians attended to the political duties that were required of them in exchange for their enjoyment of political rights they would never have seen their fellowcitizens dragged daily through their streets to the scaffold at the nod of tyrants whom they ought early to have crushed  during the progress of this conspiracy the assemblies of the sections where the citizens met to deliberate on public affairs were either filled by the agents of the conspirators or governed by the conspirators themselves and where neither of them had weight sufficient to mislead the citizens they took advantage of their departure to propose and carry resolutions among themselves which they proclaimed as the voice of the section though these practices were denounced in the convention and though sometimes the section of today came to disclaim what the same section of yesterday had said yet the discovery of the fraud had no tendency to awaken the citizens to greater vigilance had they known to what end all the artifices of the conspirators tended they would undoubtedly have been on their guard but as they were made to serve the views of the traitors in demanding the expulsion of their representatives without believing that they had committed any crime so they were also made the instruments of consummating the treason by assisting in the violation of the representation itself in the arbitrary arrest of the deputies without knowing for what reason they were armed and assembled a long and mournful experience has at length shown them that it is not sufficient to feel the love of liberty without making continual efforts to preserve it that so many and various are the enemies which it has to combat before its reign can be permanently established that as much vigilance is required to guard it from the inroads of the aspiring demagogue as courage to shake off the yoke of despotism and that when the sacred code of freedom is violated in one point it leads to the destruction of the whole when the nobles whom the law had confounded in the class of citizens were persecuted as a cast when men of superior abilities became proscribed for aristocracy of talents those who were distinguished for neither deceived themselves in believing they were safe  although the citizens remained unmoved at these violations a considerable number of the departments felt the indignity and prepared to avenge the national honor some made eloquent remonstrances at the bar of the convention some deliberated on the convocation of the primary assemblies some proposed sending no farther contributions to paris while others took arms to suppress the rebellion of the commune against the republic for some time the arrival of the departmental force was expected but the conspirators who foresaw this formidable opposition to the accomplishment of their designs had the prudence to provide against it by sending previously into the departments as many of their emissaries as they could spare without weakening their force at home taken partly from among their accomplices in the convention who carried with them the importance of representatives of the people  the conspirators had also the advantage of being invested with the authority of government as they had seized on the machine they had possession of the convention who were compelled to follow the impulse already given them they were proprietors of the national wealth and had the armies at their command the departments on the contrary had no central point of union except the common indignation which the conduct of the conspirators had excited they had no treasure at their disposal but what arose from voluntary contributions and while they were deliberating what steps they should pursue the conspirators clothed with the national power which they had usurped reduced the departments to the same state of subjection as they had the convention and paris in the western departments where some of the deputies who were accused had fled and around whom the people had crowded partaking their indignation the armies that had hastily assembled as suddenly disappeared and the whole of the republic except the city of lions submitted to the yoke the causes of this defection which have hitherto been involved in obscurity it being the interest of the conspirators to keep them concealed from the world have lately been developed by one of the principal actors in those memorable scenes louvet deputy of the department of the loiret who distinguished himself early in the convention by his accusation of robespierre who unmasked the conspiracy of the  0th of march and who on the   st of may was honorably proscribed but is now restored to his friends and his country i shall transcribe his own words  guadet and myself reached caen on the   th of june on the  th of the same month eight departments namely five of the former province of brittany and three of normandy had entered into a common league they had just sent their commissaries to caen and their troops were at the point of arriving wimpfen the general of the whole force had hitherto confined all his exploits to traveling about and talking and under the most frivolous pretenses delayed every kind of organisation as soon as i saw him i was convinced that he was a determined royalist for he took no pains to conceal it i asked barbaroux and buzot what they could expect from such a man for the support of our cause one of them answered me that wimpfen was a man of honor and incapable of breaking his engagements and the other was altogether captivated by his agreeable manners guadet and pethion who had just arrived did not  my apprehensions they were astonished at my readiness in suspecting every one that was not as much a republican as myself from that time i saw that every thing was going the same way at caen as it had done at paris wimpfen was beloved by the normans he had a considerable party among the administrators of calvados and had gained the confidence of the bretons in order to take the command from him it was necessary to unite and make use of all our exertions but i found myself altogether unsupported every thing therefore was likely to fail on the side of the republic besides many normans who showed the most favorable dispositions toward us because in the credit of the newspapers they believed us to be royalists changed their conduct in the most pointed manner when by our conversation and particularly by our actions they came to know us better my first hopes were directed therefore toward the south if my wife had been at caen we should have gone aboard some vessel at honfleur bound to bourdeaux and as it would have been very easy for us to have seen whether things went no better there than elsewhere we should have taken our passage aboard the first american vessel and have been at this time safe in philadelphia  three weeks elapsed while wimpfen did nothing but lead to evreux the two thousand men who had come up from the different departments in the mean time report had so swelled this little troop that it was said at paris to be thirty thousand strong at this period the patriots there had recovered from their fears spoke their opinions publicly and were preparing to overthrow the terrible municipality many sections had already sent their commissaries to evreux who had carried back to paris different publications explanatory of our true sentiments and particularly a piece which they called but i know not for what reason wimpfens manifesto and which was a declaration of the commissaries of the united departments a declaration which i had composed with great labor which breathed only peace fraternity and assistance to the parisians but open war and exemplary punishment to some of the mountain to the municipality and the cordeliers and this just distinction had produced the best possible effect in paris the commissaries besides had seen and borne their testimonies against the base calumnies which had been uttered against this departmental army when it was accused of having worn the white cockade and expressed its wish for royalty every thing in short was so disposed that if at this moment our arms had met but with the slightest success the revolution would have been effected in paris without the interposition of the departmental army but it was not in this kind of success that wimpfen was interested  the mountain under great apprehensions had at length raised in paris   00 foot soldiers the better half of which were praying for our success and also seven or eight hundred ruffians as cowardly as they were thievish this collection had just entered vernon then it was that wimpfen talked of attacking this town and here suddenly a mr puysey of whom we had never heard was introduced to us by the general as an officer full of republicanism and knowledge he it was whom wimpfen ordered to attack vernon and certainly he very well obeyed his secret instructions  in order to surprise the enemy he went out in open day with drums beating he marched during the extreme heat and then made his soldiers who had no tents and who for the greater part had never been in a camp pass the night in the open air he lost the whole of the following day in attacking a small castle which he had the honor of taking the enemy having by this time been well and duly informed of all his maneuvers he in order to give them still greater advantage made his troops halt at the entrance of a wood a league distant from vernon placed his cannon one piece behind the other along a wall left all his little army in the greatest disorder did not even place sentinels and went to sleep at a cottage at half a league from the place an hour after a few hundred men suddenly made their appearance who surprised our men and fired three rounds of grape shot but the guns in all probability were charged only with powder for there is no doubt that it was but a farce well arranged however that may be a rout took place immediately among the soldiers who did not know with what numbers they had to engage who could scarcely find their arms and who were looking about in vain for their commander this was so expeditious a retreat that had it not been for the brave soldiers of the department of the isle and vilaine who stood their ground for some little time not a single field piece would have been saved in short not a man received the slightest wound the enemy did not advance thirty steps to follow up their easy victory this adventure did not hinder mr puysay whom the administration of the department of the eure entreated not to abandon them from declaring that evreux was not tenable and in reality the next day he withdrew himself sixteen leagues without striking a blow and abandoned a whole department to the enemy  on the arrival of the courier who brought us these sad tidings wimpfen did not appear at all disconcerted he moreover assured us that there was nothing unfortunate in this event he talked of fortifying caen of declaring the city in a state of defense of organizing an army somewhat stronger and of making papermoney which should be current throughout the seven united departments  these observations afforded room for deep reflection salles and myself after having a long time conversed on the subject were convinced that the general so far from wishing to march to paris intended to keep us shut up with him in the city where his party was prevalent to establish a communication with england and to commit us with that power if it were possible in fine to make use of us according to circumstances either to make his peace with the mountain if the coalition of the southern departments should be dissolved or make his peace with the republicans if they should overthrow the mountain our colleagues to whom we communicated our suspicions thought us visionaries and nothing less was necessary to convince them than what happened soon after  the general requested to have a conference with all of us who were deputies on an affair of the greatest consequence he began by describing to us our situation as very critical unless we took some vigorous resolution he was going to lisieux to organize his army and to form his camp in such a manner as to make at least for some time a proper defense the future however required something more permanent he returned back to his projects respecting aen to his proposals about the creation of paper money etc etc etc and as he judged it necessary to support his reasoning by terror though he ought to have known that such a mode of proceeding would have little influence on men accustomed to brave daily the fury and the murderers of the mountain an officer who undoubtedly had been instructed suddenly entered and with a frightened look informed the general that there was a riot that the people had arrested the convoys going to the army and that they were making violent motions against the deputies wimpfen affected to be angry at the precipitation with which he told him this alarming news it is nothing said he to the officer go and talk calmly to the people make them easy give them a little money if it be necessary when this man left us the general thought he might venture to make the great proposition reflect maturely on all that i have said resumed he in order to execute great projects we must employ great means but stay i am going to speak plainly i see only one possible mode of providing ourselves with men arms ammunition money and help of every kind that is to negotiate with england and myself have the means provided but i must have your authority your engagem nt  the reader may be assured that i have a perfect recollection of the lines i have written in italics and i can also assure him that i have stated truly the scene of the preceding passage it is difficult to paint the effect which these words produced on my too confiding friends all of them at the same moment struck with indignation without any previous consultation rose up the conference was instantly interrupted though the general tried every means of renewing it  wimpfen somewhat disconcerted left us without seeming to feel any resentment he only repeated to us that he was going to lisieux and infinuated that in order to restrain some malevolent people who were endeavoring in caen to render us unpopular we should all do better to remain in that place i think that every person must perceive the infamous snare into which this worthy ally of the mountain wished to draw us had fear or the desire of vengeance prompted us to accede to this proposition the republic would have been lost as well as our honor the mountain would have had victorious proofs against us it would have been they who were republicans we that were royalists and all the republicans persecuted for being royalists would have been arrested imprisoned and guillotined our conspiracy they would have said extended to the south it would have been we and not themselves who delivered toulon to the english i know indeed that after their terrible triumphs they did not fail to make such assertions but they found no honest or enlightened man who gave them credit they were therefore driven to their accusation of federalism an accusation not less absurd and calumnious  the next day barbaroux and myself went to lisieux the general was somewhat surprised to see us but he did not receive us with less courtesy we learned what he himself took care not to inform us that he had just had a secret conference with one of the agents of the chiefs of the mountain who for three weeks past were throwing away handfuls of assignats at evreux and every where on their passage and who soon after probably sure of powerful support came with the intention of continuing the same plan of corruption at caen even under our eyes we found at lisieux many people in arms but no soldiers no organization no discipline and the rage of making motions a secret hand in a single day disorganized even the breton battalions which had hitherto been firmly united the general was at pains to make us observe this disorder and to lead us to conclude from thence that he could not maintain his position there but that he must march back with all his troops to caen and make this city the central point of resistance etc he nevertheless avoided repeating to us his english propositions accordingly the retreat took place the following day all my friends then acknowledged that our affairs were ruined in the western departments in vain did the general after having gone back to caen where he was always desirous of establishing himself show dispositions for a serious defense in vain did he create staff officers arrange his troops employ himself in searching for a convenient situation for encampment establish batteries of eighteenpounders all this parade no longer imposed on our colleagues  it appears clear that wimpfen the evening before had given notice by one of the couriers of the committee of public safety to the mountain and i hope that i am understood when i say the mountain that it is not of the whole body nor even all its leaders that i speak but the principal cordeliers of the mountain such as la croix fabre deglantine and who were equally deceiving and shifting between the republicans pethion guadet etc and the dictator robespierre  that wimpfen had given information of the bad success of his english overtures and that it was useless to renew the proposition it also appears that the mountain then determined to disperse our little band but without neglecting to throw on our party that coloring of royalism which was so necessary to effect our ruin and it was without doubt at this period only that they determined to deliver at least to all appearance toulon to the english what i am now saying will possibly astonish every one who is not well informed as to this business but when the proper time shall come i will explain myself fully with respect to this terrible farce of toulon  it is thought that wimpfen had a safe conduct from the mountain and a ready opportunity of going into england but i know not what became of mr puysay who suffered himself to be so complaisantly beaten at vernon the administrators of calvados had given notice to the administration of their shameful defection they had secretly made their peace with the mountain without giving us any information the third day only they made it known to us and the method they took was to send and post up at the gate of the intendance where we lodged the mountain placard in which was the decree of our being out of the law  the counterpart of the scene acted at paris between the conspirators and the convention was attempted at lions and the same day was appointed in both cities for the accomplishment of their purpose at the head of this provincial conspiracy was a man named chalier a piedmontais by birth for most of the agents of the conspirators were foreigners and a sharper by profession having fled his own country on account of having committed fraudulent bankruptcies he was sent to lions by the commune of paris after the massacre of september and opened his mission by the murder of nine persons who had been committed to prison by the municipality of lions for slight offenses agreeably to the instructions he had received and in conformity to the general plan which the commune of paris and the conspirators had formed their apostle labored incessantly to propagate the doctrines of robbery rebellion and murder seeing that these exhortations had been attended with their due effects in paris the needy villains general home where the promise of riches without labor had allured all the idle and profligate to the standard of the conspirators he was disappointed that more proselytes to this seducing system had not honored his embassy at lions where society was less disunited and where industry had established a superstitious regard to property altogether incompatible with chaliers system of reform a few however he found who listened to his projects and to those he communicated his plan of regeneration which consisted in placing a guillotine the following day on one of the bridges where all the capital merchants who were necessarily aristocrats were to be executed and their bodies thrown into the rhone though this secret was imparted under the solemnity of an oath yet there were some who touched with remorse gave private notice of it to the citizens who took measures to prevent its execution  chalier who ought instantly to have been put to death by the just indignation of the people was suffered to continue his revolutionary projects to the great annoyance of the wealthy citizens against whom his attacks were continually directed by perseverance he had at length formed a set out of the profligate which are to be found in all large communities and with their aid he was encouraged to attempt once more the accomplishment of his designs  he had been appointed procureur of the commune and as the municipality were composed of jacobins and of others as weak as those were wicked chalier supported by the faction of paris became its principal director knowing the progress of the conspiracy in that city he prepared his friends for the same events at lions by declaring openly in the popular society on the   th of may that the presidents and secretaries of the sections together with the rich egotists should be beheaded on the following day the municipality on the   th influenced by chalier had levied a revolutionary tax of six millions of livres on the rich to be paid in twentyfour hours this municipal levy excited murmurs as was expected and gave the anarchists pretenses for raising tumults the rich were destined to be the victims and chaliers band prepared themselves to be the executioners but the lyonnais might have crushed this insurrection in its birth had not the narrow spirit of traffic which sees nothing beneficial in society except the accumulation of wealth made them feel that their country was but a secondary object and fitted only to employ the attention of those whose time was of less mercantile profit than their own  apprised of the intentions of the conspirators who had made out the list of the proscriptions and arranged the plan of the massacre the citizens flew to arms and seized on the arsenal the conspirators kept possession of the town hall and both parties prepared for action for lions now consisted only of those who intended to murder and those who did not like to be murdered the combat was vigorously supported on both sides for the conspirators were aided by a party of military whom they had previously engaged in their interests victory remained doubtful for a long time as the battle was fought in the streets of the city one quarter being in the possession of the conspirators while the republicans were masters of the other it was not till midnight that the citizens took the town hall which was the head quarters of chaliers party this event decided the contest which had been severe and bloody the conspirators were imprisoned and their chief after a long and formal trial was condemned by the tribunal to death had the same resistance been made to oppression in other communes that of paris would have been compelled to submit to the general will but as the departments had declined the contest lions was left to withstand alone all the resentment of the conspirators and was besieged a few weeks after this period  letter v the chief point of accusation against the deputies who were arrested on the second of june was the continued opposition which they were accused of having made to the formation of a republican constitution this calumny was contradicted by the fact the proscribed deputies having after the labor of some months presented a plan of constitution to the convention which had been published by its order but of which it was a part of the conspirators plan to interrupt and prevent the discussion  as many believed that a constitution was the remedy for every evil moral and political and even physical that afflicted the state and that when once prepared and administered all its maladies would be cured some of the departments were appeased by the assurance that their present rulers would give them in a fortnight what they were made to believe their predecessors had so long withheld  the appearance of this constitution within the appointed time tended greatly to allay the discontents and gave an air of popularity to the proceedings of the conspirators for as long as the people obtained the blessing they were indifferent from what hand they received it they were little aware of the purposes of their tyrants who only giving them one short glimpse of this wishedfor constitution and having obtained their sanction of it threw it aside locked up this hallowed book of the law shrouded with a dark veil the tables of the rights of man and boldly proclaimed a newinvented species of tyranny under the denomination of revolutionary government that epithet has since justified every enormity warranted the violation of every principle and theft and pillage noyades and fusilades have all received the common appellation of revolutionary measures  what contributed also to dissipate the storm that was going to be poured on paris was the dread which the departments themselves had of extending the civil war which then raged in the country south of the loire when there was a possibility of attaining by milder means the objects they had in view the reestablishment of their representatives and confining the extravagant power of the commune of paris within its just bounds what also misled them was the subjection to which paris itself was reduced and which deceived by addresses from the convention and the commune they mistook for the enjoyment of tranquillity and what finished the contest was the thunder of the conspirators hurled against the departments which had shown most zeal in favor of the imprisoned deputies the constituted powers of which were dissolved by the convention and its members declared guilty of acts of rebellion it was fortunate for the usurpers that this almost general and speedy acquiescence took place as independently of the coalesced powers they had a most formidable enemy to contend with in the royalists of the vendee who while these struggles for power convulsed paris were organizing a force that but for the invincible spirit of liberty that inspired the immense majority of the republic was calculated to overwhelm every contending party and bring back the ancient despotism with all the avenging terrors of sacerdotal and aristocratical rage  the country which was the scene of this insurrection in favor of priesthood and royaly is situated between the loire and the charente stretching along the coasts between the two rivers and making part of the territory which was called under the ancient government the province of poitou it is a country fertile both in corn and pasture and from its rich abundance distributed plenty to most of the neighboring departments and furnished even to the center of france a considerable part of its supplies where nature had done so much to make this region the seat of plenty the inhabitant was not solicitous to increase his riches by foreign traffic so that commerce contributed but little to his opulence and manufacturers were almost unknown however innocent and pastoral the life of the shepherd and the husbandman has been represented and however productive of those vices that corrupt and enervate mankind the commercial intercourse between nations may have been found this communication brings with it an interchange of knowledge and manners which improves and embellishes society while the permanent habitudes of the former serve to retain him in a state which adds nothing to the common stock of knowledge and contributes nothing to the progressive improvement of the world the negative merit of exemption from vices to which we have never been tempted may be granted to this intellectual darkness where it is placed beyond the reach of endangering more enlightened society but when ignorance becomes the sport of fanaticism and ambitious men make it the instrument of their guilty designs it becomes a calamity the most terrible in the list of human evils  the department of the vendee from its local situation had little other intercourse with the rest of the republic than what arose from the export of the superfluity of its produce and while the great and immortal principles which directed the revolution awakened in the bosom of every mechanic and peasant throughout france the noble sentiment that no man was superior to him in his rights the vendean who had only heard of these things through the organ of the noble and the priest remained the implicit believer and obedient vassal while his fellowcitizens were rejoicing in their emancipation  in this insulated department the feodal system had been maintained in all its rigor the provincial laws of brittany which from the minuteness and singularity of their oppression would be rather subjects of ridicule than abhorrence had they not contributed so much to the degradation of the human character in the tyrant who inflicted and the slave who suffered them were incorporated with other laws equally barbarous and peculiar to the country  as this part of the republic from its geographical and moral situation had received but a few faint rays of the light of that liberty which had burst forth in france and as already the seeds of discord had been plentifully scattered among the inhabitants by the fanatical clergy it was fitted to become the retreat of all who were averse to the new order of public affairs accordingly the nobles and the priests who in the first meetings of the constituent assembly discovered that by the removal of those factitious barriers by which they had hitherto been separated from the other classes of the people they were now to mingle in the common mass found refuge in these departments where they trusted that those distinctions might still be respected which had elsewhere sunk into contempt their influence was extensive and as their zeal was quickened by implacable resentment those laws of which they could not hinder the promulgation and particularly those which respected their own orders were but imperfectly executed or apparently obeyed having found that that enthusiasm which led the constituent assembly to overthrow these gigantic privileges had considerably evaporated toward its close and seeing also that the court in struggling to regain its lost power sought their alliance they grew bolder in their pretensions and became more active in their hatred toward the establishment of the new government at first an air of general discontent overspread this part of the country  partial fermentations next succeeded and the spirit of insurrection at length became so general that the constituent assembly was compelled to take measures to stop its alarming progress  the means employed by the legislature were calculated rather to increase than prevent the evil for instead of sending commissaries from their own body to examine into its causes instead of enlightening the people and unmasking and punishing those who had prompted them to rebellion they entrusted the court with the execution of their decrees and as it might have been expected the insurrection obtained additional force and even a sort of royal sanction  the authority of the next assembly was insufficient to repress so alarming an evil too much divided by the spirit of party and too much occupied in struggles against the court the legislative assembly for a long time applied only palliatives to the disease nor till it wore an aspect dangerous to the existence of the revolution was the assembly roused to the application of any effective remedy the measure they first proposed was the banishment of the priests who had refused adherence to the new constitution but this measure appeared so alarming to the court and so destructive of the system it had adopted to regain its lost influence that the king was advised to make use of the repressive power which the constitution gave him and to refuse his royal sanction though this refusal hastened the destruction of the court already tottering it gave new courage to the discontented who finding themselves so zealously supported burst into open resistance in the vendee and the neighboring departments which it required all the exertion of the departmental force to suppress  the fall of the court suspended for a time the progress of this insurrection but the unhappy auspices under which the convention met inspired fresh ardour and led the insurgents to new exertions in hopes of restoring the monarchy a vast plan of insurrection was formed which not only comprehended the vendee and the adjoining departments but extended itself through a great part of brittany the convention was too much occupied in resisting the conspirators at paris to attend to the progress of the royalists who were suffered to take uninterrupted possession of the vendee and the neighboring departments before the end of march they had organized an army of  0000 men consisting chiefly of peasants servants of the former nobility smugglers poachers and gamekeepers men well accustomed to the use of arms and had begun their march toward paris before the convention were formally advised that any insurrection had taken place their army was commanded by experienced chiefs who had served under the ancient government but what gave the rebellion its fiercest rage was the fanaticism which the priest inspired who marching at the head of their columns bearing the crucifix in his hand pointed out to his followers the road to victory or heaven the progress which the royalists had made before any force was opposed to them was so alarming and at the period when the jacobins had seized upon the government at paris the portion of the country which the vendeens had subdued was so extensive that it seemed doubtful of which party france was destined to be the prey the royalists had entire possession of the loire almost as far as paris and menaced rochelle on the one side while they besieged nantes on the other and opened a passage into the departments which made part of the former province of brittany  the faction at paris did not fail to improve the events of the vendee to their own advantage pethion buzot rabaud st etienne isnard lanjuinais barbaroux guadet louvet and others of the proscribed deputies having made their escape the conspirators declared in an address to the departments that the project of the deputies who were still in arrestation was evidently the same as that of their colleagues who were gone to facilitate the march of the rebels and aid them in the establishment of the royal power this calumny which was refuted by every address received from the departments see appendix no ii  formed the basis of the accusation which was framed against the gironde and the founders and most strenuous supporters of the republic were soon after dragged to the scaffold as the advocates and protectors of royalty  in proportion as the departments relaxed in their energy the ferocity of the conspirators increased an event also happened at this period which from the calumnies to which it gave rise and the consequences it produced proved fatal to the arrested deputies this was the assassination of marat in the first dawn of the conspiracy marat became a principal instrument in the hands of the traitors who found him well fitted for their purposes and being saved from the punishment which usually follows personal insult by the contempt which the deformity and diminutiveness of his person excited he became the habitual retailer of all the falsehoods and calumnies which were invented by his party against every man of influence or reputation he was the thersites of the convention whom no one would deign to chastise for his extravagance made his employers often disclaim him as a fool while the general sentiment he excited was the sort of antipathy we feel for a loathsome reptile his political sentiments often varied for he sometimes exhorted the choice of a chief and sometimes made declamations in favor of a limited monarchy but what rendered him useful to the conspirators was his readiness to publish every slander which they framed and to exhort to every horror which they meditated  his rage for denunciation was so great that he became the dupe of the idle and his daily paper contains the names of great criminals who existed only in the imagination of those who imposed on his credulous malignity  after this first preacher of blood had performed the part allotted to him in the plan of evil he was confined to his chamber by a lingering disease to which he was subject and of which he would probably soon have died but he was assassinated in his bath by a young woman who had traveled with this intention from caen in normandy charlotte anne marie corday was a native of st saturnin in the department of the orne she appears to have lived in a state of literary retirement with her father and by the study of ancient and modern historians to have imbibed a strong attachment to liberty she had been accustomed to assimilate certain periods of ancient history with the events that were passing before her and was probably excited by the examples of antiquity to the commission of a deed which she believed with fond enthusiasm would deliver and save her country  being at caen when the citizens of the department were enrolling themselves to march to the relief of the convention the animation with which she saw them devoting their lives to their country led her to execute without delay the project she had formed louvet speaks of this extraordinary woman in the following terms  a young person came to speak to barbaroux at the intendance where we all lodged she was tall and well shaped of the most graceful manners and modest demeanor there was in her countenance which was beautiful and engaging and in all her movements a mixture of softness and dignity which were evident indications of a heavenly mind she came always attended by a servant and waited for barbaroux in an apartment through which we passed frequently since this young woman has fixed on herself the attention of the world we have each of us recollected the circumstances of her visits of which it is now clear that some favor solicited for a friend was only a pretense her true motive undoubtedly was to become acquainted with some of the founders of the republic for which she was going to devote herself and perhaps she was desirous that at some future day her features should be brought to their recollection  i declare and solemnly attest that she never communicated to us a word of her design and if such actions could be directed and she had consulted us would it have been against marat that we should have pointed her stroke did we not know that he was then languishing under a fatal disease and had but a few days to live    under pretense of going home she came to paris and the third day after her arrival obtained admission to marat she had invented a story to deceive him and when he promised her that all the promoters of the insurrection in the departments should be sent to the guillotine she drew out a knife which she had purchased for the occasion and plunged it into his breast  she was immediately apprehended and conducted to the abbaye prison from which she was transferred to the conciergerie and brought before the revolutionary tribunal  she acknowledged the deed and justified it by asserting that it was a duty she owed her country and mankind to rid the world of a monster whose sanguinary doctrines were framed to involve the country in anarchy and civil war and asserted her right to put marat to death as a convict already condemned by the public opinion she trusted that her example would inspire the people with that energy which had been at all times the distinguished characteristic of republicans and which she defined to be that devotedness to our country which renders life of little comparative estimation  her deportment during the trial was modest and dignified there was so engaging a softness in her countenance that it was difficult to conceive how she could have armed herself with sufficient intrepidity to execute the deed her answers to the interrogatories of the court were full of point and energy she sometimes surprised the audience by her wit and excited their admiration by her eloquence her face sometimes beamed with sublimity and was sometimes covered with smiles at the close of her trial she took three letters from her bosom and presented them to the judges and requested they might be forwarded to the persons to whom they were addressed two were written to barbaroux in which with great ease and spirit she relates her adventures from her leaving caen to the morning of her trial the other was an affectionate and solemn adieu to her father she retired while the jury deliberated on their verdict and when she again entered the tribunal there was a majestic solemnity in her demeanor which perfectly became her situation she heard her sentence with attention and composure and after conversing for a few minutes with her counsel and a friend of mine who had sat near her during the trial and whom she requested to discharge some trifling debts she had incurred in the prison she left the court with the same serenity and prepared herself for the last scene  she had concluded her letter to her father with this verse of corneille cest le crime qui fait la honte et non pas lechafaud and it is difficult to conceive the kind of heroism which she displayed in the way to execution the women who were called furies of the guillotine and who had assembled to insult her on leaving the prison were awed into silence by her demeanor while some of the spectators uncovered their heads before her and others gave loud tokens of applause there was such an air of chastened exultation thrown over her countenance that she inspired sentiments of love rather than sensations of pity she excited in this interesting situation a very strong and singular passion in a young man of the name of adam lux a commissary from mayence he accidentally crossed the street she was passing in her way to execution and became instantly enamoured not of her only but what was more extraordinary of the guillotine he published a few days after a pamphlet in which he proposed raising a statue to her honor and inscribing on the pedestal  greater than bruius and invoked her shade wandering through elysium with those glorious personages who had devoted themselves for their country he was sent to the prison of the force where a friend of mine often saw him and where he talked of nothing to him but of charlotte corday and the guillotine which since she had perished appeared to him transformed into an altar on which he would consider it as a privilege to be sacrificed and was only solicitous to receive the stroke of death from the identical instrument by which she had suffered a few weeks after his imprisonment he was executed as a counterrevolutionist  she ascended the scaffold with undaunted firmness and knowing that she had only to die was resolved to die with dignity she had learned from her jailor the mode of punishment but was not instructed in the detail and when the executioner attempted to tie her feet to the plank she resisted from an apprehension that he had been ordered to insult her but on his explaining himself she submitted with a smile when he took off her handkerchief the moment before she bent under the fatal stroke she blushed deeply and her head which was held up to the multitude the moment after exhibited this last impression of offended modesty  the leaders of the faction who thought every measure good that could be made subservient to their purpose found this event too replete with favorable circumstances to be neglected marat whom they had thrown aside to die at leisure unless perchance he should have lived to share the fate to which they afterward condemned their other agents was now restored to more than his ancient honors was proclaimed a martyr and his death ordered to be lamented as an irreparable loss to the republic the conspirators declared that no farther doubt of the federalism of the departments remained the death of marat was the point of conviction every member of the mountain was to be assassinated in his turn and the traitors of the departments had their accomplices in paris who had whetted their poniards to involve the city in destruction though the parisians were not sufficiently credulous to believe these calumnies the faction made them the pretense to proceed to the farther commission of crimes and while they endeavored to amuse the people with what they called the inauguration of marat and of chalier they were meditating the murder of the deputies whom they had driven from the legislature  it was impossible to contemplate without indignation and despair that glorious revolution which had opened to mankind the brightest prospects of happiness and which had promised the most beneficial effects to the world become the sport of the cruel and the prey of the rapacious to see a people who were called to liberty bending their necks like the votaries of the storied assassin of the mountain at the nod of their tyrant to see a nation which had possessed rousseau mably and voltaire prostrate in frantic enthusiasm before the shrine of marat like the idolaters of motapama whose devotion rose in proportion to the hideousness of their gods  every day some pretended plot was discovered some dark conspiracy attributed successively to nobles priests bankers and foreigners was dragged to light but the specimens produced of these counterrevolutionary projects were often such as did little honor to the invention of those by whom they were exhibited sometimes letters were found from agents of the coalesced powers but they were generally so ill fabricated that they only deceived those who could not read them  the departments having submitted to the usurpers they now began their measures of severity against those who had resisted their authority the general denomination for disaffection to their principles was that of being suspected and accordingly a decree was issued to arrest all those who came under this title the revolutionary tribunal not having all the energy necessary to carry into execution the plans that were meditating was denounced for its moderantism and the members of which it was composed renewed  a certain class of the women of paris whogave themselves the title of revolutionary women had been serviceable auxiliaries to the conspirators and had taken place of the poissards who not having all the energy which the present exigencies required had yielded the palm to their revolutionary successors these female politicians held deliberative assemblies and afterward presented their views to the convention while they influenced its debates by their vociferations in the tribunes which they now exclusively occupied on the days of tumult which preceded the   st of may they had mounted guard in person at the convention and prevented the execution of certain orders which they disliked they now presented themselves at the bar of the assembly and demanded the exclusion of the former nobles from every function civil or military the renewal of all the administrations throughout the republic the examination of the conduct of the ministers the arrest of every suspected person the raising of the whole nation in mass and obliging the women to wear red caps the convention having shown some disinclination to comply with these modest requisitions these female politicians insulted some of the members and the society was dissolved by a decree  in the mean time the royalists had proceeded almost as far as tours on their way to paris lions was in a state of formidable resistance the marseillois were at avignon mentz surrendered to the prussians the province of alsace was overrun by the austrians valenciennes was taken after a formidable siege and cambray was summoned to surrender the piedmontese had invaded the department of montblanc formerly savoy the spaniards had invested perpignan and the english were masters of toulon  more efficient measures became necessary than had hitherto been employed and that which was now adopted was putting into requisition every individual that could be made useful to his country in any situation in which his services were claimed that part of the community which was destined to the most active service were the young men from    to    years of age who under the name of the first requisition were immediately invested with the title of the defenders of their country and as soon as arms were procured sent to the frontiers  whatever may be the difference of political opinion respecting the events of the french revolution there can be no dissenting voice against the tribute of honor and applause which belongs to the armies of the republic amidst all the internal commotions of contending chiefs regardless of plain or mountain of cote droit or cote gauche they saw their country invaded and bravely repulsed the attack leaving the arrangement of the internal concerns of the state to the individuals who were left behind they were not of that class which composes the usual mass of armies the idle and the profligate who seek a refuge from industry or want in the vocation of a soldier and they were of that age when the love of military glory and the passion for liberty are felt with the greatest ardour this passion was nourished by the consciousness that their sections their communes the convention and their country were looking on them with fond and anxious expectation and the decrees which declared that they deserved well of the republic animated them with a more ardent desire to merit the eulogium  one of the great springs which mechanically inspired courage and resolution was the patriotic songs and hymns which were continually resounding through their camps but the great moral motive that urged them to valorous deeds was that contempt of death which men in all ages who combat for liberty and their country have felt and this was a motive which their antagonists could not feel the soldier was conscious that if he survived he should partake of the honor he had labored to acquire and if he died that his country would enroll his name amongst those of its deliverers and that his fate would inspire that sentiment which our animated poet has so beautifully described in his ode on the glorious dead how sleep the brave who sink to rest by all their countrys wishes blessed when spring with dewy singers cold returns to deck their hallowed mould she there shall dress a sweeter sod than fancys feet have ever trod by fairy hands their knell is rung by fairy forms their dirge is sung there honor comes a pilgrim gray to bless the turf that wraps their clay and freedom shall a while repair to dwell a weeping hermit there   but the life of a modern soldier dr johnson has observed is ill represented by heroic fiction war has means of destruction more formidable than the cannon and the sword of the thousands and ten thousands that perished in our late contest with france and spain a very small part ever felt the stroke of an enemy the rest languished in tents and ships amidst damps and putrefaction pale torpid spiritless and helpless gasping and groaning unpitied among men made obdurate by long continuance of helpless misery and were at last whelmed in pits or heaved into the ocean without notice and without remembrance by incommodious encampments and unwholesome stations where courage is useless and enterprise impracticable fleets are silently dispeopled and armies sluggishly melted away  from this devastation of disease the french have been exempted for the evils which dr johnson enumerates most commonly proceed from the absence of those conveniences which money can procure but a great part of the first requisition which was taken from the class of the rich as well as of the poor were enabled by the attention of their friends and the expenditure of their own income to procure not only the means of plenty to themselves but to contribute to the accommodation of their less wealthy companions  letter vi the usurpers saw that those young citizens who had obeyed with alacrity the call of the convention against the common enemy were not fitted to be the instruments of these revolutionary projects revolutionary committees had been established in every commune of the departments and in every section of paris but though the last were in general composed of the creatures of the faction they were not so secure of what they called the energy of the committees in the country for this reason a certain number of what was termed the most sansculottide and revolutionary citizens of each section of paris were chosen by their respective committees to compose a body of six thousand men which was called the revolutionary army and which accompanied by a a traveling guillotine guillotine ambulante was to issue forth from paris into the departments to invite the people to raise themselves to the height of the revolution  in the mean while the usurpers framed an act of accusation against the deputies whom they had driven from the convention on the   st of may and arrested the seventythree members who had protested against that measure at this period also the vague report of a spy that beauvais a deputy of the convention had been put to death by the english at toulon served as a pretext to the usurpers for inflicting twenty years imprisonment on whoever should introduce english merchandise into the republic and for throwing into prison and confiscating the property of all those who had been born in the british dominions except such as were employed in manufactures this impolitic and savage decree in open violation of the rights of nations and breach of that hospitality under the protection of which but a few months before they had invited the english then in france to remain among them was put into execution and though it met with universal reprobation yet as terror was the order of the day no one felt himself sufficiently bold to demand its repeal and as business of more importance lay before the conspirators than the consideration of the cases of individuals those who had the credulity to trust to their protection were left to ruminate on their injustice  the next step taken by the conspirators was that of throwing aside the encumbrance of the constitution a report was accordingly prepared showing the impossibility of conducting the machine of the revolution without the use of extraordinary measures and the convention voted without discussion that the constitution should be set aside and that the government should become revolutionary the superiority of a monarchical over a republican government has been said to consist in the unity of its action particularly in cases of danger the romans in time of great public calamity were accustomed to throw a veil over the tables of the laws and place in the hands of one of their fellowcitizens whom they called a dictator the whole energy of the government as long as the danger which threatened the state should exist rousseau admires this policy and recommends it in similar cases to all free governments of whatever advantage the temporary absence of liberty might have been had the people of france like the romans chosen those to rule the storm who had the greatest skill or the most acknowledged virtue those sanguinary and ferocious characters who now seized on the power instead of making this temporary despotism a means of saving the country like the malevolent genii who preside over evil filled it with horror desolation and death  to reconcile the nation to the assumption of their new power the conspirators thought it necessary to show their distinguishing attachment to what they called the people by the exercise of every kind of persecution against what they called aristocracy an appellation by no means confined to the adherents of the former court or the nobility to the aristocracy of talents succeeded the aristocracy of commerce which signified that he who enriched himself while he enriched his country by the supply of its wants was an object of suspicion or a counterrevolutionist they therefore conceived the project of reducing every article of merchandise and sublistence to what they called the maximum and obliged light every merchant and shopkeeper to sell his goods to the public at the prescribed rate whatever might have been the first cost though it was evident to the most superficial observer that such a measure must be eventually destructive of commerce and productive of the evil it was intended to prevent yet as it was an evil that but remotely affected the consumer it was calculated to please the lower class of people  the faction armed with the absolute power they had usurped fancied they could control all possible circumstances and though they could not but perceive that the manufacturer must necessarily cease his labor when the new materials exceeded the stated price of the goods he exposed to sale and that the merchant could no longer go on with his commerce when the cargo which he had purchased abroad was struck with the revolutionary maximum on its entrance into port though they could not but see that it was a law fraught with every evil yet as it was a blow at the aristocracy of commerce and a revolutionary measure it was proposed and adopted  while they were thus persuading the people what interest they took in their welfare by the introduction of plenty in the extinction of monopolies and the reduction of the price of merchandise they were equally solicitous to show their regard for the public safety by the punishment of traitors and conspirators for a long time the jacobins had demanded the trial of marie antoinette whose existence they declared endangered that of the republic she was accordingly arraigned for having committed a series of crimes which in the language of the indictment comprehended not merely counterrevolution ary projects but all the enormities of the messalinas brunehauts fredegondes and medicis a curious account of the evidence in support of these charges and the effect which her behavior produced upon robespierre is given by vilate a young man of the revolutionary tribunal the scene passed during the trial at a tavern near the tuilleries where he was invited to dine with robespierre barrere and st just seated around the table he says in a close and retired room they asked me to give them some leading features of the evidence on the trial of the austrian i did not forget that expostulation of insulted nature when hebert accusing antoinette of having committed the most shocking crime she turned with dignity toward the audience and said i appeal to the conscience and feelings of every mother present to declare if there be one amongst them who does not shudder at the idea of such horrors robespierre struck with this answer as by an electrical stroke broke his plate with his fork that blockhead hebert cried he as if it were not enough that she was really a messalina he must make her an agrippina also and furnish her with the triumph of exciting the sympathy of the public in her last moments  marie antoinette made no defense and called no witnesses alleging that no positive fact had been produced against her she had preserved an uniform behavior during the whole of her trial except when a starting tear accompanied her answer to hebert she was condemned about four in the morning and heard her sentence with composure but her firmness forsook her in the way from the court to her dungeon  she burst into tears when as if ashamed of this weakness she observed to her guards that though she wept at that moment they should see her go to the scaffold without shedding a tear  in her way to execution where she was taken after the accustomed manner in a cart with her hands tied behind her she paid little attention to the priest who attended her and still less to the surrounding multitude her eyes though bent on vacancy did not conceal the emotion that was laboring at her heart  her cheeks were sometimes in a singular manner streaked with red and sometimes overspread with deadly paleness but her general look was that of indignant sorrow she reached the place of execution about noon and when she turned her eyes toward the gardens and the palace she became visibly agitated she ascended the scaffold with precipitation and her head was in a moment held up to the people by the executioner  the trial of marie antoinette was followed by that of the accused deputies although those guardians of the public weal the jacobins had repeatedly urged the convention to bring forward their trial it had been long delayed from the difficulty of finding any proofs that wore the appearance of probability and it remained long undecided what should be the charges and who should be the victims the substance of the accusation was at length founded on a sort of sportive party romance written by camille desmoulins on brissot and the brissotins and what was meant by the author merely to excite a laugh was distorted to serve this horrible purpose camille it is said remonstrated loudly on this perversion of his intentions and disclaimed any participation in the guilt he declared that the charges were only extravagancies of his own imagination and that he could not support any of them by evidence this remonstrance was ineffectual and the romance formed part of the indictment which was filled up with charges of royalism and federalism which being presented to the assembly for their sanction the decree of accusation passed without a discussion  the witnesses in support of the charges consisted principally of the chiefs of the municipality of paris who were the original accusers but the defense which the prisoners made was so entirely destructive of the accusation that though the judges and the jury had bound up their nature to this execrable deed though the audience like the tribunes of the jacobins and the convention were hired to applaud this crime the eloquence of the accused drew iron tears down their cheeks and convinced the whole tribunal of the infamy and falsehood of the charges imagine the remorse with which the minds of the jury must have been wrung when their employment compelled them to dress out matter for condemnation from the absurd and lying fables of the conspirators who were called as witnesses to the indictment while to the demonstration even of the most perverse and ignorant the prisoners refuted every charge with triumph on their accusers and if any suspicion had existed with respect to their patriotism or love of the republic the prosecution would have served to dispel it  the judges as well as the jury although determined to execute their atrocious commission saw that the defense of the prisoners would carry conviction to the minds of the audience who notwithstanding their being hired by the accusers began to show signs of compassion the court therefore wrote to the convention to inform them that if the trials were permitted to proceed the formalities of the law would reduce them to extreme difficulties and observed that in a revolutionary process it was not necessary to be incumbered with troublesome witnesses or a long defense this humane epistle was supported by a deputation of the jacobins who spoke a still plainer language by demanding a decree that the accused should be condemned whenever the jury should feel themselves sufficiently instructed without attending to the whole of the charge or hearing what the prisoners might have to allege in their defense to this measure the society was urged by the municipal witnesses who were stung with shame at seeing their perjuries unveiled  the decree empowering the jury to stop the prosecution at whatever period they thought proper was virtually pronouncing the sentence of death and the tribunal releasing themselves from the torture they were compelled to suffer while their consciences were every hour more and more loaded with the conviction of the innocence of the victims whose judicial murder they were bound to perpetrate lost no time in declaring that they were sufficiently instructed  alas in what were they sufficiently instructed that the men they were going to condemn were those who were the most distinguished for talents and most devoted to the establishment of the republic of which they were the founders were not this sanguinary jury sufficiently instructed that it was for their virtues and not their crimes that these victims had been dragged before them and yet with all this conviction on their minds they coolly commanded the murder  this atrocious condemnation was remonstrated against by the prisoners in vain in vain they alleged that against some of them no evidence whatever had been heard that their names had scarcely been mentioned at the tribunal and that whatever pretense the jury might have for calling themselves sufficiently instructed respecting the rest they could not be informed of the crimes of those against whom no witnesses had appeared the court sheltering themselves under the sanction of a decree were little inclined to give the reasons of their conviction and therefore replied to the arguments of the prisoners by ordering the military force to take them from the tribunal valaze in a transport of indignation stabbed himself before the court brissot vergniaud gensonne la source fonfrede sillery ducos carra duperret gardien duprat faucher beauvais duchastel mainvielle la caze le hardy boileau anteboul and vigee were led to execution on the following day vergniaud having a presage of his impending fate had early provided himself with poison but finding that his young friends fonfrede and ducos who he had some hope would be spared were companions of his misfortune he gave the phial to the officer of the guard resolving to wait the appointed moment and to perish with them  they met their sat with all the calm of innocence and breathed their last vows for the safety and liberty of the republic those who were the melancholy witnesses of their last hours in prison love to relate how they spoke and felt and acted i have been told by one who was their fellow prisoner and friend that their minds were in such a state of elevation that no one could approach them with the commonplace and ordinary topics of consolation brissot was serious and thoughtful and at times an air of discontent clouded his brow but it was evident that he mourned over the fate of his country and not his own gensonne firm and selfcollected seemed fearful of sullying his lips by mentioning the names of his murderers he did not utter a word respecting his own situation but made many observations on the state of the republic and expressed his ardent wishes for its happiness vergniaud was sometimes serious and sometimes gay he amused his fellow prisoners at times with the recital of poetry which he retained in his memory and sometimes indulged them with the last touches of that sublime eloquence which was now for ever lost to the world fonfrede and ducos relieved the sombre of the piece by the habitual liveliness of their characters although each lamented the fate of his brother to their respective friends and sometimes shed tears over the distress and ruin of their wives and children for both had young families and immense fortunes their courage was the more exemplary as their fate was altogether unexpected  previously to the imprisonment of the deputies while they were yet under arrest in their own houses i frequently visited those who were in the number of our friends vergniaud had long told me that he saw no just foundation for hope and that he would rather die than live a witness of his countrys shame fonfrede and ducos had the full enjoyment of their liberty till the act of accusation appeared in which they had not the least suspicion that they should be included the day previous to the reading of this murderous proscription in the convention fonfrede had accompanied us to montmorenci about four leagues from paris where we had wandered till evening amidst that enchanting scenery which rousseau once inhabited and which he had so luxuriantly described alas while the charms of nature had soothed our imaginations and made us forget awhile the scenes of moral deformity exhibited in the polluted city we had left while every thing around us breathed delight and the landscape was a hymn to the almighty the assassins were at their bloody work and plotting the murder of our friends the next day fonfrede was sent to the conciergerie and we saw him no more a week after we were ourselves arrested he conveyed to us from his dungeon his sympathy in our misfortunes and after his condemnation wrote to bid us a last farewell but the letter was carried to the committee of general safety and never reached us  they were condemned at midnight when they returned to their prison they gave the appointed signal of their fate to their fellow prisoners whose seclusion afforded them no other means of knowing it by singing a parody of the chorus of the marseillois hymn  contre nous de la tyranny letandard sanglant est leve   after spending the few hours of life that remained in conversation now and then enlivened by the sallies of the young and gay amongst them they bade adieu to their fellow prisoners whose minds were so raised by the heroism which these patriots displayed that it was some time before they became sensible of their loss  the dungeon which they inhabited was shown with profound veneration to every prisoner who afterward arrived at this preparatory scene of murder a superstitious respect was paid to the miserable mattress of vergniaud and those who felt neither the force of their patriotism nor shared in their love for their country were taught to pronounce with religious awe the names of these martyrs of liberty  had these lamented patriots known all the foulness of the crimes which the conspirators were meditating against them it would have been easy to have withdrawn themselves from their vengeance as many of their proscribed colleagues did some indeed fell under the murderers hands but some have happily escaped  lanjuinais isnard louvet and some others appear again on the scene barbaroux and buzot i am told are alive and pethion who but a few months before was hailed as the support of his country may again deserve the appellation  but the rest are gone for ever and there is no one who has any taste for literature or feeling for liberty but will sigh at the remembrance of rabaut guadet and condorcet  letter vii paris my dear sir since my last letter was written i have left switzerland and returned to paris and have had the unspeakable joy of embracing my family again i have not yet mentioned to you for till the jacobins were destroyed it was too soon to relate that i forsook home to return no more while robespierre existed and robespierre was then in possession of such established dominion the spirit of liberty had so bowed itself beneath the axe of the guillotine from the pastoral hills of normandy to the orangegroves of nice from the ensanguined banks of the loire to the mourning waters of vaucluse that when my mother while she gave me her last embrace at parting told me she should see me no more my desponding heart assented to the sad prediction upon the fall of the deputies who were proscribed the   st of may and who were well known to have honored us with their friendship we became a subject of discussion at the committee of public safety and a mandat darret would certainly have been issued against us if we had not already been imprisoned in consequence of the law against the english by sharing the general misfortune of our countrymen in france we were sheltered from any particular mark of vengeance we afterward obtained our liberty by means of the municipality to whom we were unknown and when the murderers had satiated their vengeance in the blood of our friends my family had no longer any peculiar danger to fear but my situation was far different during the spring preceding the fatal   st of may when the deputies of the gironde and barrere passed most of their evenings at our house i had not concealed that i was employed in writing some letters which have since been published in england in which i had drawn the portrait of the tyrant in those dark shades of coloring that belonged to his hideous nature and barrere in whose power my life was placed was now the lacquey of robespierre and the great inquisitor of the english at paris he had now seared his conscience with crimes and bathed his hands in the blood of the innocent what still increased my danger was that barrere could not but recollect with the consciousness of his present vileness in our eyes the political sentiments which he had expressed in those hours of social confidence when had he been told that he should become the accomplice of unrecorded horrors he would have answered with the feelings of hazael is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing he could not but recollect that on the third of june the day after the insurrection he came to our house with looks disordered and haggard with eyes filled with tears and a mind that seemed bursting with indignant sorrow repeatedly declaring that since the national representation was violated liberty was lost deploring the fate of the gironde above all of vergniaud and execrating the jacobins and the commune of paris a thousand times he wished that he could transport himself to the foot of his native mountains the pyrenees bid adieu for ever to the polluted city of paris and wander for the rest of his life amidst that sublime scenery which he described with melancholy enthusiasm  it was not a little dangerous to have heard such sentiments from the lips of one who afterward said boastingly in the convention ll ny a que les morts qui ne reviennent pas  of one who became the leader of assassinations and who mounting the tribune with the light step of gaiety dressed up with point and epigram those atrocious edicts of the committee to which his bleeding country answered with her groans barrere also knew that there was no danger of my declaring these things at the revolutionary tribunal since those who were tried were not permitted to speak and he had no longer any ties of acquaintance with us which might have restrained him from such conduct since very soon after the   st of may upon our refusing to receive some deputies of the mountain whom he asked leave to introduce to us he abandoned us altogether  in the mean time the english newspapers came regularly to the committee of public safety in which passages from my letters were frequently transcribed and the work mentioned as mine and those papers were constantly translated into french for the members of the committee two copies of the work had also reached paris and although one was at my request destroyed the other might by means of those domiciliary visits which were so often repeated have been thrown into the hands of revolutionary commissaries  thus i passed the winter at paris with the knife of the guillotine suspended over me by a frail thread when a singular opportunity of escape presented itself and i fled to switzerland with a heart almost broken by the crimes i had witnessed and the calamities i had shared i forsook those who were most dear to me on earth with no other consolation than that i left them exposed only to the common danger of every individual in the country and relieved from the cruel apprehensions they had felt on my account  i proceeded on my journey haunted by the images of gens darmes who i fancied were pursuing me and with a sort of superstitious persuasion that it was impossible i should escape i felt as if some magical spell would chain my feet at the frontier of france which seemed to me a boundary that was impassable as i approached the frontier the agitation of my spirits increased and when i reached bourglibre the last french post where commissaries were appointed to examine the passports and those who presented them my heart sunk within me and i tried to resign myself to a fate which seemed to my disordered mind inevitable but i found that i had disquieted myself in vain revolutionary government had relaxed its iron nerve at this distance from the seat of tyranny and the commissaries on the frontiers after having performed their office with the mildest urbanity suffered us to proceed to basil which is only half a league farther  some tall stakes driven into the earth at certain distances mark the limits of france and switzerland we drove rapidly past them and were then beyond the reach of revolutionary government and the axe of the guillotine  at basil now almost the only social speck on europes wide surface where men meet for any other purposes than those of mutual destruction i was in safety but i was an exile from my family  from the only friends i had left  my friends in england to whom i had written immediately on my arrival in the fullness of my heart and with the fond persuasion that they had trembled for my safety and would rejoice in my deliverance having with few exceptions indeed returned no answers to my letters with what overwhelming sensations did i receive the tidings of the fall of robespierre which was to change the color of my life and give peace and consolation to so many millions of my fellow creatures after waiting till the struggle maintained by the jacobins against the national representation had happily ended i returned to paris on entering again that polluted city a thousand fatal recollections rushed upon my mind a thousand local sensations overwhelmed my spirit in driving along the rue honor the appalling procession of the guillotine arose before my troubled imagination  i saw in the vehicles of death the specter of my murdered friends the magnificent square of the revolution with all its gay buildings appeared to me clotted with blood and incumbered with the dead along the silent and deserted streets of the fauxbourg germain i saw inscribed in broad letters upon the gate of every hotel propriete nationale while the orphans whose fathers and mothers have perished on the scaffold and who live upon the alms of charity pass in silence by the dwellings which are their rightful inheritance  the red flag waving above the portals of their forfeited mansions reminded me of an image of horror in de foes history of the plague at london where he says every house that was infected was marked with a bloody sign of the cross  yet at least we are no longer condemned to despair of finding justice on earth every day is signalized by such acts of retribution that it seems as if heaven visibly descended to punish the guilty while at the same time mercy and humanity are binding up the wounds of the afflicted and setting the captive free we seem to live in regions of romance louvet isnard and others of our proscribed friends so long entombed in subterraneous dungeons wandering over desert mountains or concealed in the gloom of caverns unvisited by day now restored to society and to their country recount to us the secrets of their prisonhouse their hairbreadth escapes to which we listen with eager anxiety and tremble at their past dangers  but i must not thus anticipate let me lead you to the convent in the fauxbourg st antoine to which we were transferred in order to make room at the luxembourg for prisoners whom it was thought expedient to guard more strictly we were taught by the administrators of the police to consider our removal as a mark of particular indulgence toward us since we should have the privilege of seeing our friends through the grate and of walking occasionally in the garden of the convent our countrymen were condemned to remain in the luxembourg at which they repined and remonstrated in vain wives were separated from their husbands daughters from their fathers and as far the greater part of the english were in confined circumstances and lived by their respective occupations their resources being stopped by their imprisonment the little store of assignats which they had saved from sequestration they were now forced to divide and instead of sharing their frugal meal together their expenses were doubled many were reduced to the most cruel difficulties who had been accustomed to maintain their families respectably by their industry and felt that the humiliation of receiving alms was no slight aggravation of the miseries of captivity i cannot resist mentioning that mons and madame du f with whose misfortunes and whose virtues you are acquainted no sooner heard that our property was confiscated in france and that in consequence of an act of parliament our resources were stopped from england than they wrote to tell us that their fortune was at our disposal those generous friends together with a few others endeavored to atone for the injustice of their countrymen by the steadfast fidelity of their attachment such moments of trial and of danger are indeed fitted to be the test of friendship and call forth the real character in those respects the experience of a year of revolutionary government is equivalent to that of fifty years of ordinary life  that part of the convent which the municipality had allotted for our prison consisting only of bare walls we were each of us permitted to return to our respective houses in order to provide ourselves with beds and what furniture and clothes we thought proper we were attended thither by an inspector of the police and guards together with one of the commissaries of our own section who had put the seals on our apartments and who on removing them examined our papers consisting now only of a few poetical scraps which had escaped the flames odes elegies and sonnets were instantly bundled up and sent to the municipality notwithstanding my assurances that the muses to whom they were addressed far from being accomplices in any conspiracy against liberty had in all ages been its warmest auxiliaries with what melancholy sensations did we revisit that home from which we were again to be torn in a few hours how often did my eyes wander over every object in our apartment the chairs and tables which we found in the same position as we had left them on our first imprisonment seemed like mute friends whom it was anguish to leave and whose wellknown attitudes recalled the comforts of the past with aching hearts we were once more led through the streets of paris to our new prison this convent called les anglaises was still inhabited by twentythree english nuns and as it was their own property had not shared the general fate of the monastic edifices while the french monks and nuns had for more than a year before this period been driven from their retreats the religious houses both of men and women which belonged to the english had been respected and their inhabitants left undisturbed the english or rather irish monks had however long since thrown off their habits and conformed as well as they were able to the new system of opinions but this was not the case with those religious sisters whose enthusiastic attachment to the external signs of their profession was greater and their worldly wisdom less the inhabitants of the fauxbourg st antoine where they resided accustomed from infancy to revere them to have the wants of the poor supplied at the gate of the convent and while under the former government they were treated with neglect or disdain by others to be there received with evangelical humility felt that their esteem and veneration for the nuns had survived their own superstitious belief the conquerors of the bastile the terror of aristocracy and the vanguard of revolutions laying aside their bloody pikes and bayonets humbled themselves before these holy sisters whom a sort of visible sanctity seemed to encompass and whom they suffered notwithstanding the general regulation to wear the cherished symbols of their order the veil and the cross and seven times a day to ring the bell for prayers when we had passed the sentinels who guarded the convent the gate was unlocked for our admission by a nun in her habit she embraced us with affectionate warmth and addressing us in english begged we would be comforted since she and the other nuns who were to have the charge of us were our countrywomen and our sisters this soothing sympathy expressed in our native language formed such a contrast to the rude accents of inspectors of police that it seemed as if some pitying angel had leaned from heaven to comfort us the kindness with which we were received by our amiable countrywomen contributed to reconcile us to our chamber which might more properly be called a passage to other rooms where the glowing tapestry of the luxembourg was exchanged for plaistered walls and where we had to suffer physical as well as moral evils the weather being intensely cold and our wretched gallery having neither stove nor chimney one circumstance tended to make our situation tolerable which was that true spirit of fraternity that prevailed in our community consisting of about forty female prisoners besides the nuns into how happy a region would the world be transformed if that mutual forbearance and amity were to be found in it which had power to cheer even the gloom of a prison  in addition to the tie of common calamity was the tie of a common country and in our present situation this bond of union appeared so strong that it seemed as dr johnson said of family relations that we were born each others friends it was the general study of the whole community to prevent each others wishes there were no rich amongst us the rich had made themselves wings and vanished away before the promulgation of the law against the english but those who had still any resources left shared all their little luxuries and indulgencies with those that had none the young succored the old the active served the infirm and the gay cheered the dejected there were indeed among us a few persons who born of french parents having passed their whole lives in france and not speaking one word of our native language seemed astonished to find by their imprisonment that they were english women they had no trace or recollection of that country which in evil hour chanced to give them birth and did not easily reconcile themselves to the grated convent while their french sisters were enjoying perfect liberty  when such of the former nobility who were our fellow prisoners at the luxembourg heard that we were going to be transferred to the fauxbourg st antoine they gathered round us to express their fears for our safety in that frightful quarter of the city i was persuaded on the contrary that we had much more to fear while shut up in this state prison with themselves than in the fauxbourg st antoine the inhabitants of which were chiefly composed of workmen and mechanics who in the course of the revolution had acted too much in union to be led to perpetrate any partial mischief since those immense numbers which had power to overthrow government could not be bribed to commit massacres  the administrators of the police when they ordered preparations to be made for our reception announced us to the section as being all the wives and daughters of milords anglois this was no auspicious introduction accordingly our first care was to lay aside the honors and dignities conferred upon us by the officers of the police and which certainly would not have been confirmed by the heralds office the only distinction we now envied was that of belonging to the privileged class who gained their bread by the labor of their hands and who alone were exempted from the penalties of the law we would thankfully have consented to purchase at the price of toil the sweets of liberty when bereaved of which the sickening soul grows weary of existence in vain we tried to twine the flowers of social pleasure around the bars of our prison in vain we took the viol and the harp or endeavored to rejoice at the sound of the organ that good which alone gives value to every other was wanting and music was discordant and conversation joyless  having repelled the calumnious report of our nobility the revolutionary committee of our section under whose inspection we were placed and who visited us in succession every day began to look upon us with a more propitious eye and lest our health should be impaired by confinement they unlocked the garden gate of the key of which since our arrival they had taken possession to prevent any attempts to scale the walls and permitted us to walk two hours every day accompanied by themselves during these walks we found means to convince them that we had been guilty of no other offense against the state than that of being born in england and the common principles of justice taught these unlettered patriots to lament the severity of our fate which they endeavored to soften by every mark of honest kindness  the visits of the administration of police were far less agreeable than those of our good commissaries the first time they came brutus one of their secretaries fired with uncontrollable rage at the sight of the nun who unlocked the gate for his admission rudely seized her veil which he was with difficulty prevented from tearing off her face this ferocious pagan threw down the cross which was erected in the garden and trampled it under foot and having poured forth a volley of imprecations against the great bell which still hung at the steeple instead of being transformed into a cannon he left the dismayed nuns trembling with horror and hastened to denounce the veils the crosses and the great bell at the municipality the next morning pache the mayor of paris sent orders for the bell to be taken down the crosses to be removed and the nuns to throw off their habits immediately nothing could exceed their despair upon receiving this municipal mandate the convent resounded with lamentations and the veils which were now to be cast off were bathed with tears  there was however little time to be allowed to the indulgence of unavailing sorrow brutus might return and it was necessary to proceed to action accordingly a council of caps was called in the room of the superior and after a deliberation sometimes interrupted by sighs and sometimes by pleasantry we all went to work and in a few hours sweeping trains were converted into gowns and flowing veils into bonnets one charming young nun who was a pensive enthusiast begged that if it were possible her bonnet might shroud her face altogether while another whose regards were not entirely turned away from this world hinted that she should have no objection to the decoration of a bow  my chief consolation during my confinement arose from the society of sister theresa that amiable nun who so much wished to hide a face which nature had formed to excite love and admiration it was impossible to converse with her without feeling that the revolution was a blessing if it was only for having prohibited vows which robbed society of those who were formed to be its delight and ornament i never met with a human creature who seemed to approach nearer to the ideas we form of angelic purity who possessed a more corrected spirit or a more tender heart devotion was her first delight her unfailing source of happiness and sometimes instead of regretting her fate i envied her feelings and was tempted to exclaim with pope how happy is the blameless vestals lot the world forgetting by the world forgot eternal sunshine of the spotless mind each prayer accepted and each wish resigned labor and rest that equal periods keep obedient slumbers that can wake and weep desires composed affections ever even tears that delight and sighs that waft to heaven   we were allowed the melancholy indulgence of seeing our friends through an iron grate and there were still among the french some persons whose courageous friendship undismayed by all the frowns of power and the increasing terrors of revolutionary measures did not abandon us in our prison the greater part of the english who were yet in france having been established in that country for years had acquired some friends who lamented their misfortunes and who risqued their own personal safety by making unwearied efforts for their deliverance the dress of our visitors was indeed not a little grotesque the period being now arrived when the visible signs of patriotism were dirty linen pantaloons uncombed hair red caps or black wigs and all as rosalind says denoting a careless disorder the obsolete term of muscadin which means a scented fop was revived and every man who had the boldness to appear in a clean shirt was branded with that appellation and every woman who wore a hat was a muscadine for the period was still remembered when a round cap was the badge of roture nor were the aristocratical pretensions of the hat yet buried in oblivion it is remarkable enough that at this period robespierre always appeared not only dressed with neatness but with some degree of elegance and while he called himself the leader of the sansculottes never adopted the costume of his band his hideous countenance far from being involved in a black wig was decorated with hair carefully arranged and nicely powdered while he endeavored to hide those emotions of his inhuman soul which his eyes might sometimes have betrayed beneath a large pair of green spectacles though he had no defect in his sight  at this period one of the most accomplished women that france has produced perished on the scaffold this lady was madame roland the wife of the late minister on the   st of may he had fled from his persecutors and his wife who remained was carried to prison the wits observed on this occasion that the body of roland was missing but that he had left his soul behind madame roland was indeed possessed of the most distinguished talents and a mind highly cultivated by the study of literature i had been acquainted with her since i first came to france and had always observed in her conversation the most ardent attachment to liberty and the most enlarged sentiments of philanthropy sentiments which she developed with an eloquence peculiar to herself with a flow and power of expression which gave new graces and new energy to the french language with these extraordinary endowments of mind she united all the warmth of a feeling heart and all the charms of the most elegant manners she was tall and well shaped her air was dignified and although more than thirtyfive years of age she was still handsome her countenance had an expression of uncommon sweetness and her full dark eyes beamed with the brightest rays of intelligence i visited her in the prison of st pelagie where her soul superior to circumstances retained its accustomed serenity and she conversed with the same animated cheerfulness in her little cell as she used to do in the hotel of the minister she had provided herself with a few books and i found her reading plutarch she told me she expected to die and the look of placid resignation with which she spoke of it convinced me that she was prepared to meet death with a firmness worthy of her exalted character when i enquired after her daughter an only child of thirteen years of age she burst into tears and at the overwhelming recollection of her husband and her child the courage of the victim of liberty was lost in the feelings of the wife and the mother  immediately after the murder of the gironde she was sent to the conciergerie like them to undergo the mockery of a trial and like them to perish when brought before the revolutionary tribunal she preserved the most heroical firmness though she was treated with such barbarity and insulted by questions so injurious to her honor that sometimes the tears of indignation started from her eyes this celebrated woman who at the bar of the national convention had by the commanding graces of her eloquence forced even from her enemies the tribute of applause and admiration was now in the hands of vulgar wretches by whom her fine talents far from being appreciated were not even understood i shall transcribe a copy of her defense taken from her own manuscript see appendix no iii  with keen regret i must add that some papers in her justification which she sent me from her prison perhaps with a view that at some happier period when the voice of innocence might be heard i should make them public i was compelled to destroy the night on which i was myself arrested since had they been found in my possession they would inevitably have involved me in her fate before i took this resolution which cost me a cruel effort i employed every means in my power to preserve those precious memorials in vain for i could find no person who would venture to keep them amidst the terrors of domiciliary visits and the certainty if they were found of being put to death as an accomplice of the writer but her fair fame stands in no need of such testimonials her memory is embalmed in the minds of the wise and good as one of those glorious martyrs who have sealed with their blood the liberties of their country after hearing her sentence she said vous me jugez digne de partager le sort des grands hommes que vous avez assassines je tacherai de porter a lechafaud le courage quils y ont montre you think me worthy then of sharing the fate of those great men whom you have assassinated i will endeavor to go to the scaffold with the courage which they displayed   on the day of her trial she dressed herself in white her long dark hair flowed loosely to her waist and her figure would have softened any hearts less ferocious than those of her judges on her way to the scaffold she was not only composed but sometimes assumed an air of gaiety in order to encourage a person who was condemned to die at the same time but who was not armed with the same fortitude  when more than one person is led at the same time to execution since they can sufferonly in succession those who are reserved to the last are condemned to feel multiplied deaths at the sound of the falling instrument and the sight of the bloody scaffold to be the first victim was therefore considered as a privilege and had been allowed to madame roland as a woman but when she observed the dismay of her companion she said to him allez le premier que je vous epargne au moins la douleur de voir color mon sang go first let me at least spare you the pain of seeing my blood shed  she then turned to the executioner and begged that this sad indulgence might be granted to her fellow sufferer the executioner told her that he had received orders that she should perish first but you cannot i am sure said she with a smile refuse the last request of a lady the executioner complied with her demand when she mounted the scaffold and was tied to the fatal plank she lifted up her eyes to the statue of liberty near which the guillotine was placed and exclaimed ah liberte comme on ta jouee ah liberty how have thou been sported with  the next moment she perished but her name will be recorded in the annals of history as one of those illustrious women whose superior seize seem fitted to exalt her sex in the scale of being  she had predicted that her husband would not survive her loss and her prediction was fulfilled roland who had concealed himself till this period no sooner heard the fate of his wife whose influence over his mind had often been a subject of reproach amongst his enemies than feeling that life was no longer worth possessing he put an end to his existence his body was found in a wood near the highroad between paris and rouen the papers which were in his pocketbook were sent to the committee of general safety and have never seen the light his unhappy daughter found an asylum with an old friend of her proscribed parents who had the courage to receive her at a period when it was imminently dangerous to afford her protection but the time probably now draws near when this child will be adopted by her country and an honorable provision will be made for her as a testimony of national gratitude toward those who gave her birth  amidst the extraordinary changes which were passing in france the convention now changed time itself and decreed the new calendar a report was made on it so philosophical and so pleasing to the imagination that amidst the sanguinary measures of those days it seemed to the oppressed heart what a solitary spot of fresh verdure appears to the eye amidst the cragginess of louring rocks or the gloom of savage deserts love of change is natural to sorrow and for my own part i felt myself so little obliged to the months of my former acquaintance which as they passed over my head had generally brought successive evils in their train or served as the anniversaries of some melancholy epoch that i was not much displeased to part with them for months with appellations that bring to the mind images of nature which in every aspect has some power of giving pleasure from nivose the month of snows to floreal the month of flowers i therefore soon learnt to count the days of my captivity by the new calendar which was highly necessary since if a reclamation for liberty had been dated on monday instead of primidi or on tuesday to the neglect of duodi the police would not only have passed to the order of the day but declared the writer suspect after two months imprisonment we obtained our liberty in consequence of the unwearied efforts which were made for that purpose by a young frenchman whom my sister has since married he was at rouen in normandy when the decree against the english arrived and a few hours after saw a long procession of coaches pass through the streets filled with english prisoners who just torn from their families and their homes were weeping bitterly deeply affected by this spectacle he flew to paris with the resolution of obtaining our liberty or of sharing our prison he haunted the municipality every night attended the levees of administrators of police every morning risqued his own personal safety a thousand times and at length like a true knight vanquished all obstacles and snatched his mistress from captivity i could not help lamenting that he was compelled to make application for our release to chaumette the procureur of the commune who had been the principal evidence against the deputies of the gironde nothing could be more cruel than this kind of humiliation  prostrate our friends dire murderer to implore and kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore   with what delicious emotions did we return to our own habitation after passing two months in prison at such a period we felt the blessedness of home in its full extent to range through our own apartments without being pursued by guards or jailors to return to domestic comforts and domestic peace excited sensations the most delightful society had indeed vanished and home was but a milder prison where we lived in voluntary seclusion trembling at every knock at the gate lest it should bring the mandate of a new arrestation and afraid to venture out lest we should be found guilty of an english physiognomy by some of the numerous spies of the police who were continually prowling through the streets of paris these indeed were the only persons we had to fear for even at the very moment when the permanent order of the day at the jacobins was the crimes of the english far from receiving the smallest insult from the people of paris they displayed the utmost sympathy for our situation and our release from prison seemed to diffuse general satisfaction through our whole neighborhood  the prisons became more and more crowded and increasing numbers were every day dragged to the scaffold suspect was the warrant of imprisonment and conspiracy was the watchword of murder one person was sent to prison because aristocracy was written in his countenance another because it was said to be hidden at his heart many were deprived of liberty because they were rich others because they were learned and most who were arrested enquired the reason in vain  letter viii paris a few weeks after our release from prison rabaut de st etienne was put to death he was one of the most enlightened and virtuous men whom the revolution had called forth and had acquired general esteem by his conduct as a legislator and considerable reputation by his talents as a writer he was the president of the famous committee of twelve which was appointed by the convention previously to the   st of may to examine into the conspiracies which threatened its existence and which as i have already related hastened its partial dissolution rabaut as often as he presented himself to make the report was compelled by the interruptions of the conspirators and their agents to retire from the tribune until that moment arrived when he together with the members of the commission and the deputies of the gironde were expelled or torn from the convention i saw him on this memorable day for he took shelter for a few hours at our house filled with despair not so much for the loss of his own life which he then considered as inevitable as for that of the liberty of his country now falling under the vilest despotism he escaped arrest on the  d of june from not having been present at the convention when the conspirators consummated their crime by means of the military force of paris and concealed himself in the house of a friend with his brother one of the seventythree deputies who had signed the protest  they enclosed part of a room for their place of shelter and built up the wall with their own hands placing a bookcase before the entrance so that there was not the least appearance of concealment they employed a carpenter in whom they had great confidence to make the door and the wretch betrayed them rabaut de st etienne was immediately brought before the revolutionary tribunal to have his person identified for he was now outlawed which in france is the sentence of death he was led to execution and his wife a most amiable woman unable to support the loss of a husband whom she tenderly loved put an end to her existence his brother was taken to the conciergerie where he languished with three other victims for many months in a subterraneous dungeon and there being only one bed allotted for four persons he lay upon the damp floor and contracted such violent disorders that his life was long despaired of he has now taken his seat in the convention the generous friend and his wife who had given the brothers an asylum were also dragged to prison and some time after were condemned for this noble act of friendship to perish on the scaffold  if france during the unrelenting tyranny of robespierre exhibited unexampled crimes it was also the scene of extraordinary virtue of the most affecting instances of magnanimity and kindness of this nature was the conduct of a young man who being a prisoner with his brother happened to be present when the names of the victims were called over who were summoned to appear the next day before the sanguinary tribunal the young man found the name of his brother who at that moment was absent upon the fatal list he paused only an instant to reflect that the life of the father of a large family was of more value than his own he answered the call surrendered himself to the officer and was executed in his brothers stead a father made the same sacrifice for his son for the tribunal was so negligent of forms that it was not difficult to deceive its vigilance  the increasing horrors which every day produced had at length the effect of extinguishing in every heart the love of life that sentiment which clings so fast to our nature to die and get beyond the reach of oppression appeared a privilege and perhaps nothing appalled the souls of the tyrants so much as that serenity with which their victims went to execution the page of history has held up to the admiration of succeeding ages those philosophers who have met death with fortitude but had they been led among the victims of robespierre to execution they would have found themselves in this respect undistinguished from the crowd they would have seen persons of each sex of all ages and all conditions looking upon death with a contempt equal to their own socrates expiring surrounded by his friends or seneca and lucan sinking gently into death have perhaps less claim to admiration than those blooming beauties who in all the first freshness of youth in the very spring of life submitted to the stroke of the executioner with placid smiles on their countenances and looked like angels in their flight to heaven  among the victims of the tyrants the women have been peculiarly distinguished for their admirable firmness in death perhaps this arose from the superior sensibility which belongs to the female mind and which made it feel that it was less terrible to die than to survive the objects of its tenderness when the general who commanded at longwy on its surrender to the prussians was condemned to die his wife a beautiful young woman of fourandtwenty years of age who heard the sentence pronounced cried out in a tone of despair vive le roi the inhuman tribunal instead of attributing her conduct to distraction condemned her to die her husband when he was placed in the cart was filled with astonishment and anguish when he saw his beloved wife led toward it the people shocked at the spectacle followed her to the scaffold crying elle na pas merit la mort mes amiss said she cest ma fault jai voulu perir avec mon mari she did not deserve death  my friends it is my own fault i was resolved to perish with my husband   the fury of these implacable monsters seemed directed with peculiar virulence against that sex whose weakness man was destined by nature to support the scaffold was every day bathed with the blood of women some who had been condemned to die but had been respited on account of their pregnancy were dragged to death immediately after their delivery in that state of weakness which savages would have respected one unfortunate woman the wife of a peasant had been brought to paris with nineteen other women of the same class and condemned to die with her companions she heard her sentence without emotion but when they came to carry her to execution and take away the infant who was hanging at her breast and receiving that nourishment of which death was so soon to dry up the source she rent the air with her cries with the strong shriek of instinctive affection the piercing throes of maternal tenderness  but in vain the infant was torn from the bosom that cherished it and the agonies of the unfortunate mother found respite in death  fourteen young girls of verdun who had danced at a ball given by the prussians were led to the scaffold together and looked like nymphs adorned for a festival sometimes whole generations were swept away at one moment and the tribunal exhibited many a familypiece which has almost broken the heart of humanity malesherbes the counsel of louis xvi was condemned to die at eighty years of age with his daughter and soninlaw his granddaughter and grandson  his daughter seemed to have lost sight of every earthly object but her venerable parent she embraced him a thousand times on the way to execution bathed his face with her tears and when the minister of death dragged her from him forgetting that the next moment put an end to her own she exclaimed wretch are you going to murder my father  these proscribed families seemed to find the sweetest source of consolation in dying together and to consider the momentary passage which they were going to make as so much the less painful since they should undergo no separation but enter at the same instant into another state of existence a young lady the former marchioness of boisberenger was imprisoned in the luxembourg with her whole family when her father mother and younger sister received their act of accusation and she found herself alone exempted she shed a flood of tears her heart was overwhelmed with anguish you will die without me she cried i am condemned to survive you we shall not perish together while she abandoned herself to despair her act of accusation arrived a ray of transport was instantly diffused over her countenance she flew into the arms of her parents and embraced them my dear mother she exclaimed we shall die together when the family was transferred to the conciergerie she never left her mother a moment but watched over her with unwearied tenderness and while she tried to sooth her sufferings by her filial endearments she endeavored to inspire her with courage by the example of her own heroic fortitude it was the picture of a sort of roman charity the unfortunate mother was mute and her whole soul seemed petrified with horror she seemed another niobe her admirable daughter died with the most noble resolution  mademoiselle malesi her younger sister when condemned to die said to her father with naivete je me serrerai tant contre vous mon bon pere vous qui etes si honnete homme que dieu me laissera passer malgre mes peches i will cling so fast to you my dear father you who are so good that god will suffer me to pass in spite of my transgressions   in the prison of the force the men were allowed to breathe the air in a courtyard separated by a wall from the habitation of the women a commonsewer was the only means of communication at that spot an unhappy son presented himself every morning and every night to enquire after his mother who was condemned to die but reprieved because she was pregnant and after her delivery executed that pious child in his early age already the victim of misfortune knelt down before the infectious sewer and with his mouth placed upon the hole poured forth the feelings of his filial tenderness his younger brother a lovely child of three years of age and who was suffered to remain with his mother till her last moments was often placed at the opposite end of the sewer and answered for his mother when she was too ill to undertake that task herself a person of my acquaintance heard him say mama a moins pleure cette nuit  un peu reposee et te souhaite le bon jour cest lolo qui taime bien qui te dit cela mamma has not cried so much tonight  she has slept a little and wishes you a good morning it is lolo who speaks to you who loves you very much  at length this unfortunate mother when going to execution transmitted to her son by the sewer her long and graceful tresses as the only inheritance she had to give she then bade her infant a last farewell and was led to the scaffold where her husband had perished some months before  one of the persons most distinguished by their noble contempt of death was girey dupre with whom i was well acquainted he was the writer of a paper called the patriote francois in conjunction with brissot he had acquired a high degree of literary reputation and maintained his mother a widow by the labors of his pen he was twentyfour years of age and his countenance was one of the most agreeable i ever saw to these personal advantages he united the most frank and pleasing manners and distinguished powers of conversation he had defended the deputies of the gironde with too much energy not to be involved in their fate and he was also connected by the ties of friendship with brissot dupre was forced to sly from his persecutors and seek refuge at bordeaux where he was seized and brought back in irons to paris far fr m being depressed by his approaching fate the natural gaiety of his disposition never forsook him a single moment when interrogated at the tribunal with respect to his connection with brissot he answered only in these words i knew brissot i attest that he lived like aristides and died like sydney the martyr of liberty  jai connu brissot jatteste quil a vecu comme aristide et quil est mort comme sydney martyr de la liberte he presented himself at the tribunal with his hair cut off the collar of his shirt thrown open and already prepared for the stroke of the executioner on his way to the scaffold he saw robespierres mistress at the window of his lodging with her sister and some of their ferocious accomplices a bas les tyrans et les dictateurs down with tyrants and dictators  cried dupre repeating this prophetic exclamation till he lost sight of the house while going to execution he sung in a triumphant tone a very popular patriotic song which he had himself composed and of which the chorus was plutot la mort que lesclavage rather death than slavery  that cherished sentiment he fondly repeated even to his last moment and death left the halffinished sentence on his lips  claviere who had been contemporary minister with roland and who was imprisoned in the conciergerie upon receiving his act of accusation saw that the list of witnesses against him was composed of his most implacable enemies these are assassins said he to a fellow prisoner i will snatch myself from their rage he then repeated these lines of voltaire les criminels tremblans sont trains au supplice les mortels genereux disposent de lour fort and after deliberating with his companion upon the most effectual manner of striking himself so that the dagger might reach his heart he retired to his cell where he was found a few minutes after breathing his last sigh madame claviere upon receiving the tidings of his death swallowed poison after having embraced her children and regulated her affairs notwithstanding his suicide the property of claviere was confiscated as if he had been regularly condemned a law had lately been passed to construe an act of suicide into a counterrevolutionary project when the father of a family who knew that his life was devoted had voluntarily put an end to his existence in the hope of preserving his children from want robespierre and his financial agents found nothing more pressing than to baffle those conspiracies against the revenues of their government for confiscation was so evidently the leading motive for the great mass of their judicial assassinations that the guillotine amongst other numerous titles was most generally called the minister of finance the tribunal  began to use the language of the orator see mr sheridans eloquent speech on mr hastingss trial  to look into their cash account for delinquency and found the offenders guilty of so many hundred thousand pounds worth of treason they now accused by the multiplication table tried by the rule of three and condemned not by the sublime institutes of justinian but by the unerring rules of cockers arithmetic  on some occasions the genuine feelings of nature burst forth amidst the stupefied terror that had frozen every heart a law had lately passed obliging every merchant to inscribe on his door the stock of merchandise in his warehouse under the penalty of death a winemerchant whose affairs had called him hastily into the country entrusted the business of the inscription to his son who from ignorance or regligence for it was clearly proved that there existed no intention of fraud had omitted to affix the declaration in the precise words of the law the conscientious jury of the revolutionary tribunal condemned him to death presuming on the counterrevolutionary intention in this case from the act though they were in general accustomed for want of other evidence to find the act by guessing at the intention the innocent prisoner had prepared himself for death when the minister of justice informed of the case wrote to the convention demanding a respite his letter had not been half read before the hall resounded with the cry of reprieve reprieve and fearing that the act of pardon would arrive too late the convention dispensing with the usual formalities not only sent its officers and part of the military force but great numbers of the deputies rushed out to stop the execution the officer who received the order first with which he flew toward the place of the revolution told me that on his coming out of the convention he saw the scaffold reared and the crowd assembled he had scarcely reached the first tree of the vista when he saw the fatal knife descend he redoubled his speed but before he got to the end of the walk another head had fallen a third person had mounted the scaffold but the voice of the messenger was too weak from the efforts he had made to reach the spot to be noticed by the multitude the fourth had ascended when he gained the place rushed through the crowd called to the executioner and leaped on the scaffold the prisoner had been stripped his shoulders were bare and he was already tied to the plank when the cry of reprieve burst forth the officer enquired his name which the young man told him alas you are not the person he replied the prisoner submitted calmly to his fate  the bearer of the reprieve who is a person of a very benevolent disposition declared that he never felt so acute a pang as when he was compelled to turn away from this unfortunate victim he hastened however to the prison where he found the person who was reprieved awaiting the return of the cart and the executioner his hair cut and his hands tied to be led to death at another part of the city where his house stood a wife and nine children were deploring the miserable loss of a husband and a father when the officer who had brought the tidings of life to the prisoner went at his request to carry them to his distracted family i need not describe what he related to me of the scene  your heart will readily fill up the picture  that class of men who were peculiarly the object of the tyrants rage were men of letters with respect to whom the jealousy of the rival mingled with the fury of the oppressor and against whom his hatred was less implacable for having opposed his tyranny than for having eclipsed his eloquence it is a curious consideration that the unexampled crimes of this sanguinary usurper and the consequent miseries which have desolated the finest country of europe may perhaps if traced to their source be found to arise from the resentment of a disappointed wit robespierre for the misfortune of humanity was persecuted by the most restless desire of distinguishing himself as an orator and nature had denied him the power he and his brother were born at arras and left orphans at an early age the bishop of arras had bestowed on them the advantages of a liberal education robespierre distinguished himself by his application to his first studies and obtained many literary prizes at the age of sixteen elated by the applause he had received he fancied himself endowed with such rare power of genius as would enable him to act a splendid part on the theater of the world and his friends indulged the same fond expectation he applied to the study of the law and already in imagination contemplated himself disputing with the first orators of the age the palm of eloquence experience however convinced his friends and at length himself that they had indulged a vain illusion he discovered no taste or aptitude for the profession for which he was designed became weary of study was checked by the slightest difficulties and being found destitute of those talents which were necessary to his success as a public speaker his benefactor after a trial of sufficient length refused to support him any longer at a considerable and fruitless expense at paris but ordered him to return to arras where in an humble sphere better suited to the mediocrity of his abilities he might pursue his profession as a lawyer robespierre was compelled to return to arras which after the splendid dreams he had indulged of fame and honors in the capital was an humiliation he felt keenly but which he brooded over in silence for he never on any occasion displayed his sensibility to mortifications which was in proportion to his excessive vanity but concentred within his vindictive soul his disgrace his resentment and his projects of vengeance from the period of his return to arras may be dated his abhorrence of men of talents from that moment instead of admiring genius he repined at its existence the same feelings clung to his base and envious spirit when he had usurped his dictatorial power he made it pain of death to be the author of what he called seditious publications by which means it was easy for him to involve men of letters in a general proscription he suppressed every dramatic piece in which there were any allusions he disliked or wherein the picture or history held up to view any feature of his own character and it was his plan to abolish theatrical entertainments altogether for he considered the applause bestowed on fine poetry as something of which his harangues were defrauded he held up men of letters to the people as persons hostile to the cause of liberty and incapable of raising themselves to the height of the revolution and to make them still greater objects of mistrust and suspicion he had long instructed his agents to declaim unceasingly against them as statesmen the meaning of which word in the dictionary of these conspirators was counterrevolutionist their system had even arrived at some maturity when brissot in his speech for an appeal to the people on the trial of the late king thus pourtrays them  il semble a entendre ces hommes quon ne puisse etre a la hauteur de la revolution quen montant sur des piles de cadavres il semble que le secret de lhomme detat soit maintenant le secret des bourreaux veuton fair entendre le langage de la saine politic on eft soudoye par des puissances etrangeres veuton parler celui de la raison cest de la philosophy toutepure secrieton et on accoutume la multitude a mepriser sa bienfaitrice a diviniser lignorance according to these men no one can possibly be at the height of the revolution without mounting on heaps of dead it seems as if the knowledge of the statesman was commensurate only with the skill of the executioner if we speak a language dictated by sound policy we are in the pay of foreign powers do we speak that of reason this is nothing they exclaim but the dreams of philosophy and thus the multitude are instructed to despise their benefactress and deify ignorance   lignorance de la multitude est le secret du pouvoir des agitateurs comme des despotes cest la le secret de la duree de lait de calomnier voila pourquoi ils selevent contre la philosophy qui veut affermir la liberte sur la raison universelle voila pourquoi ils plaisantent sur le systeme deducation sur lutilite des ecoles primaires il sagit bien de tout cela cest de massacres quil faut entretenir le peuple voila pourquoi ils supposent ils accusent sans cesse laristocratie du talent ah pourquoi le talent nestil quun etre metaphysique avec quel doux plaisir ces vandales le nivelleroient si leur faux pourroient latteindre the ignorance of the multitude is the masterspring of the power of anarchists as well as of despots it is by this they keep alive the breath of calumny furnished with this engine they make war on philosophy which teaches us that universal reason is the only basis of liberty and thus deride every plan of education and deny the utility of public schools these are reveries say they the people must be regenerated with blood this is the reason why they are inveighing so continually against the aristocracy of genius alas why has knowledge only a metaphysical existence with what complacency would not these vandals bring it to their own level if their destroying seythe could reach it   one of the objects of robespierres resentment was m bitauby a prussian well known in the literary world by his elegant translation of homer into french he was a member of the academy at berlin from which the king of prussia ordered his name to be struck out and the pension with which the great frederic had rewarded his merit to be discontinued on account of his avowed attachment to the principles of the revolution m bitauby had fixed his residence at paris several years previous to that event i have been acquainted with him and his lady since my first arrival in france and have never met with persons who blended with the wisdom and seriousness of age so much of all that is amiable in youth m bitauby in the first days of the revolution had been personally acquainted with robespierre who frequently dined at his house but he was not long in discovering the sanguinary and fanatical ideas of liberty which filled the soul of the tyrant and which so much disgusted him that he gave up his acquaintance  robespierre did not forget the affront which he had now the power to avenge m bitauby and his wife were dragged to prison in the beginning of the winter where they languished ten months and deprived of those cares which their age and their infirmities required they had almost sunk beneath their weight madame bitaubys indispositions required medical assistance but so many formalities were necessary before a physician could be admitted into the prison that if the disorder was not of a lingering nature the patient expired while the police were arranging the ceremonials previous to his relief during the last months of robespierres usurpation the prisoners were refused the consolation of being attended by their own physicians professional men were appointed by the police and as selections were made among those who were able to give clearer proofs of their jacobin principles than of their medical skill these revolutionary doctors sometimes robbed the revolutionary jury of their prey a few however of these officers of health possessed the negative merit which dr franklin ascribed to old and experienced physicians  they let their patients die for the remedies they administered were of too harmless a nature to be capable of doing mischief the physician of the conciergerie had as strong a predilection for tisanne as dr sangrado for hot water tisanne was the vivifying draught which was destined to sooth all pains and heal all maladies one day the doctor after having felt a patients pulse said to the jailor he is better this morning yes answered the jailor  he is better but the person who lay in this bed yesterday is dead eh bien resumed the doctor coolly quon done toujours la tisanne  m and madame bitauby had an advocate in their distress whom it was difficult indeed to resist this was an old servant of eighty years of age his figure was so interesting that sternes pencil only could sketch it well and had stern seen him he would not have failed to draw his portrait he pleaded the cause of his master with such pathetic eloquence that at the revolutionary committee he sometimes drew iron tears down plutos cheek but the old man was eloquent in vain and was sinking with despair into the grave when the revolution of the  th of thermidor restored his master and mistress to liberty  the fate of boucheu author of a poem called the months excited particular sympathy he passed his time in prison in educating one of his children and this employment seemed to charm away his cares the day he received his act of accusation knowing well the fate that awaited him he sent his son home giving him his portrait which a painter who was his fellowprisoner had drawn and which he ordered the child to give his mother below the picture he had written the following lines ne vous etonnez pas objects charmans et doux si quelquair de tristesse obscurcit mon visage lorsquun savant crayon dessinoit cet image on dressoit lechafaud et je pensois a vous loved objects cease to wonder when ye trace the melancholy air that clouds my face ah while the painters skill this image drew they reared the scaffold and i thought of you   la voisier the celebrated chemist was put to death with the other farmers general he requested a fortnights respite to enable him to complete a philosophical experiment the vandals had no time to pause in their career of blood for the pursuits of philosophy and sent him away observing that the republic had no longer any need of chemists chamfort a member of the french academy and an enthusiastic advocate for the revolution with feelings too keen to bear the horrors by which so noble a cause had been stained hid them from his sight by a voluntary death la harp was thrown into prison and was destined to perish on the scaffold the author of the travels of the younger anacharsis notwithstanding his advanced age was the object of continual persecution florian who was himself imprisoned and condemned to see his dearest friends perish had not sufficient fortitude to sustain such trials his charming pen had displayed the most soothing images of happiness and virtue and when he beheld around him only misery and crimes his disordered imagination hastened his death vicq dazyr died of a broken heart bailly the first mayor of paris whose astronomical researches have placed him in the highest rank of science was murdered with circumstances of particular aggravation he was to have been executed in the champ de mars but from the caprice of the sanguinary mob he was compelled to wait two or three hours at the place of execution while the scaffold was removed to a field adjoining where he stood drenched in rain in the midst of winter and which was more difficult to bear than the pelting of the pitiless storm exposed to the insults and injuries of an execrable set of wretches who usually attended these horrid spectacles the red flag was burned before his eyes and he was compelled to set fire to the pile that consumed it while the ruffians plunged his head into the smoke for their farther amusement he submitted to all that was inflicted on him with the serenity of a philosopher and only requested with mildness that his sufferings might be terminated one of the barbarians by whom he was tormented said to him in a tone of savage mockery tu trembles bailly mon ami cest de froid you tremble bailly  it is with cold my friend  replied the sage at length after having made him drink the cup of bitterness to the very dregs they permitted him to die  letter ix one of the particular objects of robespierres rage was general miranda a native of peru well known in europe by that philanthropic spirit of adventure which led him to pass many years in traveling through various parts of the globe with the view of being useful to his own country which since the period of the sanguinary spanish conquests has groaned beneath the yoke of the most abject slavery if this philosophical enthusiast should not accomplish the purpose for which he undertook his crusade of patriotism it has at least enabled him to furnish his mind with such acquisitions of knowledge such stores of observation and such a distinguished taste for the fine arts as render his society in the highest degree instructive and delightful while with an understanding of the first order he unites that perfect simplicity of manners which usually belongs to great minds dumourier in his memoirs while he does justice to mirandas talents complains of his  haughtiness and hardness of character miranda has certainly more of the sedate dignity of a spaniard than the brisk air of a frenchman and if that elevation of soul which scorns to make any composition with principles be haughtiness and that inflexibility which steadfastly pursues the straight path of integrity and honor be hardness of character dumourier is in the right   when the prussians were on their march toward paris miranda accepted a command in the army of dumourier who was then retreating before them after the defeat of the prussians and on the entrance of the republican army into the low countries miranda added to the high reputation he had already acquired through europe by the gallant manner in which he executed that part of the conquest of those countries which was allotted him when dumourier came to paris the command of the whole army devolved on miranda and when the campaign began and dumourier was invading holland the attack of maestricht and the army on the meuse were committed to his care the successful march of the austrians on aixlachapelle obliged him to raise the siege and he was joined soon after by dumourier who had left his conquest in holland to repair the misfortunes of the army commanded by valence the ill humor which dumourier had brought with him from paris where the jacobins had already begun their system of misrule and anarchy was not lessened by ill success and goaded by the pang of indignation and of disappointed ambition he formed the criminal design of betraying the republic this spirit of rebellion found the most inflexible opposition from miranda whose personal friendship for dumourier did not lead him to forget that his first duty was toward that country which had entrusted him with its defense the event of the battle of nerwinden fought against the repeated advice of miranda and in which this general lost a considerable part of the troops he commanded having been forced to sustain the whole shock of the enemy afforded dumourier the means of getting rid of an opponent so hostile to his designs and miranda was sent by the commissaries la croix and danton without being previously heard by them to give an account of his conduct at the bar of the convention he underwent the most strict xamination before the committees of war and general safety who declared that not the slightest doubt remained of his military conduct or his fidelity to the republic but this report was stifled by the intrigues of la croix danton and others of their party and he was sent in defiance of all decency to the revolutionary tribunal  his trial took place in the beginning of may before justice had for ever fled from that sanguinary court the hour of carnage was not yet arrived the tribunal though from its institution terrible and cruel in its forms which placed the life of the accused upon a casting voice had not yet become a shrine consecrated to infernal deities and reeking with the daily sacrifice of human victims the voice of innocence was not yet stifled by the savage vociferations of monsters thirsting for its blood and miranda pleaded his cause with such sublime energy as proved that his powers as an orator were not inferior to his talents as a general he covered himself with glory and his enemies with confusion and overstepping the usual forms the jury made their verdict the vehicle of eulogium upon his conduct  after his trial he retired to a small distance from paris where he lived in literary leisure amidst his books and paintings and where i visited him frequently his repose was however of short duration he was too distinguished a character to escape the tyranny which the conspiracy of the   st of may had established and after having been persecuted by domiciliary visits on various pretenses he was again thrown into prison charged with being the chief defender and abettor of the gironde and girondism the real cause of robespierres animosity toward him is not well known but may be resolved into that general hatred which he bore toward all men of talents and as he knew that the eminent abilities of miranda were improved by advantages which had fallen to the lot of few he might naturally think that the existence of such a man was dangerous to his own  twice in the zenith of his tyranny he accused miranda to his subjects the jacobins and when we heard that the name of miranda had issued from those pestilential lips we considered his murder as inevitable one obstacle was found sufficient to shield him from the tyrants vengeance and this was a feeling of shame which lurked in the mind of the public accuser who covered as he was with blood did not dare to meet the look of miranda and bring forward a second accusation after having once joined the general voice of applause upon his acquittal this sentiment led fouquier tainville to put off the second trial required by robespierre till the tyrant would hear of delay and excuses no more and himself inscribed mirandas name on the fatal list for the twelfth of thermidor the revolution of the tenth restored him to liberty  miranda submitted to an imprisonment of eighteen months under the continual expectation of death with that philosophical strength of mind which he possesses in a most eminent degree he had indeed determined not to be dragged to the guillotine and had therefore provided himself with poison thus armed he sent for a considerable number of books from his library and placed them in his little chamber of which he found means to keep the sole possession here he told me that he endeavored to forget his present situation in the study of history and science he tried to consider himself as a passenger on a long voyage who had to fill up the vacuity of time with the researches of knowledge and was alike prepared to perish or to reach the shore during his long confinement the only person with whom he associated was the former marquis achille du chatelet who possessed all the accomplishments of literature and whom the tyrants had dragged to prison while the wounds were yet unhealed which he had received in defending his country he and miranda used to meet every evening take their tea together and talk over the books they had read during the day avoiding as much as possible the subject of politics which affected them too deeply nor could du chatelet bear to pronounce the names of the decemvirs tidings however of the horrible scenes which were passing in paris reached him in the gloom of his prison and the emotions of his mind together with the irritation of his wound produced a fever miranda attended him night and day alternately with another prisoner and he was recovering from this disorder when he heard that some of his dearest friends had perished on the scaffold the next morning when miranda went to his room to relieve a fellowprisoner who had watched him during the night he observed that his whole face was violently inflamed he enquired eagerly what was the matter du chatelet pressed his hand and bade him farewell this unfortunate young man unable to support the shock occasioned by the murder of his friends and grown weary of existence resolved not to wait till the assassins called him to the scaffold but had recourse to poison with which he had provided himself a physician had furnished vergniaud du chatelet and several other martyrs to their country with this lethean remedy which they called the pill of liberty la pillule de la liberte a note was found in du chatelets chamber in which he declared that he had sold his books and all that belonged to him in the prison to miranda this was the only mode in which he could leave his effects to his friend or prevent their being seized by the nation  miranda found a memorial among his papers which he has put into my hands where he traces the history of his political life it contains an honorable list of the sacrifices he had made the labors he had achieved and the perils he had encountered in the public cause from the period when in      he contributed in the baillage of perronne to the union of the nobles with the third estate till the middle of the year      when although his wounds were not closed he desired leave to return to the army and obtained the command of the district of air but he soon found that his infirmities did not permit him to fulfill the duties of his station  he was obliged to return and though his fortune was now lost he refused to accept his pay as a general officer since he was no longer able to serve his country at the very moment when he was preparing to return home he was arrested by the revolutionary committee at air as a measure of  general safety and conducted with guards to the committee of general safety of the convention who with the same tender regard for public security instead of declaring that this gallant young officer had merited well of his country sent him to the prison of the force and refused to let his servant enter for a few minutes in the day to dress his wound his prison six months after became his grave and he was placed beyond the reach of tyranny miranda was then left to absolute solitude but he had still the courage to live and at length the hour of deliverance arrived  you will perhaps think dear sir that the sketch which i have given you of public and private calamity is sufficiently gloomy but alas the scene blackens as we advance and wears a deeper horror we have now arrived at that period when the tyrant grown bolder by success intoxicated with power and throwing aside all regard even to forms reached the climax of his crimes and accelerated the moment of his fall you will view him and the agents of his iniquity no longer satisfied with victims in detail they now murder in mass and in the words of racine lavent dans le fang leurs bras ensanglantes   i shall in the course of a fortnight send you a history of the last scenes of this foul tragedy and give you such a detail as can only be learnt on the spot of the events which produced the revolution of the  th of thermidor and of the incidents which on that memorable night determined the fate of the french republic  in the mean time you will not exclaim as the roman poet did with respect to religion of so many evils could liberty have been the cause it is alas the condition of our uninstructed nature that nations like individuals should acquire wisdom only in the school of experience and though the page of history which according to lord bolingbroke is philosophy teaching by example be open before us we are too presumptuous or too careless to heed or apply the lesson i need not make use of any reasoning to convince you that liberty is innocent of the outrages committed under its borrowed sanction for though we might from some momentary impulse blaspheme its name as lucretius did that of religion we must be persuaded that neither religion nor liberty is chargeable with the crimes committed by tyranny or superstition as no weeds are more pernicious than those which arise in that soil from which good fruit alone should have sprung so no crimes have exceeded those which the tyrant and the fanatic have committed in the name of freedom the guardian angel of the happiness of mankind and in that of the being whose tender mercies are over all his works  i must not conclude without informing you that the dark picture which you have been contemplating is relieved by a bright and soothing perspective the past seems like one of those frightful dreams which presents to the disturbed spirit phantoms of undescribable horror and deeds without a name awakened from which we hail with rapture the cheering beams of the morning and anticipate the meridian luster of the day the  th of thermidor has established the republic and nothing now remains but to arrange its forms its internal situation will no more offer a hideous contrast to its external victories the guilty commune of paris exists no longer the den of the jacobins is closed and the whole nation roused into a sense of its danger by the terrible lesson it has been taught can be oppressed no more there scarcely exists a family or an individual in france that has not been bereaved by tyranny of some dear relation some chosen friend who seems from the grave to call upon them with a warning voice to watch over the liberties of their country the love of public virtue in the people of france is now blended with all the sympathies and affections of their natures it is heard in the sighs of general mourning it speaks in the tears of the widow and the orphan and is not only imprinted by every argument that can render it sacred and durable on the understanding but clings to every feeling of the heart  appendix no i the representatives of the french people undersigned considering that amidst events which excite the indignation of the whole republic they cannot remain silent with respect to the attempts committed against the national representation without feeling themselves chargeable with the most shameful pusillanimity or with becoming still more guilty sharers in the crime  considering that the same conspirators who from the very period in which the republic was proclaimed had never discontinued their attacks on the national representation have at length filled up the measure of their crimes in violating the majesty of the people in the persons of their representatives by driving some to seek their safety in slight by imprisoning others and forcing the rest to bend their necks under the yoke of the most insulting tyranny  considering that the heads of this faction emboldened by long impunity growing strong through excess of impudence and relying on the number of their accomplices have seized on all the branches of the executive government on the treasury on the means of defense and the resources of the nation which they dispose of at their pleasure and which they are employing to effect its ruin  considering that they have at their command the chiefs of the military force and the constituted authorities of paris that the majority of the inhabitants of this city intimidated by the excesses of a faction which the law is unable to reach affrighted by proscriptions with which they are continually threatened find themselves not only incapable of destroying the machinations of the conspirators but often through respect to the law which enjoins obedience to the constituted authorities compelled even to become as it were accomplices in their crimes  considering that so great is the oppression under which the national convention labors that not one of its decrees can be executed unless it be approved or dictated by the heads of this faction that the conspirators have in fact set themselves up as the only organ of the public will and that they have reduced the rest of the national representation to be the passive instruments of their pleasure  considering that the national convention after having been forced to invest with unlimited powers those commissaries who have been sent into the departments and to the armies and who have been chosen exclusively by this faction has been unable to check the arbitrary acts which they have committed or even to protest against the incendiary and disorganizing principles which the majority amongst them have propagated  considering that not only has the national convention been rendered incapable of prosecuting the despoilers of the public wealth or the wretches who have given orders for murder and pillage but even these same conspirators after having failed in their designs on the night of the  0th and the   th of march have accomplished them with more success on the  0th   st   th and   st of may and on the  d of june last past  considering that at this last epoch they beat to arms rung the tocsin and fired the alarm guns that the barriers of the city were shut all communication cut off the secrecy of letters violated the hall of the convention blockaded by an armed force of more than  0000 men that a formidable artillery was stationed at every avenue of the national palace that furnaces were fixed to serve the guns with red hot balls and that every preparation was made for an attack that the battalions enrolled for the vendee but detained for this purpose in the neighborhood of paris were amongst the number of the besiegers that ruffians in the pay of the conspirators and fitted for the execution of their bloody projects occupied the most important posts and the passages of the hall that they were openly rewarded for their zeal by distributions of provisions and money that at the moment when the national convention presented itself in full assembly at the avenue of the national palace to enjoin the military to withdraw the commander invested by the conspirators with the most absolute dictatorship had audacity to insist that the proscribed deputies should be delivered up to the vengeance of the people and that on the refusal of the convention he had the impudence to call to arms and put in danger the lives of the representatives of the french people  considering finally that it is by machinations such as these that they have forced from the convention or rather from a sixth part of the members who compose it a decree which pronounced the arbitrary seizure and deprived of their functions without accusation without evidence in contempt of all forms and through the most criminal violation of the rights of man and the national sovereignty thirtytwo representatives marked out and proscribed by the conspirators themselves  they declare to their constituents to the citizens of every department and to the french people whose rights and sovereignty have been thus shamefully violated that from the moment in which the unity of the national representation has been broken by an act of violence of which the history of nations has never yet furnished an example they have neither been able nor have they thought it their duty to take any part in the deliberations of the assembly  that driven by these unhappy circumstances to the impossibility of opposing by their individual exertions the slightest obstacle to the success of the conspirators they can only proclaim to the whole republic the hateful scenes of which they have been both the witnesses and the victims  paris the  th of june  d year of the french republic signed by seventythree deputies  no ii republicans you are acquainted with the dangers which threaten the public weal they are so great that we must either take arms and die in the field of honor or submit to the stroke of the assassin in our homes we must save the republic or perish with it we must crouch to anarchy or destroy it we must resume our rank among the nations or yield the precedence to the slave of the asiatic despot or the uncivilized tartarian horde  when the national representation by losing its unity becomes virtually dissolved when the departments whose deputies are shamefully arrested consider themselves in reality as no longer represented when the majesty of the people is violated by the attempts committed against its mandatories when the faction which is longing for the return of royalty insolently domineers over that corrupted city by which we are menaced there is no longer any room for hesitation  shame and slavery or let us fly to paris you waste the precious moments which are yet left to apply the remedy in deliberating on the disease your country your liberties your honor as frenchmen yourselves your wives and children are lost neither public nor private fortunes any longer exist you lose four year of toil of care of labor of watchings of battles and torrents of blood shed in defense of the most glorious of causes these will be inevitably lost and it is but a vile handful of factious traitors who are deciding on the liberty of twentyfive millions of men  in this critical and desperate situation one general voice is heard from the center to the confines of the republic it proclaims that the nation is roused to conquer or die the nation is roused let us march marseilles calls on you marseilles which has unquestionably so much right to your confidence and so deep a concern in the support of this revolution of which she has given so noble an example this appeal is the last use which she wishes to make of the liberty of speech in order to promulgate the great resolutions she has adopted and the decisive measures she has taken far from a warlike people far from a nation of soldiers who wait only the signal for battle be the vain tinsel of words to dare and to act is all we have to do  let us strike and let frenchmen so long characterised as frivolous show the world that if they deserved the imputation while under the control of kings they have now resumed their ancient habitudes and are become independent and formidable like the gauls and the franks from whom they glory in being descended  republicans who pant for liberty and detest licentiousness who abhor royalty and desire the establishment of the republic united and undivided league yourselves with the marseillois who breathe the same vows already made by a considerable number of departments they declare that the present political state of paris is equivalent to a declaration of civil war against the whole republic  they accuse and present to you as guilty of all the disorders that afflict france philip dorleans and his faction the frantic monster marat whose venal howlings are his purchase and whose name would sully this declaration the den of the jacobins of paris the seditious and factious men who are spreading themselves throughout the republic and exciting it to commotion marseilles points them out as common enemies who have been wishing to lead us to the brink of the precipice to adulterate their monstrous but measured system of anarchy with a king of their own creating and this king would have been the most dishonored being in existence a man overwhelmed with debt rich in disgrace debauchery and baseness a man whom no virtuous citizen would admit among his servants and who would be driven by themselves from their society a man in short who is imprisoned within our walls and of whose speedy and severe punishment we are equally desirous  we invite you to sign with us this just and indispensable covenant which we propose for the public safety and to wipe off the stain of so many injuries  marseilles therefore declares that it is in a legal state of resistance to oppression and that it is authorized by the law to make war against the seditious    that it can no longer acknowledge a convention whose unity is violated to be the national representation and that at that period only when the deputies of the people shall be fully and freely reinstated in their functions the nation will obey its orders with confidence and submission    that the throne of anarchy has been raised on the wrecks of the throne you have overturned and that tyranny is detestable in proportion to the corruption of those who are prompted to exercise it    that the conspirators have already proceeded to dissolve the national convention by reducing and disorganizing it and exciting it to acts of folly rashness and disorder and that the french nation can consider those acts which are promulgated by a portion of its representatives who yet keep their seats only as evidences of the tyranny exercised over some by the perfidy and wickedness of others    that the imprisonment of a great number of deputies of the convention is an attempt made in the delirium of guilt an act which posterity will scarcely believe if its authenticity were not proved by the record of the just vengeance we have sworn to take and which you will aid us in inflicting    that the good citizens who still inhabit paris are invited to assist as much as lies in their power the united efforts which we are going to make for the public welfare and to let the whole weight of the responsibility rest on the heads of the conspirators which we declare are forfeited by their crimes    that the domineering faction at paris has compelled the departments to lead into that city so long the prey and sport of ambitious men the military force which is the last resource of the sovereign people declaring at the same time that the united force under the direction of the departments and in conformity to their wishes is destined to extirpate those whose criminal hands have been employed in effecting the ruin of their country    that every man capable of bearing arms is summoned in the name of the law in that of his own and the public interest and in the name of humanity to join his efforts in strengthening the dyke which we are opposing to this desolating torrent that he may avoid being swept away into that abyss which the anarchists and infamous plunderers have opened before us    that by decreeing a levy of a stated number of men ready to join in mass to destroy utterly every faction in its stronghold the marseillois who are solicitous to finish a revolution which they began and make the example which they have just given an object of imitation call upon every citizen to join them who is anxious to deserve well of mankind  they have taken this preliminary step only in consideration of the urgency of the measures to be adopted submitting them to the examination and the approbation of the whole sovereign body without pretending to set bounds to the zeal of the generous defenders of their country who shall voluntarily come forward to strengthen the phalanx of liberty they hope that it will increase in its march and that every citizen anxious for the public weal will bear a part   0 that in the colors of this army the soldiers of the country shall read inscribed the accomplishment of every good law the republic united and undivided respect for persons and property words of consolation already graven on every heart     that we appeal to god and to our arms against the attempts that have been made on the unity of the national representation against the violence which has been exercised on the personal liberty of our special deputies against the conspiracies destructive of liberty from which the superintendance of providence has delivered us of which marseilles is pursuing the accomplices who undertook to execute the most horrible deeds within its walls a popular tribunal the guardian of established and well regulated order is carrying on the prosecution of the conspirators notwithstanding the obstacles with which it is surrounded invested with the confidence of the people and by them supported the most imperious law that of circumstances determines the activity of its operations and the people of marseilles far from deserving to be considered as disobedient to the law in making use of the sword to punish the guilty fulfill the first of social duties which consists in the distribution of the most exemplary justice  it is thus that the city of marseilles in addition to the motives arising from the general danger of the republic joins the detail of the particular grievances which affect its tranquillity and explains the necessity it is under of silencing its calumniators who in despair at not having succeeded in kindling the torch of discord among us have dared to present it to the convention as the light of truth  republicans the signal is given the moments are precious and the measures are decisive let us march let the law enter with us into paris and if you are unacquainted with the way follow the traces of the blood of your brethren which will lead you to the feet of its walls from whence have issued forth those murderous scourges those sanguinary conspiracies and that consuming traffic of finance the source of all our misery  there you will give liberty to good citizens dignity to the national convention the ruffians will disappear and the republic will be saved  taken into consideration in the general committee of the    sections of marseilles the   th of june      the second year of the french republic signed peloux president castellanet and pinatal secretaries yesterday the   th all the administrative bodies took the oath expressed in the manifesto    no iii the accusation against me is founded wholly on the supposition of my being an accomplice with men called conspirators my friendship for a few of those persons is prior to the political circumstances which form the charge against them the correspondence i held with them by an intermediate channel at the time of their departure from paris is altogether foreign to state affairs i have had in truth no political correspondence and in this respect i might absolutely deny the charge yet although i cannot be called upon to give an account of my private affections i may glory in them as i do in the whole of my conduct and i have nothing to conceal from the world  i declare then that i have received testimonies of regret on account of my imprisonment and was informed that duperret had two letters for me but whether written before or after my friends had left paris whether from one or two of them i am altogether ignorant since these letters have never reached me at another time i was earnestly conjured to escape from my prison and received offers of assistance in the attempt and to convey me to whatever place i should think proper i was deterred from accepting these offers from considerations both of duty and honor of duty because i would not injure those to whose care i was committed of honor since in all cases i should prefer exposing myself to the consequences of every possible vexation rather than incur the appearances of guilt by a flight unworthy of my character i should not have been so careless with regard to my safety on the   st of may had i had an intention of effecting my escape at a later period this is the extent of my connections with my friends who fled undoubtedly if the communication had not been interrupted between us or if i had not been restrained by my imprisonment i should have endeavored to procure information concerning them for i knew of no law that forbids it alas in what age or amongst what people were those sentiments of esteem and fidelity which bind men to each other ever accounted a crime i do not pretend to decide upon the measures taken by those who were proscribed but i never will believe that those men have intended ill whose integrity patriotism and generous devotion to their country i have seen so clearly displayed if they have erred their errors are those of virtue they are overcome without being degraded they are unfortunate in my eyes without being guilty if i am criminal in offering vows for their safety i declare myself so to the whole world i am under no concern for their glory and i willingly share in the honor of being oppressed by their enemies i have known these generous men who are accused of having conspired against their country they were firm but humane republicans they were persuaded that good laws were necessary to make the republic beloved by those who had no confidence in its stability but this was indeed a more difficult task than to murder them the history of all ages has proyed that great talents are necessary to lead men to virtue by good laws while violence alone has been sufficient to restrain them by terror or annihilate them by death i have heard my friends maintain that plenty like happiness could only result from an equitable government that the omnipotence of bayonets might produce fear but not bread i have seen them animated by the warmest enthusiasm for the happiness of the people disdaining to flatter them determined to fall rather the victims of their blindness than deceive them i own that these principles and this conduct have appeared to me altogether different from those of tyrants and ambitious men who amuse the people only to enslave them it is for these reasons that i am filled with esteem for these generous men this error if it be one will go with me to the grave and i shall glory in following those whom i could not accompany thither  my defense i may venture to assert is more necessary to those who are desirous of being informed than it is to myself conscious of having fulfilled my duties i look to the future with security and confidence my taste for study and my habits of retirement have kept me at a distance both from the follies of dissipation and from the bustle of intrigue enamoured of liberty the value of which i learnt from reflection i viewed the revolution with transport persuaded that it was the epoch of the subversion of despotism which i detest of the reformation of abuses under which i had often sighed while the fate of the unhappy and oppressed hung upon my heart i have followed the progress of the revolution with solicitude i have expressed myself on the subject with warmth but i have never overpassed the limits prescribed me by my sex some talents perhaps a little philosophy a greater degree of courage and which in times of danger did not weaken that of my husband are probably what those who knew me have imprudently ascribed to me and which may have contributed to make me enemies amongst those by whom i was not known roland sometimes employed me as his secretary and the celebrated letter to the king for instance was copied wholly by me this would be a good paper enough to frame part of my indictment if the austrians were my prosecutors and thought proper to extend the responsibility of the minister to his wife but roland had long since displayed his sentiments and his love of great principles the evidence of this exists in the numerous books which he has published during these fifteen years past his knowledge and his integrity are eminently his own and he had no need of a wife to become a wise and faithful minister neither conferences nor cabals have ever been held at his house his friends his colleagues whoever they were and his acquaintances met at his table once a week where in very public conversation they discoursed openly on those topics in which every one was interested on the whole the writings of this minister breathe throughout the love of order and peace explaining in the most affecting manner the best principles of morality and policy they will for ever bear witness to his wisdom as the accounts he has given in bear witness to his integrity  i return to the crime imputed to me i observe that i had no intimate acquaintance with duperret i had sometimes seen him while my husband was minister but he had not visited me during the six months that have elapsed since roland quitted the administration and i might make the same remark respecting the other deputies who were our friends which certainly does not tally with the accusation of conspiracy and secret understanding imputed to us it is clear from my first letter to duperret that i wrote to this deputy only because i found it difficult to write to any other with the idea that he would be inclined to render me service my correspondence with him therefore was not a thing projected it was not the sequel of any preceding connections and it had no political view it furnished me with an opportunity of receiving intelligence of those who were absent and with whom i was in habits of friendship altogether independent of political considerations such considerations formed no part of the correspondence which i held with them in the first moments of their absence no memorial to this effect is brought in evidence against me those which are produced only intimate that i share in the opinions of those who are called conspirators this induction is founded i own it to the world and i glory in this conformity of sentiment but i have never published these sentiments in any manner that can be imputed to me as a crime in order to establish the being an accomplice in any project it must be proved that advice has been given and means furnished i have done neither i am therefore not guilty in the eyes of the law there is none which can condemn me there exists no fact for the application of any  i know that in revolutions law as well as justice is often forgotten and the evidence of this is that i am at this bar i am indebted for this prosecution only to those prejudices and that violent hatred which burst forth amidst great convulsions and which in general fix upon those who are placed in conspicuous situations or who are known to possess energy of character it would have been easy for me to have avoided this trial which i foresaw but i thought it more becoming to meet it i thought that i owed this example to my country i thought that if i should be condemned i should leave to my tyrants the odium of sacrificing a woman who had no other crime than perhaps some talents of which she seldom availed herself great zeal for the interests of mankind courage to adhere to her unfortunate friends and to render homage to truth at the hazard of her life those who have true greatness of soul throw away selfish feelings remember that they belong only to the species and look to futurity for their reward i belong to the virtuous and persecuted roland i was in habits of friendship with men whom ignorance and the jealous hatred of low vulgar minds have proscribed and murdered i am to perish also because it is consistent with the principles of tyranny to sacrifice those whom it has cruelly oppressed and annihilate even every witness of its crimes under both these titles you ought to condemn me to die and i await my sentence when innocence mounts the scaffold to which it is condemned by error or wickedness it reaches the goal of triumph may i be the last victim that shall be sacrificed i shall leave with joy this unhappy land which is destroying the good and drinking in the blood of the just o truth my country friendship sacred objects sentiments dear to my heart receive my last offering my life was devoted to you and ye alone spread a softness and grace over my last moments god of heaven enlighten this unhappy people for whose liberty i breathe my warmest vows  liberty  to those great souls it eminently belongs who despise death and who can meet it with courage but it was not formed for weak minds who compound with crime while they conceal their selflove and their cowardice under the name of prudence it was not formed for those profligate men who rising from their beds of debauchery or creeping forth from a sink of wretchedness run and bathe themselves in the blood that streams from the scaffolds but it is the guardian of a wise and humane people who practice justice despise flatterers know their true friends and revere truth as long as you shall not form such a people o my fellowcitizens you will talk in vain of liberty you will live only in a state of licentiousness of which each of you will fall the victim in your turn you will ask for bread but you will find only mangled carcasses and you will end in being slaves  i have concealed neither my sentiments or opinions i know that a roman lady was sent to execution under tiberius for having lamented her son i know that in times of blindness and partyspirit whoever dares to avow himself the
