sermons by laurence stern am prebendary of york and vicar of sutton on the forest and of stillington near york  vol i  laurence stern am prebendary of york etc etc   the sermons of mr yorick  vol i  london printed for r and j dodsley in pall mall  preface the sermon which gave rise to the publication of these having been offered to the world as a sermon of yoricks i hope the most serious reader will find nothing to offend him in my continuing these two volumes under the same title lest it should be otherwise i have added a second title page with the real name of the author  the first will serve the booksellers purpose as yoricks name is possibly of the two the more known  and the second will ease the minds of those who see a jest and the danger which lurks under it where no jest was meant  i suppose it is needless to inform the public that the reason of printing these sermons arises altogether from the favorable reception which the sermon given as a sample of them in tristram shandy met with from the world  that sermon was printed by itself some years ago but could find neither purchasers or readers so that i apprehended little hazard from a promise i made upon its republication that if the sermon was liked these should be also at the worlds service which to be as good as my word they here are and i pray to god they may do the service i wish it i have little to say in their behalf except this that not one of them was composed with any thoughts of being printed  they have been hastily wrote and carry the marks of it along with them  this may be no recommendation  i mean it however as such for as the sermons turn chiefly upon philanthropy and those kindred virtues to it upon which hang all the law and the prophets i trust they will be no less felt or worse received for the evidence they bear of proceeding more from the heart than the head i have nothing to add but that the reader upon old and beaten subjects must not look for many new thoughts  it is well if he has new language in three or four passages where he has neither the one or the other i have quoted the author i made free with  there are some other passages where i suspect i may have taken the same liberty  but it is only suspicion for i do not remember it is so otherwise i should have restored them to their proper owners so that i put it in here more as a general saving than from a consciousness of having much to answer for upon that score in this however and every thing else which i offer or shall offer to the world i rest with a heart much at ease upon the protection of the humane and candid from whom i have received many favors for which i beg leave to return them thanks  thanks  subscribers a the duke of ancaster earl of ashburnham lord anson lady

subscribers will be excused the shortness of the time rendering it impossible to print a complete and correct list  sermon i inquiry after happiness sermon i psalm iv     there be many that say who will show us any good  lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us   the great pursuit of man is after happiness it is the first and strongest desire of his nature  in every stage of his life he searches for it as for hid treasure  courts it under a thousand different shapes  and though perpetually disappointed  still persists  runs after and enquires for it afresh  asks every passenger who comes in his way  who will show him any good  who will assist him in the attainment of it or direct him to the discovery of this great end of all his wishes  he is told by one to search for it amongst the more gay and youthful pleasures of life in scenes of mirth and sprightliness where happiness ever presides and is ever to be known by the joy and laughter which he will see at once painted in her looks  a second with a graver aspect points out to the costly dwellings which pride and extravagance have erected  tells the enquirer that the object he is in search of inhabits there  that happiness lives only in company with the great in the midst of much pomp and outward state that he will easily find her out by the coat of many colors she has on and the great luxury and expense of equipage and furniture with which she always sits surrounded  the miser blesses god  wonders how any one would mislead and wilfully put him upon so wrong a scent  convinces him that happiness and extravagance never inhabited under the same roof  that if he would not be disappointed in his search he must look into the plain and thrifty dwelling of the prudent man who knows and understands the worth of money and cautiously lays it up against an evil hour that it is not the prostitution of wealth upon the passions or the parting with it at all that constitutes happiness  but that it is the keeping it together and the having and holding it fast to their heirs for ever which are the chief attributes that form this great idol of human worship to which so much incense is offered up every day  the epicure though he easily rectifies so gross a mistake yet at the same time he plunges him if possible into a greater for hearing the object of his pursuit to be happiness and knowing of no other happiness than what is seated immediately in the senses  he sends the enquirer there  tells him it is in vain to search elsewhere for it than where nature herself has placed it  in the indulgence and gratification of the appetites which are given us for that end and in a word  if he will not take his opinion in the matter  he may trust the word of a much wiser man who has assured us  that there is nothing better in this world than that a man should eat and drink and rejoice in his works and make his soul enjoy good in his labor  for that is his portion  to rescue him from this brutal experiment  ambition takes him by the hand and carries him into the world  shows him all the kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them  points out the many ways of advancing his fortune and raising himself to honor  lays before his eyes all the charms and bewitching temptations of power and asks if there can be any happiness in this world like that of being caressed courted flattered and followed  to close all the philosopher meets him bustling in the full career of this pursuit  stops him  tells him if he is in search of happiness he is far gone out of his way  that this deity has long been banished from noise and tumults where there was no rest found for her and was fled into solitude far from all commerce of the world and in a word if he would find her he must leave this busy and intriguing scene and go back to that peaceful scene of retirement and books from which he at first set out  in this circle too often does man run tries all experiments and generally sits down weary and dissatisfied with them all at last  in utter despair of ever accomplishing what he wants  nor knowing what to trust to after so many disappointments or where to lay the fault whether in the incapacity of his own nature or the insufficiency of the enjoyments themselves  in this uncertain and perplexed state  without knowledge which way to turn or where to betake ourselves for refuge  so often abused and deceived by the many who pretend thus to show us any good  lord says the psalmist lift up the light of thy countenance upon us send us some rays of thy grace and heavenly wisdom in this benighted search after happiness to direct us safely to it o god let us not wander for ever without a guide in this dark region in endless pursuit of our mistaken good but lighten our eyes that we sleep not in death  but open to them the comforts of thy holy word and religion  lift up the light of thy countenance upon us  and make us know the joy and satisfaction of living in the true faith and fear of thee which only can carry us to this haven of rest where we would be  that sure haven where true joys are to be found which will at length not only answer all our expectations  but satisfy the most unbounded of our wishes for ever and ever  the words thus opened naturally reduce the remaining part of the discourse under two heads  the first part of the verse  there be many that say who will show us any good  to make some reflections upon the insufficiency of most of our enjoyments toward the attainment of happiness upon some of the most received plans on which it is generally sought  the examination of which will lead us up to the source and true secret of all happiness suggested to us in the latter part of the verse  lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us  that there can be no real happiness without religion and virtue and the assistance of gods grace and holy spirit to direct our lives in the true pursuit of it  let us enquire into the disappointments of human happiness on some of the most received plans on which it is generally sought for and expected by the bulk of mankind  there is hardly any subject more exhausted or which at one time or other has afforded more matter for argument and declamation than this one of the insufficiency of our enjoyments scarce a reformed sensualist from solomon down to our own days who has not in some fits of repentance or disappointment uttered some sharp reflection upon the emptiness of human pleasure and of the vanity of vanities which discovers itself in all the pursuits of mortal man  but the mischief has been that though so many good things have been said they have generally had the fate to be considered either as the overflowings of disgust from sated appetites which could no longer relish the pleasures of life or as the declamatory opinions of recluse and splenetic men who had never tasted them at all and consequently were thought no judges of the matter so that it is no great wonder if the greatest part of such reflections however just in themselves and founded on truth and a knowledge of the world are found to leave little impression where the imagination was already heated with great expectations of future happiness and that the best lectures that have been read upon the vanity of the world so seldom stop a man in the pursuit of the object of his desire or give him half the conviction that the possession of it will and what the experience of his own life or a careful observation upon the life of others do at length generally confirm to us all  let us endeavor then to try the cause upon this issue and instead of recurring to the common arguments or taking any ones word in the case let us trust to matter of fact and if upon enquiry it appears that the actions of mankind are not to be accounted for upon any other principle but this of the insufficiency of our enjoyments twill go further toward the establishment of the truth of this part of the discourse than a thousand speculative arguments which might be offered upon the occasion  now if we take a survey of the life of man from the time he is come to reason to the latest decline of it in old age  we shall find him engaged and generally hurried on in such a succession of different pursuits and different opinions of things through the different stages of his life  as will admit of no explication but this that he finds no rest for the sole of his foot on any of the plans where he has been led to expect it  the moment he is got loose from tutors and governors and is left to judge for himself and pursue this scheme his own way  his first thoughts are generally full of the mighty happiness which he is going to enter upon from the free enjoyment of the pleasures in which he sees others of his age and fortune engaged  in consequence of this  take notice how his imagination is caught by every glittering appearance that flatters this expectation  observe what impressions are made upon his senses by diversions music dress and beauty  and how his spirits are upon the wing flying in pursuit of them that you would think he could never have enough  leave him to himself a few years till the edge of appetite is wore down  and you will scarce know him again you will find him entered into engagements and setting up for a man of business and conduct talking of no other happiness but what centers in projects of making the most of this world and providing for his children and childrens children after them examine his notions he will tell you that the gayer pleasures of youth are fit only for those who know not how to dispose of themselves and time to better advantage that however fair and promising they might appear to a man unpracticed in them  they were no better than a life of folly and impertinence and so far from answering your expectations of happiness twas well if you escaped without pain  that in every experiment he had tried he had found more bitter than sweet and for the little pleasure one could snatch  it too often left a terrible sting behind it besides did the balance lay on the other side he would tell you there could be no true satisfaction where a life runs on in so giddy a circle out of which a wise man should extricate himself as soon as he can that he may begin to look forwards  that it becomes a man of character and consequence to lay aside childish things to take care of his interests to establish the fortune of his family and place it out of want and dependence and in a word if there is such a thing as happiness upon earth it must consist in the accomplishment of this  and for his own part if god should prosper his endeavors so as to be worth such a sum or to be able to bring such a point to bear  he shall be one of the happiest of the sons of men  in full assurance of this on he drudges  plots  contrives  rises early  late takes rest and eats the bread of carefulness till at length by hard labor and perseverance he has reached if not outgone the object he had first in view  when he has got thus far  if he is a plain and sincere man he will make no scruple to acknowledge truly what alteration he has found in himself  if you ask him  he will tell you that his imagination painted something before his eyes the reality of which he has not yet attained to that with all the accumulation of his wealth he neither lives the merrier sleeps the sounder or has less care and anxiety upon his spirits than at his first setting out  perhaps you will say some dignity honor or title is only wanting  oh could i accomplish that as there would be nothing left then for me to wish good god how happy should i be  it is still the same  the dignity or title  though they crown his head with honor  add not one cubit to his happiness upon summing up the account all is found to be seated merely in the imagination  the faster he has pursued the faster the phantom fled before him and to use the satyrists comparison of the chariot wheels  haste as they will they must for ever keep the same distance  but what though i have been thus far disappointed in my expectations of happiness from the possession of riches  let me try whether i shall not meet with it in the spending and fashionable enjoyment of them  behold i will get me down and make me great works and build me houses and plant me vineyards and make me gardens and pools of water and i will get me servants and maidens and whatsoever my eyes desire i will not keep from them  in prosecution of this  he drops all gainful pursuits  withdraws himself from the busy part of the world  realizes  pulls down  builds up again  buys statues pictures  plants  and plucks up by the roots  levels mountains  and fills up valleys  turns rivers into dry ground and dry ground into rivers  says unto this man go and he goes and unto another do this and he does it  and whatsoever his soul lusts after of this kind he withholds not from it when every thing is thus planned by himself and executed according to his wish and direction surely he is arrived to the accomplishment of his wishes and has got to the summit of all human happiness  let the most fortunate adventurers in this way answer the question for him and say  how often it rises higher than a bare and simple amusement  and well if you can compound for that  since it is often purchased at so high a price and soured by a mixture of other incidental vexations as to become too often a work of repentance which in the end will extort the same sorrowful confession from him which it did from solomon in the like case  lo i looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labor that i had labored to do  and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit  and there was no profit to me under the sun  to inflame this account the more  twill be no miracle if upon casting up he has gone further lengths than he first intended run into expenses which have entangled his fortune and brought himself into such difficulties as to make way for the last experiment he can try  to turn miser with no happiness in view but what is to rise out of the little designs of a sordid mind set upon saving and scraping up  all he has injudiciously spent in this last stage  behold him a poor trembling wretch shut up from all mankind  sinking into utter contempt spending careful days and sleepless nights in pursuit of what a narrow and contracted heart can never enjoy  and here let us leave him to the conviction he will one day find  that there is no end of his labor  that his eyes will never be satisfied with riches or will say  for whom do i labor and bereave myself of rest  this is also a sore travel  i believe this is no uncommon picture of the disappointments of human life  and the manner our pleasures and enjoyments slip from under us in every stage of our life and though i would not be thought by it as if i was denying the reality of pleasures disputing the being of them any more than one would the reality of pain  yet i must observe on this head that there is a plain distinction to be made betwixt pleasure and happiness for though there can be no happiness without pleasure  yet the converse of the proposition will not hold true  we are so made that from the common gratifications of our appetites and the impressions of a thousand objects we snatch the one like a transient gleam without being suffered to taste the other and enjoy that perpetual sunshine and fair weather which constantly attend it this i contend is only to be found in religion  in the consciousness of virtue  and the sure and certain hopes of a better life which brightens all our prospects and leaves no room to dread disappointments  because the expectation of it is built upon a rock whose foundations are as deep as those of heaven and hell  and though in our pilgrimage through this world  some of us may be so fortunate as to meet with some clear fountains by the way that may cool for a few moments the heat of this great thirst of happiness  yet our savior who knew the world though he enjoyed but little of it tells us that whosoever drinks of this water will thirst again  and we all find by experience it is so and by reason that it always must be so  i conclude with a short observation upon solomons evidence in this case  never did the busy brain of a lean and hectic chemist search for the philosophers stone with more pains and ardour than this great man did after happiness  he was one of the wisest enquirers into nature  had tried all her powers and capacities and after a thousand vain speculations and vile experiments he affirmed at length it lay hid in no one thing he had tried  like the chymicks projections all had ended in smoke or what was worse in vanity and vexation of spirit  the conclusion of the whole matter was this  that he advises every man who would be happy to fear god and keep his commandments  sermon ii the house of feasting and the house of mourning described sermon ii ecclesiastes vii     it is better to go to the house of mourning than to the house of feasting    that i deny  but let us hear the wise mans reasoning upon it  for that is the end of all men and the living will lay it to his heart sorrow is better than laughter  for a crackdbraind order of carthusian monks i grant but not for men of the world for what purpose do you imagine has god made us for the social sweets of the well watered valleys where he has planted us or for the dry and dismal deserts of a sierra morena are the sad accidents of life and the uncheery hours which perpetually overtake us are they not enough but we must sally forth in quest of them  belie our own hearts and say as your text would have us that they are better than those of joy did the best of beings send us into the world for this end  to go weeping through it  to vex and shorten a life short and vexatious enough already do you think my good preacher that he who is infinitely happy can envy us our enjoyments or that a being so infinitely kind would grudge a mournful traveller the short rest and refreshments necessary to support his spirits through the stages of a weary pilgrimage or that he would call him to a severe reckoning because in his way he had hastily snatched at some little fugacious pleasures merely to sweeten this uneasy journey of life and reconcile him to the ruggedness of the road and the many hard justlings he is sure to meet with consider i beseech you what provision and accommodation the author of our being has prepared for us that we might not go on our way sorrowing  how many caravanseras of rest  what powers and faculties he has given us for taking it  what apt objects he has placed in our way to entertain us  some of which he has made so fair so exquisitely for this end that they have power over us for a time to charm away the sense of pain to cheer up the dejected heart under poverty and sickness and make it go and remember its miseries no more  i will not contend at present against this rhetoric i would choose rather for a moment to go on with the allegory and say we are travelers and in the most affecting sense of that idea that like travelers though upon business of the last and nearest concern to us may surely be allowed to amuse ourselves with the natural or artificial beauties of the country we are passing through without reproach of forgetting the main errand we are sent upon and if we can so order it as not to be led out of the way by the variety of prospects edifices and ruins which solicit us it would be a nonsensical piece of saint errantry to shut our eyes  but let us not lose sight of the argument in pursuit of the simile  let us remember various as our excursions are  that we have still set our faces toward jerusalem  that we have a place of rest and happiness toward which we hasten and that the way to get there is not so much to please our hearts as to improve them in virtue  that mirth and feasting are usually no friends to achievements of this kind  but that a season of affliction is in some sort a season of piety  not only because our sufferings are apt to put us in mind of our sins but that by the check and interruption which they give to our pursuits they allow us what the hurry and bustle of the world too often deny us  and that is a little time for reflection which is all that most of us want to make us wiser and better men  that at certain times it is so necessary a mans mind should be turned toward itself that rather than want occasions he had better purchase them at the expense of his present happiness  he had better as the text expresses it go to the house of mourning where he will meet with something to subdue his passions than to the house of feasting where the joy and gaity of the place is likely to excite them  that whereas the entertainments and caresses of the one place expose his heart and lay it open to temptations  the sorrows of the other defend it and as naturally shut them from it so strange and unaccountable a creature is man he is so framed that he cannot but pursue happiness  and yet unless he is made sometimes miserable how apt is he to mistake the way which can only lead him to the accomplishment of his own wishes  this is the full force of the wise mans declaration  but to do further justice to his words i would endeavor to bring the subject still nearer  for which purpose it will be necessary to stop here and take a transient view of the two places here referred to  the house of mourning and the house of feasting give me leave therefore i beseech you to recall both of them for a moment to your imaginations that from thence i may appeal to your hearts how faithfully and upon what good grounds the effects and natural operations of each upon our minds are intimated in the text  and first let us look into the house of feasting  and here to be as fair and candid as possible in the description of this we will not take it from the worst originals such as are opened merely for the sale of virtue and so calculated for the end that the disguise each is under not only gives power safely to drive on the bargain but safely to carry it into execution too  this we will not suppose to be the case  nor let us even imagine the house of feasting to be such a scene of intemperance and excess as the house of feasting does often exhibit  but let us take it from one as little exceptionable as we can  where there is or at least appears nothing really criminal  but where every thing seems to be kept within the visible bounds of moderation and sobriety  imagine then such a house of feasting where either by consent or invitation a number of each sex is drawn together for no other purpose but the enjoyment and mutual entertainment of each other which we will suppose shall arise from no other pleasures but what custom authorizes and religion does not absolutely forbid  before we enter  let us examine what must be the sentiments of each individual previous to his arrival and we shall find that however they may differ from one another in tempers and opinions that every one seems to agree in this  that as he is going to a house dedicated to joy and mirth it was fit he should divest himself of whatever was likely to contradict that intention or be inconsistent with it  that for this purpose he had left his cares  his serious thoughts  and his moral reflections behind him and was come forth from home with only such dispositions and gaiety of heart as suited the occasion and promoted the intended mirth and jollity of the place with this preparation of mind which is as little as can be supposed since it will amount to no more than a desire in each to render himself an acceptable guest  let us conceive them entering into the house of feasting with hearts set loose from grave restraints and open to the expectations of receiving pleasure it is not necessary as i premised to bring intemperance into this scene  or to suppose such an excess in the gratification of the appetites as shall ferment the blood and set the desires in a flame  let us admit no more of it therefore than will gently stir them and fit them for the impressions which so benevolent a commerce will naturally excite in this disposition thus wrought upon beforehand and already improved to this purpose  take notice how mechanically the thoughts and spirits rise  how soon and insensibly they are got above the pitch and first bounds which cooler hours would have marked  when the gay and smiling aspect of things has begun to leave the passages to a mans heart thus thoughtlessly unguarded  when kind and caressing looks of every object without that can flatter his senses have conspired with the enemy within to betray him and put him off his defense  when music likewise has lent her aid and tried her power upon his passions  when the voice of singing men and the voice of singing women with the sound of the viol and the lute have broke in upon his soul and in some tender notes have touched the secret springs of rapture  that moment let us dissect and look into his heart  see how vain how weak how empty a thing it is look through its several recesses  those pure mansions formed for the reception of innocence and virtue  sad spectacle behold those fair inhabitants now dispossessed  turned out of their sacred dwellings to make room  for what  at the best for levity and indiscretion  perhaps for folly  it may be for more impure guests which possibly in so general a riot of the mind and senses may take occasion to enter unsuspected at the same time  in a scene and disposition thus described  can the most cautious say  thus far shall my desires go  and no farther or will the coolest and most circumspect say when pleasure has taken full possession of his heart that no thought nor purpose shall arise there which he would have concealed  in those loose and unguarded moments the imagination is not always at command  in spite of reason and reflection it will forceably carry him sometimes whither he would not  like the unclean spirit in the parents sad description of his childs case which took him and often times cast him into the fire to destroy him and wheresoever it takes him it teareth him and hardly departs from him  but this you will say is the worst account of what the mind may suffer here  why may we not make more favorable suppositions  that numbers by exercise and custom to such encounters learn gradually to despise and triumph over them  that the minds of many are not so susceptible of warm impressions or so badly fortified against them that pleasure should easily corrupt or soften them  that it would be hard to suppose of the great multitudes which daily throng and press into this house of feasting but that numbers come out of it again with all the innocence with which they entered  and that if both sexes are included in the computation what fair examples shall we see of many of so pure and chaste a turn of mind  that the house of feasting with all its charms and temptations was never able to excite a thought or awaken an inclination which virtue need to blush at  or which the most scrupulous conscience might not support god forbid we should say otherwise  no doubt numbers of all ages escape unhurt and get off this dangerous sea without shipwreck yet are they not to be reckoned amongst the more fortunate adventurers  and though one would absolutely prohibit the attempt or be so cynical as to condemn every one who tries it since there are so many i suppose who cannot well do otherwise and whose condition and situation in life unavoidably force them upon it  yet we may be allowed to describe this fair and flattering coast  we may point out the unsuspected dangers of it and warn the unwary passenger where they lay we may show him what hazards his youth and inexperience will run how little he can gain by the venture and how much wiser and better it would be as is implied in the text to seek occasions rather to improve his little stock of virtue than incautiously expose it to so unequal a chance where the best he can hope is to return safe with what treasure he carried out  but where probably he may be so unfortunate as to lose it all  be lost himself and undone for ever  thus much for the house of feasting which by the way though generally open at other times of the year throughout the world is supposed in christian countries now every where to be universally shut up and in truth i have been more full in my cautions against it not only as reason requires  but in reverence to this season preached in lent wherein our church exacts a more particular forbearance and selfdenial in this point and thereby adds to the restraints upon pleasure and entertainments which this representation of things has suggested against them already  here then let us turn aside from this gay scene and suffer me to take you with me for a moment to one much fitter for your meditation let us go into the house of mourning made so by such afflictions as have been brought in merely by the common cross accidents and disasters to which our condition is exposed  where perhaps the aged parents sit broken hearted pierced to their souls with the folly and indiscretion of a thankless child  the child of their prayers in whom all their hopes and expectations centred  perhaps a more affecting scene  a virtuous family lying pinched with want where the unfortunate support of it having long struggled with a train of misfortunes and bravely fought up against them  is now piteously borne down at the last  overwhelmed with a cruel blow which no forecast or frugality could have prevented  o god look upon his afflictions  behold him distracted with many sorrows surrounded with the tender pledges of his love and the partner of his cares  without bread to give them  unable from the remembrance of better days to dig  to beg ashamed  when we enter into the house of mourning such as this  it is impossible to insult the unfortunate even with an improper look  under whatever levity and dissipation of heart such objects catch our eyes  they catch likewise our attentions collect and call home our scattered thoughts and exercise them with wisdom a transient scene of distress such as is here sketchd how soon does it furnish materials to set the mind at work how necessarily does it engage it to the consideration of the miseries and misfortunes the dangers and calamities to which the life of man is subject by holding up such a glass before it it forces the mind to see and reflect upon the vanity  the perishing condition and uncertain tenure of every thing in this world from reflections of this serious cast the thoughts insensibly carry us farther  and from considering what we are  what kind of world we live in and what evils befall us in it they set us to look forwards at what possibly we shall be  for what kind of world we are intended  what evils may befall us there  and what provision we should make against them here whilst we have time and opportunity  if these lessons are so inseparable from the house of mourning here supposed  we shall find it a still more instructive school of wisdom when we take a view of the place in that more affecting light in which the wise man seems to confine it in the text in which by the house of mourning i believe he means that particular scene of sorrow where there is lamentation and mourning for the dead  turn in hither i beseech you for a moment behold a dead man ready to be carried out the only son of his mother and she a widow perhaps a more affecting spectacle  a kind and an indulgent father of a numerous family lies breathless  snatched away in the strength of his age  torn in an evil hour from his children and the bosom of a disconsolate wife  behold much people of the city gathered together to mix their tears with settled sorrow in their looks going heavily along to the house of mourning to perform that last melancholy office which when the debt of nature is paid we are called upon to pay each other  if this sad occasion which leads him there has not done it already take notice to what a serious and devout frame of mind every man is reduced the moment he enters this gate of affliction the busy and fluttering spirits which in the house of mirth were wont to transport him from one diverting object to another  see how they are fallen how peaceably they are laid in this gloomy mansion full of shades and uncomfortable damps to seize the soul  see the light and easy heart which never knew what it was to think before how pensive it is now how soft how susceptible how full of religious impressions how deeply it is smitten with sense and with a love of virtue could we in this crisis whilst this empire of reason and religion lasts and the heart is thus exercised with wisdom and busied with heavenly contemplations  could we see it naked as it is  stripped of all its passions unspotted by the world and regardless of its pleasures  we might then safely rest our cause upon this single evidence and appeal to the most sensual whether solomon has not made a just determination here in favor of the house of mourning  not for its own sake but as it is fruitful in virtue and becomes the occasion of so much good without this end sorrow i own has no use but to shorten a mans days  nor can gravity with all its studied solemnity of look and carriage serve any end but to make one half of the world merry and impose upon the other  consider what has been said and may god of his mercy bless you amen  sermon iii philantropy recommended sermon iii luke x       which now of these three think thou was neighbor unto him that fell amongst the thieves  and he said he that showed mercy on him then said jesus unto him  go and do thou likewise   in the foregoing verses of this chapter the evangelist relates that a certain lawyer stood up and tempted jesus saying master what shall i do to inherit eternal life  to which enquiry our savior as his manner was when any ensnaring question was put to him which he saw proceeded more from a design to entangle him than an honest view of getting information  instead of giving a direct answer which might afford a handle to malice or at best serve only to gratify an impertinent humor  he immediately retorts the question upon the man who asked it and unavoidably puts him upon the necessity of answering himself  and as in the present case the particular profession of the enquirer and his supposed general knowledge of all other branches of learning left no room to suspect he could be ignorant of the true answer to his question and especially of what every one knew was delivered upon that head by their great legislator our savior therefore refers him to his own memory of what he had found there in the course of his studies  what is written in the law how read thou  upon which the enquirer reciting the general heads of our duty to god and man as delivered in the   th of leviticus and the  th of deuteronomy  namely  that we should worship the lord our god with all our hearts and love our neighbor as ourselves our blessed savior tells him he had answered right and if he followed that lesson he could not fail of the blessing he seemed desirous to inherit  this do and thou shall live  but he as the context tell us willing to justify himself  willing possibly to gain more credit in the conference or hoping perhaps to hear such a partial and narrow definition of the word neighbor as would suit his own principles and justify some particular oppressions of his own or those of which his whole order lay under an accusation  says unto jesus in the   th verse  and who is my neighbor though the demand at first sight may seem utterly trifling yet was it far from being so in fact for according as you understood the term in a more or a less restrained sense  it produced many necessary variations in the duties you owed from that relation  our blessed savior to rectify any partial and pernicious mistake in this matter and place at once this duty of the love of our neighbor upon its true bottom of philanthropy and universal kindness makes answer to the proposed question not by any far fetched refinement from the schools of the rabbis which might have sooner silenced than convinced the man  but by a direct appeal to human nature in an instance he relates of a man falling amongst thieves left in the greatest distress imaginable till by chance a samaritan an utter stranger coming where he was by an act of great goodness and compassion not only relieved him at present but took him under his protection and generously provided for his future safety  on the close of which engaging account  our savior appeals to the mans own heart in the first verse of the text  which now of these three think thou was neighbor unto him that fell amongst the thieves and instead of drawing the inference himself leaves him to decide in favor of so noble a principle so evidently founded in mercy  the lawyer struck with the truth and justice of the doctrine and frankly acknowledging the force of it our blessed savior concludes the debate with a short admonition that he would practice what he had approved  and go and imitate that fair example of universal benevolence which it had set before him  in the remaining part of the discourse i shall follow the same plan and therefore shall beg leave to enlarge first upon the story itself with such reflections as will rise from it and conclude as our savior has done with the same exhortation to kindness and humanity which so naturally falls from it  a certain man says our savior went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his raiment and departed leaving him half dead there is something in our nature which engages us to take part in every accident to which man is subject from what cause soever it may have happened but in such calamities as a man has fallen into through mere misfortune to be charged upon no fault or indiscretion of himself there is something then so truly interesting that at the first sight we generally make them our own not altogether from a reflection that they might have been or may be so but oftener from a certain generosity and tenderness of nature which disposes us for compassion abstracted from all considerations of self so that without any observable act of the will we suffer with the unfortunate and feel a weight upon our spirits we know not why on seeing the most common instances of their distress but where the spectacle is uncommonly tragical and complicated with many circumstances of misery the mind is then taken captive at once and were it inclined to it has no power to make resistance but surrenders itself to all the tender emotions of pity and deep concern so that when one considers this friendly part of our nature without looking farther one would think it impossible for man to look upon misery without finding himself in some measure attached to the interest of him who suffers it  i say one would think it impossible  for there are some tempers  how shall i describe them  formed either of such impenetrable matter or wrought up by habitual selfishness to such an utter insensibility of what becomes of the fortunes of their fellow creatures as if they were not partakers of the same nature or had no lot or connection at all with the species  of this character our savior produces two disgraceful instances in the behavior of a priest and a levite whom in this account he represents as coming to the place where the unhappy man was  both passing by without either stretching forth a hand to assist or uttering a word to comfort him in his distress  and by chance there came down a certain priest  merciful god that a teacher of thy religion should ever want humanity  or that a man whose head might be thought full of the one should have a heart void of the other  this however was the case before us  and though in theory one would scarce suspect that the least pretense to religion and an open disregard to so main a part of it could ever meet together in one person  yet in fact it is no fictitious character  look into the world  how often do you behold a sordid wretch whose straight heart is open to no mans affliction taking shelter behind an appearance of piety and putting on the garb of religion which none but the merciful and compassionate have a title to wear take notice with what sanctity he goes to the end of his days in the same selfish track in which he at first set out  turning neither to the right hand nor to the left  but plods on  pores all his life long upon the ground as if afraid to look up lest peradventure he should see aught which might turn him one moment out of that straight line where interest is carrying him  or if by chance he stumbles upon a hapless object of distress which threatens such a disaster to him  like the man here represented devoutly passing by on the other side as if unwilling to trust himself to the impressions of nature or hazard the inconveniences which pity might lead him into upon the occasion  there is but one stroke wanting in this picture of an unmerciful man to render the character utterly odious and that our savior gives it in the following instance he relates upon it and likewise says he a levite when he was at the place came and looked at him it was not a transient oversight the hasty or ill advised neglect of an unconsidering humor with which the best disposed are sometimes overtaken and led on beyond the point where otherwise they would have wished to stop  no  on the contrary it had all the aggravation of a deliberate act of insensibility proceeding from a hard heart when he was at the place he came and looked at him  considered his misfortunes gave time for reason and nature to have awoke  saw the imminent danger he was in  and the pressing necessity of immediate help which so violent a case called aloud for  and after all  turned aside and unmercifully left him to all the distresses of his condition  in all unmerciful actions the worst of men pay this compliment at least to humanity as to endeavor to wear as much of the appearance of it as the case will well let them  so that in the hardest acts a man shall be guilty of he has some motives true or false always ready to offer either to satisfy himself or the world and god knows too often to impose both upon the one and the other and therefore it would be no hard matter here to give a probable guess at what passed in the levites mind in the present case and show was it necessary by what kind of casuistry he settled the matter with his conscience as he passed by and guarded all the passages to his heart against the inroads which pity might attempt to make upon the occasion  but it is painful to dwell long upon this disagreeable part of the story i therefore hasten to the concluding incident of it which is so amiable that one cannot easily be too copious in reflections upon it  and behold says our savior a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him  and went to him  bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine  set him upon his own beast brought him to an inn and took care of him i suppose it will be scarce necessary here to remind you that the jews had no dealings with the samaritans  an old religious grudge  the worst of all grudges had wrought such a dislike between both people that they held themselves mutually discharged not only from all offices of friendship and kindness but even from the most common acts of courtesy and good manners this operated so strongly in our saviors time that the woman of samaria seemed astonished that he being a jew should ask water of her who was a samaritan  so that with such a prepossession however distressful the case of the unfortunate man was and how reasonably soever he might plead for pity from another man there was little aid or consolation to be looked for from so unpromising a quarter alas after i have been twice passed by neglected by men of my own nation and religion bound by so many ties to assist me left here friendless and unpitied both by a priest and levite men whose profession and superior advantages of knowledge could not leave them in the dark in what manner they should discharge this debt which my condition claims  after this  what hopes what expectations from a passenger not only a stranger  but a samaritan released from all obligations to me and by a national dislike inflamed by mutual ill offices now made my enemy and more likely to rejoice at the evils which have fallen upon me than to stretch forth a hand to save me from them  it is no unnatural soliloquy to imagine but the actions of generous and compassionate tempers baffle all little reasonings about them  true charity in the apostles description as it is kind and is not easily provoked so it manifested this character  for we find when he came where he was and beheld his distress  all the unfriendly passions which at another time might have rose within him now utterly forsook him and fled when he saw his misfortunes  he forgot his enmity toward the man  dropped all the prejudices which education had planted against him and in the room of them all that was good and compassionate was suffered to speak in his behalf  in benevolent natures the impulse to pity is so sudden that like instruments of music which only obey the touch  the objects which are fitted to excite such impressions work so instantaneous an effect that you would think the will was scarce concerned and that the mind was altogether passive in the sympathy which her own goodness has excited the truth is  the soul is generally in such cases so busily taken up and wholly engrossed by the object of pity that she does not attend to her own operations or take leisure to examine the principles upon which she acts so that the samaritan though the moment he saw him he had compassion on him yet sudden as the emotion is represented you are not to imagine that it was mechanical but that there was a settled principle of humanity and goodness which operated within him and influenced not only the first impulse of kindness but the continuation of it throughout the rest of so engaging a behavior and because it is a pleasure to look into a good mind and trace out as far as one is able what passes within it on such occasions i shall beg leave for a moment to state an account of what was likely to pass in his and in what manner so distressful a case would necessarily work upon such a disposition  as he approached the place where the unfortunate man lay the instant he beheld him no doubt some such train of reflections as this would rise in his mind good god what a spectacle of misery do i behold  a man stripped of his raiment  wounded  lying languishing before me upon the ground just ready to expire  without the comfort of a friend to support him in his last agonies or the prospect of a hand to close his eyes when his pains are over but perhaps my concern should lessen when i reflect on the relations in which we stand to each other  that he is a jew and i a samaritan  but are we not still both men partakers of the same nature  and subject to the same evils  let me change conditions with him for a moment and consider had his lot befallen me as i journeyed in the way what measure i should have expected at his hands  should i wish when he beheld me wounded and halfdead that he should shut up his bowels of compassion from me and double the weight of my miseries by passing by and leaving them unpitied  but i am a stranger to the man  be it so  but i am no stranger to his condition  misfortunes are of no particular tribe or nation but belong to us all and have a general claim upon us without distinction of climate country or religion besides though i am a stranger  it is no fault of his that i do not know him and therefore unequitable he should suffer by it  had i known him possibly i should have had cause to love and pity him the more  for aught i know he is some one of uncommon merit whose life is rendered still more precious as the lives and happiness of others may be involved in it perhaps at this instant that he lies here forsaken in all this misery a whole virtuous family is joyfully looking for his return and affectionately counting the hours of his delay oh did they know what evil has befallen him  how would they fly to succor him  let me then hasten to supply those tender offices of binding up his wounds and carrying him to a place of safety  or if that assistance comes too late i shall comfort him at least in his last hour  and if i can do nothing else  i shall soften his misfortunes by dropping a tear of pity over them  it is almost necessary to imagine the good samaritan was influenced by some such thoughts as these from the uncommon generosity of his behavior which is represented by our savior operating like the warm zeal of a brother mixed with the affectionate discretion and care of a parent who was not satisfied with taking him under his protection and supplying his present wants but in looking forwards for him and taking care that his wants should be supplied when he should be gone and no longer near to befriend him  i think there needs no stronger argument to prove how universally and deeply the seeds of this virtue of compassion are planted in the heart of man than in the pleasure we take in such representations of it and though some men have represented human nature in other colors though to what end i know not that the matter of fact is so strong against them that from the general propensity to pity the unfortunate we express that sensation by the word humanity as if it was inseparable from our nature that it is not inseparable i have allowed in the former part of this discourse from some reproachful instances of selfish tempers which seem to take part in nothing beyond themselves yet i am persuaded and affirm it is still so great and noble a part of our nature that a man must do great violence to himself and suffer many a painful conflict before he has brought himself to a different disposition  it is observable in the foregoing account that when the priest came to the place where he was he passed by on the other side  he might have passed by you will say without turning aside  no there is a secret shame which attends every act of inhumanity not to be conquered in the hardest natures so that as in other cases so especially in this many a man will do a cruel act who at the same time would blush to look you in the face and is forced to turn aside before he can have a heart to execute his purpose  inconsistent creature that man is who at that instant that he does what is wrong is not able to withhold his testimony to what is good and praise worthy  i have now done with the parable which was the first part proposed to be considered in this discourse and should proceed to the second which so naturally falls from it of exhorting you as our savior did the lawyer upon it to go and do so likewise but i have been so copious in my reflections upon the story itself that i find i have insensibly incorporated into them almost all that i should have said here in recommending so amiable an example by which means i have unawares anticipated the task i proposed i shall therefore detain you no longer than with a single remark upon the subject in general which is this it is observable in many places of scripture that our blessed savior in describing the day of judgment does it in such a manner as if the great enquiry then was to relate principally to this one virtue of compassion  and as if our final sentence at that solemnity was to be pronounced exactly according to the degrees of it i was a hungered and ye gave me meat  thirsty and ye gave me drink  naked and ye clothed me  i was sick and ye visited me  in prison and ye came unto me not that we are to imagine from thence as if any other good or evil action should then be overlooked by the eye of the allseeing judge but barely to intimate to us that a charitable and benevolent disposition is so principal and ruling a part of a mans character as to be a considerable test by itself of the whole frame and temper of his mind with which all other virtues and vices respectively rise and fall and will almost necessarily be connected  tell me therefore of a compassionate man you represent to me a man of a thousand other good qualities  on whom i can depend  whom i may safely trust with my wife  my children my fortune and reputation it is for this as the apostle argues from the same principle  that he will not commit adultery  that he will not kill  that he will not steal  that he will not bear false witness that is the sorrows which are stirred up in mens hearts by such trespasses are so tenderly felt by a compassionate man that it is not in his power or his nature to commit them  so that well might he conclude that charity by which he means the love to your neighbor was the end of the commandment and that whosoever fulfilled it had fulfilled the law  now to god etc amen  sermon iv self knowledge sermon iv   samuel xii    st part and nathan said unto david thou art the man   there is no historical passage in scripture which gives a more remarkable instance of the deceitfulness of the heart of man to itself and of how little we truly know of ourselves than this wherein david is convicted out of his own mouth and is led by the prophet to condemn and pronounce a severe judgment upon another for an act of injustice which he had passed over in himself and possibly reconciled to his own conscience to know ones self one would think could be no very difficult lesson  for who you will say can well be truly ignorant of himself and the true disposition of his own heart if a man thinks at all he cannot be a stranger to what passes there  he must be conscious of his own thoughts and desires he must remember his past pursuits and the true springs and motives which in general have directed the actions of his life he may hang out false colors and deceive the world but how can a man deceive himself that a man can  is evident because he daily does so  scripture tells us and gives us many historical proofs of it besides this to which the text refers  that the heart of man is treacherous to itself and deceitful above all things and experience and every hours commerce with the world confirms the truth of this seeming paradox that though man is the only creature endowed with reflection and consequently qualified to know the most of himself  yet so it happens that he generally knows the least  and with all the power which god has given him of turning his eyes inwards upon himself and taking notice of the chain of his own thoughts and desires  yet in fact is generally so inattentive but always so partial an observer of what passes that he is as much nay often a much greater stranger to his own disposition and true character than all the world besides  by what means he is brought under so manifest a delusion and how he suffers himself to be so grossly imposed upon in a point which he is capable of knowing so much better than others is not hard to give an account of nor need we seek further for it than amongst the causes which are every day perverting his reason and misleading him we are deceived in judging of ourselves just as we are in judging of other things when our passions and inclinations are called in as counselors and we suffer ourselves to see and reason just so far and no farther than they give us leave how hard do we find it to pass an equitable and sound judgment in a matter where our interest is deeply concerned  and even where there is the remotest considerations of self connected with the point before us what a strange bias does it hang upon our minds and how difficult is it to disengage our judgments entirely from it with what reluctance are we brought to think evil of a friend whom we have long loved and esteemed and though there happens to be strong appearances against him how apt are we to overlook or put favorable constructions upon them and even sometimes when our zeal and friendship transport us to assign the best and kindest motives for the worst and most unjustifiable parts of his conduct  we are still worse casuists and the deceit is proportionably stronger with a man when he is going to judge of himself  that dearest of all parties  so closely connected with him  so much and so long beloved  of whom he has so early conceived the highest opinion and esteem and with whose merit he has allalong no doubt found so much reason to be contented it is not an easy matter to be severe where there is such an impulse to be kind or to efface at once all the tender impressions in favor of so old a friend which disable us from thinking of him as he is and seeing him in the light may be in which every one else sees him  so that however easy this knowledge of onesself may appear at first sight it is otherwise when we come to examine since not only in practice but even in speculation and theory we find it one of the hardest and most painful lessons some of the earliest instructors of mankind no doubt found it so too and for that reason soon saw the necessity of laying such a stress upon this great precept of self knowledge which for its excellent wisdom and usefulness many of them supposed to be a divine direction that it came down from heaven and comprehended the whole circle both of knowledge and the duty of man and indeed their zeal might easily be allowed in so high an encomium upon the attainment of a virtue the want of which so often baffled their instructions and rendered their endeavors of reforming the heart vain and useless for who could think of a reformation of the faults within him who knew not where they lay or could set about correcting till he had first come to a sense of the defects which required it  but this was a point always much easier recommended by public instructors than shown how to be put in practice and therefore others who equally sought the reformation of mankind observing that this direct road which led to it was guarded on all sides by selflove and consequently very difficult of open access soon found out that a different and more artful course was requisite as they had not strength to remove this flattering passion which stood in their way and blocked up all the passages to the heart they endeavored by stratagem to get beyond it and by a skilful address if possible to deceive it this gave rise to the early manner of conveying their instructions in parables fables and such sort of indirect applications which though they could not conquer this principle of selflove yet often laid it asleep or at least overreached it for a few moments till a just judgment could be procured  the prophet nathan seems to have been a great master in this way of address david had greatly displeased god by two grievous sins which he had committed and the prophets commission was to go and bring him to a conviction of them and touch his heart with a sense of guilt for what he had done against the honor and life of uriah  the holy man knew that was it any ones case but davids own no man would have been so quicksighted in discerning the nature of the injury  more ready to have redressed it or who would have felt more compassion for the party who had suffered it than he himself  instead therefore of declaring the real intention of his errand by a direct accusation and reproof for the crimes he had committed he comes to him with a fictitious complaint of a cruel act of injustice done by another and accordingly he frames a case not so parallel to davids as he supposed would awaken his suspicion and prevent a patient and candid hearing and yet not so void of resemblance in the main circumstances as to fail of striking him when shown in a proper light  and nathan came and said unto him there were two men in one city the one rich and the other poor  the rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds but the poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb which he had bought and nourished up  and it grew up together with him and with his children  it did eat of his own meat and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter  and there came a traveller unto the rich man and he spared to take of his own flock and of his own herd to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him but took the poor mans lamb and dressed it for the man that was come unto him  the case was drawn up with great judgment and beauty  the several minute circumstances which heightened the injury truly affecting  and so strongly urged that it would have been impossible for any man with a previous sense of guilt upon his mind to have defended himself from some degree of remorse which it must naturally have excited  the story though it spoke only of the injustice and oppressive act of another man  yet it pointed to what he had lately done himself with all the circumstances of its aggravation  and withal the whole was so tenderly addressed to the heart and passions as to kindle at once the utmost horror and indignation and so it did  but not against the proper person in his transport he forgot himself  his anger greatly kindled against the man  and he said unto nathan as the lord lives the man that has done this thing shall surely die and he shall restore the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity  it can scarce be doubted here but that davids anger was real and that he was what he appeared to be greatly provoked and exasperated against the offender and indeed his sentence against him proves he was so above measure for to punish the man with death and oblige him to restore fourfold besides was highly unequitable and not only disproportioned to the offense but far above the utmost rigor and severity of the law which allowed a much softer atonement requiring in such a case no more than an ample restitution and recompense in kind the judgment however seems to have been truly sincere and well meant and bespoke rather the honest rashness of an unsuspicious judge than the cool determination of a conscious and guilty man who knew he was going to pass sentence upon himself  i take notice of this particular because it places this instance of self deceit which is the subject of the discourse in the strongest light and fully demonstrates the truth of a fact in this great man which happens every day amongst ourselves namely that a man may be guilty of very bad and dishonest actions and yet reflect so little or so partially upon what he has done as to keep his conscience free not only from guilt but even the remotest suspicions that he is the man which in truth he is and what the tenor and evidence of his life demonstrate if we look into the world  davids is no uncommon case  we see some one or other perpetually copying this bad original sitting in judgment upon himself  hearing his own cause and not knowing what he is doing hasty in passing sentence and even executing it too with wrath upon the person of another when in the language of the phophet one might say to him with justice thou art the man  of the many revengeful covetous false and illnatured persons which we complain of in the world though we all join in the cry against them what man amongst us singles out himself as a criminal or ever once takes it into his head that he adds to the number  or where is there a man so bad who would not think it the hardest and most unfair imputation to have any of those particular vices laid to his charge  if he has the symptoms never so strong upon him which he would pronounce infallible in another they are indications of no such malady in himself  he sees what no one else sees some secret and flattering circumstances in his favor which no doubt make a wide difference betwixt his case and the parties which he condemns  what other man speaks so often and vehemently against the vice of pride sets the weakness of it in a more odious light or is more hurt with it in another than the proud man himself it is the same with the passionate the designing the ambitious and some other common characters in life and being a consequence of the nature of such vices and almost inseparable from them the effects of it are generally so gross and absurd that where pity does not forbid it is pleasant to observe and trace the cheat through the several turns and windings of the heart and detect it through all the shapes and appearances which it puts on  next to these instances of self deceit and utter ignorance of our true disposition and character which appears in not seeing that in ourselves which shocks us in another man there is another species still more dangerous and delusive and which the more guarded perpetually fall into from the judgments they make of different vices according to their age and complexion and the various ebbs and flows of their passions and desires  to conceive this let any man look into his own heart and observe in how different a degree of detestation numbers of actions stand there though equally bad and vicious in themselves he will soon find that such of them as strong inclination or custom has prompted him to commit are generally dressed out and painted with all the false beauties which a soft and flattering hand can give them and that the others to which he feels no propensity appear at once naked and deformed surrounded with all the true circumstances of their folly and dishonor  when david surprised saul sleeping in the cave and cut off the skirt of his robe we read his heart smote him for what he had done  strange it smote him not in the matter of uriah where it had so much stronger reason to take the alarm  a whole year had almost passed from the first commission of that injustice to the time the prophet was sent to reprove him  and we read not once of any remorse or compunction of heart for what he had done and it is not to be doubted had the same prophet met him when he was returning up out of the cave  and told him that scrupulous and conscientious as he then seemed and thought himself to be that he was deceiving himself and was capable of committing the foulest and most dishonorable actions  that he should one day murder a faithful and a valiant servant whom he ought in justice to have loved and honored  that he should without pity first wound him in the tenderest part by taking away his dearest possession  and then unmercifully and treacherously rob him of his life  had nathan in a prophetic spirit foretold to david that he was capable of this and that he should one day actually do it and from no other motive but the momentary gratification of a base and unworthy passion he would have received the prediction with horror and said possibly with hazael upon just such another occasion and with the same ignorance of himself  what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing and yet in all likelihood at that very time there wanted nothing but the same degree of temptation and the same opportunity to induce him to the sin which afterward overcame him  thus the case stands with us still when the passions are warmed and the sin which presents itself exactly tallies to the desire observe how impetuously a man will rush into it and act against all principles of honor justice and mercy  talk to him the moment after upon the nature of another vice to which he is not addicted and from which perhaps his age his temper or rank in life secure him  take notice how well he reasons  with what equity he determines  what an honest indignation and sharpness he expresses against it and how insensibly his anger kindles against the man who has done this thing  thus are we nice in grains and scruples  but knaves in matters of a pound weight  every day straining at gnats yet swallowing camels  miserably cheating ourselves and torturing our reason to bring us in such a report of the sin as suits the present appetite and inclination  most of us are aware of and pretend to detest the barefaced instances of that hypocrisy by which men deceive others but few of us are upon our guard or see that more fatal hypocrisy by which we deceive and overreach our own hearts it is a flattering and dangerous distemper which has undone thousands  we bring the seeds of it along with us into the world  they insensibly grow up with us from our childhood  they lie long concealed and undisturbed and have generally got such deep root in our natures by the time we are come to years of understanding and reflection that it requires all we have got to defend ourselves from their effects  to make the case still worse on our sides it is with this as with every grievous distemper of the body  the remedies are dangerous and doubtful in proportion to our mistakes and ignorance of the cause for in the instances of selfdeceit though the head is sick and the whole heart faint the patient seldom knows what he ails  of all the things we know and learn this necessary knowledge comes to us the last  upon what principles it happens thus i have endeavored to lay open in the first part of this discourse which i conclude with a serious exhortation to struggle against them which we can only hope to do by conversing more and oftener with ourselves than the business and diversions of the world generally give us leave  we have a chain of thoughts desires engagements and idlenesses which perpetually return upon us in their proper time and order  let us i beseech you assign and set apart some small portion of the day for this purpose  of retiring into ourselves and searching into the dark corners and recesses of the heart and taking notice of what is passing there if a man can bring himself to do this task with a curious and impartial eye he will quickly find the fruits of it will more than recompense his time and labor he will see several irregularities and unsuspected passions within him which he never was aware of  he will discover in his progress many secret turns and windings in his heart to which he was a stranger which now gradually open and disclose themselves to him upon a nearer view in these labyrinths he will trace out such hidden springs and motives for many of his most applauded actions as will make him rather sorry and ashamed of himself than proud  in a word he will understand his errors and then see the necessity with david of imploring god to cleanse him from his secret faults  and with some hope and confidence to say with this great man after his conviction  try me o god and seek the ground of my heart  prove me and examine my thoughts  look well if there be any way of wickedness in me and lead me in the way everlasting  now to god the father etc etc  sermon v a charity sermon advertisement this sermon with the following dedication to the lord bishop of carlisle then dean of york was printed some years ago but was read by very few it is therefore reprinted in this collection  to the very reverend richard osbaldeston dd dean of york sir i have taken the liberty to inscribe this discourse to you in testimony of the great respect which i owe to your character in general and from a sense of what is due to it in particular from every member of the church of york  i wish i had as good a reason for doing that which has given me the opportunity of making so public and just an acknowledgment being afraid there can be little left to be said upon the subject of charity which has not been often thought and much better expressed by many who have gone before and indeed it seems so beaten and common a path that it is not an easy matter for a new comer to distinguish himself in it by any thing except the novelty of his vehicle  i beg however sir your kind acceptance of it and of the motives which have induced me to address it to you one of which i cannot conceal in justice to myself because it has proceeded from the sense of many favors and civilities which i have received from you i am  reverend sir your most obliged and faithful humble servant laurence stern  sermon v   kings xvii    and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail according to the word of the lord which he spoke by the prophet elijah   the words of the text are the record of a miracle wrought in behalf of the widow of zerephath who had charitably taken elijah under her roof and administered unto him in a time of great scarcity and distress there is something very interesting and affectionate in the manner this story is related in holy writ and as it concludes with a second still more remarkable proof of gods favor to the same person in the restoration of her dead son to life one cannot but consider both miracles as rewards of that act of piety wrought by infinite power and left upon record in scripture not merely as testimonies of the prophets divine mission but likewise as two encouraging instances of god almightys blessing upon works of charity and benevolence  in this view i have made choice of this piece of sacred story which i shall beg leave to make use of as the groundwork for an exhortation to charity in general and that it may better answer the particular purpose of this solemnity i will endeavor to enlarge upon it with such reflections as i trust in god will excite some sentiments of compassion which may be profitable to so pious a design  elijah had fled from two dreadful evils the approach of a famine and the persecution of ahab an enraged enemy and in obedience to the command of god had hid himself by the brook cherith that is before jordan in this safe and peaceful solitude blessed with daily marks of gods providence the holy man dwelt free both from the cares and glories of the world by miraculous impulse the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening and he drank of the brook till by continuance of drought the windows of heaven being shut up in those days for three years and six months which was the natural cause likewise of the famine it came to pass after a while that the brook the great fountain of his support dried up and he is again directed by the word of the lord where to betake himself for shelter he is commanded to arise and go to zerephath which belongs to zidon with an assurance that he had disposed the heart of a widowwoman there to sustain him  the prophet follows the call of his god  the same hand which brought him to the gate of the city had led also the poor widow out of her doors oppressed with sorrow she had come forth upon a melancholy errand to make preperation to eat her last meal and share it with her child  no doubt she had long fenced against this tragical event with all the thrifty management which selfpreservation and parental love could inspire full no doubt of cares and many tender apprehensions lest her slender stock should fail them before the return of plenty  but as she was a widow having lost the only faithful friend who would best have assisted her in this virtuous struggle the pressing necessity of the times at length overcame her and she was just falling down an easy prey to it when elijah came to the place where she was and he called unto her her and said fetch me i pray thee a little water in a vessel that i may drink and as she was going to fetch it he called unto her and said bring me i pray thee a morsel of bread in thine hand and she said as the lord thy god lives i have not a cake but a handful of meal in a barrel and a little oil in a cruse and behold i am gathering two sticks that i may go in and dress it for me and my son that we may eat it and die and elijah said unto her fear not but go and do as thou have said but make me thereof a little cake first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus says the lord god of israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse of oil fail until the day that the lord sends rain upon the earth  true charity is always unwilling to find excuses  else here was a fair opportunity of pleading many she might have insisted over again upon her situation which necessarily tied up her hands  she might have urged the unreasonableness of the request  that she was reduced to the lowest extremity already  and that it was contrary to justice and the first law of nature to rob herself and child of their last morsel and give it to a stranger  but in generous spirits compassion is sometimes more than a balance for selfpreservation for as god certainly interwove that friendly softness in our nature to be a check upon too great a propensity toward selflove  so it seemed to operate here  for it is observable that though the prophet backed his request with the promise or an immediate recompense in multiplying her stock yet it is not evident she was influenced at all by that temptation for if she had doubtless it must have wrought such a mixture of selfinterest into the motive of her compliance as must greatly have allayed the merit of the action but this i say does not appear but rather the contrary from the reflection she makes upon the whole in the last verse of the chapter now by this i know that thou art a man of god and that the word of the lord in thy mouth is truth  besides as she was an inhabitant of zerephath or as it is called by st luke sarepta subject to sidon the metropolis of phoenicia without the bounds of gods people she had been brought up in gross darkness and idolatry in utter ignorance of the lord god of israel or if she had heard of his name which is all that seems probable she had been taught to disbelieve the mighty wonders of his hand and was still less likely to believe his prophet  moreover she might argue if this man by some secret mystery of his own or through the power of his god is able to procure so preternatural a supply for me whence comes it to pass that he now stands in want himself oppressed both with hunger and thirst  it appears therefore that she must have been wrought upon by an unmixed principle of humanity  she looked upon him as a fellowpartner almost in the same affliction with herself  she considered he had come a weary pilgrimage in a sultry climate through an exhausted country where neither bread or water were to be had but by acts of liberality  that he had come an unknown traveller and as a hard heart never wants a pretense that this circumstance which should rather have befriended might have helped to oppress him  she considered for charity is ever fruitful in kind reasons that he was now far from his own country and had strayed out of the reach of the tender offices of some one who affectionately mourned his absence  her heart was touched with pity  she turned in silence and went and did according as he had said and behold both she and he and her house did eat many days or as in the margin one whole year and the barrel of meal wasted not neither did the cruse of oil fail until the day that god sent rain upon the earth  though it may not seem necessary to raise conjectures here upon this event yet it is natural to suppose the danger of the famine being thus unexpectedly got over that the mother began to look hopefully forwards upon the rest of her days there were many widows in israel at that time when the heavens were shut up for three years and six months yet as st luke observes to none of them was the prophet sent save to this widow of sarepta in all likelihood she would not be the last in making the same observation and drawing from it some flattering conclusion in favor of her son  many a parent would build high upon a worse foundation  since the god of israel has thus sent his own messenger to us in our distress to pass by so many houses of his own people and stop at mine to save it in so miraculous a manner from destruction doubtless this is but an earnest of his future kind intentions to us at least his goodness has decreed to comfort my old age by the long life and health of my son  but perhaps he has something greater still in store for him and i shall live to see the same hand hereafter crown his head with glory and honor we may naturally suppose her innocently carried away with such thoughts when she is called back by an unexpected distemper which surprises her son and in one moment brings down all her hopes  for his sickness was so sore that there was no breath left in him   the expostulations of immoderate grief are seldom just  for though elijah had already preserved her son as well as herself from immediate death and was the last cause to be suspected of so sad an accident yet the passionate mother in the first transport challenges him as the author of her misfortune  as if he had brought down sorrow upon a house which had so hospitably sheltered him the prophet was too full of compassion to make reply to so unkind an accusation he takes the dead child out of his mothers bosom and laid him upon his own bed and he cried unto the lord and said o lord my god have thou brought evil upon the widow with whom i sojourn by slaying her son is this the reward of all her charity and goodness thou have before this robbed her of the dear partner of all her joys and all her cares and now that she is a widow and has most reason to expect thy protection behold thou have withdrawn her last prop thou have taken away her child the only stay she had to rest on  and elijah cried unto god and said o lord my god i pray thee let this childs soul come into him again  the prayer was urgent and bespoke the distress of a humane mind deeply suffering in the misfortunes of another  moreover his heart was rent with other passions  he was zealous for the name and honor of his god and thought not only his omnipotence but his glorious attribute of mercy concerned in the event for oh with what triumph would the prophets of baal retort his own bitter taunt and say his god was either talking or he was pursuing or was in a journey or peradventure he slept and should have been awaked  he was moreover involved in the success of his prayer himself  honest minds are most hurt by scandal  and he was afraid lest so foul a one so unworthy of his character might arise amongst the heathen who would report with pleasure lo the widow of zerephath took the messenger of the god of israel under her roof and kindly entertained him and see how she is rewarded surely  prophet was ungrateful he wanted power or what is worse he wanted pity  besides all this he pleaded not only the cause of the widow it was the cause of charity itself which had received a deep wound already and would suffer still more should god deny it this testimony of his favor so the lord hearkened unto the voice of elijah and the soul of the child came into him again and he revived and elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother and elijah said see thy son lives  it would be a pleasure to a good mind to stop here a moment and figure to itself the picture of so joyful an event  to behold on one hand the raptures of the parent overcome with surprise and gratitude and imagine how a sudden stroke of such impetuous joy must operate on a despairing countenance long accustomed to sadness  to conceive on the other side of the piece the holy man approaching with the child in his arms  full of honest triumph in his looks but sweetened with all the kind sympathy which a gentle nature could overflow with upon so happy an event it is a subject one might recommend to the pencil of a great genius and would even afford matter for description here but that it would lead us too far from the particular purpose for which i have enlarged upon thus much of the story already the chief design of which is to illustrate by a fact what is evident both in reason and scripture that a charitable and good action is seldom cast away but that even in this life it is more than probable that what is so scattered shall be gathered again with increase cast thy bread upon the waters and thou shall find it after many days be as a father unto the fatherless and instead of a husband unto their mother so shall thou be as the son of the most high and he will love thee more than thy mother does be mindful of good turns for thou know not what evil shall come upon the earth and when thou fallest thou shall find a stay it shall preserve thee from all affliction and fight for thee against thy enemies better than a mighty shield and a strong spear  the great instability of temporal affairs and constant fluctuation of every thing in this world afford perpetual occasions of taking refuge in such a security  what by successive misfortunes by failings and cross accidents in trade by miscarriage of projects  what by unsuitable expenses of parents extravagance of children and the many other secret ways whereby riches make themselves wings and fly away so many surprising revolutions do every day happen in families that it may not seem strange to say that the posterity of some of the most liberal contributors here in the changes which one century may produce may possibly find shelter under this very plant which they now so kindly water nay so quickly sometimes has the wheel turned round that many a man has lived to enjoy the benefit of that charity which his own piety projected  but besides this and exclusive of the right which gods promise gives it to protection hereafter charity and benevolence in the ordinary chain of effects have a natural and more immediate tendency in themselves to rescue a man from the accidents of the world by softening the hearts and winning every mans wishes to its interest when a compassionate man falls who would not pity him who that had power to do it would not befriend and raise him up or could the most barbarous temper offer an insult to his distress without pain and reluctance so that it is almost a wonder that covetousness even in spite of itself does not sometimes argue a man into charity by its own principle of looking forwards and the firm expectation it would delight in of receiving its own again with usury  so evident is it in the course of gods providence and the natural stream of things that a good office one time or other generally meets with a reward  generally did i say  how can it ever fail  when besides all this so large a share of the recompense is so inseparable even from the action itself ask the man who has a tear of tenderness always ready to shed over the unfortunate who withal is ready to distribute and willing to communicate ask him if the best things which wits have said of pleasure have expressed what he has felt when by a seasonable kindness he has made the heart of the widow sing for joy mark then the expressions of unutterable pleasure and harmony in his looks and say whether solomon has not fixed the point of true enjoyment in the right place when he declares that he knew no good there was in any of the riches or honors of this world but for a man to do good with them in his life nor was it without reason he made this judgment  doubtless he had found and seen the insufficiency of all sensual pleasures how unable to furnish either a rational or a lasting scheme of happiness how soon the best of them vanished the less exceptionable in vanity but the guilty both in vanity and vexation of spirit but that this was of so pure and refined a nature it burned without consuming it was figuratively the widows barrel of meal which wasted not and cruse of oil which never failed  it is not an easy matter to add weight to the testimony of the wisest man upon the pleasure of doing good or else the evidence of the philosopher epicurus is very remarkable whose word in this matter is the more to be trusted because a professed sensualist who amidst all the the delicacies and improvements of pleasure which a luxuriant fancy might strike out still maintained that the best way of enlarging human happiness was by a communication of it to others  and if it was necessary here or there was time to refine upon this doctrine one might further maintain exclusive of the happiness which the mind itself feels in the exercise of this virtue that the very body of man is never in a better state than when he is most inclined to do good offices  that as nothing more contributes to health than a benevolence of temper so nothing generally was a stronger indication of it  and what seems to confirm this opinion is an observation the truth of which must be submitted to every ones reflection  namely  that a disinclination and backwardness to do good is often attended if not produced by an indisposition of the animal as well as rational part of us  so naturally do the soul and body as in other cases so in this mutually befriend or prey upon each other and indeed setting aside all abstruser reasoning upon the point i cannot conceive but that the very mechanical motions which maintain life must be performed with more equal vigor and freedom in that man whom a great and good soul perpetually inclines to show mercy to the miserable than they can be in a poor sordid selfish wretch whose little contracted heart melts at no mans affliction but sits brooding so intently over its own plots and concerns as to see and feel nothing and in truth enjoy nothing beyond himself and of whom one may say what that great master of nature has speaking of a natural sense of harmony which i think with more justice may be said of compassion that the man who had it not    was fit for treasons stratagems and spoils  the motions of his spirits are dull as night  and his affections dark as erebus   let no such man be trusted  what divines say of the mind naturalists have observed of the body that there is no passion so natural to it as love which is the principle of doing good  and though instances like this just mentioned seem far from being proofs of it yet it is not to be doubted but that every hardhearted man has felt much inward opposition before he could prevail upon himself to do aught to fix and deserve the character and that what we say of long habits of vice that they are hard to be subdued may with equal truth be said concerning the natural impressions of benevolence that a man must do much violence to himself and suffer many a painful struggle before he can tear away so great and noble a part of his nature  of this antiquity has preserved a beautiful instance in an anecdote of alexander the tyrant of pheres who though he had so industriously hardened his heart as to seem to take delight in cruelty insomuch as to murder many of his subjects every day without cause and without pity yet at the bare representation of a tragedy which related the misfortunes of hecuba and andromache he was so touched with the fictitious distress which the poet had wrought up in it that he burst out into a flood of tears the explication of which inconsistency is easy and casts as great a luster upon human nature as the man himself was a disgrace to it the case seems to have been this in real life he had been blinded with passions and thoughtlessly hurried on by interest or resentment  but here there was no room for motives of that kind so that his attention being first caught hold of and all his vices laid asleep  then nature awoke in triumph and showed how deeply she had sown the seeds of compassion in every mans breast when tyrants with vices the most at enmity with it were not able entirely to root it out  but this is painting an amiable virtue and setting her off with shades which wickedness lends us when one might safely trust to the force of her own natural charms and ask whether any thing under heaven in its own nature is more lovely and engaging  to illustrate this the more let us turn our thoughts within ourselves and for a moment let any number of us here imagine ourselves at this instant engaged in drawing the most perfect and amiable character such as according to our conceptions of the deity we should think most acceptable to him and most likely to be universally admired by all mankind  i appeal to your own thoughts whether the first idea which offered itself to most of our imaginations would not be that of a compassionate benefactor stretching forth his hands to raise up the helpless orphan whatever other virtues we should give our hero we should all agree in making him a generous friend who thought the opportunities of doing good to be the only charm of his prosperity we should paint him like the psalmists river of god overflowing the thirsty parts of the earth that he might enrich them carrying plenty and gladness along with him if this was not sufficient and we were still desirous of adding a farther degree of perfection to so great a character we should endeavor to think of some one if human nature could furnish such a pattern who if occasion required was willing to undergo all kinds of affliction to sacrifice himself to forget his dearest interests and even lay down his life for the good of mankind  and here  o merciful savior how would the bright original of thy unbounded goodness break in upon our hearts thou who becamest poor that we might be rich  though lord of all this world yet had not where to lay thy head  and though equal in power and glory to the great god of nature yet made thyself of no reputation tookest upon thee the form of a servant  submitting thyself without opening thy mouth to all the indignities which a thankless and undiscerning people could offer and at length to accomplish our salvation becamest obedient unto death suffering thyself as on this day preached on good friday  to be led like a lamb to the slaughter  the consideration of this stupendous instance of compassion in the son of god is the most unanswerable appeal that can be made to the heart of man for the reasonableness of it in himself  it is the great argument which the apostles use in almost all their exhortations to good works  beloved if christ so loved us  the inference is unvoidable and gives strength and beauty to every thing else which can be urged upon the subject and therefore i have reserved it for my last and warmest appeal with which i would gladly finish this discourse that at least for their sakes for whom it is preached we might be left to the full impression of so exalted and so seasonable a motive  that by reflecting upon the infinite labor of this days love in the instance of christs death we may consider what an immense debt we owe each other and by calling to mind the amiable pattern of his life in doing good we might learn in what manner we may best discharge it  and indeed of all the methods in which a good mind would be willing to do it i believe there can be none more beneficial or comprehensive in its effects than that for which we are here met together  the proper education of poor children being the groundwork of almost every other kind of charity as that which makes every other subsequent act of it answer the pious expectation of the giver  without this foundation first laid how much kindness in the progress of a benevolent mans life is unavoidably cast away and sometimes where it is as senseless as the exposing a tender plant to all the inclemencies of a cruel season and then going with sorrow to take it in when the root is already dead i said therefore this was the foundation of almost every kind of charity  and might not one have added of all policy too since the many ill consequences which attend the want of it though grievously felt by the parties themselves are no less so by the community of which they are members and moreover of all mischiefs seem the hardest to be redressed  insomuch that when one considers the disloyal seductions of popery on one hand and on the other that no bad man whatever he professes can be a good subject one may venture to say it had been cheaper and better for the nation to have bore the expense of instilling sound principles and good morals into the neglected children of the lower sort especially in some parts of great britain than to be obliged so often as we have been within this last century to rise up and arm ourselves against the rebellious effects which the want of them have brought down even to our doors and in fact if we are to trust antiquity the truth of which in this case we have no reason to dispute this matter has been looked upon of such vast importance to the civil happiness and peace of a people that some commonwealths the most eminent for political wisdom have chose to make a public concern of it thinking it much safer to be entrusted to the prudence of the magistrate than to the mistaken tenderness or natural partiality of the parent  it was consistent with this and bespoke a very refined sense of policy in the lacedaemonians though by the way i believe different from what more modern politics would have directed in like circumstances when antipater demanded of them fifty children as hostages for the security of a distant engagement they made this brave and wise answer they would not  they could not consent  they would rather give him double the number of their best upgrown men  intimating that however they were distressed they would choose any inconvenience rather than suffer the loss of their countrys education and the opportunity which if once lost can never be regained of giving their youth an early tincture of religion and bringing them up to a love of industry and a love of the laws and constitution of their country  if this shows the great importance of a proper education to children of all ranks and conditions what shall we say then of those whom the providence of god has placed in the very lowest lot of life utterly cast out of the way of knowledge without a parent  sometimes may be without a friend to guide and instruct them but what common pity and the necessity of their sad situation engages  where the dangers which surround them on every side are so great and many that for one fortunate passenger in life who makes his way well in the world with such early disadvantages and so dismal a setting out we may reckon thousands who every day suffer shipwreck and are lost for ever  if there is a case under heaven which calls out aloud for the more immediate exercise of compassion and which may be looked upon as the compendium of all charity surely it is this and i am persuaded there would want nothing more to convince the greatest enemy to these kinds of charities that it is so but a bare opportunity of taking a nearer view of some of the more distressful objects of it  let him go into the dwellings of the unfortunate into some mournful cottage where poverty and affliction reign together there let him behold the disconsolate widow  sitting  steeped in tears  thus sorrowing over the infant she knows not how to succor  o my child thou art now left exposed to a wide and a vicious world too full of snares and temptations for thy tender and unpractised age perhaps a parents love may magnify those dangers  but when i consider thou art driven out naked into the midst of them without friends without fortune without instruction my heart bleeds beforehand for the evils which may come upon thee god in whom we trusted is witness so low had his providence placed us that we never indulged one wish to have made thee rich  virtuous we would have made thee  for thy father my husband was a good man and feared the lord  and though all the fruits of his care and industry were little enough for our support yet he honestly had determined to have spared some portion of it scanty as it was to have placed thee safely in the way of knowledge and instruction  but alas he is gone from us never to return more and with him are fled the means of doing it  for behold the creditor is come upon us to take all that we have  grief is eloquent and will not easily be imitated  but let the man who is the least friend to distresses of this nature conceive some disconsolate widow uttering her complaint even in this manner and then let him consider if there is any sorrow like this sorrow wherewith the lord has afflicted her or whether there can be any charity like that of taking the child out of the mothers bosom and rescuing her from these apprehensions should a heathen a stranger to our holy religion and the love it teaches should he as he journeyed come to the place where she lay when he saw would he not have compassion on her god forbid a christian should this day want it or at any time look upon such a distress and pass by on the other side  rather let him do as his savior taught him bind up the wounds and pour comfort into the heart of one whom the hand of god has so bruised let him practice what it is with elijahs transport to say to the afflicted widow  see thy son lives  lives by my charity and the bounty of this hour to all the purposes which make life desirable  to be made a good man and a profitable subject on one hand to be trained up to such a sense of his duty as may secure him an interest in the world to come and with regard to this world to be so brought up in it to a love of honest labor and industry as all his life long to earn and eat his bread with joy and thankfulness  much peace and happiness rest upon the head and heart of every one who thus brings children to christ  may the blessing of him that was ready to perish come seasonably upon him  the lord comfort him when he most wants it when he lays sick upon his bed make thou o god all his bed in his sickness and for what he now scatters give him then that peace of thine which passes all understanding and which nothing in this world can either give or take away amen  sermon vi pharisee and publican in the temple sermon vi luke xviii     st part i tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other    these words are the judgment which our savior has left upon the behavior and different degrees of merit in the two men the pharisee and publican whom he represents in the foregoing parable as going up into the temple to pray in what manner they discharged this great and solemn duty will best be seen from a consideration of the prayer which each is said to have addressed to god upon the occasion  the pharisee instead of an act of humiliation in that awful presence before which he stood  with an air of triumph and selfsufficiency thanks god that he had not made him like others  extortioners adulterers unjust or even as this publican  the publican is represented as standing afar off and with a heart touched with humility from a just sense of his own unworthiness is said only to have smote upon his breast saying  god be merciful to me a sinner i tell you adds our savior this man went down to his house justified rather than the other  though the justice of this determination strikes every one at first sight it may not be amiss to enter into a more particular examination of the evidence and reasons upon which it might be founded not only because it may place the equity of this decision in favor of the publican in a stronger light but that the subject seems likely to lead me to a train of reflections not unsuitable to the solemnity of the season preached in lent   the pharisee was one of that sect who in our saviors time what by the austerity of their lives  their public almsdeeds and greater pretenses to piety than other men had gradually wrought themselves into much credit and reputation with the people and indeed as the bulk of these are easily caught with appearances their character seems to have been admirably well suited to such a purpose  if you looked no farther than the outward part of it you would think it made up of all goodness and perfection an uncommon sanctity of life guarded by great decorum and severity of manners  profuse and frequent charities to the poor  many acts of religion much observance of the law  much abstinence  much prayer   it is painful to suspect the appearance of so much good  and would have been so here had not our blessed savior left us their real character upon record and drawn up by himself in one word  that the sect were like whitened sepulchers all fair and beautiful without and enriched there with whatever could attract the eye of the beholder but when searched withinside were full of corruption and of whatever could shock and disgust the searcher so that with all their affectation of piety and more extraordinary strictness and regularity in their outward deportment all was irregular and uncultivated within  and all these fair pretenses how promising soever blasted by the indulgence of the worst of human passions  pride  spiritual pride the worst of all pride  hypocrisy selflove covetuousness extortion cruelty and revenge what pity it is that the sacred name of religion should ever have been borrowed and employed in so bad a work as in covering over such a black catalogue of vices  or that the fair form of virtue should have been thus disgraced and for ever drawn into suspicion from the unworthy uses of this kind to which the artful and abandoned have often put her the pharisee seems to have had not many scruples of this kind and the prayer he makes use of in the temple is a true picture of the mans heart and shows with what a disposition and frame of mind he came to worship   god i thank thee that thou have formed me of different materials from the rest of my species whom thou have created frail and vain by nature but by choice and disposition utterly corrupt and wicked  me thou have fashioned in a different mould and have infused so large a portion of thy spirit into me lo i am raised above the temptations and desires to which flesh and blood are subject  i thank thee that thou have made me thus  not a frail vessel of clay like that of other men  or even this publican but that i stand here a chosen and sanctified vessel unto thee  after this obvious paraphrase upon the words which speaks no more than the true spirit of the pharisees prayer  you will naturally ask what reason was there for all this triumph  or what foundation could he have to insult in this manner over the infirmities of mankind  or even those of the humble publican who stood before him  why says he i give tithes of all that i possess  truly a very indifferent account of himself  and if that was all he had to offer in his own behalf god knows it was but a weak foundation to support so much arrogance and selfconceit because the observance of both the one and the other of these ordinances might be supposed well enough to be consistent with the most profligate of life and manners  the conduct and behavior of the publican appears very different  and indeed as much the reverse to this as you could conceive but before we enter upon that as i have spoke largely to the character of the pharisee twill be but justice to say a word or two in general to his  the publican was one of that order of men employed by the roman emperors in levying the taxes and contributions which were from time to time exacted from judea as a conquered nation whether from the particular fate of that employment owing to the fixed aversion which men have to part with what is their own or from whatever other causes it happened  so it was that the whole set of men were odious insomuch that the name of a publican was a term of reproach and infamy amongst the jews  perhaps the many instances of rigor to which their office might direct them  heightened sometimes by a mixture of cruelty and insolence of their own  and possibly always made to appear worse than they were by the loud clamours and misrepresentations of others  all might have contributed to form and ix this odium but it was here no doubt as in all other classes of men whose professions expose them to more temptations than that of others  that there are numbers who still behave well and who amidst all the snares and opportunities which lie in their way  pass through them not only with an unblemished character but with the inward testimony of a good conscience  the publican in all likelihood was one of these  and the sentiments of candor and humility which the view of his condition inspired are such as could come only from a heart and character thus described  he goes up into the temple to pay his sacrifice of prayer  in the discharge of which he pleads no merit of his own  enters into no comparison with others  or justification of himself with god but in reverence to that holier part of the temple where his presence was supposed more immediately to be displayed  he keeps afar off  is afraid to lift up his eyes toward heaven  but smites upon his breast and in a short but fervent ejaculation  submissively begs god to have mercy upon his sins o god how precious how amiable is true humility what a difference in thy sight does it make to consist betwixt man and man pride was not made for a creature with such manifold imperfections  religious pride is a dress which still worse becomes him  because of all others it is that to which he has least pretense  the best of us fall seven times a day and thereby add some degree of unprofitableness to the character of those who do all that is commanded them  was i perfect therefore says job i would not know my soul i would be silent i would be ignorant of my own righteousness for should i say i was perfect it would prove me to be perverse from this introduction i will take occasion to recommend this virtue of religious humility which so naturally falls from the subject and which cannot more effectually be enforced than by an enquiry into the chief causes which produce the opposite vice to it  that of spiritual pride  for in this malady of the mind of man  the case is parallel with most others of his body the dangers of which can never rightly be apprehended or can remedies be applied either with judgment or success till they are traced back to their first principles and the seeds of the disorder are laid open and considered and first i believe one of the most general causes of spiritual pride is that which seems to have misled the pharisee  a mistaken notion of the true principles of his religion he thought no doubt that the whole of it was comprehended in the two articles of paying tithes and frequent fasting and that when he had discharged his conscience of them  he had done all that was required at his hands and might with reason go and thank god that he had not made him like others  it is not to be questioned but through force of this error the pharisee might think himself to be what he pretended a religious and upright man  for however he might be brought to act a double and insincere part in the eyes of men upon worldly views  it is not to be supposed  that when he stood by himself apart in the temple and no witnesses of what passed between him and his god  that he should knowingly and wilfully have dared to act so open and barefaced a scene of mockery in the face of heaven this is scarce probable  and therefore it must have been owing to some delusion in his education which had early implanted in his mind false and wretched notions of the essentials of religion  which as he grew up had proved the seeds of infinite error both in practice and speculation   with the rest of his sect he had been so principled and instructed as to observe a scrupulous nicety and most religious exactness in the lesser matters of his religion  its frequent washings  its fastings and other external rites of no merit in themselves  but to be exempted from the more troublesome exactness in the weightier matters of the law which were of eternal and unchangeable obligation so that they were in truth blind guides  who thus would strain at a gnat and yet swallow a camel and as our savior reproves them from a familiar instance of domestic inconsistency  would make clean the outside of the cup and platter  yet suffer the inside  the most material part to be full of corruption and excess from this knowledge of the character and principles of the pharisee it is easy to account for his sentiments and behavior in the temple which were just such as they would have led one to have expected  thus it has always happened by a fatality common to all such abuses of religion as make it to consist in external rites and ceremonies more than inward purity and integrity of heart  as these outward things are easily put in practice  and capable of being attained to without much capacity or much opposition to flesh and blood  it too naturally betrays the professors of it into a groundless persuasion of their own godliness and a despicable one of that of others in their religious capacities and the relations in which they stand toward god which is the very definition of spiritual pride  when the true heat and spirit of devotion is thus lost and extinguished under a cloud of ostentatious ceremonies and gestures as is remarkable in the roman church  where the celebration of high mass when set off to the best advantage with all its scenical decorations and finery looks more like a theatrical performance than that humble and solemn appeal which dust and ashes are offering up to the throne of god  when religion i say is thus clogged and bore down by such a weight of ceremonies  it is much easier to put in pretentions to holiness upon such a mechanical system as is left of it than where the character is only to be got and maintained by a painful conflict and perpetual war against the passions it is easier for instance for a zealous papist to cross himself and tell his beads than for an humble protestant to subdue the lusts of anger intemperance cruelty and revenge to appear before his maker with that preparation of mind which becomes him the operation of being sprinkled with holy water is not so difficult in itself as that of being chaste and spotless within  conscious of no dirty thought or dishonest action it is a much shorter way to kneel down at a confessional and receive absolution  than to live so as to deserve it  not at the hands of men  but at the hands of god  who sees the heart and cannot be imposed on  the achievement of keeping lent or abstaining from flesh on certain days is not so hard as that of abstaining from the works of it at all times  especially as the point is generally managed amongst the richer sort with such art and epicurism at their tables  and with such indulgence to a poor mortified appetite  that an entertainment upon a fast is much more likely to produce a surfeit than a fit of sorrow  one might run the parallel much farther but this may be sufficient to show how dangerous and delusive these mistakes are  how apt to mislead and overset weak minds which are ever apt to be caught by the pomp of such external parts of religion  this is so evident that even in our own church where there is the greatest chastity in things of this nature  and of which none are retained in our worship but what i believe tend to excite and assist it  yet so strong a propensity is there in our nature to sense  and so unequal a match is the understanding of the bulk of mankind for the impressions of outward things  that we see thousands who every day mistake the shadow for the substance and was it fairly put to the trial would exchange the reality for the appearance  you see this was almost universally the case of the jewish church  where for want of proper guard and distinction betwixt the means of religion and religion itself the ceremonial part in time eat away the moral part and left nothing but a shadow behind  it is to be feared the buffooneries of the romish church bid fair to do it the same ill office to the disgrace and utter ruin of christianity wherever popery is established what then remains but that we rectify these gross and pernicious notions of religion and place it upon its true bottom which we can only do by bringing back religion to that cool point of reason which first showed us its obligation  by always remembering that god is a spirit  and must be worshipped suitable to his nature i e in spirit and in truth  and that the most acceptable sacrifice we can offer him is a virtuous and an upright mind  and however necessary it is not to leave the ceremonial and positive parts of religion undone  yet not like the pharisee to rest there  and omit the weightier matters but keep this in view perpetually that though the instrumental duties are duties of unquestionable obligation to us  yet they are still but instrumental duties conducive to the great end of all religion  which is to purify our hearts  and conquer our passions  and in a word to make us wiser and better men  better neighbors  better citizens  and better servants to god  to whom etc  the end of the first volume
