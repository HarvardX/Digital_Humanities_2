this piece to you gratitude and vanity gratitude because it is success has been greatly owing to your judicious advice and vanity because i wish to acquaint the world that such a character as mr garrick has been warmly the friend of his sincerely affectionate  and very much obliged humble servant hugh kelly middle temple jan         prologue written by david garrick esquire mr kelly originally intended the prologue to be grave and accordingly wrote a serious one himself but as mr king was to speak it mr garrick with great propriety thought a piece of humor would be best suited to the talents of that excellent actor and therefore very kindly took the trouble of putting it into a form so entirely different from the first that it cannot with the least justice be attributed to any other author  spoken by mr king i am vexed  quite vexed  and you will be vexed  that is worse to deal with stubborn scribblers there is the curse write moral plays  the blockhead  why good people you will soon expect this house to wear a steeple for our fine piece to let you into facts is quite a sermon  only preached in acts you will scarce believe me till the proof appears but even i tom fool

footmen mr wright etc lady betty lambton mrs abington miss marchmont mrs baddeley miss rivers mrs jefferies mrs harley mrs dancer sally miss reynolds scene richmond  time the time of representation  false delicacy act i scene i an apartment at lady betty lambtons  enter sidney and winworth sidney still i cannot help thinking but lady betty lambtons refusal was infinitely more the result of an extraordinary delicacy than the want of affection for your lordship   winworth o my dear cousin you are very much mistaken i am not one of those coxcombs who imagine a woman doesnt know her own mind or who because they are treated with civility by a lady who has rejected their addresses suppose she is secretly debating in their favor lady betty is a woman of sense and must consequently despise coquetry or affectation   sidney why she always speaks of you with the greatest respect   winworth respect  why she always speaks of you with the greatest respect does it therefore follow that she loves you no charles  i have for some time you know ceased to trouble lady betty with my solicitations and i see myself honored with her friendship though i havnt been so happy as to merit her heart for this reason i have no doubt of her assistance on the present occasion and i am certain i shall please her by making my addresses to miss marchmont   sidney miss marchmont is indeed a very deserving young woman   winworth next to lady betty i never saw one so formed to my wishes besides during the whole period of my fruitless attendance she seemed so interested for my success and expressed so hearty a concern for my disappointment that i have considered her with an eye of more than common friendship ever since  but what is the matter with you charles you seem to have something upon your spirits   sidney indeed my lord you are mistaken i am only attentive   winworth o is that all  this very day i purpose to request lady bettys interest with miss marchmont for unhappily circumstancd as she is with regard to fortune she possesses an uncommon share of delicacy and may possibly think herself insulted by the offer of a rejected heart  lady betty in that case will save her the pain of a supposed disrespect and me the mortification of a new repulse but i beg your pardon charles i am forgetting the cause of friendship and shall now step up stairs to colonel rivers about your affair  ah sidney you have no difficulties to obstruct the completion of your wishes and a few days must make you one of the happist men in england   exit sidney looking after him a few days make me one of the happiest men in england  a likely matter truly little does he know how i passionately admire the very woman to whom he is immediately going with an offer of his person and fortune  the marriage with miss rivers i see is unavoidable and i am almost pleased that i never obtained any encouragement from miss marchmont as i should now be reduced to the painful alternative either of giving up my own hopes or of opposing the happiness of such a friend   enter mrs harley and miss marchmont mrs harley o here my dear girl is the sweet swain in propria persona  only mind what a funeral sermonface the creature has notwithstanding the agreeable prospects before him  well of all things in the world defend me i say from a sober husband   sidney you are extremely welcome mrs harley to divert yourself    mrs harley he speaks too in as melancholy a tone as a passing bell  lord lord what can colonel rivers see in the wretch to think of him for a soninlaw  only look miss marchmont at this loveexciting countenance  observe the cupids that ambush in these eyes  these lips to be sure are fraught with the honey of hybla  go you lifeless devil you  go try to get a little animation into this unfortunate face of yours   sidney upon my word my face is very much obliged to you   miss marchmont you are a mad creature my dear and yet i envy your spirits prodigiously   mrs harley and so you ought  but for all that you and lady betty are unaccountably fond of those halfsould fellows who are as mechanically regular as so many pieces of clockwork and never strike above once an hour upon a new observation  who are so sentimental and so dull  so wise and so drowsy  why i thought lady betty had already a sufficient quantity of lead in her family without taking in this lump to increase the weight of it   miss marchmont what can she posibly mean mr sidney   sidney it is impossible to guess madam the lively widow will still have her laugh without sparing any body   mrs harley why surely my dear you cannot forget the counter part of poor dismal here that elaborate piece of dignified dullness lady bettys cousin lord hectic who through downright fondness is continually plaguing his poor wife and rendering her the most miserable woman in the world from an extraordinary desire of promoting her happiness   miss marchmont and isnt there a great deal to say in extenuation of an error which proceeds from a principle of real affection   mrs harley affection ridiculous but you shall have an instance of this wonderful affection  the other day i dined at his house and though the weather was intollerably warm the table was laid in a close room with a fire large enough to roast an ox for a country corporation   sidney well and so    mrs harley in a great chair near the fire side sat poor lady hectic wrapped up in as many fur cloaks as would bassle the severity of a winter in siberia  on my entrance i expressed a proper concern for her illness and asked the nature of her complaint  she told me she complained of nothing but the weight of her dress and the intolerable heat of the apartment adding that she had been caught in a little shower the preceding evening which terrisied lord hectic out of his wits and so for fear she might run the chance of a slight cold he exposed her to the hazard of absolute suffocation   sidney upon my word miss marchmont she has a pretty manner of turning things   miss marchmont really i think so   mrs harley well  unable to bear either the tyranny of this preposterous fondness any longer or the intolerable heat of his room i made my escape the moment the cloth was removed and shall not be surprised if before the conclusion of the summer he is brought before his peers for having murdered his poor lady out of downright affection   sidney a very uncommon death mrs harley among people of quality   enter a footman footman to sidney lord winworth sir desires the favor of your company above the person is come with the writings from the temple    sidney i will wait upon him immediately   mrs harley ay pray do you are the fittest company in the world for each other  if colonel rivers was of my mind he would turn you instantly adrift and listen to the overtures of sir harry newburg   sidney i really believe you have a fancy to me yourself youre so constantly abusing me  exit mrs harley i you odious creature   miss marchmont now you mention sir harry my dear isnt it rather extraordinary for him to think about miss rivers when he knows of the engagements between her and mr sidney  especially as her father has such an objection to the wildness of his character   mrs harley what you are still at your sober reflections i see and are for scrutinizing into the morals of a lover  the women truly would have a fine time of it if they were never to be married till they found men of unexceptionable characters   miss marchmont nay i dont want to lessen sir harrys merit in the least  he has his good qualities as well as his faults  and is no way destitute of understanding  but still his understanding is a fashionable one and pleads the knowledge of every thing right to justify the practice of many things not strictly warrantable   mrs harley why i never heard any thing to his prejudice but some fashionable liberties which he has taken with the ladies   miss marchmont and in the name of wonder what would you desire to hear   mrs harley come come hortensia we women are unaccountable creatures the greatest number of us by much love a fellow for having a little modish wildness about him and if we are such fools as to be captivated with the vices of the men we ought to be punished for the depravity of our sentiments   enter rivers and lady betty rivers i tell you sister they can read the parchments very well without our assistance  and i have been so fatigued with looking over papers all the morning that i am heartily sick of your indentures witnessing your forasmuchs likewises alsos moreovers and notwithstandings and i must take a turn in the garden to recover myself   exit lady betty nay i only spoke because i imagined our being present would be more agreeable to lord winworth  but i wonder sir harry doesnt come he promised to be here by ten and i want to see his cousin cecil mightily   miss marchmont what lady betty does mr cecil come with him here this morning   lady betty he does my dear  he arrived at sir harrys last night and i want to see if his late journey to france has any way improved the elegance of his appearance  ironically mrs harley well i shall be glad to see him too for notwithstanding his disregard of dress and freedom of manner  there is a something right in him that pleases me prodigiously   miss marchmont a something right mrs harley  he is one of the worthiest creatures in the world   lady betty o hortensia he ought to be a favorite of yours for i dont know any body who possesses a higher place in his good opinion   miss marchmont twoud be odd indeed if he wasnt a favorite of mine  he was my fathers best friend  gave him a considerable living you know and when he died would have provided very kindly for me if your generosity lady betty hadnt rendered his goodness wholly unnecessary   lady betty pooh pooh no more of this   mrs harley  wish there was a possibility of making him dress like a gentleman  but i am glad he comes with sir harry  for though they have a great regard for each other they are continually wrangling and form a contrast which is often extremely diverting    enter a footman sir harry newburg and mr cecil madam   lady betty o here they are show them in  exit footm mrs harley now for it   miss marchmont hush they are here   sir harry ladies your most obedient    cecil ah girls  give me a kiss each of you instantly  lady betty i am heartily glad to see you  i have a budget full of compliments for you from several of your friends at paris    lady betty did you meet any of them at paris   cecil i did  and what was worse i met them in every town i passed through  but the english are a great commercial nation you know and their fools like their broad cloths are exported in large quantities to all parts of europe   sir harry what and they found you a fool so much above the market price that they have returned you upon the hands of your country  here ladies is a head for you piping hot from paris   cecil and here ladies is a head for you like the alps   sir harry like the alps ladies how do you make that out   cecil why it is always white and always barren it is constantly covered with snow but never produces any thing profitable   mrs harley o say no more upon that head i beseech you   lady betty indeed sir harry i think they are too hard for you   mrs harley why i think so too  especially my friend cecil who with that unfortunate shock of hair has no great right to be considered as a standard for dress in this country   cecil ah widow there are many heads in this country with much more extraordinary things upon them than my unfortunate shock of hair as you call it  what do you think of these wings for instance that cover the ears of my cousin mercury   sir harry death dont spoil my hair   cecil you see this fellow is so tortured upon the wheel of fashion that a single touch immediately throws him into agonies  now my dress is as easy as it is simple and five minutes    sir harry with the help of your five fingers equips you at any time for the drawing room  ha ha ha   cecil and isnt it better than being five hours under the paws of your hairdresser   lady betty but custom mr cecil    cecil men of sense have nothing to do with custom and it is more their business to set wise examples than to follow foolish ones   mrs harley but dont you think the world will be apt to laugh a little mr cecil   cecil i cannot help the want of understanding among mankind   sir harry the blockhead thinks there is nothing due to the general opinion of ones country   cecil and none but blockheads like you would mind the foolish opinions of any country   lady betty well mr cecil must take his own way i think  so come along ladies  let us go into the gaden and send my brother to sir harry to settle the business about theodora   cecil theodora  what a charming name for the romance of a circulating library  i wonder lady betty your brother woudnt call his girl deborah after her grandmother    mrs harrley deborah  o i should hate such an old fashioned name abominably    cecil and i hate this new fashion of calling our children by pompous appellations  by and by we shall not have a ralph or a roger a bridget or an alice remaining in the kingdom  the dregs of the people have adopted this unaccountable custom and a fellow who keeps a little alehouse at the bottom of my avenue in the country has no less than an augustusfrederick a scipio africanus and a matildawilhelminaleonora in his family   mrs harley upon my word a very pretty string of christian names   lady betty well sir harry you and mr cecil dine with us  come ladies let us go to the garden   mrs harley i positively will not go without mr cecil for i must have somebody to laugh at   cecil and so must i widow therefore i will not lose this opportunity of being in your company   exeunt ladies and followed by cecil who meets rivers entering cecil ah colonel i am heartily glad to see you    rivers my dear cecil you are welcome home again   cecil there is my wise kinsman wants a word with you  exit sir harry colonel your most obedient  i am come upon the old business  for unless i am allowed to entertain hope of miss rivers i shall be the most miserable of human beings   rivers sir harry i have already told you by letter and i now tell you personally i cannot listen to your proposals   sir harry no sir   rivers no sir  i have promised my daughter to mr sidney  do you know that sir   sir harry i do  but what then engagements of this kind you know    rivers so then you do know i have promised her to mr sidney   sir harry i do  but i also know that matters are not finally settled between mr sidney and you and i moreover know that his fortune is by no means equal to mine therefore    rivers sir harry let me ask you one question before you make your consequence   sir harry a thousand if you please sir   rivers why then sir let me ask you what you have ever observed in me or my conduct that you desire me so familiarly to break my word  i thought sir you considered me as a man of honor   sir harry and so i do sir a man of the nicest honor   rivers and yet sir you ask me to violate the sanctity of my word  and tell me indirectly that it is my interest to be a rascal    sir harry i really dont understand you colonel  i thought when i was talking to you i was talking to a man who knew the world  and as you have not yet signed    rivers why this is mending matters with a witness  and so you think because i am not legally bound i am under no necessity of keeping my word  sir harry laws were never made for men of honor  they want no bond but the rectitude of their own sentiments and laws are of no use but to bind the villains of society   sir harry well but my dear colonel if you have no regard for me show some little regard for your daughter   rivers sir harry i show the greatest regard for my daughter by giving her to a man of honor  and i must not be insulted with any farther repetition of your proposals   sir harry insult you colonel  is the offer of my alliance an insult  is my readiness to make what settlements you think proper    rivers sir harry i should consider the offer of a kingdom an insult if it was to be purchased by the violation of my word  besides though my daughter shall never go a beggar to the arms of her husband i would rather see her happy than rich and if she has enough to provide handsomely for a young family and something to spare for the exigencies of a worthy friend i shall think her as affluent as if she was mistress of mexico   sir harry well colonel i have done  but i believe    rivers well sir harry and as our conference is done we will if you please retire to the ladies  i shall be always glad of your acquaintance though i cannot receive you as a soninlaw  for a union of interest i look upon as a union of dishonor and consider a marriage for money at best but a legal prostitution   exeunt end of the first act act ii scene a garden enter lady betty and mrs harley mrs harley lord lord my dear youre enough to drive one out of ones wits  i tell you again and again he is as much yours as ever and was i in your situation he should be my husband tomorrow morning   lady betty dear emmy you mistake the matter strangely  lord winworth is no common man nor would he have continued his silence so long upon his favorite subject if he had the least inclination to renew his addresses  his pride has justly taken the alarm at my insensibility and he will not i am satisfied run the hazard of another refusal   mrs harley why then in the name of wonder if he was so dear to you could you prodigally trifle with your own happiness and repeatedly refuse him   lady betty i have repeatedly told you because i was a fool emmy  till he withdrew his addresses i knew not how much i esteemed him my unhappiness in my first marriage you know made me resolve against another  and you are also sensible i have frequently argued that a woman of real delicacy should never admit a second impression on her heart   mrs harley yes and i always thought you argued very foolishly  i am sure i ought to know for i have been twice married  and though i loved my first husband very sincerely there was not a woman in england who could have made the second a better wife  nay for that matter if another was to offer himself tomorrow i am not altogether certain that i should refuse listening    lady betty you are a strange creature   mrs harley and arent you a much stranger in declining to follow your own inclinations when you could have consulted them so highly to the credit of your good sense and the satisfaction of your whole family  but it isnt yet too late and if you will be advised by me every thing shall end as happily as you can wish   lady betty well let me hear your advice   mrs harley why this then  my lord you know has requested that you would indulge him with half an hours private conversation some time this morning   lady betty well   mrs harley this is a liberty he hasnt taken these three months  and he must design something by it  now as he can design nothing but to renew his addresses i would advise you to take him at the very first word for fear your delicacy if it has time to consider should again show you the strange impropriety of second marriages   lady betty but suppose this should not be his business with me   mrs harley why then well go another way to work  i as a sanguine friend of my lords can give him a distant hint of matters exacting at the same time a promise of the most inviolable secrecy and assuring him you would never forgive me if you had the least idea of my having acquainted him with so important a    lady betty and so you would have me    mrs harley why not  this is the very step i should take myself if i was in your situation   lady betty may be so  but it is a step which i shall never take  what would you have me lost to all feeling would you have me meanly make use of chambermaid artifices for a husband   mrs harley i would only have you happy my dear  and where the man of ones heart is at stake i dont think we ought to stand so rigidly upon trifles    lady betty trifles emmy do you call the laws of delicacy trifles  she that violates these    mrs harley poh poh she that violates  what a work there is with you sentimental folks  why dont i tell you that my lord shall never know any thing of your concern in the design   lady betty but shall not i know it myself emmy  and how can i escape the justice of my own reflections   mrs harley well thank heaven my sentiments are not sufficiently refined to make me unhappy   lady betty i cannot change my sentiments my dear emmy  nor would i if i could  of this however be certain that unless i have lord winworth without courting him i shall never have him at all  but be silent to all the world upon this matter i conjure you  particularly to miss marchmont for she has been so strenuous an advocate for my lord that the concealment of it from her might give her some doubts of my friendship and i should be continually uneasy for fear my reserve should be considered as an indirect insult upon her circumstances   mrs harley well the devil take this delicacy i dont know any thing it does besides making people miserable  and yet some how foolish as it is one cannot help liking it  but yonder i see sir harry and mr cecil   lady betty let us withdraw then my dear they may detain us and till this interview is over i shall be in a continual agitation yet i am strangely apprehensive of a disappointment emmy  and if   going mrs harley lady betty   lady betty what do you say   mrs harley do you still think there is any thing extremely preposterous in second marriages   lady betty you are intolerably provoking   exeunt enter cecil and sir harry cecil well did not i tell you the moment you opened this affair to me that the colonel was a man of too much sense to give his daughter to a coxcomb   sir harry but what if i should tell you that his daughter shall be still mine and in spite of his teeth   cecil prithee explain kinsman   sir harry why suppose miss rivers should have no very strong objection to this unfortunate figure of mine   cecil why even your vanity cannot think that a young lady of her good sense can possibly be in love with you   sir harry what you think that no likely circumstance i see   cecil i do really  formerly indeed the women were fools enough to be caught by the frippery of externals and so a fellow neither picked a pocket nor put up with an affront he was a dear toad  a sweet creature  and a wicked devil  nay the wicked devil was quite an angel of a man  and like another alexander in proportion to the number of wretches which he made he constantly increased the luster of his reputation  till at last having conquered all his worlds he sat down with that celebrated ruffian and wept because he could commit no farther outrages upon society   sir harry o my good moralizing cousin you will find your self cursedly out in your politics and i shall convince you in a few hours that a handsome suit on the back of a sprightly young fellow will still do more among the women than all your sentiment and slovenliness    cecil what would you persuade me that miss rivers will go off with you    sir harry you have hit the mark for once in your life my sweet tempered mouther of morality  the dear theodora    cecil the dear theodora and so harry you imagine that by the common maxims of fashionable life you may appear to be a friend to the colonel at the very moment you are going to rob him of his daughter  for shame kinsman  for shame  have some pride if you have no virtue  and dont smile in a mans face when you want to do him the greatest of all injuries  dont harry    sir harry cecil i scorn a base action as much as you or as much as any man  but i love miss rivers honorably  i ask nothing from her father and as her person is her own she has a right to bestow it where she pleases   cecil i am answered  her person is her own  and she has a right to be miserable her own way  i acknowledge it  and will not discover your secret to her father    sir harry discover it to her father  why sure you woudnt think of it  take care cecil  take care  i do indeed love you better than any man in the world  and i know you have a friendship a cordial friendship for me  but the happiness of my whole life is at stake and must not be destroyed by any of your unaccountable peculiarities   cecil harry  you know i would at any time rather promote your happiness than obstruct it  and you also know that if i die without children  you shall have a principal part of my fortune  but damn it  i wish you had not used the mask of friendship to steal this young lady away from her relations  it is hard that their good nature must be turned against their peace  and hard because her whole family treat you with regard that you should offer them the greatest insult imaginable   sir harry dear cecil i am more to be pitied than condemned in this transaction  when i first endeavored to make myself agreeable to miss rivers i imagined her family would readily countenance my addresses and when i succeeded in that endeavor i had not time to declare myself in form before her father entered into this engagement with sidney  the moment i heard it mentioned i wrote to him offering him a carte blanch and this morning a repetition of my offer was treated with contempt  i have therefore been forced into the measure you disapprove so much  but i hope my conduct in the character of the soninlaw will amply atone for any error in my behavior as a friend   cecil well well we must make the best of a bad market  her father has no right to force her inclinations  it is equally cruel and unjust therefore you may depend upon my utmost endeavors not only to assist you in carrying her off but in appeasing all family resentments  for really you are so often in the wrong that one must stand by you a little when you are in the right  so i shall be ready for you kinsman   sir harry why cecil this is honest  this is really friendly  and you shall abuse me a whole twelvemonth without my answering a syllable  but for the present i must leave you  yonder i see miss rivers  we have some little matters to talk of  you understand me  and now   exit cecil for a torrent of rapture and nonsense  what egregious puppies does this unaccountable love make of young fellows nay for that matter what egregious puppies does it not make of old ones  ecce signum  it is a comfort though that no body knows i am a puppy in this respect but myself  here was i fancying that all the partiality i felt for poor hortensia marchmont proceeded from my friendship for her father  when upon an honest examination into my own heart  i find it principally arises from my regard for herself  i was in hopes a change of objects would have driven the baggage out of my thoughts  and i went to france  but i am come home with a settled resolution of asking her to marry a slovenly rascal of fifty who is to be sure a very likely swain for a young lady to fall in love with  but who knows  the most sensible women have sometimes strange tastes  and yet it must be a very strange taste that can possibly approve of my overtures  i will go cautiously to work however  and solicit her as for a friend of my own age and fortune  so that if she refuses me which is probable enough  i shall not expose myself to her contempt  what a ridiculous figure is an old fool sighing at the feet of a young woman  zounds i wonder how the greyheaded dotards have the impudence to ask a blooming girl of twenty to throw herself away upon a moving mummy or a walking skeleton  exit the scene changes to an apartment in lady bettys house enter lady betty and mrs harley lady betty you cannot think emmy how my spirits are agitated  i wonder what my lord can want with me   mrs harley well well try and collect yourself a little  he is just coming up  i must retire  courage my dear creature this once  and the days our own i warrant you  exit enter winworth bowing very low lady betty here he is  bless me what a flutter i am in   winworth your ladyships most obedient   lady betty will not your lordship be seated  he seems excessively confused   aside winworth i have taken the liberty madam  how she awes me now i am alone with her  aside lady betty my lord   winworth i say madam i have taken the liberty to    lady betty i beg my lord you will not consider an apology in the least    winworth your ladyship is extremely obliging  and yet i am fearful    lady betty i hope your lordship will consider me as a friend  and therefore lay aside this unnecessary ceremony   winworth i do consider you madam as a friend  as an inestimable friend  and i am this moment come to solicit you upon a subject of the utmost importance to my happiness   lady betty aside lord what is he going to say   winworth madam    lady betty i say my lord that you cannot speak to me on any subject of importance without engaging my greatest attention   winworth you honor me too much madam   lady betty not in the least my lord  for there is not a person in the world who wishes your happiness with greater cordiality   winworth you eternally oblige me madam  and i can now take courage to tell you that my happiness in a most material degree depends upon your ladyship   lady betty on me my lord  bless me   winworth yes madam on your ladyship   lady betty aside mrs harley was right and i shall sink with confusion   winworth it is on this business madam i have taken the liberty of requesting the present interview  and as i find your ladyship so generously ready    lady betty why my lord i must confess  i say i must acknowledge my lord  that if your happiness depends upon me  i should not be very much pleased to see you miserable   winworth your ladyship is benignity itself  but as i want words to express my sense of this obligation  i shall proceed at once to my request nor trespass upon your patience by an ineffectual compliment to your generosity   lady betty if you please my lord   winworth then madam my request is that i may have your consent    lady betty this is so sudden my lord  so unexpected   winworth why madam it is so  yet if i could but engage your acquiescence  i might still think of a double union on the day which makes my cousin happy    lady betty my lord  i really dont know how to answer  doesnt your lordship think this is rather precipitating matters   winworth no man madam can be too speedy in promoting his happiness  if therefore i might presume to hope for your concurrence  i woudnr altogether    lady betty my concurrence my lord  since it is so essentially necessary to your peace i cannot refuse any longer  your great merit will justify so immediate a compliance  and i shall stand excused of all    winworth then madam i dont despair of the ladys    lady betty my lord   winworth i know your ladyship can easily prevail upon her to overlook an immaterial punctilio and therefore    lady betty the lady my lord   winworth yes madam miss marchmont if she finds my addresses supported by your ladyship will in all probability be easily induced to receive them  and then your ladyship knows    lady betty miss marchmont my lord   winworth yes madam miss marchmont  since your final disapprobation of those hopes which i was once presumptuous enough to entertain of calling your ladyship mine the anguish of a rejected passion has rendered me inconceivably wretched and i see no way of mitigating the severity of my situation but in the esteem of this amiable woman who knows how tenderly i have been attached to you and whose goodness will induce her i am well convinced to alleviate as much as possible the greatness of my disappointment   lady betty your lordship is undoubtedly right in your opinion  and i am infinitely concerned to have been the involuntary cause of uneasiness to you  but miss marchmont my lord  she will merit your utmost    winworth i know she will madam  and it rejoices me to see you so highly pleased with my intention   lady betty o i am quite delighted with it   winworth i knew i should please you by it    lady betty you cannot imagine how you have pleased me   winworth how noble is this goodness  then madam i may expect your ladyship will be my advocate  the injustice which fortune has done miss marchmonts merit obliges me to act with a double degree of circumspection  for when virtue is unhappily plunged into difficulties it is entitled to an aditional share of veneration   lady betty aside how has my folly undone me   winworth i will not trespass any longer upon your ladyships leisure than just to observe that though i have solicited your friendship on this occasion i must nevertheless beg you will not be too much my friend  i know miss marchmont would make any sacrifice to oblige you  and if her gratitude should appear in the least concerned  this is a nice point my dear lady betty and i must not wound the peace of any persons bosom to recover the tranquillity of my own   exit enter mrs harley who speaks well my dear is it all over   lady betty it is all over indeed emmy   mrs harley but why that sorrowful tone  and melancholy countenance mustnt i wish you joy   lady betty o i am the most miserable woman in the world  would you believe it  the business of this interview was to request my interest in his favor with miss marchmont   mrs harley with miss marchmont  then there is not one atom of sincere affection in the universe   lady betty as to that i have reason to think his sentiments for me are as tender as ever   mrs harley he gives you a pretty proof of his tenderness truly when he asks your assistance to marry another woman   lady betty had you but seen his confusion    mrs harley he might well be confused when after courting you these three years he could think of another and that too at the very moment in which you were ready to oblige him   lady betty there has been a sort of fatality in the affair  and i am punished but too justly  the woman that wants candor where she is addressed by a man of merit wants a very essential virtue and she who can delight in the anxiety of a worthy mind is little to be pitied when she feels the sharpest stings of anxiety in her own   mrs harley but what do you intend to do with regard to this extraordinary request of lord winworth  will you really suffer him to marry miss march mont   lady betty why what can i do if it was improper for me before i knew any thing of his design in regard to miss marchmont to insinuate the least desire of hearing him again on the subject of his heart it is doubly improper now when i see he has turned his thoughts on another woman and when this woman besides is one of my most valuable friends   mrs harley well courage lady betty  we arent yet in a desperate situation  miss marchmont loves you  as herself  and woudnt i dare say accept the first man in the world if it gave you the least uneasiness  i will go to her therefore this very moment  tell her at once how the case is  and my life for it her obligations to you    lady betty stay emmy  i conjure you stay  and as you value my peace of mind be for ever silent on this subject  miss marchmont has no obligations to me  since our acquaintance i have been the only person obliged she has given me a power of serving the worthiest young creature in the world and so far has laid me under the greatest obligation   mrs harley why my dear    lady betty but suppose i could be mean enough to think an apartment in my house a place in my chariot a seat at my table and a little annuity in case of my decease were obligations when i continually enjoy such a happiness as her friendship and her company  do you think they are obligations which should make a woman of her fine sense reject the most amiable man existing especially in her circumstances where he has the additional recommendation of an elevated rank and an affluent fortune  this would be exacting interest with a witness for trifles and instead of having any little merit to claim from my behavior to her i should be the most inexorable of all usurers   mrs harley well but suppose miss marchmont should not like my lord   lady betty not like him  why will you suppose an impossibility   mrs harley but let us suppose it for argument sake   lady betty why i cannot say but it would please me above all things  for still emmy i am a woman and feel this unexpected misfortune with the keenest sensibility  it kills me to think of his being anothers but if he must i would rather see him here is than any womans in the universe  but i will talk no more upon this subject till i acquaint her with his proposal and yet emmy how severe a trial must i go through   mrs harley ay and you most richly deserve it  exeunt end of the second act act iii scene lady bettys garden sir harry miss rivers and sally cross at the head of the stage colonel rivers observing them rivers in close conversation with sir harry this half hour at the remotest part of the garden  why what am i to think of all this  doesnt she know i have refused him  doesnt she know herself engaged to sidney  there is something mean and pitiful in suspicion  but still there is something that alarms me in this affair and who knows how far the happiness of my child may be at stake  women after all are strange things  they have more sense than we generally allow them  but they have also more vanity  tisnt for want of understanding they err  but through an insatiable love of slattery  they know very well when they are committing a fault but destruction wears so bewitching a form that they rebel against the sense of their own conviction  and never trouble themselves about consequences till they are actully undone  but here they come  i dont like this listening  yet the meanness of the action must for once be justified by the necessity   retires behind a clump of trees enter miss rivers sir harry and sally miss rivers indeed sir harry you upbraid me very unjustly  i feel the refusal which my father has given you severely  nevertheless i must not consent to you proposal  an elopement would i am sure break his heart  and as he is wholly ignorant of my partiality for you  i cannot accuse him of unkindness   rivers behind so so so so   sir harry why then my dear miss rivers woudnt you give me leave to mention the prepossession with which you honor me to the old gentleman   rivers the old gentleman    miss rivers because i was in hopes my father would have listened to your application without putting me to the painful necessity of acknowledging my sentiments in your favor and because i feared that unless the application was approved on account of it is intrinsic generosity there was nothing which could possibly work upon the firmness of his temper   rivers well said daughter   sally the firmness of your fathers temper madam  the obstinacy you should say  sir harry as i live and breathe there isnt so obstinate so perverse and so peevish an old devil in all england   rivers thank you mrs sally   miss rivers sally i insist that when you speak of my father you always speak of him with respect  tisnt your knowledge of secrets which shall justify these freedoms  for i would rather every thing was discovered this minute than hear him mentioned with so impudent a similiarity by his servants   sally well madam i beg pardon  but you know the colonel where he once determines is never to be altered  so that call this steadiness of temper by what name you please  it is likely to make you miserable unless you embrace the present opportunity and go off like a woman of spirit with the object of your affections   rivers what a damned jade it is   sir harry indeed my dear miss rivers sally advises you like a true friend  and i am satisfied your own good sense must secretly argue on her side the question  the only alternative you have is to fly and be happy  or stay and be miserable  you have yourself acknowledged my ever adorable    rivers o damn your adorables   sir harry i say madam you have yourself acknowledged that there is no hope whatsoever of working upon the colonels tenderness by acquainting him with our mutual affection  on the contrary it is likely that had he the least suspicion of my being honored with your regard he would drag you instantly to his favorite sidney who is so utterly insensible of your merit  and who if he has a passion for any body is i am confident devoted to miss marchmont   rivers why what a lie has the rascal trumpd up here against poor sidney   miss rivers dear sir harry what would you have me do   rivers there  her dear sir harry   sir harry my ever adorable miss rivers    rivers no she cannot stand these ever adorables   sir harry this excess of filial affection is extremely amiable  but it ought by no means to render you forgetful of what is due to yourself  consider madam if you have been treated with tenderness you have repaid that tenderness with duty and have so far discharged this mighty obligation   rivers a pretty method of settling accounts truly   miss rivers dont my dear sir harry speak in this negligent manner of my father   rivers kind creature   sir harry from what i have urged you must see madam that though you are so ready to sacrifice your peace for your father he sets a greater value upon a trifing promise than upon your happiness  judge therefore whether his repose should be dearer to you than your own and judge too whether to prevent the breach of his word you should vow eternal tenderness to a man you must eternally detest and violate even your veracity to kill the object of your love   miss rivers good heaven what shall i do   sally do  madam  go off to be sure   rivers i will wring that husseys head off   sir harry on my knees madam let me beg you will consult your own happiness and in your own the happiness of your father   rivers ay now he kneels it is all over   sir harry the colonel madam has great sensibility and the consciousness that he himself has been the cause of your unhappiness will sill him with endless regret  whereas by escaping with me the case will be utterly otherwise  when he sees we are inseparably united and hears with how unabating an assiduity i labor to merit the blessing of your hand a little time will necessarily make us friends and i have great hopes that before the end of three months we shall be the favorites of the whole family   rivers you will be cursedly mistaken though    sir harry but speak my dear miss rivers  speak and pronounce my fate   miss rivers sir harry you have convinced me    rivers ay i knew he would    miss rivers and provided you here give me a solemn assurance that the moment we are married you will employ every possible method of effecting a reconciliation    sir harry you consent to go off with me the first opportunity  a thousand thanks my angel for this generous condescension  and when    miss rivers there is no occasion for professions sir harry  i rely implicitly on your tenderness and your honor    sally dear madam you have transported your poor sally by this noble resolution   rivers i dare say she has  but i may chance to cool your transport in a horsepond    miss rivers i am obliged to you sally for the part you take in my affairs and i purpose that you shall be the companion of my flight   sally shall i madam  you are too good  and i am sure i shoudnt like to live in my old masters house when you are out of the family   rivers dont be uneasy on that account   sir harry suffer me now my dear miss rivers since you have been thus generously kind to inform you that a coach and six will be ready punctually at twelve at the side of the little paddock at the back of lady bettys garden  there is a close walk you know from the garden to the place and i will meet you at the spot to conduct you to the coach   miss rivers well i am strangely apprehensive  but i will be there  however it is now high time for us to separate  my fathers eyes are generally every where  and i am impatient since it is determined  till our design is executed   rivers o i dont in the least doubt it    sir harry till twelve then farewell my charmer    miss rivers you do what you will with me    exeunt separately rivers comes forward you do what you will with me why what a fool what an idiot was i  ever to suppose i had a daughter  from the moment of her birth  to this cursed hour i have labored i have toiled for happiness and now when i fancied myself sure of her tenderest affection she casts me off for ever  by and by  i shall have this fellow at my feet entreating my forgiveness and the world will think me an unfeeling monster if i dont give him my estate as a reward for having blasted my dearest expectations  the world will think it strange that i should not promote his felicity because he has utterly destroyed mine and my dutiful daughter will be surprised if the tender ties of nature are not strictly regarded in my conduct though she has violated the most sacred of them all in her own  death and hell who would be a father  there is yet one way left  and if that fails  why i never had a daughter    exit the scene changes to an apartment enter miss marchmont and cecil miss marchmont nay now sir i must tax you with unkindness  know something that may possibly be of consequence to my welfare  and yet decline to tell me  is this consistent with the usual friendship which i have met with from mr cecil   cecil lookye hortensia it is because i set a very great value on your esteem that i find this unwillingness to explain myself   miss marchmont indeed sir you grow every moment more and more mysterious    cecil well then hortensia if i thought you woudnt be offended  i    miss marchmont i am sure sir you will never say any thing to give me a reasonable cause of offense  i know your kindness for me too well sir    cecil where is the need of sirring me at every word  i desire you will lay aside this ceremony and treat me with the same freedom you do every body else  these sirs are so cold and so distant    miss marchmont indeed sir i cannot so easily lay aside my respect as you imagine for i have long considered you as a father   cecil as a father  but that is a light in which i dont want to be considered  as a father indeed  o she is likely to think me a proper husband for her i can see that already   aside miss marchmont why not sir  your years  your friendship for my father and your partiality for me sufficiently justify the propriety of my epithet    cecil aside my years  yes i thought my years would be an invincible obstacle   miss marchmont but pray sir  to the business upon which you wanted to speak with me  you dont consider i am all this time upon the rack of my sexs curiosity    cecil why then hortensia  i will proceed to the business  and ask you in one word  if you have any disinclination to be married   miss marchmont this is proceeding to business indeed sir  but ha  ha  ha pray who have you designed me as a husband   cecil why what do you think of a man about my age   miss marchmont of your age sir   cecil yes of my age    miss marchmont why sir what would you advise me to think of him   cecil that isnt the question for all your arch significance of manner madam   miss marhmont o i am sure you would never recommend him to me as a husband sir   cecil  so  and why not pray   miss marchmont because i am sure you have too great a regard for me   cecil she gives me rare encouragement aside  but do you imagine it impossible for such a husband to love you very tenderly   miss marchmont no  sir  but do you imagine it possible for me to love him very tenderly  you see i have caught your own frankness sir  and answer with as much ease as you question me   cecil aside how lucky it was that i did not open myself directly to her  o i should have been most purely contemptible   miss marchmont but pray sir  have you in reality any meaning by these questions  is there actually any body who has spoken to you on my account   cecil hortensia there is a fellow a very foolish fellow for whom i have some value that entertains the sincerest affection for you   miss marchmont then indeed sir i am very unhappy  for i cannot encourage the addresses of any body   cecil no   miss marchmont o sir i had but two friends in the world  yourself and lady betty  and i am with justice apprehensive that neither will consider me long with any degree of regard  lady betty has a proposal from lord winworth of the same nature with yours in which i fear she will strongly interest herself  and i must be under the painful necessity of disobliging you both from an utter impossibility of listening to either of your recommendations   cecil i tell you hortensia not to alarm yourself   miss marchmont dear sir i have always considered you with reverence and it would make me inconceivably wretched if you imagined i was actuated upon this occasion by any ridiculous singularity of sentiment  i would do much to please you  and i scarcely know what i should refuse to lady bettys request  but sir though it distresses me exceedingly to discover it  i must tell you i have not a heart to dispose of   cecil how is this   miss marchmont at the same time i must however tell you that my affections are so placed as to make it wholly impossible for me ever to change my situation  this acknowledgment of a prepossession sir may be inconsistent with the nice reserve which is proper for my sex  but it is necessary to justify me in a case where my gratitude might be reasonably suspected and when i recollect to whom it is made i hope it will be doubly entitled to an excuse   cecil your candor hortensia needs no apology  but as you have trusted me thus far with your secret  may not i know why you can have no prospect of being united to the object of your affections   miss marchmont because sir he is engaged to a most deserving young lady and will be married to her in a few days  in short mr sidney is the man for whom i entertain this secret partiality  you see therefore that my partiality is hopeless  but you see at the same time how utterly improper it would be for me to give a lifeless hand to another while he is entirely master of my affections  it would be a meanness of which i think myself incapable and i should be quite unworthy the honor of any deserving hand if circumstancd in this manner i could basely stoop to accept it   cecil you interest me strangely in your story hortensia  but has sidney any idea    miss marchmont none in the least  before the match with miss rivers was in agitation he made addresses to me though privately and i must own his tenderness joined to his good qualities soon gave me impressions in his favor  but sir i was a poor orphan wholly dependant upon the generosity of others and he was a younger brother of a family great in his birth but contracted in his circumstances  what could i do  it was not in my power to make his fortune  and i had too much pride or too much affection to think of destroying it   cecil you are a good girl  a very good girl  but surely if lady betty knows any thing of this matter there can be no danger of her recommending lord winworth so earnestly to your attention    miss marchmont there sir is my principle misfortune  lady betty is of all persons the least proper to be made acquainted with it  her heart is in the marriage between miss rivers and mr sidney and had she the least idea of my sentitiments for him or of his inclination for me i am positive it would immediately frustrate the match  on this account sir i have carefully concealed the secret of my wishes  and on this account i must still continue to conceal it  my heart shall break before it shall be worthless  and i should detest myself for ever if i was capable of establishing my own peace at the expense of my benefactresss first wish and the desire of her whole family   cecil zounds what can be the matter with my eyes    miss marchmont my life was marked out early by calamity  and the first light i beheld was purchased with the loss of a mother  the grave snatched away the best of fathers just as i came to know the value of such a blessing  and hadnt it been for the exalted goodness of others i who once experienced the unspeakable pleasure of relieving the necessitous had myself perhaps felt the immediate want of bread  and shall i ungratefully sting the bosom which has thus benevolently cherished me  shall i basely wound the peace of those who have rescued me from despair  and stab at their tranquillity in the very moment they honor me with protection  o mr cecil they deserve every sacrifice which i can make  may the benignant hand of providence shower endless happiness upon their heads and may the sweets of a stillencreasing felicity be their portion whatever becomes of me   cecil hortensia  i cannot stay with you  my eyes are exceedingly painful of late  what the devil can be the matter with them  but let me tell you before i go that you shall be happy after all  that you shall i promise you  but i see lady betty coming this way  and i cannot enter into explanations  yet do you hear  dont suppose i am angry with you for refusing my friend  dont suppose such a thing i charge you  for he has too much pride to force himself upon any woman and too much humanity to make any woman miserable  he is besides a very foolish fellow and it doesnt signify    exit enter lady betty lady betty well my dear hortensia i am come again to ask you what you think of lord winworth  we were interrupted before  and i want as soon as possible for the reason i hinted to know your real opinion of him   miss marchmont you have long known my real opinion of him lady betty  you know i always thought him a very amiable man   lady betty with impatience do you think him an amiable man   miss marchmont the whole world thinks as i do in this respect  yet    lady betty ay she loves him it is plain and there is no hope after this declaration  aside  his lordship merits your good opinion i assure you miss marchmont   miss marchmont aside yes i see by this ceremony that she is offended at my coolness to the proposal   lady betty i have hinted to you miss marchmont that my lord requested i would exert my little interest with you in his favor   miss marchmont the little interest your ladyship has with me  the little interest   lady betty dont be displeased with me my dear hortensia  i know my interest with you is considerable  i know you love me   miss marchmont i would sacrifice my life for you lady betty for what had that life been without your generosity    lady betty if you love me hortensia never mention any thing of this nature   miss marchmont you are too good    lady betty but to my lord winworth  he has earnestly requested i would become his advocate with you  he has entirely got the better of his former attachments and there can be no doubt of his making you an excellent husband   miss marchmont his lordship does me infinite honor  nevertheless    lady betty eagerly nevertheless what my dear   miss marchmont i say notwithstanding i think myself highly honored by his sentiments in my favor  it is utterly impossible for me to return his affection   lady betty surprized impossible for you to return his affection   miss marchmont aside i knew what an interest she would take in this affair   lady betty and do you really say you cannot give him a favorable answer  how fortunate   aside miss marchmont i do my dear lady betty  i can honor i can reverence him  but i cannot feel that tenderness for his person which i imagine to be necessary both for his happiness and my own   lady betty upon my word my dear you are extremely difficult in your choice and if lord winworth is not capable of inspiring you with tenderness  i dont know who is likely to succeed for in my opinion there is not a man in england possessed of more personal accomplishments   miss marchmont and yet great as these accomplishments are my dear lady betty they never excited your tenness    lady betty why all this is very true my dear  but though i felt no tenderness  yet i  to be sure i  that is  i say nevertheless  this is beyond my hopes   aside miss marchmont aside she is distressed that i decline the proposal  her friendship for us both is generously warm  and she imagines i am equally insensible to his merit and my own interest   lady betty well my dear i see your emotion  and i heartily beg your pardon for saying so much  i should be inexpressibly concerned if i thought you made any sacrifice on this occasion to me  my lord to be sure possesses a very high place in my esteem  but    miss marchmont dear lady betty what can i do  i see you are offended with me  and yet    lady betty i offended with you my dear  far from it i commend your resolution extremely since my lord is not a man to your taste  offended with you why should i take the liberty to be offended with you  a presumption of that nature    miss marchmont indeed lady betty this affair makes me very unhappy   lady betty indeed my dear you talk very strangely  so far from being sorry that you have refused my lord  i am pleased  infinitely pleased  that is since he was not agreeable to you  be satisfied your acceptance of him would have given me no pleasure in the world  i assure you it woudnt  on the contrary as matters are situated i woudnt for the world have you give him the smallest encouragement   exit miss marchmont alone i see she is greatly disappointed at my refusal of an offer so highly to my advantage  i see moreover she is grieved that his lordship should meet with a second repulse and from a quarter too where the generosity of his proposal might be reasonably expected to promise it success  how surpised she seemed when i told her he coudnt make an impression on my heart and how eagerly she endeavored to convince me that she was pleased with my conduct not considering that this very eagerness was a manifest proof of her dissatisfaction  she is more interested in this affair than i even thought she would be  and i should be completely miserable if she could suspect me of ingratitude  as she was so zealous for the match i was certainly to blame in declining it  it is not yet however too late  she has been a thousand parents to me  and i will not regard my own wishes when they are any way opposite to her inclinations  poor mr cecil  make me happy after all  how  impossible  for i was born to nothing but misfortune    exit end of the third act act iv scene an apartment at lady bettys house enter lady betty and mrs harley lady betty thus far my dear emmy there is a gleam of hope  she determined positively determined against my lord  and even suspected so little of my partiality for him that she appeared under the greatest anxiety lest i should be offended with her refusing him  and yet shall i own my folly to you   mrs harley pray do my dear  you will scarcely believe it  but i have follies of my own sometimes   lady betty why you quite surprise me   mrs harley it is very true for all that  but to your business   lady betty why then greatly as i dreaded her approbation of the proposal  i was secretly hurt at her insensibility to the personal attractions of his lordship   mrs harley i dont doubt it my dear  we think all the world should love what we are in love with ourselves   lady betty your are right  and though i was happy to find her resolution so agreeable to my wishes my pride was not a little piqud to find it possible for her to refuse a man upon whom i had so ardently placed my own affection  the surprise which i felt on this account threw a warmth into my expressions and made the generous girl apprehensive that i was offended with her   mrs harley well this is a strange world we live in  that a woman without a shilling should refuse an earl with a fine person and a great estate is the most surprising affair i ever heard of  perhaps lady betty my lord may take it in his head to go round the family  if he should my turn is next and i assure you he shall meet with a very different reception   lady betty then you woudnt be cruel emmy   mrs harley why no  not very cruel  i might give myself a few airs at first  i might blush a little and look down  wonder what he could find in me to attract his attention  then pulling up my head with a toss of disdain  desire him if ever he spoke to me on that subject again    lady betty well   mrs harley to have a license in his pocket  that is all  i would make sure work of it at once and leave it to your elevated minds to deal in delicate absurdities  but i have a little anecdote for you which proves beyond a doubt that you are as much as ever in possession of lord winworths affection   lady betty what is it my dear emmy   mrs harley why about an hour ago my woman it seems and arnold my lords man had a little conversation on this unexpected proposal to miss marchmont in which arnold said  never tell me of your miss marchmonts mrs nelson  between ourselves  but let it go no farther  lady betty is still the woman and a sweet creature she is that is the truth on it but a little fantastical and does not know her own mind    lady betty i will assure you  why mr arnold is a wit   mrs harley well but hear him out  mrs nelson i know as much of my lords mind as any body let him mary whom he pleases he will never be rightly happy but with her ladyship and i would give a hundred guineas with all my soul that it could be a match  these nelson tells me were his very words  arnold is an intelligent fellow and much in the confidence of his master   lady betty indeed i always thought my lord happy in so excellent a servant  this intelligence is worth a world my dear emmy    enter miss marchmont miss marchmont i have been looking for your ladyship   lady betty have you any thing particular my dear hortensia  but why that gloom upon your features  what gives you uneasiness my sweet girl speak and make me happy by saying it is in my power to oblige you   miss marchmont it is in your power my dear lady betty to oblige me highly  by forgiving the ungrateful disregard which i just now showed to your recommendation of lord winworth   mrs harley aside now will i be hanged if she does not undo every thing by a fresh stroke of delicacy   lady betty my dear   miss marchmont and by informing his lordship that i am ready to pay a proper obedience to your commands   mrs harley aside o the devil take this elevation of sentiment   lady betty a proper obedience to my commands my dear i really dont understand you   miss marchmont i see how generously you are concerned for fear i should upon this occasion offer violence to my inclination  but lady betty i should be infinitely more distressed by the smallest act of ingratitude to you than by any other misfortune  i am therefore ready in obedience to your wishes to accept of his lordship and if i cannot make him a fond wife i will at least make him a dutiful one   mrs harley aside now her delicacy is willing to be miserable   lady betty how could you ever imagine my dear hortensia that your rejection of lord winworth could possibly give me the smallest offense  i have a great regard for his lordship it is true but i have a great regard for you also and would by no means wish to see his happiness promoted at your expense  think of him therefore no more and be assured you oblige me in an infinitely higher degree by refusing than accepting him   miss marchmont the more i see your ladyships tenderness and delicacy the more i see it necessary to give an affirmative to lord winworths proposal  your generosity must not get the better of my gratitude   mrs harley did ever two fools plague one another so heartily with their delicacy and sentiment  aside dear lady betty why dont you deal heartily with her    lady betty her happiness makes it necessary now and i will   mrs harley ay there is some sense in this    lady betty your uncommon generosity my dear hortensia has led you into an error    miss marchmont not in the least lady betty   lady betty still hortensia you are running into very great mistakes  my esteem for lord winworth let me now tell you    enter winworth winworth ladies your most obedient  as i entered lady betty i heard you pronounce my name  may i presume to ask if you were talking to miss marchmont on the business i took the liberty of communicating to you this morning   mrs harley aside ay now it is all over i see   lady betty why to be candid my lord i have mentioned your proposal    winworth well my dear miss marchmont and may i flatter myself that lady bettys interposition will induce you to be propitious to my hopes  the heart now offered to you madam is a grateful one and will retain an eternal sense of your goodness  speak therefore my dear miss marchmont and kindly say you condescend to accept it   mrs harley aside so  here will be a comfortable piece of work  i will even retire and leave them to the consequences of their ridiculous delicacy  exit miss marchmont i know not what to say my lord  you have honored me greatly honored me  but lady betty will acquaint you with my determination    lady betty i acquaint him my dear  surely you are yourself the most proper to  i shall run distracted   aside miss marchmont indeed madam i cannot speak to his lordship on this subject   lady betty and i assure you hortensia it is a subject upon which i do not choose to enter   lord winworth if you had a kind answer from miss marchmont lady betty i am sure you would enter upon it readily  but i see her reply very clearly in your reluctance to acquaint me with it    miss marchmont why madam will you force me to    lady betty and why hortensia  what am i going to say   aside lord winworth dont my dear ladies suffer me to distress you any longer  to your friendship madam i am as much indebted addressing himself to lady betty as if i had been successful  and i sincerely wish miss marchmont that happiness with a more deserving man which i find it impossible for her to confer on me  going lady betty aside now i have some hope    miss marchmont my lord i entreat your stay    lady betty dont call his lordship back my dear it will have an odd appearance   enter lord winworth miss marchmont he is come back  and i must tell him what your unwillingness to influence my inclinations makes you decline   lord winworth your commands madam    lady betty aside now i am undone again   miss marchmont i am in such a situation my lord that i can scarcely proceed  lady betty is cruelly kind to me  but as i know her wishes    lady betty my wishes miss marchmont  indeed my dear there is such a mistake    miss marchmont there is no mistaking your ladyships goodness you are fearful to direct my resolution and i should be unkind to distress your friendship any longer   lady betty you do distress me indeed miss marchmont  half aside and sighing lord winworth i am all expectation madam    miss marchmont i am compelled by gratitude to both and from affection to my dear lady betty to break through the common forms imposed on our sex and to declare that i have no will but her ladyships   lady betty this is so provoking  aside lord winworth ten thousand thanks for this condescending goodness madam  a goodness which is additionally dear to me as the result of your determination is pronounced by your own lips   miss marchmont well lady betty i hope i have answered your wishes now   lady betty you cannot conceive how sensibly i am touched with your behavior my dear  sighs miss marchmont you feel too much for me lady betty    lady betty why i do feel something my dear  this unexpected event has filled my heart  and i am a little agitated  but come my dear let us now go to the company   miss marchmont how generously madam do you interest yourself for my welfare   lord winworth and for the welfare of all her friends   lady betty your lordship is too good    lord winworth but the business of her life is to promote the happiness of others and she is constantly rewarded in the exercise of her own benignity   lady betty you cannot imagine how i am rewarded upon the present occasion i assure your lordship  exeunt scene the paddock behind lady bettys garden enter miss rivers and sally sally dear madam dont terrify yourself with such gloomy reflections   miss rivers o sally you cannot conceive my distress in this critical situation  an elopement even from a tyrannical father has something in it which must shock a delicate mind  but when a woman flies from the protection of a parent who merits the utmost return of her affection she must be insensible indeed if she does not feel the sincerest regret  if he shoudnt forgive me    sally dear madam he must forgive you  arent you his child    miss rivers and therefore i shoudnt disoblige him  i am half distracted  and i almost repent the promise i gave sir harry  when i consider how much my character may be lessened by this step and recollect how it is likely to affect my unfortunate father    sally but i wonder where sir harry can be all this time    miss rivers i wish he was come    sally courage madam  i hear him coming   miss rivers it must be he let us run and meet him    enter rivers sally shrieks and runs off miss rivers my father   rivers yes theodora  your poor abandoned miserable father   miss rivers oh sir    rivers little theodora did i imagine i should ever have cause to lament the hour of your birth and less did i imagine when you arrived at an age to be perfectly acquainted with your duty you would throwevery sentiment of duty off  in what my dear has your unhappy father been culpable that you cannot bear his society any longer  what has he done to forfeit either your esteem or your affection  from the moment of your birth to this unfortunate hour he has labored to promote your happiness  but how has his solicitude on that account been rewarded you now fly from these arms which have cherished you with so much tenderness when gratitude generosity and nature should have twined me round your heart    miss rivers dear sir   rivers look back infatuated child upon my whole conduct since your approach to maturity havnt i contracted my own enjoyments on purpose to enlarge yours and watched your very looks to anticipate your inclinations have i ever with the obstinacy of other fathers been partial in favor of any man to whom you made the slightest objection  or have i ever shown the least design of forcing your wishes to my own humor or caprice on the contrary hasnt the engagement i have entered into been carried on seemingly with your own approbation  and havnt you always appeared reconciled at least to a marriage with mr sidney   miss rivers i am so ashamed of myself   rivers how then theodora have i merited a treatment of this nature you have understanding my dear though you want filial affection and my arguments must have weight with your reason however my tranquillity may be the object of your contempt  i loved you theodora with the warmest degree of paternal tenderness and flattered myself the proofs i every day gave of that tenderness had made my peace of mind a matter of some importance to my child  but alas a paltry compliment from a coxcomb undoes the whole labor of my life and the daughter whom i looked upon as the support of my declining years betrays me in the unsuspecting hour of security and rewards with her person the assassin who stabs me to the heart    miss rivers hear me dear sir hear me    rivers i do not come here theodora to stop your flight or put the smallest impediment in the way of your wishes  your person is your own and i scorn to detain even my daughter by force where she is not bound to me by inclination  since therefore neither duty nor discretion a regard for my peace nor a solicitude for your own welfare are able to detain you  go to this man who has taught you to obliterate the sentiments of nature and gained a ready way to your heart by expressing a contempt for your father  go to him boldly my child and laugh at the pangs which tear this unhappy bosom  be uniformly culpable nor add the baseness of a despicable slight to the unpardonable want of a filial affection   going miss rivers i am the most miserable creature in the world    rivers returns one thing more theodora  and then farewell for ever  though you come here to throw off the affection of a child i will not quit this place before i discharge the duty of a parent even to a romantic extravagance and provide for your welfare while you plunge me into the most poignant of all distress  in the doting hours of paternal blandishment i have often promised you a fortune of twenty thousand pounds whenever you changed your situation  this promise was indeed made when i thought you incapable either of ingratitude or dissimulation  and when i fancied your person would be given where there was some reasonable prospect of your happiness  but still it was a promise and shall be faithfully discharged  here then in this pocketbook are notes for that sum miss rivers shows an unwillingness to receive the pocketbook  take it  but never see me more  banish my name eternally from your remembrance  and when a little time shall remove me from a world which your conduct has rendered insupportable boast an additional title my dear to your husbands regard by having shortened the life of your miserable father    exit enter sally sally what madam is he gone   miss rivers how could i be such a monster  such an unnatural monster as ever to think of leaving him  but come sally let us go into the house    sally go into the house madam  why arent we to go off with sir harry    miss rivers this insensible creature has been my confident too  o i shall eternally detest myself    enter sir harry and cecil sir harry i beg a thousand pardons my dear miss rivers for detaining you  an unforeseen accident prevented me from being punctual  but the carriage is now ready and a few hours will whirl us to the summit of felicity  my cousin cecil is kindly here to assist us  and    miss rivers sir harry i can never forsake my father    sir harry madam   miss rivers by some accident he discovered our design and came to this spot while i was trembling with expectation of your appearance    sir harry well my dear creature    miss rivers here in a melancholy but resolute voice he expatiated on the infamy of my intended slight and mentioned my want of affection for him in terms that pierced my very soul  having done this he took an abrupt leave and scorning to detain me by force forsook me to the course of my own inclinations   sir harry well my angel and since he has left you to follow your own inclinations you will not surely hesitate to    miss rivers sir harry unloose my hand  the universe woudnt bribe me now to go off with you  o sir harry if you regarded your own peace you would cease this importunity  for is it possible that a woman can make a valuable wife who has proved an unnatural daughter   sir harry but consider your own happiness my dear miss rivers    miss rivers my own happiness sir harry  what a wretch must the woman be who can dream of happiness while she wounds the bosom of a father   cecil what a noble girl  i shall love her myself for her sense and her goodness   sally aside to sir harry she will not consent i know sir harry  so if the coach is at hand it will be the best way to carry her off directly   sir harry then my dear miss rivers there is no hope    miss rivers sir harry i must not hear you  this parting is a kind of death    sir harry part madam  by all that is gracious we must not part  my whole soul is unalterably fixed upon you  and since  neither tenderness for yourself nor affection for me persuade you to the only measure which can promote our mutual felicity you must forgive the despair that forces you from hence and commits a momentary disrespect to avoid a lasting unhappiness   miss rivers hear me sir harry  i conjure you hear me   sir harry let me but remove you from this place madam and i will hear every thing  cecil assist me   miss rivers o mr cecil i rely upon your honor to save and protect me   cecil and it shall madam  for shame kinsman unhand the lady   sir harry unhand her what do you mean cecil   cecil what do i mean i mean to protect the lady  what should a man of honor mean   miss rivers breaking from sir harry dear mr cecil dont let him follow me   she runs off sally following i will give her warning this moment that is the short and the long of it   exit sir harry mr cecil this is no time for trisling  did not you come here to assist me in carrying the lady off   cecil with her own inclinations kinsman  but as they are now on the other side of the question so am i too  you must not follow her sir harry    sir harry zounds but i will   cecil zounds but you shall not  lookye harry i came here to assist the purposes of a man of honor not to abet the violence of a russian  your friends of the world your fashionable friends may if they please support one anothers vices but i am a friend only to the virtues of a man and where i sincerely esteem him i always endeavor to make him honest in spite of his teeth   sir harry an injury like this    cecil harry  harry  dont advance  i am not to be terrified you know from the support of what is just  and though you may think it very brave to sight in the defense of a bad action it will do but little credit either to your understanding or your humanity   sir harry dear cecil there is no answering that  your justice and your generosity overpower me  you have restored me to myself  it was mean it was unmanly it was infamous to think of using force  but i was distracted  nay i am distracted now and must entirely rely upon your assistance to recover her   cecil as far as i can act with honesty harry you may depend upon me  but let me have no more violence i beg of you   sir harry dont mention it cecil  i am heartily ashamed    cecil and i am heartily glad of it    sir harry pray let us go to my house and consult a little  what a contemptible figure do i make    cecil why pretty well i think but to be less so put up your sword harry    sir harry she never can forgive me   cecil if she does she will scarcely deserve to be forgiven herself   sir harry dont cecil it is ungenerous to be so hard upon me  i own my faults and you should encourage me for every coxcomb has not so much modesty   cecil why so i will harry for modesty i see as yet sits upon you but very aukwardly   exeunt end of the fourth act act v scene an apartment at lady bettys enter rivers and sidney sidney i am deeply sensible of miss riverss very great merit sir  but    rivers but what sir    sidney hear me with temper i beseech you colonel   rivers hear you with temper  i dont know whether i shall be able to hear you with temper  but go on sir    sidney miss rivers independent of her very affluent fortune colonel has beauty and merit which would make her alliance a very great honor to the first family in the kingdom  but notwithstanding my admiration of her beauty and my reverence for her merit i find it utterly impossible to prosit either by her goodness or your generosity   rivers how is all this sir do you decline a marriage with my daughter   sidney a marriage with miss rivers sir was once the object of my highest ambition and had i been honored with her hand i should have studied to show my sensibility of a blessing so invaluble  but at that time i did not suppose my happiness to be incompatible with here is  i am now convinced that is so and it becomes me much better to give up my own hopes than to offer the smallest violence to her inclinations   rivers death and hell sir  what do you mean by this behavior  shall i prefer your alliance to any mans in england  shall my daughter even express a readiness to marry you  and shall you after this insolently tell me you dont choose to accept her    sidney dear colonel you totally misconceive my motive  and i am sure upon reflection you will rather approve than condemn it  a man of common humanity sir in a treaty of marriage should consult the ladys wishes as well as his own and if he cannot make her happy he will scorn to make her miserable   rivers scorn to make her miserable  why the fellows mad i believe  doesnt the girl absolutely consent to have you  would you have her drag you to the altar by force  would you have her fall at your feet and beg of you with tears to pity one of the finest women with one of the best fortunes in england   sidney your vehemence sir prevents you from considering this matter in a proper light  miss rivers is sufficiently unhappy in losing the man of her heart but her distress must be greatly aggravated if in the moment she is most keenly sensible of this loss she is compelled to marry another  besides colonel i must have my seelings too  there is something shocking in a union with a woman whose affections we know to be alienated and it is difficult to say which is most entitled to contempt he that stoops to accept of a preengaged mind or he that puts up with a prostituted person   rivers mighty well sir  mighty well but let me tell you mr sidney  that under this specious appearance of generosity i can easily see your your motive for this refusal of my daughter  let me tell you i can easily see your motive sir  and let me tell you that the person who is in possession of your affections shall no longer find an asylum in this house   sidney colonel if i had not been always accustomed to respect you  and if i did not even consider this insult as a kind of compliment i dont know how i should put up with it as to your insinuation you must be more explicit before i can understand you   rivers miss marchmont  sir  do you understand me now sir if miss marchmont had not been in the case my daughter had not received this insult  sir harry was right and had not i been ridiculously besotted with your hypocritical plausibility i might have seen it sooner but your cousin shall know of your behavior and then sir you shall answer me as a man   sidney miss marchmont colonel is greatly above this illiberal reflection as for myself i shall be always ready to justify an action which i know to be right though i should be sorry ever to meet you but in the character of a friend   exit rivers alone well  well  well  but it does not signify  it does not signify  it does not signify  i will not put myself in a passion about it i will not put myself in a passion about it i will tear the fellow piecemeal  zounds i dont know what i will do   exit enter mrs harley and cecil cecil why this is better and better   mrs harley what a violent passion he is in   cecil this is the very thing i could wish  twill advance a principal part of our project rarely  well isnt sidney a noble young fellow and doesnt he richly deserve the regard which my poor little girl entertains for him   mrs harley why really i think he does  but how secretly my lady sentimental carried matters  o i always said that your grave reflecting moralizing damsels  were a thousand times more susceptible of tender impressions than those lively open hearted girls who talk away at random and seem ready to run off with every man that happens to fall into their company   cecil i dont know widow but there may be some truth in this you see at least i have such a good opinion of a madcap that you are the first person i have made acquainted with the secret   mrs harley well and havnt i returned the compliment by letting you into my design about lady betty and lord winworth   cecil what a ridiculous bustle is there here about delicacy and stuff  your people of refined sentiments are the most troublesome creatures in the world to deal with and their friends must even commit a violence upon their nicety before they can condescend to study their own happiness  but have you done as we concerted   mrs harley yes i have pretended to lady betty that my lord desires to speak with her privately on business of the utmost importance and i have told his lordship that she wants to see him to disclose a secret that must entirely break off the intended marriage with miss marchmont   cecil what an awkward figure they must make each imagining that the other has desired the interview  and expecting every moment to be told something of consequence  but you have not given either the least hint of hortensias secret inclination for sidney   mrs harley how could you possibly suppose such a thing   cecil well well to your part of the business then while i find out the colonel and try what i can do with him for my rattlepated sir harry   mrs harley o never doubt my assiduity in an affair of this nature   exeunt enter lady betty in another apartment lady betty what can he want with me i wonder  speak with me again in private and upon business of the utmost importance he has spoken sufficiently to me already upon his business of importance to make me miserable for ever  but the fault is my own and i have nobody to blame but myself  bless me here he is   enter winworth winworth madam your most devoted i come in obedience to your commands to    lady betty my commands my lord   winworth yes madam your message has alarmed me prodigiously  and you cannot wonder if i am a little impatient for an explanation   lady betty impatient for an explanation my lord   winworth yes madam the affair is of the nearest concern to my happiness and the sooner you honor me with    lady betty honor you with what my lord   winworth my dear lady betty this reserve is unkind especially as you know how uneasy i must be till i hear from yourself    lady betty really my lord i am quite astonished  uneasy till you hear from myself  impatient for an explanation  i beg your lordship will tell me what is the meaning of all this   winworth surely madam you cannot so suddenly change your kind intentions    ledy betty my kind intentions my lord   winworth i would not madam be too presuming but as i know your ladyships goodness i flatter myself that    lady betty your lordship is all a mystery  i beg you will speak out  for upon my word i dont understand these half sentences    winworth why madam mrs harley has told me   lady betty with eagerness what has she told you my lord   winworth she has told me of the secret madam which you have to disclose that must entirely break off my marriage with miss marchmont   lady betty has she then betrayed my weakness    winworth madam i hope you will not think your generous intentions in my favor a weakness for be assured that the study of my whole life    lady betty i did not think that mrs harley could be capable of such an action  but since she has told you of the only circumstance which i ever wished to be concealed i cannot deny my partiality for your lordship   winworth madam    lady betty this secret was trusted with her and her alone but though she has ungenerously discovered it her end will still be disappointed i acknowledge that i prize your lordship above all the world  but even to obtain you i will not be guilty of a baseness nor promote my own happiness by any act of injustice to miss marchmont   winworth i am the most unfortunate man in the world  and does your ladyship really honor me with any degree of a tender partiality   lady betty this question is needless my lord after what mrs harley has acquainted you with   winworth mrs harley madam has not acquainted me with particulars of any nature    lady betty no   winworth no  and happy as this discovery would have made me at any other time it now distresses me beyond expression since the engagements i have just entered into with miss marchmont put it wholly out of my power to receive any benefit from the knowledge of your sentiments  o lady betty had you been generously candid when i solicited the blessing of your hand how much had i been indebted to your goodness but now think what my situation is when in the moment i am sensible of your regard i must give you up for ever   enter cecil and mrs harley from opposite places mrs harley repeating ludicrously who can behold such beauty and be silent cecil in the same accent desire first taught us words  mrs harley man when created wandered up and down cecil forlorn and silent as his vassal beasts mrs harley but when a heavenborn maid like you appeared cecil strange pleasure filled his eyes and seized his heart mrs harley unloosd his tongue cecil and his first talk was love  both ha ha ha winworth pray mr cecil what is the meaning of this whimsical behavior   lady betty the nature of this conduct mrs harley bears too strong a resemblance to a late disingenuity for me to wonder at   mrs harley what disingenuity my dear   lady betty why pray madam what secret had i to disclose to his lordship   mrs harley the secret which you have disclosed my dear    courtseying cecil i beg my lord that we may not interrupt your heroics when in the moment you are sensible of her regard  you must give her up for ever  a very moving speech mrs harley  i am sure it almost makes me cry to repeat it   winworth mr cecil listening is    mrs harley what are we going to have a quarrel    cecil o yes your lover is a mere nobody without a little bloodshed two or three duels give a wonderful addition to his character   lady betty why what is the meaning of all this   cecil you shall know in a moment madam  so walk in good people  walk in and see the most surprising pair of true lovers who have too much sense to be wise and too much delicacy to be happy   mrs harley walk in  walk in   enter rivers miss rivers miss marchmont sir harry and sidney lady betty o emmy is this behaving like a friend   mrs harley yes and like a true friend as you shall see presently    rivers my lord i give you joy joy heartily  we have been posted for some time under the direction of marshal cecil and general harley in the next room who have acquainted us with every thing and i feel the sincerest satisfaction to think the perplexities of today have so fortunate a conclusion   winworth the perplexities of today are not yet concluded colonel   miss marchmont o lady betty why would not you trust me with your secret i have been the innocent cause of great uneasiness to you and yet my conduct entirely proceeded from the greatness of my affection   lady betty i know it my dear  i know it well  but were you to give up lord winworth this moment  be assured that i would not accept of any sacrifice made at the expense of your happiness   cecil at the expense of her happiness  o is that all  come here master sobersides  to sidney and come here madam gravity  to miss marchmont come here i say  i suppose my lord i suppose lady betty that you already know from what very manly motives  sidney here has declined the marriage with miss rivers   winworth i do and though i lament the impossibility of a relation to the colonels family i cannot but admire his behavior on that occasion   lady betty and i think it extremely generous   mrs harley come cecil stand by a little you shall not have the whole management of this discovery   cecil did you ever see such a woman   mrs harley well my lord and lady betty since we have agreed thus far you must know that mr sidneys behavior has produced more good consequences than you can imagine  in the first place it has enabled colonel rivers without a breach of his word    cecil to give his daughter to my foolish kinsman   mrs harley you wont hold your tongue   cecil and in the next place it has enabled mr sidney    mrs harley to marry miss marchmont   cecil ay she will have the last word  for it seems that between these two turtles there has long subsisted    mrs harley a very tender affection    cecil the devils in her tongue  she has the speed of me   winworth what an unexpected felicity   lady betty i am all amazement   rivers well well my dear sister  no wondering about it  at a more convenient time you shall know particulars for the present let me tell you that now i am cool and that matters have been properly explained to me i am not only satisfied but charmed with mr sidneys behavior though it has prevented the first wish of my heart and i hope that his lordship and you by consenting to his marriage with miss marchmont will immediately remove every impediment in the way of your own happiness   winworth if my own happiness was not to be promoted by such a step i should instantly give my consent  and therefore my dear miss marchmont if i have lady bettys approbation and your own concurrence i here bestow this hand upon as deserving a young man as any in the universe  this is the only atonement i can make for the uneasiness i have given you and if your happiness is any way proportioned to your merit i need not wish you a greater share of felicity   sidney what shall i say my lord   winworth say nothing charles for if you only knew how exquisite a satisfaction i receive on this occasion you would rather envy my feelings than think yourself under an obligation  and now my dear lady betty if i might presume    lady betty that i may not be censured any longer i here declare my hand your lordships whenever you think proper to demand it for i am now convinced the greatest proof which a woman can give of her own worth is to entertain an affection for a man of honor and understanding   winworth this goodness madam is too great for acknowledgment   lady betty and now my dear theodora let me congratulate with you i rejoice that your inclinations are consulted in the most important circumstance of your life and i am sure sir harry will not be wanting in gratitude for the partiality which you have shown in his favor   miss rivers dear madam you oblige me infinitely   sir harry and as for me lady betty it is so much my inclination to deserve the partiality with which miss rivers has honored me as well as to repay the goodness of her family that i shall have little merit in my gratitude to either i have been wild i have been inconsiderate but i hope i never was despicable and i flatter myself i shall not be wanting in acknowledgment only to those who have laid me under the greatest of all obligations   rivers sir harry say no more  my girls repentance has been so noble your cousin cecils behavior has been so generous and i believe you after all to be a man of such principle  that next to sidney i dont know who i should prefer to you for a soninlaw  but you must think a little for the future and remember that it is a poor excuse for playing the fool to be possessed of a good understanding   winworth well there seems but one thing remaining undone  i just now took the liberty of exercising a fathers right over miss marchmont by disposing of her hand it is now necessary for me    cecil hold my lord  i guess what you are about but you shall not monopolize generosity i assure you  i have a right to show my friendship as well as your lordship so after your kinsmans marriage whatever you have a mind to do for him shall be equalled on my part for miss marchmont guinea for guinea as far as you will and let us see who tires first in going through with it   winworth a noble challange and i accept it   lady betty no there is no bearing this    miss marchmont speak to them mr sidney for i cannot    sidney i wish i had words to declare my sense of this goodness   rivers i did not look upon myself as a very pitiful fellow but i am strangely sunk in my own opinion since i have been a witness of this transaction   cecil why what the devil is there in all this to wonder at people of fortune often throw away thousands at the hazard table to make themselves miserable and nobody ever accuses them of generosity   winworth mr cecil is perfectly right and he is the best manager of a fortune who is most attentive to the wants of the deserving   mrs harley why now all is as it should be  all is as it should be  this is the triumph of good sense over delicacy  i could cry for downright joy  i wonder what ails me  this is all my doing   cecil no  part of it is mine  and i think it extremely happy for your people of refined sentiments to have friends with a little common understanding   rivers sister i always thought you a woman of sense    mrs harley yes she has been a long time intimate with me you know   cecil well said saucebox   sir harry if this story was to be represented on the stage the poet would think it his duty to punish me for life because i was once culpable   winworth that would be very wrong the stage should be a school of morality and the noblest of all lessons is the forgiveness of injuries   rivers true my lord  but the principal moral to be drawn from the transactions of today is that those who generously labor for the happiness of others will sooner or later arrive at happiness themselves   finis epilogue
