francis douce   the life and surprising adventures of gilbert langley formerly of serlestreet near lincolns end goldsmith and jeweller and afterward a notorious sharper and gamester having ran away to holland with upwards of twenty thousand pounds of his creditors money  written by himself in maidstone goal whilst under sentence of death for robbing john springate of feversham of three farthings on the kings highway in the county of kent  london printed by j webb opposite the queenshead noar the sessions house in the old bailey  the life etc of gilbert langley the following pages contain the adventures of gilbert langley goldsmith written by his own pen it is conceived that a liker picture cannot well be drawn than that which he has given us of himself it is published chiefly for the use of such as may resemble him in some respects many would fly from vice if they saw her face all at once and in day light here she is never was was she better known to any than to this man and he has sent her abroad in her own clothes his style is the style of a man of pleasure and was not altered because it may be of use to know what sort of style that is  some people may perhaps fancy the reading such a life dangerous for their sakes this advertisement is prefixed if they see young people make ill use of it let them set them right let them bid these inconsiderate folks make the growth and progress of vice from abusing education to cheating a father to defrauding the world from defrauding the world to downright robbery and so to the gallows an open broad road and his unhappy journey makes the stages for others that they stop or ride back in time according to the old approved maxim satius est recurrere quam currere male better return than in an ill road run   we commonly hear the young spendthrists of our times discourse exactly in mr langleys language and reason or rather pervert reason as he does in such a case point out a similar passage in this fine history of modern gallantry and put him in mind of the conclusion tell him which is a certain truth that greenwich rambles lead to maidstone goal that intrigues with prostitutes in the pleasure rather of a goat than of a man and that the digressions from the paths of virtue is walking for the air in tyburn road where you run more hazards than one of choking but to proceed to his own account  gilbert langley eldest son of holdenby langley an eminent goldsmith in london and nephew to sir thomas langley bart was born nov       0 at three years of age he was sent down to his grandmothers seat at peldersley in derbyshire under whose care he continued till he was seven years of age when his mother growing impatient at his long continuance in the country came down from london to setch him home no sooner had he received the visits common on such occasions and recovered from the fatigue of his journey but he was put to school to mr adams in redlionstreet from whose prudent instructions he in his tenders years made so great an improvement that few or none in the same school were thought his equals and his father unwilling to curb the promising genuis of his child by the advice and consent of his master removed him from thence to the charter house and thereby gave him a further opportunity of exerting his natural parts here in a short time he began to read virgil ovid horace and demosthenes and had as great knowledge of those authors as his tender years would admit but such is the misfortune of some of our english schools that the masters either to please the parents or indulge the child hurry their pupils from class to class without consulting whether they are sufficiently grounded in the first rudiments of learning hence it is that so many youths who have ran through all the classic authors after a year or twos absence from school are almost as far to seek as if their parents had not expended any thing on their education  gilberts father being sully persuaded of this almost universal error and corruption in our english schools resolved to send him over to the benedictine monks at doway in flanders there to have him brought up in his own religion but notwithstanding the great disparity between a foreign and english education was so fully proved by several of mr langleys friends yet his wife could not by arguments be induced to a compliance in parting with her child preferring rather the presence of her son in ignorance before his absence in a place where he was sure to have the fairest opportunity of acquiring solid and useful learning thus her fondness triumphed over her reason and she could not bear the thoughts of a separation from her darling who to please her though to his own prejudice was continued at home till providence was pleased to take her away and by that removed the sole obstacle to the intended progress of our young student for no sooner was his toofond mamma dead and decently interred but the father earnestly bent on his sons advancement made diligent search for a proper person to whom he might commit the trust of his son until he should arrive at doway the place designed for his future education upon enquiry he found out mr sturton the prior of the benedictine monks who being come to london about some particular business was now returning to his convent with this gentleman he agreed on an annual sum for my board learning and all other necessary expenses and it was agreed my departure was to be as soon as possible the day been fixed we met at the crosskeys in gracechurchstreet where my indulgent father with reiterated entreaties solicited mr sturton to a peculiar care of his young pupil and after he had tenderly embraced me with flowing eyes committed me to the management of my new tutor for my part i readily consess that being fond of novelty and having a roving disposition i was rather pleased than concerned at our parting and with joy resigned myself to a new strange guardian in short we lay at the inn that eight and in the morning took coach for dover from whence the packet being ready to sail we embarked for calais and in a fw hours with a fresh and favorable gale we reached the wishedfor haven my tutor being intimately acquainted with mr francia commonly known in england by the name of francia the jew we lodged in his house and were civilly and agreeably entertained by him for the space of three days  now all things appeared to me very uncommon and being unable to understand the native language manners or customs i thought myself in a new world asking several impertinent questions of my guardian who well pleased with my curiosity and juvenile observations gave me such answers as my tender age was capable to understand now after thanks to mr francia for his kind entertainment we proceeded on our journey and the next day arrived at st omers where we spent the whole day viewing the curiosities of that town which i shall not presume to describe being then but in the   th year of my age yet i cannot forbear taking notice of the cathedral of st bartins an ancient and stately structure adorned with several curious pieces of painting and embellished with numerous ornaments but what struck me most with wonder and surprise were the skins of a toad and a crocodile each of an enormous size that were fixed to one of the columns of the church but since there are so many various reports and omantick fables devised by the populace concerning the prodigious dimensions of those animals and the manner of their being discovered i shall omit troubling my reader any farther on that head since where i cannot give a full true and satisfactory account my resolution is to be silent  adjoining to this noble cathedral is a magnificent and splendid convent resembling more the palace of a grand monarch than the receptacle of persons who under the spacious pretense of religion retire thither although in reality they much more fully iudulge their irregular passions and inordinate desires than those who struggling in the tempestuous ocean of the world boldly expose themselves to all dangers and to the utmost of their abilities serve and glorify their great creator in this convent are upwards of   0 jesuits and near  00 students who all pay the annual salary of    l sterling except twelve of them who are upon the popes foundation my guardian and i paid a visit to the prior who entertained us in a sumptuous and elegant manner none being so profuse in their entertainments as the romish clergy one among another the next morning we set out for doway where we arrived in the evening to the great satisfaction and comfort of the benedictines who with all possible demonstrations of joy received their superior and as i was afterward informed highly applauded him for the due execution of his commission and commended his diligence and unwearied endeavors in increasing the number of the faithful at the expiration of three days which are usually allowed to young sparks to initiate themselves in the forms and precepts of the college i was examined by three reverend fathers and upon a strict examination was found capable of nothing higher than alvaruss grammar and caesars commentaries a plain proof of the vanity of some of our english schools but since my readers may be curious and willing to be informed of the manners and customs of our collegiate life i shall for their satisfaction give a true account thereof the annual salary is    l sterling for an elder brother and  0 ditto for a younger at our first entrance we are divested of our secular garb and clothed with a cassock and a gown resembling in form those of the foundation of the charter house which dress according to the ancient rules of the house is allowed to each student new every year the scholars are divided according to their different abilities and capacities into several classes each apart to prevent noise and interruption and over each class presides a proper master whose business is to instruct his pupils in the knowledge of such authors as he thinks most proper and suitable to their genius and understanding we were obliged to continue twelve months in the same study that we may be entirely perfect therein and during that time have monthly examinations in which the most perfect is for his encouragement to receive a praemium from the hands of the prior at the three several grand examinations that are held before the whole house at easter michaelmas and christmas all except those who are in the accidence are compelled at all times and on all occasions to speak the latin tongue we have a large dormitory where each student has a bed apart a calefactory and at each end thereof a large fire place though but small allowance of wood having but one faggot and two billets to each fire and that only in the evening which causes some of our young sparks sometimes privately and sometimes by open force to break into the woodhouse that stands in our area or yard our refectory or dining room is large and commodious and served with due economy where each scholar has the first choice of the portions of meat according to his superiority in learning our diet is bread and butter every morning at noon half a pound of boiled meat with a porringer of broth and at night the same allowance of roast with a sallad except on fasts but at meals we have as much bread and beer as we desire although at all other times we are debarred even from a crust of bread or a draught of beer which makes us frequently convey out the same under our cassocks and sometimes like ravenous wolves make bold incursions into the kitchen and there plunder and carry away all that we can meet with but of this more hereafter over the students which are never less than fifty or threescore a prefect is appointed by the prior who ought to be a person of great sagacity and discretion for to his care the direction of all the scholars when out of their respective schools is committed he hears all debates settles all controversies and appeases all quarrels that arise amongst his pupils his business is to call them at five in the morning as well in winter as summer he rings the bell to prayers at their meals says grace and orders one of the scholars in his turn to mount the pulpit and read the martyrology during the time of repast whilst he himself stands at the upper end of the refectory to keep silence and prevent any confusion or irregularities that might otherwise happen among such boys hours of study are from five till half an hour after seven the other half hour being allowed for washing and breakfast time at eight we go to school at eleven to prayers at noon to dinner at one to study at two to school at half an hour after four to play at five to study at six to supper and afterward to play if in the summer time or in the winter to our respective seats in the calefactory none dares presume to go into the town without the prefects leave we have a capacious area or yard wherein is a terras walk and a place very proper for the exercise of handball in which we strove to surpass each other  at christmas the scholars are allowed to choose a king to promote pastime and all the great officers of his court which occasions a great deal of diversion on twelfth night the king sends his ambassadors to invite the prior and some of the grandees of the house to an elegant and costly supper to which none except the great officers of state are admitted all the rest being then in waiting and receive as his majestys bounty what comes from his royal table for my readers satisfaction i shall mention an odd accident that happened to me whilst i had the honor of serving in quality of an ambassador  on the eve of the epiphany i received an order to take three of the lords of the bedchamber and go about two miles out of town to a publickhouse and there to purchase four gallons of brandy for the abovementioned entertainment as i could speak the french language i soon executed the commission at a far more reasonable rate than i could possibly have done in the town there being a large duty on the import of any spirituous liquors into the garrison and that farmed by a comis or officer that has his myrmidons constantly attending at the entrance of the town gate who search all comers in but it being usual to let the students of different colleges pass and repass without hindrance or examination we thought ourselves secure from any danger that might arise on that head so after our bottles were filled we sat down in the house and drank a glass or two to refresh ourselves but as ill fortune would have it a soldier coming into the same house privately took notice of our bottles that stood on the table and went to the searchers office and gave information that four students of the benedictine monks were going to convey brandy into the garrison we were entirely ignorant of the private information that he had given and therefore in a merry mind paid the reckoning and returned homeward with the liquor under our cassocks when to our great surprise as we were going in at the gate we were stopped the brandy found upon us and we secured in the adjoining office till they had called a file of musketeers to conduct us to the head comiss house for further examination i had then a pistole in my pocket and knowing the mighty force of gold offered it to the searchers for our enlargement but they were inflexible and therefore any one may judge what horror and confusion we were in at the approaching danger in short as we marched along with the guard of soldiers the inhabitants wondered what crime such youths could be guilty of that had thus exposed them to public scandal and shame some pitied our misfortune and others condemned our folly but by a lucky accident we met with two irish franciscan friars who enquiring of the sergeant the cause of this unusal treatment reprimanded him severely for his folly in carrying us to the officer of the customs and at the same time advised him to conduct us to our own college and inform the prior of what had happened it being properly his business to answer for the misdemeanors and trepasses of all students under his immediate care and direction this sage advice of the fathers prevailed on the rigid officer who conveyed us safe to our own convent and asterwards made his report to the abovementioned officer who next morning sent to demand four hundred florins of the prior the usual forfeiture or fine imposed for the infringement of his dues and privileges our prior was startled at this exorbitant demand and absolutely refused to give the least satisfaction which so exasperated the comis that he resolved to prosecute us with the utmost rigor hereupon the prior consulting the sages of the law was advised to quiet the impending storm and bring this unlucky accident to an amicable composition which was accordingly effected on the payment of one hundred florins and a further promise that none of his pupils should ever be guilty of the like offense  the march following another misfortune happened to me that had likely to have proved fatal and of greater consequence than the former which was as follows  john hussy william etherington george pigot john racket william brown and myself formed a conspiracy against the peace of the commonwealth and by a mutual and solemn engagement were fully determined to make an irruption into the kitchen and there plunder all that we could meet with the night before the execution of our plot we by the help of gimblets had secretly bored two holes in the kitchen door that leads to the refectory and fixed two pieces of packthread blacked on purpose to prevent their being observed to the bolts that fastened the door on the inside this scheme though artfully managed was perceived by one of the scullions who immediately gave notice thereof to the rest of the servants who judging our intent armed themselves with bludgeons and resolved to dispute the entrance into their sooty kingdom against all invaders they likewise furnished themselves with a dark lanthorn either to descry the number of the assailants and loudy complain against such public acts of rapine and hostility no less diligent were we to execute our intent and having provided ourselves with lusty cudgels and a chissel to open the refectory door between the hours of twelve and one we began to attack the garrison first with little or no noise forced open the door and gained an easy entrance into the kitchen passage by the help of those cords we had fastened to the bolts of the said door that guarded the entrance we now thought ourselves secure and found in the said inlett into our intended port two large barrels of raisins with the heads of them open this unexpected prize overjoyed us and we immediately fell to plunder and filled a large sack that we had brought with us to carry away our booty but to our great astonishment we were suddenly saluted with repeated blows on our heads backs and shoulders from different quarters laid heavily on us by the numerous company of servants that were fully bent to retrieve their lost reputation and make us prisoners of war we straitway quitted our prize and fell pellmell on the enemy with true english courage and bravery and returned their blows so briskly that they began to give ground which so redoubled our ardour that we drove them out of their fortifications into the open garden belonging to the religious where finding themselves unable to withstand our fury they immediately set up a great cry calling out laroon laroon which is in english thieves thieves and the shoemaker who was one of the gang stretching forth his dark lanthorn looked steadfastly on us whereupon hussy knocked it out of his hand tho too late for he already knew us and their outcry by this time having alarmed the house we were obliged to make a precipitate retreat and endeavor to regain our quarters before the perfects arrival which was happily effected and we all in our respective beds pretending to be fast asleep but this artifice would not pass on him for we not having time to undress our cassocks were not as usual spread over our bedcloaths and he thereby easily discovered us  the next morning we were summoned before the grand prior where the poor battered and bruised servants made a most pitious complaint of their barbarous treatment vowing that they would all leave the house except they had ample satisfaction for the injury done them the prior taking this affair into his consideration rightly judged that if he countenanced snch open acts of theft and hostility that none would ever serve in the convent and that it vastly derogated from his character whose office was to maintain peace and good tranquillity throughout his jurisdiction and therefore he pronounced this harsh though just sentence that we should for this unparalled crime be expelled the college as an example to deter others from the like notorious offense we were now like criminals under sentence of death none caring to converse with us least they should be suspected to be infected with our wicked and perverse dispositions however as mercy is sometimes extended to the most abandoned wretches we all except brown by great itnerest and the characters our masters gave of our being youths of a promising genius were reprieved and once more on promise of our future good behavior again admitted into favor notwithstanding this unexpected clemency we could not suppress our resentment at the expulsion of our old confederate brown but vowed to revenge the injury and injustice that we thought was done to our former companion in the most secret manner that possibly we could and therefore we had frequent debates and consultations how to bring about our intended project at last the following method was unanimously resolved on in our area stands the woodhouse to which the scullion the informer of our first attack usually came every day with a wheelbarrow to fetch wood between the hours of four and five in the afternoon for the use of the kitchen we therefore provided ourselves with a cloak belonging to one of the minor students to prevent suspicion ready against his entrance to surprise him in the following manner  there was a ladder standing in the yard by the help of which we privately got in at the window and hid ourselves behind the faggots and there with impatience waited his coming having in the mean time well provided ourselves with smart switches to lash the bare bumb of our inveterate enemy no sooner had he opened the door and began to load his barrow but the cloak was thrown over his head and fastened with a cord round his neck so that being blinded he was incapable to discover who was the foe or make any defense to prevent his intended punishment in short we first shut the door to prevent his cries being heard then knocked him down let down his breeches and paid his bare buttocks in turns till we were all weary nor were his hideous cries or loud invocations of his tutelar saints able to abate our rage or defend him from the severe punishment that we were in honor bound to inflict on this delinquent as a retaliation and satisfaction for the disgrace of our former companion no sooner was this bloody flagellation or scourging ended but the bell rang to study and we left the poor unhappy wretch alone to bemoan his dire misfortune and vainly vonjecture who were the persons who had thus irreverently profaned their characters and went in a decent manner to the musaeum where we took our respective seats as innocently in appearance as if nothing had happened though well pleased in our conceits at the good success of what we had so long and so earnestly wished for the scullion had no sooner freed himself from his hoodwink and recovered his lost sight but he ran crying out le diable le diable with the utmost speed into the kitchen and there after having recovered his breath recounted the dismal story to his fellow servants who were all amazed and sorely affrighted lest the same devils should unexpectedly surprise and punish them for the said offense however when the pannic fear and terror they were in was something abated they in a whole posse with the injured party at their head went to the prior and loudly exclaimed against the insult and barbarous treatment of their countryman by those bougre de chiens or english dogs as they were pleased to call us his students the prior calmly heard their just accusation and faithfully promised them in verbo sacerdotis to redress their grievances and inflict condign punishment on those who should be sound guilty of this villainous and unpardonable act of cruelty accordingly he came into the musaeum and cast a piercing and observant look over all the scholars hoping thereby to discern by their countenances who were the guilty persons but as the most sagacious and cunning are sometimes deceived so was he all his artifices proved ineffectual and therefore he with reason good as we were formerly proved guilty of a misdemeanor positively charged us with the fact and called us one by one into a private room for further examination but we who were always true to each other absolutely denied that we either directly or indirectly were privy to or knew any thing of what we were thus charged with and i for my part to clear myself and copartners in the crime swore by the holy cross of christ that then stood on a table in the room that we were no ways accessory or concerned in the commission of this horrid villainy and in confirmation thereof on bended knees kissed and embraced the same this solemn protestation had its desired effect and the prior being thoroughly satisfied with this frank and unprecedented manner of acquitting ourselves afterward treated us with more than usual marks of his civility and esteem nor was it ever known during my stay in the college who were the authors of the abovementioned riot  affairs being thus happily accommodated all things seemed to bear the cheerful air of joy peace and tranquillity and i plied my studies so very diligently that for the two following years i had the honor to receive the annual praemiums given for the encouragement of the industrious student now the eyes of the whole synod was fixed on me of whom they had great hopes if they could by any means or arguments induce me to relinquish all thoughts of a gay and secular life and embrace a religious monastical state and to accomplish this their design they treated me in a manner different from that used toward the rest of my contemporaries and by their artful and engaging behavior easily persuaded me to promise that with my fathers consent and approbation i would accept of the habit and add one more to the number of the faithful but mark how providence by an unexpected and unforeseen accident subverted and frustrated wha they with so much art had endeavored to obtain as by the benevolence and kind indulgence of my father i was constantly supplied with money i frequently went into the town partly for my recreation and partly to improve myself in the french language which i was very desirous to become master of and therefore one thursday in the afternoon which is always a holyday with us i asked leave of the prefect for me and my companion roger meynel to go out and walk on the ramparts the prefect being vexed at some disappointment or other was in a sullen morose humor and theresore denied our request exasperated at this unexpected denial we determined nolens volens to accomplish our intent and thus resolved we boldly went out at the conventgate into the town and from thence to a tavern where we gave a loose to pleasure and revelled at large till we were weary and intoxicated with liquor and then to sober ourselves we staggered about an hour on the ramparts not unobserved by many and from thence we reeled home but had the wit to steal privately to bed when the bell rang to supper we being missing were enquired for however answer was made by some of our friends that we were taken ill and gone to bed this excuse passed for two or three days till a gentleman who knew us came to visit the prior and informed him in what a scandalous foolish condition we had been observed on the public ramparts which so highly incensed our governor that after several reprimands he ordered us both to be smartly sloggd i was then in poetry and therefore was so highly exasperated at this insult that i resolved to lay aside all thoughts of any further progress in my learning and therefore betook myself to a sullen and continued silence which i strictly observed for near a month and no persuasions were able to alter my perverse disposition till father howard took me to task and by his winning affability prevailed on my sullen temper this gentleman indulged me with the free use of his chamber where i spent my leisure hours with the umtost pleasure in the perusal of his books and was highly delighted with his ingenious remarks and observations on such authors as best suited my genius and heightened the natural conceptions of my growing capacity thus having relinquished all desires of coming to england i closely followed my studies and having ran through all the classicks i proceeded to philosophy passed through my dialect of logic and was just entering upon a course of metaphysics when an order came for my immediate return home  this unexpected news greatly surprised the whole house and the prior with my consent wrote to my father in the most moving terms urged the future advantage i should reap by a full conclusion of what i had so happily began but all his endeavors were in vain for the old gentleman remained inflexible and once more sent a positive order for my removal and also for five guineas for my return home thus having bid adieu and taken my last farewell of the religious and all my fellowstudents with tears in my eyes i took coach to st omers we had not drove above a mile or two out of town but my gloomy melancholy was dispersed and dissipated by the sprightliness and alacrity of my fellowtravellers consisting of two french officers and three ladies the thoughts of a college life were now turned into gaiety and pleasure and i was emulous to outshine the officers in point of complaisance to my fair female companions at night we arrived at st omers where we had an elegant supper and spent the evening with the utmost mirth and delight the ladies being excused from any part in the reckoning according to the custom of france from thence i took post to calais and lodged at the sign of the ville des londres or the city of london where i met with several english gentlemen and ladies that were waiting a passage to england next day having a letter of recommendation to my old friend mr francia i went and dined with him who generously offered me the free use of his house during my stay at calais but pleased with the variety of diverting company at my inn i modestly declined his courteous offer because thereby i had a greater freedom of indulging my juvenile follies and extravagancies the wind continuing n w for near three weeks no vessel could stir out of the harbor wherefore my money being almost exhausted by this unexpected delay i was obliged to make proof of mr francias friendship who procured me a passage on board the mary sloop capt hawkins who quartered at the same inn with me and the rest of the company who were all his passengers at last the wind chopping about to the southward we all embarked cast of from the key and had a pleasant passage to gravesend where we went ashore and supped at the faulcon tavern and drank plentifully but here i confess i sat on thorns for having expended all my money i was at a great loss how to discharge my share of the reckoning at last i assumed an air of boldness and putting my hand in my pocket asked the gentleman that sat next to me if he would favor me with change of a pistole telling him that i had no english coin the gentleman replied sir a crown is at your service i humbly thanked him and readily accepted the pleasing proffer which was sufficient to discharge my dividend of the reckoning highly delighted at my good luck and the generous treatment of a stranger  at last we arrived at towerstairs and having returned many thanks to the abovementioned gentleman and gave him directions where my father lived i took my leave of the rest of the company went ashore and called a coach and ordered him to drive to lincolnsinnfields my father was standing at his door but scarcely knew me habited like a frenchman and dressed alamode de paris till at last recovering himself from his surprise he took me into the parlour and there tenderly embraced me numbers of the neighbors came to compliment me on my safe return home sometime after i had refreshed myself the good old gentleman asked me what course of life i was willing to embrace for my future support and maintenance i proposed the study of the law or physic both which the rejected and i at last by his earnest solicitations was bound apprentice to him  mr thomas gilpin my fellow apprentice having then about one year and a half to serve my father made use of this opportunity of giving me a further education and more suitable for the transaction of public business than the former and therefore he sent me to mr yeates academy in chancery lane there to be perfect in arithmetic he likewise provided me a french master who daily came to instruct me in the theory of that useful language of which before i had nothing but the practick part in the evening i went to a german limner in cravenbuildings there to learn that noble and ingenious science of drawing so vastly beneficial in all the stages of human life thus for a considerable time my thoughts were wholly intent on the pursuit of the abovementioned accomplishments till by degrees falling into company with some other gay sparks i grew weary of my habitual exercises and soo found that my weekly allowances was not sufficient to furnish out those frequent excursions and irregularities that my unlimitted desires urged on and excited by lewd company often subjecte me to and therefore i privately began to pilfer though at first with an intent to repay from the several quantities of old silver that were brough into the shop and was grown so expert and cunning in this my villainous practices that neithe my father nor mr gilpin ever suspected me t be any ways concerned in such base wicke practices  one summers evening being sent with a bag of plate to a gentlemans house in grosvenr square as i crossed covent garden i chaced to meet with a beautiful lady well dressed and gay who by her airy appearance seemed to be a woman of the town this nymph so struck me at the first sight that i resolved at all events to follow her home which as it happened was not far off that part of the town being the usual residence for those of her stamp in short seeing her go into a house i thought myself secure and went to a neighboring publicans where calling for a quartern of brandy by the description of my fair charmer i soon found that that was the usual place of her residence and abode however having then a charge of plate and being in a dishable i durst not presume to gratify my ardent desires with my fair phillis for the present but resolved at all events to visit her the sunday following and therefore i discharged my trust and went home her lovely form filled my soul and therefore all my earnest care and study was how to raise money sufficient to indulge and gratify my eager wishes in the possession of those charms with which i was so passionately enamored now fortune by the following unexpected accident gave me an opportunity to furnish myself with a sufficiency to execute my amorous exploit my father according to custom being gone to smoke a pipe after dinner i was left alone in the shop and knowing that he would not return in less than an hour i thought this a proper time to execute my intended project then going to his desk to my great joy and surprise found the key in it and willingly embracing this favorable opportunity opened the desk and took seven guineas out of the three several bags least that sum if taken out of one should be missed and i suspected of the fraud no sooner had i put the money in my pocket but i called up the maid to look after the shop whilst i went backwards and hid the money least perchance i should be discovered and the cash found upon me but the old gentleman who never kept any regular account thereof never missed it and i the sunday following having dressed myself to the best advantage put three guineas of my stolen treasure into my pocket and about three in the afternoon went to visit my lovely goddess her apartment was up onepairofstairs well furnished her attendant an old superannuated curtezan worn out in the wars of venus who in a snuffling tone asked me what i would please to have i briskly replied your lady sir says she please to walk in and she will be here immediately i obeyed the old hags command and seated myself in the dining room where the old bawd fatigued me with the fulsome and impertinent discourse concerning her former antiquated amors and desired me to treat her with a glass of wine i readily consented and flung down two shillings for a bottle presently after in came my phillis i arose and paying my respects civilly saluted her she returned the compliment and seating herself by me with a pleasing air of gaiety and careless negligence orders her servant to put on the tea kettle her discourse was melting and amorous which so raised my youthful vigor that unable any longer to oppose the mighty force of love with eager haste i conducted her to the bedchamber but not willing so soon to quit the company of my darling i proposed a supper at the fountain tavern in katherinestreet and she readily yielded to my request but it being summertime and a fine day i handed her to the abovementioned place of rendezvous but was to my sorrow afterward observed and taken notice of by my father who watched my motions and saw me go into the said tavern nevertheless for some secret cause unknown to me he avoided my sight and i wholly intent on my amorous dalliances of love never so much as saw him nor had the least suspicion of his being privy to my secret amor in short we had an elegant supper arrack punch jellies and other provocations to lust and about three in the morning i discharged the reckoning satisfied my mercenary nymph for her attendance and well pleased with this my first entrance into this new scene of life went home little thinking how dearly i should pay for so trivial and transitory a pleasure  the next day my father called me to him and with an angry and frowning countenance asked me where i had been yesterday in the afternoon and what induced me to keep such unreasonable hours i replied that i had been at church and afterward in company with two or three of my companions mr gilpert says he i know your tricks and therefore think myself in duty bound to chastise and restrain your libidinous excesses by a timely and severe punishment so taking me down into the cellar he made me strip and there scourged me very heartily with a horsewhip and afterward ordered that i should not be admitted again to his table until by my future and good behavior i had amply atoned for my former past offense but this harsh treatment had not the desired effect for being banished from my fathers i dined with the maid and my desires daily waxed more fierce and ardent wherefore to appease the rage and torrent of lust i made a vigorous attack on the servant who neither armed with the shield of modesty or virtue made a faint resistance and soon rendered herself a victim nor was i wanting in generosity to my new and pretty i cannot omit to tell you that one day having bought a pair of gold laced shoes for my chloe my father being out i called her up into the parlour and shut the shop door madam said i saluting her please to accept of this trifle and with it the heart of your admirer this i presume is a proof of your being sole mistress of my esteem and affections which i shall always maintain fixed and unalterable chloe well pleased with the present fondly caressed me which so fanned the amorous flame that notwithstanding my fathers expected immediate return or any ones coming about business i hastened to enjoy her but as the devil would have it my father knocked at the door at which confusion and shame overspread my countenance however chloe had the good fortune to get off unperceived by him who seeing the laced shoes standing on the table said pray whose are these methink they are very gay i replied sir a lady of whom i bought some silver lace desired she might leave them here till her return this answer as i plainly perceived was not satisfactory to the old gentleman who ever after kept a stricter eye both on my conduct in point of honesty and behavior toward the maid wherefore i grew more cautious and artful in tricking him of cash and more vigilant and circumspect in the pursuit of my amors till having by hypocrisy and a well dissembled good behavior reinstated my self in the love and esteem of my father  i was again admitted to his table and all former flights of youth buried in oblivion till one sunday night coming home drunk and finding no body there but the maid i out of a frolic toyed with her on the kitchen floor but by ill fortune was again surpised by my father who contrary to custom opening the shutters of the kitchen window saw me engaging in the amorous combat  the wench and i were both ignorant of this unexpected discovery and he for that night took no notice thereof but the next morning he called up the maid whom he immediately discharged and severely reprimanded me vowing by all that was good and sacred that if i ever was guilty of the like impudence he would totally discard and turn me like a vagabond out of doors and furthermore to prevent such disorders in his house he hired a grave sedate matron and who as he thought was past the follies and dalliances of love but as there can be no reason assigned for that bewitching passion o neither the wrinkled furrows of her aged face nor the vigilance of my father were able to restrain my furious and ardent desires of enjoying that living sepulcher but as youth and age are as opposite as fire and water so the cold and feeble embraces of this antiquated dame served only to allay and quench my lustful ardour which reillumind by the various and pleasing objects of the town therefore in the bloom of vigorous youth i pursed the willing fair ones who though like the apples of gomorrah they appear beauteous and alluring without yet are their insides both rotten and pestilential  i soon grew tainted by their poisonous infection for the cure of which i secretly applied myself to an able surgeon who religiously kept my secret and faithfully discharged his trust with honor and integrity  one evening being in liquor as i crossed drury lane i was saluted by a female who in a soft and engaging voice said come my dear will not you give me a pint of wine and as bacchus is the constant companion of love i replied yes my angel so in i carried her to the feathers tavern up stairs we went and i called for a bottle of wine when as soon as we had drank a glass or two apiece i grew passionately fond of my new prize which she observing and seeing me disguised in liquor resolved to make her market and therefore insisted upon half a crown before hand i condescended and foolishly gave it her but was then no nearer the point i aimed at than before well said she give me the other two shillings and sixpence and you shall be feasted which i had no sooner parted with and was preparing for the wanton engagement but upon a stamp that she gave with her foot in rushed four more bold viragoes who seizing me held my hands and rifled my pockets swearing that if i offered to make a noise or cry out that they would charge me with a constable for attempting to abuse them at the word constable i was sorely affrighted fearing i should be exposed and my father become acquainted therewith wherefore i seemingly condescended to what i could by no means prevent  when they had robbed me of every thing valuble except my clothes they swore they would strip me if i did not call for a bottle of arrack wherefore to prevent the impending ruin that would have proved my total overthrow i readily submitted to their imposition and ringing the bell odrered the drawer to bring in my forfeit for that was the term they ordered me to make use of no sooner was the bottle out but the she devils disappeared and left me alone to bemoan my unfortunate disappointment  in short i went to the bar and loudly complained of the ill treament i had met with but it availed nothing for the landlady insisted on her reckoning and said sir i know nothing of the women they came in with you had you applied to me for a lady i should have provided you one and been accountable for her civility and good behavior at length finding it in vain to dispute i left my waistcoat to satisfy her demands and went home much sobered by the fright and surprise that i had been in  sometime after this standing alone at the shop door an old woman came and gav me a letter sealed with a thimble a mark peculiar to fallen women i opened it and found by the scrawl that it came from the maid whom my father had formerly discharged on my account the contents were that she was big with child and expected in a fortnight or three weeks to be brought to bed and therefore if i was willing to screen myself from shame and disgrace i must take care pursuant to the directions in the letter either to come and see her or else send a constant supply during her lyingin but that if i failed to comply with her request that she should through necessity be forced to expose me i was not a little startled at this sudden and as i thought unreasonable demand however i gave the bearer half a crown for her use and sixpence for her own trouble in bringing the unwelcome letter with a promise shortly to visit my molly and ease her under her misfortunes but as the old saying is out of sight out of mind i forgot my promise but she strictly observed hers for in less than three weeks she swore the bastard to me and i was taken into custody for the same hereupon i immediately wrote to my father who came and passed his word to see the affair compounded which he in three days time upon the payment of    l with the utmost secrecy effected  this was a standing memorial of my folly and therefore to blot out the remembrance of it i seemed vastly uneasy and shagrined insomuch that my father took notice thereof and kindly compassionating my anxious troubles and disquietude of mind gener ously forgave the offense and promised never to reflect on these my former fights of youth having thus freed myself from this scandalous reflection i pursued my former pleasures and being  in high esteem and credit with my father i artfully altering the figures and current of the cash book amassed together a considerable sum which i hid in the cellar making use thereof on extraordinary occasions my reigning favourits were molly st gerrge phebe player and sally king with whom i indulged myself in all libidinous excesses as often as time or opportunity would permit  being now almost grown to mans estate and my father was taken very ill and obliged to keep his bed and therefore the whole charge of the business lay upon my hands and to do myself justice during the time of his sickness i faithfully discharged the great trust reposed in me honor gratitude and filial duty gaining the ascendant over the base allurements of a depraved nature now the good gentleman dying left me a large fortune and a shop well stocked with abundance of plate jewels and other valuable effects as also a set of worthy gentlemen for my customers who to their honor and credit be it spoken discharged their debts due to the deceased and continued their favors to me his unworthy son my father nominated three executors viz francis cunning esquire mr richard lacon and mr thomas gilpin who all unanimously agreed that i although under age should carry on the business and mr  as an overseer and observer of my behavior in this new scene of life boarded with me in the house  now the goddess of fortune seemed to shower down her favors on me and my trade daily increasing i found it absolutely necessary to hire a journeyman and a boy to run on errands i now totally relinquished all thoughts of extravagancy abhorred and detested my former vicious course of life and therefore for my instruction and amusement i furnished myself with a select library of books and was so constant and diligent in my business that it was the received and general opinion of the town that young langley would in a few years gain a plentiful estate and had i been so happy as to have maintained the prudent and discreet economy that i observed at my first launching out into the world i had certainly verified those candid conceptions that the town in general had conceived of me for in the first year that i followed business upon the balance of accounts i found myself  00 l gainer by my trade and that more likely to increase than diminish if i trod those paths in which i had so wisely began but alas what is so prevalent on youth as bad example disguised under the false pretext of paternal care and inviolable friendship  m  whom i mentioned before was the only acting executor wherefore to please him was all my earnest care and study now this gentleman having imprudently entrusted me with my brothers fortunes which were  000 l on the payment of   l per cent i naturally grew fond of his company and made him a present of a gold watch and chain thinking thereby more firmly to rivet myself in his affections and wholly engage him to my interest and by my artful and engaging behavior i won so insensibly upon him that laying aside the respect and awe du to a guardian he not only reposed an entire confidenc in me and never examined into the state of my affairs but chose nay even insisted on my being his companion and partner in his frequent debauches which by the continual repetitions so vitiated my former principle that the young goldsmith was soon metamorphosed in to the prouse prodigal and spend thrift  thus having none to awe and restrain my unboundless and unlimited desires i soon became a professed rake and whoremaster i cannot forget one night being in company with  and having drank very plentifully i proposed to conduct him to the apartments of one of my favorite ladies he seemed highly pleased with the proffer and took coach and drove to madams lodgings who being a well bred woman entertained us in a courteous and obliging manner the old gentleman was soon captivated with her charms and burned for enjoyment which i observing called her aside and said madam the gentleman is my uncle and therefore i desire you would oblige him and me also in the request i am now going to make you she with a smile consented whereupon i ordered her whilst the fumbler was in the vain pursuit of delight to pick his pocket of some notes that i knew he had about him she faithfully performed her promise and afterward gave them into my hands  shortly after this she and he after several attempts to do what in reality he could not effect returned into the dining room little thinking of the merry trick that had been put upon him to be brief we staid till about three in the morning then calling a coach went home  the next day recollecting himself where he had been and missing his bills called for me and acquainted me with his loss and that he suspected that that damned painted whore had stolen them from him i seemed to be in a passion and swear that i believed she would scorn so base an action but that for his satisfaction i would go and enquire into the matter and at the same time let him know that if she had them she would insist on a handsome present on the delivery of the same damn her says he give her two guineas and place them to my account thus the old gentleman paid the forfeit due to his folly and mrs morris and i revelled the ensuing night at his cost and charge this imposition gave the old fool such a distaste and abhorrence to the female prostitutes that after i had returned him his notes he solemly vowed and declared never to converse with any of them for the future  sometime after as the biter is bit at last a gentleman well dressed stopped at my door in a coach and coming into the shop complimented me on my fathers decease and expressed the great value and esteem he had for him and that upon his account he was willing to continue his favors for the encouragement of me his son i humbly thanked him for his civility and told him i should strenuously endeavor to maintain the good repute and fair character of my deceased father by a strict adherence to his principles of inviolable honor and integrity he full fraught with deceit seemed highly pleased with my reply and therefore as a seeming promise of his friendship bespoke   0 l worth of plate and after he had given me the impression of his coat of arms from a seal that hung to his gold watch said he should be glad to take a glass of wine with me i was proud of the honor and we went to a neighboring tavern where drinking plentifully he took the opportunity whilst i was elevated with liquor to propose a lady to me in marriage who although deformed he said had  0000 l fortune and further more he added that she was under his tuition and direction of his spouse and that if i pleased to come down to his country seat he would engage to gain her consent and bring her to a very speedy compliance  this artful bait had its desired effect for i now not only looked on him as a good customer but as a worthy friend and therefore i invited him to dinner with me the next day and he in return engaged me to sup with him the next evening at his lodgings in tavistockstreet where an elegant entertainment was provided the chambers were richly furnished and illuminated with wax candles in silver candlesticks and sconces in the same metal two footmen in laced liveries waited at supper and every thing augmented the opinion i had already received of his being a gentleman of a large and plentiful estate about twelve i took my leave of him and the next day gave orders for getting ready his plate as soon as possible which being done he in about a weeks time came to me i showed him the plate with which he was extremely pleased and highly commended the curious workmanship thereof and said sir come let us take a bottle before we part for to morrow morning i must go to my country seat i with pleasure yielded to his request and whilst we were in the tavern he pulled out his pocketbook and gave me a note on a vintner in bartholomewclose for   0 l payable in three weeks saying sir this i presume is the same to you as ready cash but please for your own satisfaction to send immediately and enquire into the character of the man i readily obeyed his order and finding by the account i received from my servant that the vintner was a person of a fair character upon his endorsement of the note i accepted it in full payment for my goods and sent the plate packed up to the gun tavern at billingsgate pursuant to his order neither did i forget to take a direction where he lived in the country but promised as soon as possible to visit my intended wealthy bride  in short we parted and i went home quite blown up with the aspiring thoughts of raising my fortune at once and making a splendid and gay appearance in the world but as i lay one night in my bed ruminating on the imaginary possession of the nymph who like the goddess of riches was to load me with her favors a sudden thought eclipsed my joys perhaps says i to myself i am deceived and this great fortune like faryland as soon as seen disappears wherefore i resolved to send to my neighbor  a cunning and artful man whose veracity and integrity i had often experienced the next day down to the gentlemans seat with orders to make a private enquiry in the neighborhood of the truth and reality of what my seeming friend had given me so fair an expectance of accordingly i gave him two guineas and loaded with instructions he departed  i was now racked with alternate hope and fear till his return which was in three days time when he ingeniously told me that after the utmost search and strictest scrutiny it was possible for man to make he could not find out or even hear of any such gentleman or lady that ever lived or resided in that country this was shocking news to me and i reasonably conjectured that since i was deceived in my mistress there was also some fallacy in the note he had given me in payment for my goods but since i had accepted the same i knew no other remedy but to wait with patience till time should bring to light the fraud and discover the whole villainy as i judged so it happened for on sending my servant with the note after three days grace to demand the money the vintner was gone and his house shut up highly incensed at this base and scandalous trick i vowed revenge on the pretended gentleman and resolved if possible at all events to lay him by the heels and make an example of him to deter others from the like falsehood and treachery  about a fortnight afterward a gentlewoman came to my shop and desired to speak with me in private i led her into the parlour where she immediately burst out into tears and for some time could not utter a word till being recovered from her disorder she said sir i am ruined and undone for ever that villain  has imposed on my husbands credulity and under a pretense of raising him   0 l by the discount of his notes to keep his payments good with the winemerchant has obtained three notes of hand of him for   0 l each which he has paid away and applied the money to his own use  this i confess at first startled me but upon a further enquiry i found that her husband was the same person on whom i had the abovementioned note endorsd to me by the said anthony g the sham gentleman and my pretended friend so commiserating her deplorable circumstances i not only promised not to trouble her husband but also to use my interest and endeavor with the other gentlemen my fellow sufferers in the fraud to engage them to a compliance in granting mr m her husband a letter of license for three years highly satisfied with this ganerous proffer and a farther assurance of my resenting the injury and injustice done both to myself and her by mr gshe humbly thanked me and departed leaving directions with me where to find her husband  next day according to my promise i went to the gentlemen who being of tender and human dispositions were easily brought to an accommodation wherefore sending for m and an attorney we agreed on terms to the satisfaction of all parties but one day walking along fleet street near st dunstans a strange gentleman came up to me and asked me whether my name was not langley i replied yes sir says he have you not a demand on one anthony g yes sir quoth i well then said he well step into the bull head and there i will inform you further of the matter so in we went where he told me that he had g deadset and that if i would give him one guinea he would engage to have him in close quarters in less than an hour overjoyed at this news i freely granted him his demand and told him that i would wait there till his return but had i been as good as my word i should have staid there till now for i never saw him afterward this second bite exasperated me more than the former and i resolved if ever i caught g to make him pay for all wherefore i employed a brisk and expert attorney to hunt him out and promised to be accountable for all charges in the execution thereof at last i took the villain and clapped him into the marshalprison where he obliged me to sue him to an execution and there he remained during the whole time that i continued in trade  some time after this i became acquainted with a vintner near grays inn gate in holborn with whom i contracted such an intimacy that very evening i paid a visit and he was foolishly fond of horse racing cock fighting hunting and the like expensive and costly pastimes and diversions and being a constant attendant at newmarket seasons kept a good gelding for that purpose being daily at his house he often solicited me to accompany him thither and greatly enlarged on the grandeur of the assembly and the variety of recreations and amusements that presented themselves for the delight of the curious spectators at last i yielded to his request and furnished myself with a good saddle horse and other jockeylike accourements suitable to the humor of such vain and giddy fools who neglecting their proper employments endeavor to shine in a sphere of life that renders them the scorn and contempt of men of fortune  newmarket is seated in a bottom and has nothing to recommend it but the extravagant imposition of the innkeepers occasioned by the numerous concourse of hairbrained fellows that swarm like ants in a mole hill whilst the rascally grooms under pretense of letting them into the secret pick their pockets and run away with their money  in the high street is a coffee house a common receptacle for n and sharpers thieve and common tradesmen who pass the evening  hazard where the noblemen looses his estat the tradesmen his cash and credit whilst the others laugh at their stupidity and enrich themselves by their downfall early in the morning the heath swarms with horses and dogs as the land of egypt did formerly with locusts when every one pursues the bent of his inclinations generally comprised under the three following classe some hunt some course and the rest stand gaing at the race horses taking their mornin sweats who are so swaddled up that were the not a distinct part of the creation any reasonab man would take them for so many egyptian mumies raised from the dead to scamper upon the grassy turff for the benefit of the mornin air  about twelve each troop hastens to its baracks like oxen to smithfield on a market day where the mercenary grooms are looking out sha for new faces to wheedle themselves into a go dinner and striving to out do each other in lying pretending to give you as true a genealogy of t race of horses as an antiquarian of wales cou of owen tudors family about three in t afternoon the horses are led upon the cour where the whole company assembles at the devi ditch and there till four they are as noisy a busy as so many stock jobbers or jew brokers  exchange alley a little before the drawing of a state lottery a little after four at the solemn beat of a drum the horses start and the whole host like a company of wild arabs in a confused and promiscuous rout scour after them without rhyme or reason and at the turn of the lands set up as hideous an outcry as a parcel of naked wenches discovered bathing in a river some damning the riders and others the horses for losing the heat whilst the winners laugh in their sleeves and pay as much reverence and homage to the victor led into the town as the indians do at present to any of their most celebrated pagods here it was that i first caught the ruinous itch of gaming which was ever after so prevalent that i could not see a box and dice but i was as fond of the gewgaw as a child is of a rattle and at first as the old saying is the devil is kind to a young gamester i won upwards of  00 l and had the wit and discretion to carry it off but this was but a glimmering of life that vainly buoys up the departing patient before the fatal approach of death for in less than six months i doubled the loss of my former gain and by my too frequent extravagancies now found my circumstances in a melancholy posture and my substance vastly impaired however i played my cards so artfully that none of my creditors ever suspected me in the least guilty of so much imprudence and folly  one day being at my friend the vintners house he called me aside and desired me to take his niece to my service i readily condescended and giving my old servant a months warning prepared for the reception of the new one whom on her uncles account i always used with the utmost civility and good manners in short after she had been with me a month i discovered something so innocent and modest in her behavior that so insensibly stole upon me that in despite of my vicious and inordinate desires her virtue so awed and restrained my villainous intentions that for some time i durst not approach her but with the utmost respect and modesty till one fatal night to her coming home a little elate with liquor i called for a bottle of wine and desired her company to partake of it she with a blush modestly excused herself which rather heightened than diminished my passion and therefore i insisted on her compliance with my friendly request she consented and i took this favorable opportunity to acquaint her with my sincere love and esteem then turning the discourse to an amorous scene gave her to understand by a double entendre the meaning of my foul design whether her amorous star had then the ascendant i soon read her approaching destiny who was then upon the point of being ruined by me without any regard to my former esteem for her or the friendship i had long professed to her uncle such is the worth of a man given up to lust and of such value his friendship  my own house which before seemed to me a prison was now changed into a perfect elysium and i neither knew nor wished for any greate bliss than the pleasure of my never to be forgotten clarindas society for she disdained all mercenary ends and was far more deserving of being the legal partner of a marriage bed than mistress of a lawless love that sometime or other would prove her ruin  in short had i been so happy and prudent as to have made her my wife i am well assured that the union of the sacred knot would have exempted me from various inconveniences that destable poverty and horrid want in the sequal exposed me to during the heat of my amor i had several advantageous offers of marriage proposed to me which i declined for the following reason viz that the parents or friends of such young ladies that were actually in a capacity to bestow on them large fortunes insisted on proper settlements for their daughters and also an exact scrutiny into my affairs which although by my artful and deceitful conduct appeared to be in a flourishing condition yet if nicely examined into there was nothing to be found but the ruins and poor remains of a shattered fortune for by this time i had obtained a considerable credit from several merchants in jewels and by the punctual payment of my bills my notes passed as current as those of the bank and i confequently was reputed a great and eminent trader particularly in that most advantageous and profitable part of business but alas to my sorrow i only fulfilled the old english proverb robbing peter to pay paul for under the specious pretense of disposing of the abovementioned goods to persons of quality i secretly pawned them to those who out of a sordid lucre of gain and an avaracious desire of more than legal interest supplied me with what cash i required and by their indiscretion and folly in relyiag on my integrity suffered them to be greatly imposed upon by me who frequently borrowed larger sums on those goods than what i had contracted to pay for them  by this means i had always a large quantity of money at my command and thinking this artifice would always pass undiscovered i lived more like an heir apparent to a great estate than a wary and industrious tradesman assemblies operas masquerades plays and country journies were now my only delight and my sole favorite companions such young gentlemen who were either in the full possession of large estates or in a fair expectation of the same  i cannot omit that two of these young sparks and i having made an agreement to pass a fortnight or three weeks at greenwich for the benefit of the air in the summer season we quartered at the greyhound inn there when one evening over a merry bottle a proposal was made to patrole through the town in quest of ladies of pleasure which was readily agreed too by all parties but finding none there either handsome enough or fitting for our purposes i immediately proposed to return to london and bring down three of the best of that stamp that i could find were willing to indulge themselves with the diversions of a country life my companions highly applauded my design and i took a pair of oars which presently wasted me to templestairs where as soon as i landed i went in pursuit of my game and being well known to the porter at the rose in covent garden to him i applied for the execution of my design  the porter went directly out whilst i called for a pint of wine to wait for his return who in about half an hours time brought three wanton lasses well dressed and not disagreeable i arose and saluting them said ladies please to seat yourselves my business is to acquaint you that your company is desired for a fortnight or three weeks at greenwich where you may be assured to be treated in the most courteous and polite manner for the persons that you will have to do with are gentlemen of honor and therefore if you approve of my proposal please to provide yourselves with such linen and apparel as you shall think proper for your use during your residence in the country i will remain here an hour longer so ladies if ye are willing go and prepare yourselves for the journey they unanimously agreed and dropping a curtisie at their going out of the room returned with their baggage within the time appointed i called a coach and drove to the temple stairs where i took a pair of oars and landed at greenwich but not without the repeated insults of opprobious language commonly used by the vulgar on the thames however my female companions verified the latin adage nemo me impune lacessit and returned their scurrility with as smart and satirical repartees as if they had served a seven years apprenticeship to any of the most celebrated fishwomen at billingsgate  i looked upon myself now as an eastern monarch bearing as absolute sway in my floating seraglio as the grand seignior ever did in his sumptuous edifice at constantinople in short i conducted the ladies to the greyhound inn where my companions were with impatience waiting for my return upon our entrance into the room they civilly complimented the women and we being all seated i said gentlemen i presume i have answered your expectations and honorably discharged my trust please therefore to take the first choice and the nymph that has not the honor to please either of you shall be the copartner of my bed and be taken under immediate care and protection this generous offer augmented their delight and each pyramid chose his favorite thisbe now nothing was to be seen but perfect harmony and an uninterrupted scene of joys the gods of love and wine by alternate possession resided in our hearts nor were the sylvan deities exempt from participating the mutual and transporting pleasures that we fully possessed in the shady retirement of the adjacent park but those soft and endearing caresses of our amorous goddesses by reiterated repititions grew dull and infipid and we cloyed and wearied with the continual performance of daily sacrifice to the cyprian dame resolved to put a merry trick upon the ladies and leave them in the lurch  one day after we had dined we desired them to go and walk in the park and we would follow immediately and order the teakettle and other necessaries to be brought up with us thither  they seemed well pleased with our request and readily obeyed whereupon we called our landlord and paid him his bill and then crossed the water to the isle of dogs where we spent the remainder of the day in mirth and jollity highly diverted that we had bilked the prostitutes of their expected fare they walked in the park a long time and seeing no appearance of us or the servant of the house returned to the inn and on enquiry finding that we were gone as the landlord told them by our order to london they quarrelled with each other for their folly in complying with our request before they had had satisfaction for their ware but finding it in vain to trifle away their time in railing and scolding to no purpose they hired a pair of oars for london and as ill fortune would have it our boats both met veragainst cuckolds point they immediately set up a cry that both alarmed and surprised us the female viragos were for boarding but we sheered off as fast as we could and encouraging our watermen to make way we in spite of our adversaries kept about sour boats length ahead of them but were forced to bear the lash of their tongues till we got within three or four yards of the landing place of the temple and then we jumped ashore making the best of our way to one of the gentlemens chambers to prevent the scandal and disturbance that would have ensued had they come up with us  sometime after this a married gentleman of my acquaintance desired me to accompany him and his spouse to greenwich to which i readily assented being glad of the opportunity to make knownn my affections to miss jenny their chambermaid we stopped at the gun tavern at billingsgate and put three bottles of wine into the boat to animate our spirits and excite mirth and gaiety in our passage to the intended port the gentleman asked me if i could recommend him to an inn yes sir i replied and the best in town where i have been very civilly entertained the landlord knows me perfectly well and i will engage that you and your lady shall be accommodated to the utmost of your desires and as for miss jenny says i in a jocose manner i will recommend her to a brisk young fellow that is worth money though he serves as a drawer in the house jenny blushed the lady laughed and my friend drank a brave bumper to the good success of this new amor  in an hours time we landed and i led the way to my inn the greyhound where the master expressed a great satisfaction in seeing me and returned me thanks for the favor i did him in recommending his house here we ordered a supper and i took an opportunity whilst jenny was in the kitchen to let her know how passionately i loved her and by a steadfast observance of her eyes found that my proposals were not disagreeable wherefore i holdly urged her to yield to my embraces could it be managed with secrecy whereupon i faithfully promised to contrive the matter with so much privacy and cunning that none in the house should have the least occasion to dream or suspect any thing of our amor with this solemn assurance of secrecy confirmed with a volley of oaths and imprecations jenny consented and the only difficulty remaining was to engage the chambermaid to be faithful to her trust wherefore i immediately took her aside and sliding half a gui into her hand imparted my design to her who promised to perform her part to my satisfaction at supper we were exceeding merry amd i was highly pleased at the conceit of my new favorite when we ogled each other as the figures in an old suit of hangings  the hour of repose drawing igh my friend called to the chambermaid to show him a room with two beds in it one for himself and spouse and the other for miss jenny who the lady being big with child was deired might lie in the same chamber with them but it was all in vain for the artful hussy well versed in intrigues with an hypocritical cant and smile declared that would the gentleman give her fifty pounds she could not oblige him with that favor for all the rooms except those reserved for our lodgings were taken up and engaged the gentleman being an easy credulous person believed what she said was true so ordering her and jenny to light them to bed took his leave of me for that night as soon as they were gone up stairs i called for a bottle of wine and sat smoking my pipe with impatience waiting the return of my mistress who as soon as she had undressed her lady and put her to bed came and sat down by me and presently after in came my true and faithful confident whom i desired to sit down and bear us company when the bottle was out i desired her to show us to our room and bring a cooltankard with her up stairs the chamber we lay in was up two pair of stairs backwards and commodiously contrived for the like intrigues for there was two doors to it and a private pair of stairs unknown to any but us and the people of the inn so that supposing the gentleman had had any suspicion and should have attempted if he had known my apartment to surprise us it was morally impossible that he should succeed in his design for as i locked the door fronting the great staircase before we went to bed so i could easily have concealed my doxy by turning her out at the private stairs but poor gentleman he i suppose had something else to think on for although jenny and i lay together during our whole stay there neither he or his spouse ever imagined any thing of the matter in about ten days we returned to london where i visisted him as usual and by private billets appointed my charmer at the blue posts without temple bar she was truly observant to my assignations managed her growing burden so artfully that although she lay with the other maid yet neither she nor her lady for a very considerable time observed that she was with child till at last unable to conceal her public shame any longer she quitted her service and took private lodgings from whence she daily plagued me with fulsome letters stuffed with nonsense and love with which being pretty well cloyed the remembrance of her former embraces was grown not only grating but loathsome however rather than to suffer her to lay the child to me i appointed her a meeting where to acquit myself with honor i gave her a purse of guineas and there took my final leave of her neither have i ever heard of her since nor would the gentleman or his lady have been acquainted with this our amor had i not now published it to the world but notwithstanding these excesses clarinda by merit claimed the greatest share of my affections and being acquainted with all my follies and extravagancies she often with an engaging and persuasive air represented the dismal state of want and griping penury which she clearly foresaw must be the future issue of my profuse and licentious manner of life and as often with repeated assurances of real love and sincere friendship warmly pressed me to desist and leave my vicious courses but all her tears and amicable admonitions proved abortive and unable to curb and restrain me in the full career of my lawless passions that blindly hurried me on to my utter ruin however to do her justice although she knew the parties of whom i had borrowed considerable sums of money and doubtless might by a discovery of my affairs been amply rewarded by them yet so extensive was the generosity of her soul that she disdained so vile and sordid a practice and detested and abhorred such mean and mercenary views  sometime after this i went to windsor with my particular and worthy friend capt l his spouse and a young lady a relation of his we were very merry in our journey and during our residence there we enjoyed all the diversion of a rural life for having a coach and four at command we took the benefit of the morning air in the park and her grace the duchess of marlborough being then in london we frequently visited her lodge celebrated for its curious and inimitable pieces of painting and in the afternoon drove to the ancient college of eton famed for learning and so eminent in the numbers of bright and ingenious gentlemen who are deservedly deemed the pride and glory of their country nor was the castle unobserved that noble and magnificent structure so much honored with the presence of our ancient monarchs and greatly ornamented and embellished by various and bizarre figures formed in different shapes from numberless arms by the ingenious and artful contrivers here is also a beauteous terras commanding a delightful prospect of all the adjacent country and from whence the curious spectators are gratified with a view of the stately cathedral of st pauls in london love and gallantry were now the fool topics of our conversation and the young lady being single i made honorable proposals of love to her with which neither she nor the captain or his lady were in the least displeased in a fortnights time we returned to town and stopped at the st albanstavern in st albansstreet where we ordered a supper and the footman to bring the arms that we carried into the country for our safeguard and defense into our room after supper we drank plentifully and wine growing more potent than reason the captain for variety sake would kiss my fair companion whereby i thinking my property infringed opposed his intent upon which words arose and the pistols lying on a marble slab in the room we each of us hastily snatched up one of them and presenting attempted to give fire but were providentially disappointed in our design by the diligence and care of the footman who had unloaded them well knowing the capricious temper of his master when disguised in liquor the ladies were sorely affrighted at this surprising rencountre and skreamd out at which the landlord and his drawers came in upon us and seeing us for we had thrown down our arms hard at it with our fists parted us and calling two coaches sent us home to our respective habitations next morning when i awaked i was ignorant of what had happened and about eleven the captain came to see me then we went to take our mornings draught when upon saying what news sir news quoth he my wife tells me that you and i were going to murder one another last night on miss bs account but i declare upon honor that i knew nothing of it and since it was a mad frolic i will engage the young lady to be at my house this evening and shall expect your company there likewise i punctually obeyed his orders and we spent the evening very agreeably all strife and contention gave place to mirth and gaiety we asked the ladies pardon for putting them in a fright which they readily granted and miss b with a pleasing and jocose air added that she had conceived a much better opinion of herself than she ever had before since two such gentlemen at the hazard of their lives had contended for her favors whereupon bowing we returned the compliment and it now growing late i waited on miss home all night i was no more master of my own person but passed the tedious night racked with alternate hope and fear the next evening i sent for the captain to the queenshead tavern in holhorn and there to ease my torment disclosed my ardent passion he gentlemanlike in an open and free manner told me that her fortune was but small and that too in the hands of those who he feared would not without difficulty surrender it however said he if you are upon honorable terms i will use my interest to bring miss to a compliance sir says i i should think myself undeserving of that frieudship you always professed for me should i even presume to entertain the least glympse of a dishonorable thought for a young lady any ways releated to your worthy family hereupon the captain well pleased with my generous reply told me where her uncle lived and in a friendly manner advised me to apply to him who being a gentleman of fortune if he approved of my proposal would inevitably compel her guardians to pay her fortune upon the marriage day pursuant to my friends good counsel i went to he uncle and to him opened the whole affair who seemed very willing for the match and promised his friendly assistance for the recovery of her fortune  nothing now remained but the usual ceremony of a ew days courtship and therefore i with free consent and permission of her friends visited her daily but as the old saying is many things happen between the cup and the lip for this young lady had a younger sister who for the first two or three days that i went to the house treated me with an air of indifferency even little inferior to that of illmanners however i too no notice of it but continuing my courtship a usual i soon saw the scene was changed for she it seems at my first coming being ignorant of m intent resolved to resent the affront which she thought was offered her in preferring her sisters company to hers when we went the above mentioned journey being apprized hereof i communicated it the captain and desired him to use his endeavors to repair the breach and appease the young ladys seeming indignation he at first seemed to slight the affair as merely trivial and frivolous till seeing me very urgent and importunate he then promised his friendly assistance to accommodate the seeming difference and therefore gave the two sisters and me an invitation to sup at his house after supper he very genteely and with so much prudence excused both himself and me in the choice of our companion to windsor that they were both highly pleased and were extreme good company particularly miss fanny who was naturally of a more gay and airy temper than her eldest sister and although she had not the finest of faces yet so graceful was her air so easy and engaging her behavior and so soft and alluring her voice not strained by art but by the mere effect of the lavish bounty of nature that she captivated the hearts of all who had the pleasure of her company upon the captains request she favored us with a tune on the spinnet and to perfect the music joined so melodious a voice that transported with ravishment and delight i thought myself in paradise twas then that i began to repent my choice miss bs charms once so prevalent now appeared as mere phantoms and illusions and fanny reigned sole mistress of my affections  however as i thought it was not prudence in me to disclose this sudden change i behaved myself as one indifferent to her and insensible of those amicable qualifications that she was perfect mistress of in short having paid our compliments to our generous host and hostess i waited on the ladies home  the next day i began seriously to consider wha would be the consequence of breaking my affai with the elder and making my addresses to the younger when upon mature deliberation it appeared to me so vile and scandalous an action after such mutual and solemn assurances of fidelity that fearing as with just reason i might that should not succeed in my design upon fanny fully resolved of the two evils to choose the least and therefore with great difficulty and violence to myself i broke off the intimacy and after wa entirely regardless of that love that at first i ha so warmly pursued  next door to me lived one mr elias brown peruke maker who had by his marriage and success in trade acquired a very handsome fortune this man had one only daughter ahout sixtee years of age a likely young girl enough an well educated upon some trivial difference tha arose in my fathers time between him and m brown our families were at variance with eac other but upon my fathers decease all contention and animosity ceased so that from being in a manner strangers to one another we in short time commenced an intimacy and friendship by this means i was admitted as a membe of the weekly club held at the goldenlyon tvern in fleet street on thursday moreover o custom was every saturday to dine at the castle  kingston upon thames where we usually drank hard and played high and mr brown finding that notwithstanding my youth i was master of that valuable art of secrecy placed an entire confidence in me and made me privy to all his intrigues and lawless pleasures this intimacy of the fathers gave birth to the daughters love that afterward proved both her ruin and mine she took all opportunities of being in my company and frequently staid so late at my house without the leave of her father and mother that in a little time it became the public talk of the neighbors and almost the whole town and as fame is generally attended with falsehood some there were that scrupled not to report that i was more familiar with her than was consistent with the modesty of her sex but this accusation i take god to witness was utterly false for upon my hearing that her character and reputation was so so grossly injured and that those malicious aspersions arose from the innocent pastimes with which we amused ourselves together i acquainted my neighbor brown with what i heard was currently reported concerning his daughter and me and furthermore desired him as he tendered the welfare of his child to keep her away from my house he heartily thanked me for my good counsel and accordingly removed her to her cousin hs at mile end where she continued near three months but not without sending me a letter or two to let me know she should be very glad to see me at the place appointed in the same  but i who had no thoughts of making her my wife out of friendship to her father scorned to take advantage of her youth nor ever answered her billetdoux or went according to her request to the place of assignation in the mean time my intimate and bosom friend f f proposed to take a house on eppingforest the rent of which he said was twentyfive pounds per annum whereupon i promised to become his tenant for one room and moreover to send down some household goods to furnish it withal f laughing said but are you willing to have leases drawn in your name for you know how my affairs stand yes sir quoth i withal my heart provided that you will engage for the payment of the rent by all means quoth he thus we concluded upon the hire of our country seat and over a merry bottle christened it langley hall about a week after i sent down the goods according to my promise and likewise for my part in the housewarming a large ham and two gallons of brandy soon after my friend f and i with some other merry blades went down to our country seat where we staid three or four days on our retur an accident happened to me that had like to have proved very fatal but i verified the old saying naught is often in danger but never hurt for being three parts mellow and mounted on a golding of great spirit and courage by my frequent tickling him with the spur he in spite of all i could do ran away with me till i came to hackney river where to punish my courser for his obstinacy and cool his courage i clapped spurs to him and plunged him into the river down he fell broke his knees and in the fall pitched me clear over his ears where for some time i could not recover myself but by good fortune at length i regained my legs and kept puffing and blowing like a porpice till my companions came up and seeing me in that pityful condition dispatched old charon to take me up and waft me to the other side of the ferry whence like a drowned rat i went dripping along stripped myself and got half a pint of brandy made hot and went to bed where i lay till my shirt and clothes were dried by the fire in the evening i rose and returned to london and adjourned to the old place of rendezvous the trumpet tavern in sheer lane where we passed the evening very merrily but i resolved for the future never to be guilty of the like frolic again  sometime after this mr brown thinking that absence had sufficiently abated the warmth of his daughters affections sent for her home and i out of good manners went to compliment miss on her return but alas her absence had only served to smother the amorous flame which by frequent interviews soon burnt with fiercer rage in fine one morning the old gentlewoman sent for me to breakfast and then proposed very advantageous terms of marriage with her daughter and urged me to a compliance with very great warmth and zeal furthermore to corroborate her argument down came miss nancy with her hair disheveled her eyes flowing with tears and her dress careless and negligent see says the mother i  canting tone in what a pickle poor nancy is how can you be so cruel and hardhearted as not to return her love come come neighbor langley i will engage you will have no occasion to repent of your bargain mr brown and i shall never have any more children and when we die you will come in for all at the word all which had a far greater impression on me than what she had said before i pricked up my ears and seemed to hearken to her with pleasure and nancy who was before cruelly in the dumps now began to revive and put on the air of joy in short i told mrs brown that since it was an affair of such great consequence i must desire a months time to consider of it and that then i would give her my final answer upon this she was well satisfied and i took my leave of them for the present  now i began seriously to consider the state of my affairs and finding by the private accounts that i kept in my pocket book that the payment of those several large sums borrowed on jewels of a considerable less value than what i had fraudulently pledged them for was within three months of its expiration i thought my circumstances in a very melancholy posture and my case almost desperate for if i should not redeem those pledges pursuant to contract my credit and reputation would be entirely lost and on the contrary i honor and honesty should have the ascendan over fraud and villainy then i should be  great sufferer thereby wherefore i resolved tha since i had begun to play the villainous part that  would at all events complete it thus determined there nothing now remained but the manner o effectually executing what i so fully intended and was so steadfastly resolved upon marriage i considered with myself would not only furnish me with a pretty sum of ready cash but would likewise corroborate my credit and strengthen my interest for as the greatest villainies are carried on and supported by the specious pretect of sanctity and dissimulation so i thought it was but a reasonable supposition that the town now generally acquainted with my frequent debauches would upon my entrance into the connubial state judge me thereby reclaimed and become a sedate and sober man for this reason sometime before and after my marriage i gave due attendance at the romish chapel in lincolnsinnfields and in about three weeks time i invited mrs brown and her daughter to supper i told her that upon a mature deliberation of her proposals i was willing to acquiesce and condescend thereunto on the following terms viz that mr brown should be at the expense of the weddingclothes and pay the stipulated sum on the morning of the weddingday she readily agreed and promised her husbands punctual compliance with my demands furthermore as a surety to bind the bargain i gave the old gentlewoman a ring set with rose diamonds in form of a coronet nanncy was now all life and gaiety and by her parents approbation as well as mine acted the part of a mistress in my house with the same freedom and authority before as she did after the ceremony was performed but alas poor girl she little thought how short her reign would prove and how the sunshine of her glory would speedily be darkened and eclipsed by black impending clouds that threatened sure though not immediate destruction and endless woe but notwithstanding this engagement and solemn contract with nancy i continued my lawless embraces with clarinda whom i made my counselor and confidant in the most secret transactions of my life and therefore although to satisfy my intended spouse and please her parents i turned her away soon after marriage yet i frequently kept company with her afterward and made her several considerable presents mrs brown immediately purchased all things suitable for the wedding and also was so very indulgent as to bring the several patterns of silks and laces designed for nancys parapharnalia to me for my approbation thereof this courtesy and the richness of the dress so pleased me that i made her a present of a gold watch and chain and likewise a brilliant diamond roundabout ring that she might appear in the fashion of other married ladies and now the license being taken out and all things ready for the consummation of our nuptials mr brown desired me to six the solemn day which he said he should choose on that of his birth day but i declined so speedy an execution on account of a tour i had promised to take with some friends to a gentlemans seat in essex and desired the marriage might be deserred for three weeks longer which favor was easily granted and now all things being agreed on i bethought myself of a clergyman of my acquaintance a gentleman void of a living and reduced to a low state greatly inferior to that of his profession nevertheless he was a boon companion told a merry tale and sung a song with a good grace and by his industry made a shift to get a red face in the service of the church for having given my word to this gentleman that he should be my sacred magician whenever i altered my condition of life i thought myself in honor bound to perform my promise therein i therefore sent for him to the bull head in lincolnsinnfields where over a merry bottle i acquainted the doctor with my intent and enjoined him to be ready on the day appointed for the performance thereof having thus prepared the minister i went down in the country and after a sincere and hearty welcome returned to london on the evening before our appointed nuptials when after having drank a bottle or two with the innkeeper where my horse stood at livery i went to mr brownes who had prepared a handsome supper for my reception where none were present but captain hs lady and our family after supper mr brown asked me if i was provided with a clergyman yes sir said i and he will be punctual to his appointment at graysinn chapel at eight in the morning well then replied he all is right for i have ordered a coach and four to be here at seven and after the ceremony well drive to tim harriss at egham agreed sir said i so taking my leave went home where according to custom i lay with clarinda all night at six in the morning i arose and went to my neighbor brownes where they were all very busy in preparing the new bride he called me aside and asked me whether i would have the cash before or after marriage before sir said i by all means whereupon he immediately complied with the contract by notes drawn on sir francis child and likewise gave me the writings of a house belonging to his daughter in charles court in the strand and afterward taking a bottle of rum out of his corner cupboard we drank all health to each other now the bride being ready we drove to the chapel where my good friend the doctor was waiting and performed his duty as a gentleman worthy of his profession from chapel we drove to egham where an elegant dinner was provided at mr brownes expense and to use the words of the ingenious mr phillips naught but mirth and joy around the table flowed at four we returned to town and i regardless of my spouse mounted the coachbox and drove to the queens head tavern in holborn where clarinda by my direction had ordered a sumptuous and elegant entertainment to be provided at which mr ln mr hd jun and his spouse the host and hostess were all present about eleven we adjourned to my father brownes where whilst the men drank a bowl of punch the women out of their pious care dished out the bride in bed fit for the reception of her husband  i must observe that we were married on a thursday and therefore i thought if i could prevail on my wife who was one of the church of england to accompany me to mass on the sunday following i should thereby gain the applause and esteem of all those blinded zealots this i confess i did not attempt out of a religious motive but from a thought of private gain hoping by this well feigned hypocrisy to insinuate myself further into the good graces and esteem of the most eminent and wealthy followers of that faith and profession my spouse to oblige me yielded to my request and her condescension thereunto had its desired effect for a merchant in basinghallstreet sent for me next day and commending the meritorious act of making a convert favored me with nine hundred and seventyfive pounds worth of silver on my note payable in a months time this was a great encouragement to me and served further to facilitate my design in running away as much in debt as possibly i could wherefore i resolved to strike while the iron was hot and make as much of my credit as time and occasion would permit for the effectual performance of which i took up large quantities of jewels of several merchants under pretense of disposing of them to several ladies whom i had the honor to serve and in three or four days artfully returned them again telling the owners that the ladies were not as yet come to a full resolution for the purchase of them i likewise took up a repeating watch of one mr vernon in fleet street the outside case whereof was set with large brilliants of the first water in form of a mariners compass betwixt the hours and minutes were interspersed some brilliant sparks with rubies topazes and various precious stones of different colors resembling the iris the rims of the case were also ornamented with costly jewels imitating the twelve signs of the zodiac and on the top of the spring that causes the movement to strike was set a large brilliant of the first water the chain was three continued rows of diamonds and on the top of the hook was a very large oval brilliant in short it was the richest and most curious performance of that nature that had been seen in europe at that time  this watch i pretended was designed for the queen of spain and having the honor to show it to several noblemen and ladies of the highest rank i could have disposed of it to them however i thought it would turn more to my advantage to refuse the sale thereof for this reason viz if i sold it in england the owner would have expected the payment thereof in a short time and on the contrary it was not reasonable to think that he would refuse to wait for the return of foreign bills if it was supposed to be sent to her catholic majesty and now the time drawing on for the execution of my full purport i made it my business to frequent slaughters coffee house in st martins lane where i soon got acquainted with a set of foreigners of whom i enquired into the laws and customs of those countries relating to broken tradesmen that fled thither for refuge and safety and being assured by them that holland was the safest azylum to skreen villainies of that nature i resolved to steer my course thither and therefore went to blands on tower hill to enquire for a vessel that would be ready to sail in about a fortnights time upon enquiry i met with one ts js commander of the cs sloop a gentleman observant of his word if the wind and weather permitted with this captain i agreed for the passage of two persons to have the convenience of his state room and great cabin and gave him a guinea earnest the next thing i did was to get a bill of exchange for five hundred pounds in the name of robert clinton esquire payable to nim or order which being easily obtained i then applied myself to the abovementioned merchants for their jewels pretending that the ladies were now come to a final resolution and would purchase them and now the prices being agreed on i gave them my promissary note three months after date for the same all things being thus carried on with the utmost secrecy i appointed clarinda whom i still kept company to be at the prince williams head at charing cross she was punctual to my assignation and there after mutual assurances of constant love and inviolable friendship i acquainted her with my secret design and insisted on her accompanying me in my voyage thither and that upon her condescension thereunto she should be an equal copartner and sharer of my large fortune which in all human probability was sufficient for our maintenance in a polite and genteel way during the term of our lives but she like a generous girl declined my base proposals and in her defense urged my being already married to a very deserving young lady whom in honor i could not leave and that if she consented to my proffer she should thereby deservedly incur the scandal of the most vile and abandoned adultress in fine all the arguments i could use were fruitless so having engaged her religiously to keep my important secret i took my farewell of her and then resolved that since i could not obtain her consent that i would take my wife over with me which confess i did not so much out of pure love a out of a view of interest hoping that if i should be frustrated in my design that her father out  love and regard to her would look with a favourable eye on me and impute my misfortunes or rather ill management to the folly  youth  wherefore as soon as i came home i proposed  my wife a country journey on the sunday following and ordered her to get ready and pack up all he clothes my intent being to stay there for three week or a month in the mean time i hired a chaise an four for two days to be ready at the time appointed and to prevent my being seen or taken notice of i passing through the city i ordered the chaise to wa for me on st margaretshill southwark i the sealed up my jewels bank notes and the abovementioned watch with bills of exchange amounting i all to the value of nineteen thousand or twenty thousand pounds in a little trunk and meeting the captain at blands pursuant to his appointment on friday at four in the afternoon i gave the trunk in his custody with a particular charge to lock it up i his bureau and took a receipt for the same being well assured by him that he would sail from gravesen on the monday following in the evening i went  my father browns and acquainted him with my prtended journey into the country with which he seeme well pleased it being the long vacation time in  morning i gave my journeyman charge of the shop an left all my plate standing therein least the remove thereof should cause a suspicion amongst my creditor and intercept my intended flight i likewise ordered him to pay all such trivial sums as were owing to my workmen  and now my spouse and i having taken leave of our parents called a coach and drove to the abovementioned place where the chaise and four were waiting according to my order then discharging the coach we went into the kings arms and breakfasted from thence we went to gravesend and put up at the faulcon where i paid two guineas and an half for the discharge of the chaise according to agreement  on sunday we dined with the captain and other gentlemen and ladies that were going passengers with us on monday morning the captain according to his promise heaved up his anchor with the wind s w all the passengers with my spouse went on board but i staid ashore till the captain went off which was nigh an hour after and now the ship being adrift lay to for his coming on board in the mean time as i was drinking with my landlord in his back yard fronting the water i espied a one eye game cock which i purchased for half a crown for a venture in holland now the captain having completed all his business ashore hurried me and my new purchase on board we then braced about filled our held sails and spread all the canvass we could to the welcome gale that freshing on us wafted our ship the next day to the bombkays at rotterdam where we went ashore and by the commanders recommendation lodged at the sign of the koning van england or king of englands head kept by one john gadbury on the vine haven  the next day captain j came to dinner with us and acquitted his charge honorably thus all things seemed to favor my undertaking and i being of a vain and aspiring temper resolved to pass for the younger son of my lord f and to the end that i might make an appearance suitable to the dignity that i had falsely assumed i ordered a tailor to make me a rich suit of clothes and as it happened one mr loven a decayed gentleman quartered at the same inn with me who speaking the dutch and french languages to perfection with him i contracted to be my gentleman and interpreter and to do him justice he faithfully executed the trust i reposed in him this gentleman i ordered to hire three french footmen and cloth them with the utmost expedition with my livery which was blue cloth turned up with red scarlet waistcoats and breeches trimmed with silver and broad gold laced hats as to the coach mr laven informed me that it was customary in holland for all persons of quality except foreign ministers to hir their equipages as they had occasion for them there being many grand and stately ones kept for that purpose  having thus settled my equipage and servants after the nicest and richest fancy i resolved to devote myself to pleasure for some time although in the interim i privately enquired for a gentleman of worth and integrity to whom i might with safety commi the trust of my effects that if peradventure my creditors should come over in quest of me that they no finding any thing valuable in my possession might no think it worth their while to give themselves any further trouble about me but rest contented with those effects i had left in england  now i must observe that upon my return to my quarters i frequently found the abovementioned captain in company with my spouse however i took no notice thereof but on the contrary always entertained him with the utmost courtesy and good manners but one night as we were in bed i asked her the meaning of the captains frequent visits and whether he endeavored to show a more than lawful love and respect for her hereupon she frankly told me that she believed it was the captains design to betray her virtue for that he often expressed how passionately he loved her that therefore she had used all possible means to avoid his company but found it a very difficult matter which gave her cause to suspect that he had bribed the landlady to acquiesce in the pursuit of his amors wherefore she earnestly requested me to provide fresh lodgings where she might be more retired and shun the vile impertinence of the said commander well pleased with this open and generous confession i highly commended her honor and integrity but desired that she would not offer the least affront to the captain i artfuly said until i could be further informed of the punishments inflicted on persons in adultery by the severe laws of the united provinces upon consulting with my gentleman who was well versed in statutes of that republic i found that the penalty on such henious crimes was immediate forfeiture of all the delinquents effects and close imprisonment during life as a satisfaction or atonement to the injured party for the dishonor  one day hearing that there was to be a cockfight i ordered one of my servants to prepare mine who had been for some time in keeping to enter the lists and by my spouses earnest entreaty i took her though contrary to the usual custom of the ladies with me to see the pastime in short i backed my cock against the opposers and he by good fortune at one chance blow killed his antagonist by whose unexpected death i was a gainer of about ten pounds highly pleased with my success i returned home and it being summer time we seated ourselves under a shady tree that fronted the inn door and called for a bottle of claret but had not been there long before the captain came and joined us and being informed of my good fortune wished me joy i returned the compliment and nancy with an air of gaiety desired that i would favor her with the winnings for the purchase of some dutch toys i replied with all my heart my dear for this and all that i have is at your service and thereupon immediately flung the money into her lap soon after this i saw her countenance change and asked her what was the matter but she made me no answer whereupon madam said i what are you dumb this rash and hasty expression so nettled her that she threw the money into the street which i knowing the value of better than she ran and picked it up swearing that since she had abused my generosity i would give her sufficien reason to repent it but my passion was over and by mr js mediation i promised to forgive and forget that silly flight of youth  hereupon the captain proposed a tour to the hague which was with pleasure agreed to and w next morning set out for that agreeable rendezvous of nobility where we dined in a sumptuous and elegant manner at the sign of the english parliament a celebrated house for polite entertainment from whence we returned to rotterdam where i entertained the captain and some of the other gentlemen with a grand entertainment when the company was gone i used all possible arguments to persuade nancy to yield a seeming compliance to the captains lawless desires and to appoint him pursuant to my direction a place proper for the execution of his villainous design furthermore i urged the great advantage accruing from thence and the diligent care and caution i would take to surprise him blasted in the fruitless expectations of satiating his luxuriant and adulterous passion but notwithstanding all my arguments nancy remained inflexible and could not be induced to acquiesce to this treacherous proposal and in her defense urged that no lucre or sordid gain though ever so great could expiate or atone for that dishonor and loss of character that she must inevitably sustain by condescending to so infamous an act wherefore i thought proper to drop an argument so displeasing and ungrateful to her and to proceed to an affair far more weighty and important viz the security of my person and effects  for the effectual performance of which being recommended to mr h a man of worth and experienced fidelity that kept a large warehouse on the bombkays to him i committed the charge of my cash and jewels and now finding by his discourse that he was well versed in the laws of that republic and more particular in those relating to broken tradesmen that took sanctuary in those parts him i judged to be the properest person to consult and communicate with about my own affairs nevertheless i was not so rash as to let him into the secret of my circumstances at the first interview but taking a note of him for the redelivery of my cash and effects on demand i parted with him for the present and as soon as i came home enquired more strictly of my landlord into his character and repute mr gadbury my host scrupled not to expatiate largely on his undoubted veracity and unbiassed fidelity to his trust and at the same time nominated several gentlemen whose affairs were then in a melancholy and dangerous posture that by his prudence and sagacity had been reinstated in their pristine glory  these words uttered with so much warmth and ardour easily induced me to a belief that mr h was in reality deserving of so great a character and therefore i engaged him to dine with me the next day at the hague and without reserve i unbosomed myself to him in a frank and friendly manner hereupon he promised to be steadfast and true to my interest and advised me immediately to procure a protection from the states general which he assured me would totally exempt me from the jurisdiction of any other foreign laws and as a farther proof of his sincerity he promised by the assistance of a lawyer his particular friend to obtain what he so heartily wished as well for my security as his own satisfaction that i were now in possession of moreover added he it must be done with the utmost expedition least peradventure your creditors being apprized of your intent should by their unwearied diligence and extensive interest undermine your undertakings wherefore you must not regard the expense for favors of that nature are not to be obtained but by a well timed liberalty and some presents suitable to the persons concerned in the management of so great and important an affair your protection which i doubt not you will obtain stands for six months both for your person and effects and at the expiration of the limited time it is easily renewed for a trival cost  charmed with his discourse that inspired me with new life and vigor and banished the gloomy thoughts of fear or approaching danger i pressed him to a speedy execution of his promise and gave him a full commission to disburse whatever he thought proper on that occasion and assured him i would satisfy him and his friend for their trouble and ever after gratefully acknowledged the favor in the evening we returned to rotterdam where we supped together and mr h with repeated assurances of his sincerity and utmost endeavors to assist me in all my designs departed  four days after this mr h and his friend the lawyer came to my lodgings from whence we went to michael edwards at the sun on the bombkays and there the lawyer with an air of gaiety said sir i wish you joy of what replied i of your so much desired protection sir which i here present you with by this extraordinary dispatch you may see how unwearied our endeavors have been to serve you the states are not now sitting but this i have by great interest obtained of their secretary for the space of twelve days at the expiration whereof their high mightinesses will assemble and grant you a further protection for six months longer i humbly thanked him for this so singular a mark of his esteem and friendship and ordered mr h to pay the gentleman one hundred guineas for his trouble  i now rambled up and down without fear or apprehension of any molestation that could arise from any quarter and mr h and i contracted a partnership in merchandise on the following terms and conditions viz that i should lend the said h  000 l at common interest and thereupon add  000 l more to make up a joint stock of  0000 l from which large sum with good success we promised ourselves to raise a fair fortune wherefore that we might immediately proceed to business we went to amsterdam to purchase a ship and there upon enquiry we found that the prince william snow captain b was lying there for sale upon which we sent for the commander went on board with him examined into the vessel and purchased her for   0 l sterling which money i paid on my own account being desirous to become the sole proprietor thereof in the interim i received advice that four of my principal creditors were came ove in quest of me and that they by great interest had engaged the earl of chesterfield then ambassador at the hague to prevent my promised protection and upon the expiration of that which i had to obtain a grant from their high mightinesses to seize my person and effects this news i confess struct me with horror and confusion and judging that if i returned to rotterdam i should inevitably fall into their hands i resolved to lie perdue at the house of mr a at the hague and there wait the issue of their proceedings and in the mean time to dispatch mr  to try if possible to subvert my enemies designs by large sums of persuasive gold i now laid aside my equipage and the grand title of my lord passed for a private gentleman by the name of robert clifton and continued at the abovementioned house nigh upon a week without ever going out of my chamber when one morning my landlord who was privy to the affair came into my room and trembling gave me a letter from mr h which informed me that the creditors having intelligence where i lay were on the road to surround the house and take me prisoner that he used all possible means to renew my protection but that all his efforts therein was vain and fruitless that there had been published a reward of  00 l for securing my person and likewise  00 l more for the discovery of my effects that my tailor had given a description of the clothes that he had made and moreover that my picture was set up at the change and the most public places of amsterdam and rotterdam that the best advice he was capable to give me at present was to exchange my apparel disguise myself and make into the adjacent wood and there wait for his coming which should be punctually at four in the afternoon  scarce had i read the letter before i was alarmed with a confused noise in the street whereupon my landlord looking out of the window cried zounds sir you are taken my house is now surrounded be calm sir said i and send up one of your dutch servants to me i will change habits with him also let me have a lighted candle and a cork immediately the landlord obeyed my orders i stripped put on mynheers habit blackd my eyebrows and passed out at the back door unobserved by any from thence i went into the weod where i lay hid until the time appointed when mr h came highly overjoyed to find me escaped from the fury of my adversaries come sir said he you must now personate the dutchman and we will go to vienna a protected place of ten miles in circumference where i will obtain for you the governors protection and there you may live secure and free from all molestations and arrests this scheme was no sooner proposed than with pleasure agreed to so from the wood we went into the next town and there hired a phaeton or chaise for vienna in the evening we arrived there and the next morning waited on the governor of whom for  0 guineas i received the favor of a protection with a strict charge and caution not to exceed the bounds of his minute territories  the next day mr h took his leave of me with repeated assurances of frienship and a solemn promise not to discover my effects here i enjoyed all pleasures that a place inhabited by unfortunate persons could afford this being but a living goal in epitome however having a sufficiency of cash the honor and respect i met with there in some measure alleviated the hardship of my confinement here i became acquainted with two irish young fellows of daring and bold dispositions who had here taken refuge and sanctuary for murder no crime being reckoned sufficiently black or infamous to exclude the vile offenders from the graces and protection of his tartarean excellency these two rusians for want of better society i daily admitted to my table and on all occasions bore their expenses and they as the only satisfaction that they could make faithfully promised at the hazard of their lives to secure me from all insults and dangers  hither came mr h pursuant to his promise weekly and supplied me with what cash i demanded and assured me that my creditors began to be out of all hopes and that if i patiently submitted to my confinement for a short time that they would soon be wearied out with the large and extravagant charges they were at in their vain search and fruitless pursuit whereupon i charged him to make my wife as easy as he possibly could and let her know that as soon as the storm was over i would pay her a visit but at the same time cautioned him not to let her into the secret of my abode least peradventure through the folly and indiscretion of youth she should inadvertently blab it out nancy i must observe to you had near upon four hundred pounds by her besides her jewels gold watch and snuff box so that i knew she could not be in any want and therefore made myself easy on that head  during my stay here i was taken violently ill which prevented my intended journey to his prussian majestys dominions whither i had designed to go and by presenting my somuch amed and celebrated watch to his then favorite lady flattered myself with the hopes of obtaining a commission in that great monarchs service dr w was my physician who lived contiguous to the house where i lodged and three times a day visited me lying in a dangerous condition in my bed not able to move either hand or foot but racked with tormenting pains both night and day my faithful irishmen constantly attended me and for my security brought fire arms into my room least the governor being influenced by a larger sum or solicited by their high mightinesses should cancel or supercede my protection and thereby expose me to the free arrest and fury of my adversaries  one night as i lay in my bed two of my creditors came and surprised me in my room and insisted on my going with them immediately producing the governors order to compel me to acquiesce to their demands but i excused myself on account of my illness for that night and promised to be ready in the morning to comply with their request nevertheless this answer was not satisfactory for they insisted on lying in the same room with me as a guard to my person here upon my comrades armed themselves with a brac of pistols each and presenting swore that if the gentlemen did not immediately depart that they would severely punish their rashness and insolence for they insisted on that room being their property and that i was only there on sufference hereupon the creditors withdrew but placed a guard round the house swearing that they would hurry me away with them very early in the morning  now the fright i was in dispelled all my pain and i who before could not move myself in my bed now put on my clothes and walked hastily up and down the room ruminating what course to take to extricate myself from this emergency at last i sent for the doctor who had already heard of the affair and with him i agreed that if he would leave open his back door between the hours of twelve and one i would make my escape and take shelter in his house  to this purpose he readily consented and promised to be punctual in the execution of his trust whereupon my companions and i called for liquor plentifully and i seemed to be no ways concerned at the danger i was in  now the time of my intended flight drawing nigh we called for a large bowl of arrack punch which whilst the landlady the sole person then stirring in the house was making i by the favor and obscurity of the night escaped out at the back door and slipped unseen into the doctors house where i lay concealed for nine or ten days leaving my pursuers to curse their unhappy stars and commence a fresh hunt after their flown game  at length growing weary of this intolerable confinement i resolved to venture abroad in disguise and therefore borrowed a suit of womans apparel of the doctors spouse in return for which i gave her a diamond girdle buckle the dress i had was french and therefore i was now obliged to play the part of madam de paris and for two or three days behaved very modestly among the ladies being instructed in my female discipline by the doctors spouse at last i set out for amsterdam having a gentleman of the doctors recommendation to personate my husband as soon as i arrived there i wrote to mr h desiring him to remit me  00 guineas but he never complied with my demand  three days afterward i received a letter from an uuknown hand assuring me that my partner h had proved false and betrayed his trust to me for that he had actually agreed to deliver up all my effects on promise of the abovementioned reward that therefore the only expedient i had left to prevent his villainous design was a voluntary surrender of myself whereupon as the old saying is needs must when the devil drives i determined to make the best of my way to rotterdam where i heard that my creditors were assembled at mr e at the sun on the vinehaven and by a voluntary submission to their mercy and clemency to appease their just indignation and thereby obtain that reward that my partner had by so infamous and treacherous a plot endeavored to gain  the design happily had its desired effect for upon my free surrender the creditors not only used me in a generous and gentlemanlike manner but sent for mr h and absolutely demanded all those effects that i had lodged in his hands threatening upon refusal thereof to seize them by authority in short he was obliged to comply and produced all that eve i had committed to his trust and at the same time brought in a charge against me for cash drawn out of his hands as likewise his bill for attendance and services done for me whilst under my misfortunes the gentlemen as well as i were greatly amazed at his exorbitant demands which were upwards of  00 l but nevertheless to avoid further trouble and expenses they were advised to acquiesce to his exactions the laws of the united provinces being strictly severe in compelling all persons to satisfy the parties by them employed to the utmost of their demands though never so immoderate and now as a gratuity the creditors gave me the sum of  00 l enjoining me to be ready to sail with them for england on the first opportunity  matters being thus accommodated i went to my old landlords at the kings head but to my surprise sound that my wife was gone from thence at the instigation of the abovementioned h who had basely persuaded her to make a tour to antwerp in flanders where he said i was settled upon a further enquiry about her effects the landlord told me that she had honorably discharged the house and took her trunk along with her however i made myself as easy as possible under my unfortunate circumstances but vowed to revenge myself on h for the injury and injustice he had done me and therefore i privately bought a pair of pocket pistols loaded them and then went to his house to drink a glass with him under pretense of accommodating our differences though my full and real intent was to have shot him as an example to deter others from violating the sacred ties of friendship by the horrid and scandalous breach of trust but he unable to bear the reproaches of the populace was gone and so preserved his own life as well as mine which would have been inevitably forfeited to the just laws of the republic severely rigid against homicide  soon after this my creditors and i returned for england on our arrival at london we went to mr barness a goldsmith on ludgate hill and one of my principal creditors who was generonsly pleased to treat me better than i deserved at this gentlemans house i lay all night and the next morning was carried to the crown and rolls tavern in chancery lane where the commissioners of the bankruptcy were assembled here to my surprise i met with my wife and motherinlaw both dressed in mourning for the death of their relation capt holden when after a civil salute the old gentlewoman said ah mr langley this dress well becomes our present circumstances for we are all ruined by your folly mr brown raves like a madam and will by no means be pacified and nancys dutch landlord has ran away with all her cash clothes and jewels whilst she was in quest of you our further discourse was interrupted by an order from the commissioners for me to attend them immediately where after a long and strict examination passed to the content of all parties i was discharged upon promise of giving due attendance to the attorney for the commission and one of the assignees for my encouragement thereunto gave me five guineas in hand after this i took an apartment for myself and wife in devercux court near temple bar and daily wated on the assignees and their attorney for the execution of the then dependant business viz to settle my affairs and cell in my debts which were large there being upwards of eighteen hundred pounds in the book and my plate and household furniture was sold for upwards of twelve hundred pounds more but amongst all my misfortunes none so much grieved me as to see my curious library of books that with pains i purchased for two hundred and fifty pounds disposed of for the trivial sum of thirty pounds and now my wife being taken very ill was removed to her mothers to be attended with all necessary care for a sick person whereupon finding   s per week too much for my fallen circumstances to pay for a room barely to sleep in i discharged the same and took another at   s   d per week in hemlock court  during the indisposition of my spouse i was not permitted to see her being strictly forbid the house by her father wherefore having now settled the book debts and given an account of the respective abodes of the different creditors i resolved to seek my fortune abroad hoping that upon my return i should find my affairs happily concluded and myself thereby master of a great sum arising from the statute mrs brown used her utmost endeavors to dissuade me from my purpose but i remained inflexible and deaf to all her earnest entreaties and therefore mustering up the sum of thirty guineas i went to the barbados coffeehouse where i agreed with captain joseph richardson commander of the friar galley bound for the abovementioned island for my passage thither upon the captains telling me that he should be ready to sail in a fortnight i prepared myself pursuant to his directions and having packed up my clothes and linen i took a final leave of my firiends and went down to blackwall where the ship then lay having given a letter of attorney to my good friend mr g to act for me in my absence  whilst the vessel staid at blackwall i quartere at the whitehorse and being now metamorphose into a kind of sea officer with my laced hat and speckled shirt i passed upon some for the mate of a ship i cannot forget that being accidentally in company with a barber the credulous fool forced me to accept of a handsome ty wig on my note payable on my return an i confss i believe that i could then have ha all the wigs in his shop on the same condition  i now went by the name of james englefield and having purchased  0 gallons of alderma parsonss beer four dozen of wine  00 lemons and a loaf of sugar i went on board an fell down to gravesnd the next day the captain and the rest of the passengers arrived there from whence we sailed with a fair wind at n w into the downs where the winds hanging to the westward we continued for ten days here w stocked ourselves with brandy at a very reasonabl rate from the downs we steered our course t our intended port our company consisting  two ladies eight gentlemen and myself wh one day to my sorrow i speak it some of the passengers began to play at hazard whereupon  who always had a strong and ungovernable inclination to gaming made one amongst them w played high and fortune frowning on me i soo became a broken merchant upon this disaste i thought myself the most unhappy man in the world being bound to a strange place and enie destitute of either money or friends however i amused myself with settling the accounts of one mr morgan a yearly trader to those parts and knowing no other antidote to my present afflictions but patience i determined to bear up against the torrent of adversity with a cheerful alcrity and pleasing hopes of some unectxpeed turn of fortune  on christmas day we went ashore and the ships doctor invited me to dinner with him at a friends house for every one by my apparel judged me to be a young gentleman of fortune in the evening i went to mrs carmichaels the best tavern in charles town where i quartered for a considerable time my good friend mr morgan having given me a fair character to my landlady and also presented me with two moidores for the service i had done him in settling his accounts but this ready cash was soon expended and i considerably indebted to my kind hostess which threw me in so a great dilemma how to manage my affairs that i could neither rest night nor day full well i knew that i could not get off from the island without giving public notice thereof for one and twenty days nevertheless as i had artfully lodged my chest and apparel at a little tavern adjoining to the waterside i waited in hopes of some favorable opportunity of bilking my landlady accordingly some time afterward his majestys ship the gosport arrived in the bay and by good fortune some of the young officers came to dinner at my quarters where in the afternoon over a merry bottle one of the gentlemen asked me if i was not a commander of some vessel for so he judged me to be my apparel which was scarlet trimmed with silver sir said i my appearance i confess may speak me to be such as you please to imagine but to tell you the real truth i am the most unfortunate young fellow alive for here i am involved in debt which i am unable to discharge neither know i how to escape from this accursed island sir replied he briskly if that be all your grievance i will put you in a way to redress it immediately our captain is an honorable and goodnatured gentleman and therefore if you apply to him for your passage to jamaica i doubt not but that he will easily grant your request he comes ashore every morning about nine and your best way is to address yourself to him on his landing before he is engaged in other company in the mean time be cautious how you let any one into the secret and you need not fear success therein in fine i heartily thanked him for his wholesome and highly agreeable advice and the next morning met the commander to whom i freely without reserve made known the state of my affairs and he as generously was pleased to promise me my passage on board the ship and at the same time as a signal ordered me when i saw his maintop sail sheets hauld home to come on board and he would receive me into his care and protection  highly pleased with this unexpected courtesy from a stranger i was not failing in an humble and grateful acknowledgement of so singular a favor and elate with joy returned to my quarters now my sole business was to keep a sharp lookout for my so much desired signal which on the fourth day i espied to my great joy and comfort whereupon i directly took a canoe put my chest therein and went on board captain richardson seeing me go on board the man of war imagined how affairs went and sent his mate to me with three guineas for the whig which i had had of my aforesaid friend the barber at blackwall from barbados we sailed to jamaica and during the passage i had the honor to mess with the lieutenats who seemed well pleased at the merry recital of my various adventures i leave my readers to judge of the confusion that my landlady was in at the news of my sudden departure and now proceed to the relation of what happened to me in the abovementioned island of jamaica  i lodged at mr wades at port royal and by my coming there in the man of war passed currently for one of the midshipmen here in a short time i expended my small stock but was happily prevented from running in debt by an unexpected accident for one night being at supper with some gentlemen of the island one of the company gave me a kind invitation to come over to his plantation near saltpanhill there to spend three weeks or a month with him in a retired life i readily embraced the opportunity as hoping thereby to gain the favor of being recommended to some employment on the island the next day we went to his country seat far more resembling the infernal regions than the pleasing abode of a mortal here on earth  his numerous attendants both male and female were all black and their young like swine lay grovelling in the dust here the parched and yawning earth brought to my remembrance how dame tullis raised up her barren head invoking jove to crush the giddy phaeton in his wild and mad carreer and by his deserved fall to save her vast dominions from an universal conflagration as this gentleman had no european but myself to converse i soon became familiar with him who being acquainted with my circumstances promised to serve me to the utmost of his capacity although i here enjoyed all that the island afforded yet a retired life was not agreeable to my own disposition and therefore i resolved to use some stratagem to get a little cash of him and then go on board the fleet commanded by admiral steward to effect this i proposed to live with this gentleman as his servant or overseer which favor after many solicitations and earnest entreaties was granted and my designed employment was to overlook the negroes in the fishery now as soon as mr lynch for that was the gentlemans name and i had agreed on terms for my wages i freely told him that my chest and clothes lay as a security for twenty dollars at port royal and i most humbly entreated him to advance me money for the redemption of the same to which h readily consented and ordered his negroes t man the canoe and then row me over to port royal and there wait till i had completed  business  no sooner was i landed there but i took one  the slaves with me to a tavern and there gav him a letter to carry to his master the contents whereof were that i returned him many thanks for his kind entertainment and generous assistance but that fortune had unexpectedly provided something for me far superior to the station of a servant that i hoped he would excuse my breach of promise and that as to the cash that he had lent me i would repay him as soon as possible having thus dismissed the negroe i forthwith addressed myself to the aforesaid admiral who generously compassionating my youth and misfortunes was pleased to order me on board the same ship that brought me thither and the commander thereof favored me with the liberty of walking the quarter deck in three or four days the fleet sailed round for port antonio situate on the northermost part of the island where we continued near four months all hands being daily employed ashore in building a dock for his majestys service from whence we returned to port royal and after a short stay there our ship was ordered home to plymouth and there soon after paid off whilst i was on board i had contracted an intimacy with the surgeons mate and we two now became inseparable companions we both lodging at the three guns at the dock amidst the various company that resorted thither was an old gentleman clerk of the dock yard a man of an affable and engaging temper with whom as he daily frequented the house we soon became acquainted this gentleman had a very agreeable young lady for his daughter with whom as she accidentally came to call her father home my comrade the doctor was so smitten at the first sight that he could not rest till he ha engaged her and her father to favor us with their company to supper on the following evening mr b for that was the gentlemans name readily consented and we passed the hours i mirth and gaiety the young lady to heighter our pleasures diverting us with several songs between twelve and one we waited on our company home and afterward returned to our quarters where the doctor was now more inflamed his thoughts and discourse running continually on the perfections of his new mistress but for my part i concealed my ardent passion and resolved to wait a more favorable opportunity of disclosing my love and esteem in an honorable manner if so it may be called in me who had already tied the conjugal knot in the mean time the doctor and i being both flush with money revelled at large till by our repeated extravagancies we had almost drained our pockets and in return to our folly got the french disease  however one day as we were playing at billiards i looking out of the window accidentally saw my charmer standing at the door of a corner shop whereupon giving the game for lost doctor said i there is molly come let us go and drink a dish of tea with her by no means replied he for the people of the house are strangers and consequently would deem it impudence in us to force any acquaintance with them no matter for that quoth if you will not go i will so down stairs i ran to the shop and as in a surprise said bless me madam what good fortune has brought you hither ve oftentimes promised myself the happiness of drinking tea with you but never till now had the opportunity so slipping into the shop i told the mistress thereof that i hoped she would excuse my freedom in desiring the favor of her to make a pot of tea and at the same time flung down half a crown as a satisfaction for her trouble  she seemed very well pleased to have the opportunity of obliging her cousin as she called her and me and therefore desired us to walk into the parlour whilst she prepared the tea equipage here i freely disclosed my mind to my lovely goddess and met with a more favorable reception than i expected soon after in came the old gentleman who merrily said so so mr englefield  see that molly and you are got together yes sir said i and since i have had the pleasure of drinking tea with miss i desire the favor that we may now go and drink a glass together for i have something to impart to you of great consequence agreed to sir replied he and you and i will go first and molly if she pleases may follow after us in short i told the old gentleman how passionately i loved his daughter and that i should be proud to make her my wife whilst we were thus discoursing molly came to us whereupon i showed all possible marks of sincere love and esteem for her in the presence of her father who invited me to breakfast with him next morning all this time my good friend the doctor was on thorns and longed to know the result of our long conferences which i told him was on various subjects but never mentioned that i had made the least prosser of love to molly no that i was to go there in the morning to breakfast wherefore i arose early and under a pretense o taking a walk went privately to mr browns wh received me with the utmost civility and left hi daughter and me alone in the parlour here it was that i repeated my addresses and passionately expressed my inviolable and constant love vowing always to maintain the same fixed and unalterable  length the nymph consented provided that her father would be content to ratify it whereupon warmly saluting her i went into the garden to the old gentleman and desiring him to consummate our happiness by his consent to which he generously replied since my daughter  willing i am content whereupon we went in to breakfast and all my desires being thus happily accomplished i took my leave for the present  as soon as i came to my lodgings i began seriously to reflect on my past folly in engaging myself in so solemn and important an affair without any probability of effecting what i had seemingly carried on with so much success the sole reason whereof was owing to my imprudence for although i made a gay appearance yet i had but ten shillings lest in money and moreover was severely peppered by the favors of a miss i had met with at plymouth wherefore on mature deliberation of the consequences that must inevitably arise from the consumption of my intended nuptials i determined to visit her once more to let her know that that i had received an ordor from my friends to repair to london forthwith on some urgent affair but that upon the conclusion thereof i would return and honorably perform my promise molly seemed well enough pleased herewith but insisted on knowing how to write to me whereupon i told her to direct to the gun tavern at billingsgate now there being a sloop ready to sail that day for london my friend the doctor and i embarked therein and landed at tower stairs  the first thing i then did was to send for mr ge to whom i related my adventures and of him enquired into the state of the bankruptcy hereupon he told me that mr ln and the assignees were involved in law and that no dividend had as yet been made but says he i have two guineas for you that was lest by your worthy friend mr gilpin which i should have sent to you on board the ship that you went out in had i not heard that she was sailed before i could possibly remit them to you mr brown has sent your wife to board in the north of england but as to the particular place i cannot inform you i would therefore now advise you to lodge privately on southwark side where if you send me a direction i will sometimes call and see you hereupon i took my leave of him and went in search of an apartment which by good fortune i soon met with agreeable to my taste it being in a public house where i had the room gratis near unto my mansion lived a mantuamaker and her daughter who i besieged so closely that in a little time her virtue began to stagger and her concupiscence to be a tiptoe in short the sole prevention of her ruin was my being so pickled with the abovementioned distemper notwithstanding this i visited the assignees and the attorney two or three times a week from who i had a constant supply of money though n sufficient to support my extravagancies wherefore being now pretty deep in my landlords deb i resolved to make another trip to sea but wa happily prevented by being one day arrested as  was walking in cheapside at the suit of a person who had been attendant on my wife in her progress to flanders for this debt i was clappe into the poultry compter and now thinking myself secure for some time i applied to my frien ge who generously ordered a surgeon to attend me for my cure in this unhappy place  soon became acquainted with some of the most notorious villains and noted prostitutes of the town from whose bewitching conversation  sucked in the deadly poison of unblushing vice and lost what impressions of virtue and honor i had yet remaining  here i continued near eleven months living on the spoils of the unfortunate whom i used to cheat and cozen at cards and dice etc till being wearied of this long and tedious confinement i entered into a conspiracy with two others to take the opportunity when the turnkey brought in the unhappy women of the town at night to force our passage out but this base design was frustrated by one of the confederates turning informer whereupon i was confined for four days in the strong hold and afterward moved by a duce to newgate where it being the summer time through the noisome and filthy stench of the place i fell dangerously ill whereupon my friends compassionating my misfortunes and to prevent the scandalous reflection of my death in so detestable a place procured my enlargement and generously paid for my board and lodging for three months hoping that in that time i should get into some honest employment  now being pretty well recovered of my indisposition by propitious fortune i crept into the good graces of mr ls attorney who employed me for a considerable time  one day i chanced to meet john gadbury my former landlord in holland who had ran away with my wifes effects whom i dogged to his lodgings and acquainting my attorney for the commission therewith had him secured in the fleet from whence after seven months imprisonment he made his escape to the great detriment of the warden who was obliged thereby to satisfy our demands upon the abovementioned attorneys going to settle in the country i contracted with one kk a bucklemaker in waterlane fleet street to learn the art of carving buckles our agreement was that i should serve him twelve months and for his trouble in instructing me in that branch of business give him a promissory note for twenty five pounds payable six months after the expiration of my servitude for some time i lived very happy with this man till by an unexpected accident he became jealous of me and his wife the sole reason whereof was as follows a relation of mr ks who supplied the widow an at the star music house near the dockhead southwark with wine used annually to give an entertertainment there to which he always invited m master and mistress now it happened that m master was ill at the time appointed for t merrymaking wherefore he desired me to a company his spouse thither to which i readi agreed and the hours passing swiftly away  mirth and dancing we staid there till four ocloc in the morning this innocent though imprude action gave birth to his fears and jealousies a caused him to imagine that i had violated t rights of his marriage bed however he too no notice thereof for the present but resolved  watch for an opportunity to confirm what he a ready suspected  this mr kk had a neice a very pret young girl for whom i prosessed a great respec and used always to wait on her home when s came to visit her uncle now it fell out that o morning as i was in the kitchen and my master  stairs that this young woman came and asked h aunt to take a walk to ington my mistress consented and i out of a frolic offered my service accompany them to mr ls there at the la of nod which being readily accepted i pretend to my moster that i was obliged to attend the a signees in the afternoon and therefore desired  leave to make half a holliday he freely comply with my request and i according to my agreemen met my company at the place appointed but h not been there long before mr kk came  puffing and blowing like a porpice and almost as pa as ashes his first salutation was a blow on h wifes head with a large stick which he wou have repeated had i not prevented him the w men affrighted ran out of the room and he and i sat down together where i used all possible arguments to eradicate these groundless whimsies that possessed his brain but all to no purpose for he remained inflexible and vowed revenge on her wherefore finding it in vain to reconcile the difference and that i should run in danger of my life if i continued any longer in his service i proposed a separation to prevent any farther mischief which he readily agreed to now being destitute of all business i lived on the reversions of a prostitute of the town till growing weary of that scandalous course of life i resolved to go to sea and therefore applied to my friend ge who was so kind as to obtain for me a letter of recommendation to captain tollard commander of the pearl man of w that was going on her station to barbados now i might have been happy and recovered my lost reputation and credit had i been so wise as to have gone on board pursuant to order but so prevalent was my lewd habit of life that i could not quit the ruinous company of my harlot with whom i staid in dalliances of lawless love till the ship was sailed  by this imprudent action i entirely disobliged all my friends and was therefore obliged to keep on in the same abandoned and despicable state of life till one day as i crossed lincolnsinnsquare i was arrested by mr dod the officer at the suit of kk my former master mr dod knowing me when i was in prosperity conducted me to his house where he told me i might remain as long as i could find money i was now in the utmost despair and had there ended my days miserably by hanging myself had not the rope unfortunately broke  now mr dods wife being ill had lodgings in the country and his business often calling him out i was left in the house with only two women servants which made me resolve to take the first favorable opportunity of making my escape neither was it long before i effected it for one day as dod and his follower were gone to kentish town i sent the old woman out for a quart of gin and plied her so close with that intoxicating liquor that she soon fell fast asleep as to the young one i elevated her spirits with sack and walnuts till by amorous toys and merry waggish tales i prevailed on her to grant me the favor of standing at the street door for the benefit of the air in the interim came by a barrow of peaches whereupon come my dear said i will you eat a peach she replying yes sir i gave her sixpence to purchase some of them but did not stay to partake of the remainder for i immediately ran down to templestairs and crossed the water where i lay perdue at the house of one l an acquaintance of mine who employed me to make handles for brushes and afterward recommended me to mr weed a colourman who had built a shed in a field remote from all houses where he boiled his bullocks blood an ingredient used amongst them in the composition of blue this retired life attended with a noisome stench did not long agree with me and therefore i resolved to sell myself for a four years servant accordingly i contracted with one burge who sent me on board the spanish town factor captain gray bound to jamaica in my passage i settled the captains books who sold me for a schoolmaster to colonel sands at port royal who having a plantation at saltpanhill removed me and his children thither for the better convenience of their education here i continued near three months frequently diverting myself in the company of one quimino a facetious and trusty negroe slave belonging to my master till growing weary of the mean and poor diet i met with there i resolved at all events to run away and accordingly about four in the morning i went privately to passage fort but had not got into the boat that was to carry me to kingston before i was pursued overtaken and conducted back notwithstanding this i still remained obstinate and insisted on going to the colonels at port royal which being agreed to i loudly exclaimed against the ill treatment i had met with and plainly told him that i would serve him no longer which so exasperated the colonel that he threatened to have me whipped by his negroes enraged at this menace i swore that nothing less than his life should expatiate the gross affront whereupon he finding me so resolute remanded me to my former captain with whom he having buried one of his hands i returned to england and in the downs was pressed by his majestys ship the portland from whence i went to ilvercomb bristol and bath and rambled up and down the country with my comrade who was one of our corporals o board till having expended all our cash we made the best of our way to london taking the opportunity of passing for seafaring men cast away in the lamb captain morgan bound for ireland with the transport soldiers by which false pretense we obtained great relief on the road when we came to london we lodged in st giless at one of those mean and scandalous houses that harbor strangers for two pence a night but this life not being agreeable to either of us i persuaded my companion to enter for a soldier in the foot guards and for my part i sold myself once more to go to pensilvania and continued on board near a week in the river but there finding indifferent usage and searing to meet with worse at sea i stole ashore in company with a weaver who was likewise going on the same foolish errand from thence we traveled to canterbury where pretending ourselves to be frenchmen we were rlieved by the protestants of that town and then continued on our journey to dover where by good fortune we met with captain jennings who gave us our passage to calais at my landing there i was solicited by by several irish officers to enlist into the french service but would by no means agree to their proposals my companion now parted from me in search of business but i entered myself on board a snow loaded with corn and bound for lisbon at calais we staid seven weeks in which time the captain and all the crew were so involved in debt that we were obliged to put to sea in the middle of the night when we arrived at lisbon the commander was turned out of his employ and we all paid off  now the english fleet lying there i had some thoughts of entering on board thereof but was prevented by messr ibraham and joseph guest who kept a large avern at bll bay who agreed with me sor ten pounds per annuum to serve them in the capacity of a drawer here i must confess that i lived upon the best that the city afforded and each of my masters keeping a separate lady of pleasure i likewise grew wanton and maintained a miss for myself but as this course of life could not be supposed to have any long duration my master soon failed and i thereby was obliged to seek out for a fresh service hereupon i shipped myself with captain brook commander of the sarah galley bound to sanctacruz in barbary and from thence to cadiz and so home to england but the captain and i not long agreeing together i ran away from her at cadiz from thence after i had involved myself in debt i made the best of my way to malaga by by land all through the province of andaluzia in my journey i was greatly surprised at the poverty and extreme misery of the inhabitants chiefly owing to their bigottry they scarcely having bread to eat whilst the pretended religious are pampered up in the most exuberant luxury  when i arrived at malaga i lodged at one obrians almost a month upon credit but finding at last cold reception i resolved to apply myfelf to the clergy who i knew full well were the only persons for me to work on and having observed that it was customary for some of them to frequent the seaside daily i seated myself there on a stone and in a melancholy posture waited for their coming nor was it long before two of the dominican order came and seated themselves by me asking in the spanish tongue what countryman i was i replied in latin an englishman whereupon according to their foolish notion deoming me no christian and therefore incapable of salvation they out of their seeming piety invited me to their convent there to be instructed in their faith in short i verified the old proverb necessity has no law for being then almost starved i was glad to embrace any thing that offered for my immediate relief and pretending to be entirely ignorant of the romish principals i passed on them for a great proficient therein here i lived a retired and indolent life near four months during which time they often pressed me to the acceptance of the habit which i always declined as having an aversion to their superstitious follies though by them artfully contrived to impose on the giddy vulgar these fathers recommended me to the service of a spanish nobleman in quality of page to his lady with whom i lived eleven months till being unfortunately discovered in an amor with his niece whom i had debauched and was forced to skreen myself from the rage of the injured don by leaping out at the window and making the best of my way to the house of an irish tailor of my acquaintance where i lay concealed for a considerable time till at length meeting with a sloop bound to gibralter and from thence to ireland i entered on board thereof our passage was unparalleled and hardly credible for we were thirtyfive days before we got into the bay at gibralter which from malaga is but eighteen leagues distant wherefore thinking that such an uncommon and unusual disappointment portended something fatal attendant on our sloop i there quitted her and offered myself as a soldier in the garrison but was rejected by the followers of mars on account of my stature whereupon having nothing to subsist on i was forced to perform the disagreeable and slavish part of a labourer to the bricklayers which i thought was the greatest hardship that i ever yet met with and therefore i resolved to quit this intolerable fatiguing service and seek out for some other more facile  accordingly i applied my self to the tenniscourt and served therein as a waiter but that likewise did not answer my expectation for my mistress on account of the wet season not having so much company as usual put me to fetch water from the fountain and clean the hogsties which servile employs not consisting with my notions of life i quitted her service and commenced usher to a schoolmaster who not living within the bounds of his scholastical revenues was in a little time compelled to quit the garrison  i now thought i had a fair expectance of succeeding him in that occupation but my hopes therein proved abortive through the malice of some envious persons who represented me to the then governor general sabine as a person sent thither as a spy though in disguise whereupon his excellency ordered me to be confined in the moors castle and in a noisome and filthy cell where i continued for the space of seventeen days at the expiration of which i was released and turned out of the garrison whereupon i shipped myself as cook on board a tartan commanded by one anthony jenkins bound for walidea on the barbary shore we went out in our ballast with four moorish merchants on board that were to freight our vessel with corn and then return to gibralter for the sale thereof  but the master either through his ignorance or adverse winds could not gain his desired port but kept busking the sea till our provisions were almost expended and we reduced to the allowance of three pound of barbary rusk per week and half a pint of water a day these hardships with the ill treatment of the master made me resolve to leave him as soon as possible and soon after it luckily happened that i had an opportunity of effecting what i so much desired for in a  hard gale of wind we sprung our mast and tore our sails to shatters but at length the storm abating we the next day made the canaryislands when putting her before the wind under an old spare maintop sail that we had on board we anchored about eight at night at the coleradas belonging to the island of lancerota our captain being afraid to go into the usual port of that place left his hands who had been all barbarously treated by him should run ashore and leave him now resolved to loose no time in freeing myself from this slavery and therefore about twelve of clock at night my two confederates and i after we had taken three pieces of linen and what else we could find from the moors embarked in the boat and went ashore making the best of our way from the sea side though we knew not whither it led to about the dawn of day we met with a spaniard mounted on a bourico or jackass who civilly bidding us good morrow asked for an old pipe whereupon i having the language at command returned the compliment and favored him with one half full of tobacco whereat he expressed a great satisfaction and at the same time gave me to understand that he was mayor of that town which we then saw on the hill i confess that by his mean garb and wretched appearance i had formed a despicable idea of the rest of the inhabitants which was further augmented at the sight of their poor straggling huts and miserable manner of life their common diet being greens and oatmeal mixed with cold water which they call gosio neither do any of the inhabitants except the grandees and clergy although the island affords plenty of corn ever bake any bread for their own use  in the evening by the help of our guide whom we hired for two reals of plate about a shilling value we reached the port where stood ten or twelve ruined houses with only one which appeared in tolerable good repair which upon enquiry we found was the mansion seat of seignor don bernado trojano cocillio de los esperones the person who assumed to himself the title of the british consul to this gentleman we complained of the ill treatment that we had received from our commander representing him as no christian but as an encourager to mahometism and to prove our assertion we declared that he had four moors on board  in short we made him appear so black in the spaniards eyes that he thought him a mere devil often signing himself with the crossat the mention of his name whereupon he commiserated our hardships and entertained us very handsomely for three days to this gentleman we sold our linen cloth for  0 dollars but not thinking it secure to make any longer stay here least the captain who without dispute would come in search of us should on his appearance confute our assertions and thereby making us appear greater villains than what we had represented him and obtain an order to have us bound neck and heels and carried on board where we could expect no mercy from him or the injured moors we therefore went privately in the night to the place called la valla the residence of the governor where stood two convents one of dominican and the other of franciscan friars where we took sanctuary my two comrades in the latter and i in the former monastery  the priors of the respective orders treated us very handsomely and promised to secure us from all danger if we kept in the confines of their privileged territories we had not been long here before the captain came up to the governors and upon complaint that he could not put to sea without his hands obtained of him an order to apprehend us if found without the limits of the convents it not being in his power to take us out of the pale of the church hereupon the captain endeavored by flattery to persuade us to return on board but all in vain for we not only resolved to continue in our station but also to do him all the prejudice we could and therefore i drew up a complaint to the governor and prevailed on the prior to present it to his excellency setting forth our barbarous usage and that the said commander had moors on board who under pretense of traffic came to take a view of the island in order to return with force and surprise the inhabitants this so incensed the governor that he ordered a company of soldiers on board to search the vessel and to oblige the captain to pay     dollars as a fine for not anchoring in the open port and furthermore to put to sea in ten days time all which he unable to resist their superior power was obliged to comply with  as soon as he was sailed we ranged through the island at our liberty and were civilly entertained by the natives in the best manner they could afford my companions went on board a genoese vessel but i waited for the arrival of the father provincial well knowing that if i had the fortune to get into his good graces that it would turn considerably to my advantage wherefore on his arrival there i played my cards with so much art and cunning that i soon obtained the favor of waiting on his person who i must acknowledge treated me with the utmost humanity with him i went to santa cruz another of the canary islands where i continued in the same post but although i never wanted for the best of victuals nor clothes nevertheless seeing no prospect of getting money in his service the clergy of that profession being generally much addicted to the inordinate love thereof i left him and from thence proceeded to the port of oratava where for some time i was maintained by the english merchants but as courtesies of that nation are not of any long duration i was soon obliged to ship myself on board the charming molly captain patrick mackhugh bound to genoa where we unloaded onr orchilea a weed used by the dyers and after about a months continuance there we loaded with bale goods for cadiz and i now waiting on the captain i had an opportunity of seeing the directions of the several letters that he brought for the numerous merchants of that city and amongst them i found one directed to messrs ryan and mannock whereupon knowing mr mannock to have been my old schoolfellow and familiar companion when in trade i resolved to wait on him and therefore asked the captain liberty to go ashore where i secreted myself all night in a genoese house and the next morning waited on my worthy friend who asked me what service could he do me to which generous offer i replied sir please to obtain my discharge from the commander whereupon he immediately gave me a note to the captain for that purpose yet he absolutely refused to discharge me and the next day sailed for st lucan to load with fruit for london leaving me behind mr mannock as my wages were but trivial advised me not to trouble myself about them but ordered me to take a lodging and come to dinner with him every day until he could procure my passage to england in a gentlemanlike manner he enabled me besides to quit my seamans garb and gave me a genteel suit of his own with shirts hat wig etc and  0 pistoles in my pocket  now i began to taste the pleasures of life once more and buried all my former hardships in oblivion yet still i observed a regular and sedate conduct for fear of disobliging my generous patron till one night in the carnaval time i unfortunately picked up a spanish lady with whom i went home and spent the evening in lewd pleasures sures and as i was returning home through a dark passage my hat and wig were snatched from off my head and at the same time a book that i had borrowed of my friend was picked out of my pocket the place was so dark and obscure that i could not discover the villain who fled as fast as he could and soon skreend himself from my fruitless pursuit  it is oftentimes very dangerous for strangers at cadiz and many other places in spain to frequent houses kept by courtezans because there are frequently if not always fellows who resort thither and make their prey of poor sailors and others who are so unfortunate as to go thither they watch every person very narrowly and are sure to make something of them for if they have not an opportunity of robbing you in the house you are sure to be met and plundered as you return home to your quarters and many times english sailors have been stabbed in dark places in that city a cruel instance of which happened during the time i tarried there  a young fellow an irishman clerk to the captain of the cales factor for cales is more frequently used by mariners than cadiz being returning from a bad house where he had idly spent two days and nights with lewd women and squandered away a great deal of cash he was attacked in the dusk of the evening by some assassins who barbarously murdered him after they had taken all his money and even stripped all the clothes from off his back and i never could hear that these russians were ever detected though the british consul and the commander of the vessel to which the youth belonged published a reward for apprehending them and the governor of cadiz did all he could to bring them to justice and punishment but all the searches that were made by the officers of the city were ineffectual and the rogues were never found out as i ever heard of  this unhappy affair however put most of the british and irish seamen on their guard who rather chose to tarry on board their respective ships than hazard their lives on shore among such abandoned wretches as the courtezans and the villains who resort amongst them who act much in the same manner as bullies do to the common prostitutes who ply in london streets but with a good deal more caution for fear of being clapped up in prison from which they are seldom or ever discharged without being fined and corporally punished but to return to my own story  stung with remorse not so much i confess for the offense as for the loss i had sustained i went home greatly perplexed how to prevent this sad disaster from reaching my friends ear which full well i knew i could not effect but by procuring the book the sole obstacle to the concealment of my past folly but mr mannock had unfortunately heard of the affair by the book being exposed to sale wherefore at dinner he asked me for the same saying that he highly esteemed it as being a present from his brother to him i blushed and after dinner called him aside freely acknowledged my fault and humbly begged pardon for the offense which he generously forgave but cautioned me to beware of the like folly for the future i now resolved since my friend was acquainted with the amor to make the harlot whom i suspected to be an accomplice in the robbery to render me an ample satisfaction for the injury received and therefore i made my complaints to the alcade major or mayor of the town who ordered two officers to go with me to the house and to demand the goods i had lost and if the prostitute refused to deliver them to seize her effects and carry her to prison in short the hussy to prevent the impending storm returned the things and as an atonement for her crime gave the officer and me a dollar apiece and a handsome treat  at cadiz i had an opportunity of keeping company with some spanish sea officers and other gentlemen of fashion who finding me a man of tolerable capacity took some pains to instruct me in the spanish language many authors have mentioned the multiplicity of titles used by the king of spain but without having perfect knowledge of them and therefore i will here give them my readers  he is styled king of castile and leon of aragon of the two sicilies of jerusalem of portugal of navarre of grenada of toledo of valencia of galicia of majorca of sevil of sardinia of cardovia of corsica of murcia of jean of the algarves of algezira of gibraltar of the canary islands of the east and west indies islands and continent of the ocean archduke of austria duke of burgundy brabant and milan earl of flanders tirol and barcelona lord of bisca and molina etc etc etc  i have been in the city of barcelona which is a very ancient one and was built by barea a carthagenian  00 years before christ has a safe harbor on the mediterranean is large well fortified and secured by a castle without it called mount jovi it was well built before the french siege in      which ruined many stately structures and the inhabitants were rich into this place the spaniards put all their foot under the command of the prince of hesse darmstadt the french opened their trenches and carried them on with extraordinary vigor though much retarded by bad weather and the continual fire of the besieged at the same time the french fleet riding before the harbor threw in abundance of bombs the garrison made several great sallies in which many men were killed on both sides but yet they were always repulsed and had not their intended effect yet the besiegers had no great reason to rejoice in their success for being too few to enclose the city it was daily supplied from the spanish army that lay hard by vendosme the french general understanding that it was concerted to attack him by way of a general sally and from both the vice roys small camps resolved to prevent them and therefore leaving a sufficient force to secure his works he marched himself with one part of his army sending the the sieur dusson with the other in the dead of the night and surprising both the spanish camps put all to the rout killing many and dronwing many more who endeavored to get over the river lobregat taking all their baggage among which was the vice roys in it a box with   000 pistoles and  00 horses and mules this success encouraged the besiegers who sprung two mines under two bastions and lodged themselves on them though with the loss of many men and having blown up other mines and made a considerable breach at last the garrison capitulated to march out the   th of august in an honorable manner and be conducted to tarragona it was reported that this city cost the french   000 men which indeed seems incredible but very many died of sickness the bombs thrown in by the fleet had destroyed above half the town but when i was there it appeared like a flourishing city  the trade at cadiz is far more extensive than that of any other port belonging to the spanish monarch either in europe or elsewhere the galleons and flotilla load and unload here when go to or return from the west indies  the spanish monarchy from whatever i have heard or read of it is beyond dispute the longest in extent and if we consider the infinite and great wealth of the west indies perhaps the very richest in the world  the emperor of china generally esteemed the greatest monarch for compass of dominions possesses not above as much land as all europe together makes but the king of spain has more than that in america alone besides all his great dominions in europe and some though not very large in asia and africa yet they are such as are of a considerable value  it is well known that this monarch has lands in all the four parts of the world and therefore the spaniards say the sun never sets upon his dominions they are too large to be described by me who here only give the reader a view of them in the names of the several countries with the archbishopricks bishoprics and universities in them together with the number of towns as near as authors have been able to compute and some hints of revenues which are as follows  in spain twelve kingdoms or large provinces which are castile leon aragon navarre catalonia galicia valencia murcia biscay granada andaluzia and estremadura wherein there are sixteen thousand seven hundred towns eleven archbishopricks and fortyseven bishoprics and fourteen universities the revenues of the crown out of only these provinces here mentioned amount to above thirtysix millions of ducats yearly the income of the abovementioned archbishopricks is near nineteen million of ducats  the prebendaries parishes and other ecclesiastical benifices are worth as much more  there are nine thousand monasteries and in them near eighty thousand religious persons  the estates of the dukes that are grandees of spain are worth near two millions of ducats per annnm and some say a good deal more  those of the marquisses that are grandees about one million and a half of ducats  those of the earls grandees upwards of four hundred thousand ducats  all these revenues are within the kingdom without including the vast income hoth king and nobles yearly have from the west indies and other parts of the world  i have heard the spanish clergy declare that their most catholic and august monarch is the richest and most powerful prince in the universe but we all know this is false however it was not my business to contradict the priests for i always concurred with what they said because i was greatly carressd and led a lazy life and lived very well amongst them during my stay  in africa on the coast of mazelquivir the king of spain has oran penon melillae and ceuta the canary islands being seven in number called lancarote fuerteventura gran canaria tenrife gomera falma and hierro  in asia he has the philipine islands which with others between them and new spain are possessed by the spaniards are above two hundred but the chiefest of them all is lucon which though not broad is above two hundred leagues in length on it is built a good city called manila upon a noble river at the mouth of which is a strong fortress and on the other side the river an indifferent town all these islands produce gold cinnamon and other rich commodities  in america he is master of so many islands on the north sea that the number was never yet known those called kecayes are many and large those of st john de puerto rico about eighty leagues in length and twenty in breadth cuba three hundred leagues in length and twenty in breadth hispaniola above five hundred leagues in compass  the continent of america is divided into two peninsulas linked together by a small neck of land but eighteen leagues over  the northern peninsula is called new spain and the southern peru  the southern peninsula which is all encompassed with the sea except where the isthmus joins it it to the continent and here are many very rich provinces  in these western countries there are six archbishopricks and thirtyone bishoprics but as i intend to have done with this subject i shall proceed to my own history until i land myself once more in my native country  my good friend mr mannock having sent for me told me he had agreed for my passage home and that i must go on board in the evening for the ship would sail the next morning for england whereupon i humbly thanked him for all favors and took my last farewell of him highly overjoyed at the thoughts of my returning one more to my native country but as i passed through the city gates with a full intent to go on board i unhappily met a courtezan a quandom acquaintace with whom i stayed all night but the next morning when i came down to the mould i found to my equal sorrow and surprise the ship was sailed whereupon i was so enraged at this fatal disappointment occasioned entirely by my own folly that i almost resolved to put a period to my wretched life and now being no longer able to stay at cadiz for fear of being seen by my injured friend i took boat and went over to fort st mary and from thence to st lucar where i had heard that one mr brown a wealty merchant resided whose sister had been married to my uncle sir roger langley here i had the honor to dine with this gentleman who made me a a present of two doubloons and advised me to return home whereupon lodging at the house of one mr smith who kept an ordinary for the masters of vessels i fortunately became acquainted with captain whitaker bound for cowes and hamburgh with this gentleman i came home landed at limington and from thence made the best of my way to london where finding that my creditors had received  0 s in the pound in my long absence i was in hopes of receiving the sum stipulated by parliament for bankrupts and thereby reinstating myself in some settled business with my wife mr brown her father being dead in my absence and all the differences now now seemingly thereby to be appeased whereupon i waited on my motherinlaw and to her made proposals of sending for my wife to town which she agreed to but through her avaritious temper refused to assist me with money to enable me to advance myself once more in trade and recover my right from the statute and to obtain my certificate from the creditors whereupon finding my good designs rendred impracticable i gave a loose to false pleasure leading a loose and extravagant lise until i had almost exhausted all my slender gains as likewise a small legacy that was lest me by my cousin brent wherefore i now resolved once more to range abroad in search of new adventures and accidentally coming acquainted with one mr hill a young spark of as desperate a fortune as my own with him i proposed to make a tour to paris in order whereunto we traveled by land to dover but on our arrival there we were unhappily disappointed in our intended progress by an embargo laid on the shipping in that port  where on our return home money being low we stopped john springate of feversham within sight of the turnpike at harble down but upon rifling his pockets and finding no more than three farthings therein not thinking so inconsiderable a sum worthy our acceptance we returned him the same and civilly dismissed him  an account of our being apprehended and commitment to maidstone gaol for this robbery the same day we committed this robbery both of us were taken by a hue and cry raised by the country and after being reviled by those who were set as a guard over us we were carried before a neighboring justice of the peace where poor springate appeared more terrified than we were  as to my part i did not care what became of me for my life had already been miserable enough but my unfortunate fellowman which is generally used by those who engage in bad courses or i may say more properly brother thief knew not the consequence of this affair nor did he seem more affected than a poor country fellow that had robbed a henroost i bid him be quiet and easy and keep up his countenance for i was conscious we had committed the robbery and if the man swore to our persons we must stand committed to the county gaol  after we had tarried near an hour in the apartment where the justice hears affairs of this kind in came his worship with his bouncing belly attended by the constable headborough and tythingmen who all of them seemed to be pleased with the reward of  0 l that they should have for hanging us and quarrelled in the hall even before the magistrate was seated who was entitled to the greatest share  after silence was demanded in the hall allibone the constable who had charge of us was commanded to bring us forward to the place of audience both of us had our hands tied behind us at that time but his worship was so humane as to order us to be untied which was done in an instant  whilst we tarried for a hearing the justice had notice brought him by a livery servant that sir thomas s had called to pay him a visit an to take a dinner with him  his worship departed but returned again presently on purpose to dispatch us one way or other  i had forgot to mention that poor hill whilst we were together in the hall whispered me and said why gill this is only a bridewell job tell me  i shook my head and told him i was afraid it was much worse  at which he appeared to be quite dispirited and very sorrowful  our examination before the justice was but very short springate was called and asked if he knew either of us and was cautioned to be positive to what he swore  he told the justice that we had robbed him but he believed it was only in fun that it is in a merry way for that he had got his three farthings returned him again  however some of the country fellows persuaded him to swear that he was put in sear of his life and told him that if he did not we should ruin him for ever  so the poor fellow very justly swore it we did order him to deliver and swore we would either have his money or his life from my heart i dont believe the man would have troubled himself about us had he not been spirited on by his clownish acquaintance i mean our pursuers and apprehenders who wanted us hanged for the sake of the reward which was sorry pounds sor each of us  on the mans positive affidavit the justice soon ordered his footman to write our mittimus to the county goal where we were conveyed by a strong possee being mounted on horseback with our legs chained under the horses belly and guarded by thirty country loobies the constable who had the commitment riding first with his long staff pitched on his boot exactly representing an officer guarding a poer criminal to the place of execution  at this time the country being pestered with smugglers and as we passed on to maidstone every body imagined we were some of that gang that were reported to be taken in sussex which caused numbers of people both on horseback and on foot to follow us into maidstone town i never in my life suffered so great a punishment as the fatigue of this journey from the justices to prison it being excessive hot weather and in the month of august i could not persuade my guard to stop for a little refreshment the constable pretending he apprehended a rescue was intended by the smugglers  when we approached near the entrance of maidstone town there appeared to me to be as many people as were generally at newgate to see the poor criminals go forth to execution  as i went into the goal i thought to myself poor gill here you have cast you last stone my friend hill nappd his bibb a cant term for weeping and said he was ruined i told him i hoped not but i was afraid we were undone body and breeches till next month meaning the time we were to be tried  no sooner were we unhorsd but the cunning constable delivered his commitment o the turnkey who was a funny dog and on looking at it returned it to the constable telling him he had no business with three farthing chaps and that he must take us to the place from whence we came the silly constable stard and the turnkey snatching the commitment from him again ordered us prisoners both to walk forward into the lodge which we with sorrowful hearts were obliged to comply with  notwithstanding i was under these unhappy circumstances nothing diverted more than the pastime between the constable his attendants and the turnkey who told him as we were the first two prisoners he had ever brought thither he should cal for his two bottles of wine and said he mr constable if you dont i will kick your men out again the silly oaf laughed and ordered the wine immediately which was not delivered before be tippd em the readypullout and what was very merry it went round so fast that before it came to the constables turn he never tasted one drop but oon after more was called for that the constable drank so freely that he was topheavy meaning he had it in his nob and dropped the receipt which the turnkey had given him as a discharge for his delivering us to the keeper of the county goal of kent for the return of which he paid another bottle and after drinking a glass or two went away but soon returned and demanded the horse locks that hill and i were chained with the turnkey told him it was very well and when we were unlocked he should have them if he did not go out of town before but if he did he should receive them by a penny post letter the silly cull went off full of booze and i remained there full of sorrow  no sooner was the constable and his assistants departed but my poor cnfederate hill and i were called before the head turnkey when we appeared he cerberus like ordered us to come to book i put on a very dejected and sorrowful untenance and told him neither i nor my companion ad e sowse to save us from perdition he then ordered us to sit down at a table where he like radamanthus the judge of hell sat to determine complaints amongst the prisoners  we had not been long seated before he called out to a fellow who wos one of the jiggers or understrappers belonging to the goal and the fellow immediately appearing before him made a low bow and desired to know his pleasure here bob said the turnkey pointing to me that gentleman has a good uppershell and desires to borrow a trifle on it  at this expression i stared like a conjurer well knowing that my uppershell was my great coat but however i had no remedy but patience being obliged to comply with this villainous demand and so i was immediately obliged to strip not so much rogarding the loss of my coat as the tyranny and oppression of these sort of fellows who always make the best market they can of the unfortunate persons that are committed to their care  finding myself stripped i looked on poor hill  a pitiful aspect and hill shaking his empty  pitied my condition and said he s afrai  would serve him in the same manner i told him he was in no anger of that for his coat was not worth one shilling but though i was mistn in the stripping lay they played off a new game with my friend as will appear in the sequel  but to return to my story in about half an hour returns the fellow seemingly very joyous running to me in a great hurry and putting three shillings into my hand told me that was all he could borrow on my coat and dmn me said he i believe i have bukd my grandmother meaning the pawnbroker for your poor joseph was not worth half an ounce  and at the same time shaking me by the fist said he friend i believe youre a cock i was under a necessity of pocketing the insolence of this rascal and was glad to get rid of his impertinence and stupidity considering such fellows as he were the only persons that could relieve me under my present unhappy circumstances  poor hill who now looked as cunning as a dead pig asked me what i intended to do with the money i answered him you will soon see an end of it  and just as i was speaking up stepped the turnkey who had then just left company and accosted me in this manner  well friend i suppose my man has been with you to bring you the money on your coat i told him he had brough me three shillings in silver which i had in my pocket  ay replied he dmn these thieves of pawnbrokers they will not lend any thing on a garment unless it is very good and as yours was threadbare i think bob has flung em for he is a funny dog and a special customer to the house and he often gigs it with the old duchess  on this the turnkey was called out to take charge of another prisoner and i was glad he was gone fearing he wanted my little cole having only that to support me  newgate now came fresh into my memory but recommend me to that prison terrible as the name is for humanity for being a prisoner there for debt a considerable time i could perceive how the felons were used by the under keepers and even the master of the gaol himself who at that time was rowland ingram esquire who would come into the common felons ward and hear complaints against the jiggers or runners if they had beat or injured any one  our turnkey of maidstone was a civil fellow enough especially to those who had the cash and of the three shillings i had he was so civil as to accept only of half a crown and when he got near my all he desired one of the followers to put on our darbies  this scene which i never had yet been accustomed to gave me the greatest uneasiness but to do justice to my worthy friend the turnkey he ordered me only a fingle link and one basil which is the iron ring that goes round the leg  when i   brig with my irons on  the block to be likewise  a slout fellow though a poor   i may more properly call him  eeper ordered him to be double irond  i thought was a very great hardship  i expostulated all in my power with these mercenary misreants and begged on my knees that they would not use him unkind because we were far from our friends this however had no effect till the fellow who brings the setters perceiving my friend wore a good pair of buckskin breeches he desired him te exchange them for a pair that would fit him better  mr hill finding himself under a necessity of parting with them made no words but immediately withdrew and gave them to the villain who in return furnished him with an old pair of sheepskin big enough for a colossus his breeches were worth at least three crowns and those he had in return only sit for the rag shed  however this condescension was the only reason that he was not double setterd and a ligh single iron being put on his left leg we were oth conducted to our silthy apartment  in this place were three felons for petty crimes o had been committed since the last assizes one f whom was ill of the smallpox that night we rested as well as we could on the bare board and considering our unhappy condition slep sound occasioned no doubt by the fatigue  our journey the day before  in the morning at the time of unlocking our ward i asked the turnkey if i could be admitted to write a line or two to a friend in london for a little subsistence he told me i was welcome provided i was furnished with pen ink and paper but that not being in my power to obtain for want of cash to supply the urgency i was obliged to sell my shirt which setchd me one and twenty pence  that day i wrote to my good friend mr g informing him of my terrible condition but whether he ever received the letter i know not no answer being ever returned which was a very shocking disappointment to me i really believe the hussy that i entrusted to carry it to the post house sunk the twopence i gave her the week after the mother of a fellow prisoner who daily visited her son was so kind to carry a letter for me which i had wrote to a woman i formerly kept company with near st martins in the fields  this letter was received but not by the party it was directed to she having been married some time before but her sister lodging in the same house luckily took it from the postman and opening it read the contents which she generously communicated to her sister which last lady was so kind as to remit me a    s piece by the maidstone carrier who fafely delivered it enclosed in a letter into my own hands  i would have paid the carrier but he refused to accept of a farthing saying that he scorned to take any thing from a poor prisoner for this generous action i returned him my hearty thanks which he freely accepted of for his trouble and called for two mugs of ale to treat my unfortunate companion and myself  soon as the honest man was gone i perused the contents of the letter which contained some reflections on my former folly and the bad usage she had received from me though the direction of her epistle was no ways intended to affront me under my unhappy calamity i confess i wept heartily and the next day i wrote her an answer which was sent to a place by her own direction by her own desire but i never received any return or ever heard from her again which i was heartily sorry for considering my terrible misfortune  i lived whilst under my unhappy confinement pretty tolerable srequently doing little services for my sellow prisoners in writing petitions and letters to their relations by which i gained their good will and the esteem of all those belonging to the prison  the day the judges came into rochester to open their commission for holding the assizes a gentleman came to the gaol and presenting me with a guinea delivered me the following letter which was directed thus to mr g langley a prisoner in maidstone gaol in the county of kent my old acquaintance i am surprised to hear that you are in confinement for so great an offense i wave all reflections for i scorn to insult the unfortunate i took this opportunity of sending this piece of gold by a gentleman who was obliged to attend the assizes and i wish you a safe deliverance with all my soul i intended to be more liberal but my follies have brought me almost to beggary being abandoned by my wife and despised by my parents  your friend z     the assizes for the home circuit being appointed to be held at rochester for the county of kent we were removed thither with a great many other criminals to take our trials for the felony we stood committed for  it was reported that other indictments would be preferred against me for robberies on the highway but i declare the fact i was charged with was the only one of that kind that i ever was concerned in  on the  0th of march      the assizes on the crown side began before the hon sir john fortescue aland one of the justices of his majestys court of common pleas and being both  reigned and pleading not guilty we were the next day tried and convicted and received judgment of death but the judge was pleased to reprieve us for transportation  under this sentence these pages were written may all young men read them with a proper disposition to avoid by my example the miserable state i have brought myself to a state too frightsul to describe and the very thoughts of which stops the pen yet a state to which numbers are running as full of mirth and nad joy as if their fools paradise was a real one the royal mercy has saved me from an ignominious death and i humbly trust in god that he will give me his grace to amend my conduct and by a thorough and sincere repentance save me from death everlasting  maidstone gaol july  0    0 g langly  finis
