sedley you really have been three weeks without seeing miss bloomer   sedl true i assure you woodford and intend if my resolution holds never to see her again   woodf but i understood every thing was settled between you both and that nothing remained but to name the happy day   sedl prithee woodford no more  it adds to my uneasiness to hear her mentioned   woodf why so   sedl because i find this too susceptible heart of mine cannot so readily erase the impressions her youth beauty and innocence have made upon it   woodf indeed but what reason can you have for wishing it   sedl the greatest in the world woodford   woodf i cannot think so  explain or i shall certainly imagine you whimsical and capricious   sedl when i first paid my addresses to miss bloomer such were the beauties of her mind as well as person that i fancied i had found one all perfect as the first before she fell   woodf then were you in an adamitical paradise   sedl a fools one rather  she received me with such a flattering distinction that i thought myself the happiest of mortals when unluckily her guardians dying put her into the immediate possession of a large fortune   woodf now i should have thought that the luckiest circumstance that could have happened   sedl quite the contrary  thus freed from restraint at the age of eighteen she emerged into all the fashionable follies of the great world without a real friend to advise or direct her   woodf why did not you undertake that office   sedl i did but soon found it was an ungrateful one  so fine a girl independent of interested motives could not fail of attracting a crowd of admirers and    woodf you naturally grew jealous   sedl jealous my heart was torn in pieces  twas then i discovered a levity of temper a thoughtlessness a love of pleasure that destroyed my hopes   woodf psha trifles  foibles like these are as specks upon the sun   sedl ay but in time they threaten a total eclipse  no character however contemptible but was encouraged as a lover  no scene of gaiety however censurable but was pursued with avidity  a thousand instances did i patiently bear with in hopes of amendment  often in the gentlest terms did i convey advice and represent the hazards she ran as often was i forbad her presence   woodf ha ha ha upon my word you took an excellent method of rendering yourself agreeable to a girl of her age and spirit   sedl but when i intended that girl as a partner for life could you blame my cautious conduct no woodford though never man was more sensible of beautys charms than i yet unless those charms are adorned with virtue they make not half the impression   woodf that is a little romantic but pray go on   sedl many times did i rescue her from the most imminent dangers which her indiscretions plunged her into yet still she persevered  at length    woodf hold who comes here   sedl oh it is monsieur finesse  one of my rivals  a fellow whose impudence can only be equaled by his ignorance   enter finesse fin ah

gentlemen by accident hear her cries and tout a fait rescue her   sedl would i had been there  villains   fin oh oui  villains indeed   sedl you see woodford there is another instance of her conduct  do you think it possible for me to be happy with such a woman   woodf i tell you man you are too delicate  though appearances are against her yet i dare affirm that these are all mistakes of the heart which in time her better judgment will rectify   fin true dey be all in de heart  all vivacite noting else  i must find some oder opportunity when i shall have him to himself aside well monsieur sedley i will bid you de good morn  i am going to visit de lady i shall hear someting more dear and den i will call on you at home in private  gentlemen sans compliment i have de honneur to be your very humble servant  exit woodf hearky sedley do you build anything upon this fellows intelligence  a wretch that is an outcast and disgrace to his nation   sedl yet this very outcast as he really is does she treat in the most encouraging manner and without the least enquiry into his fortune or character admit amongst the number of her admirers  but let us change the subject  so then it seems your uncle has civilly dismissed you his house   woodf not so civilly i assure you   sedl dont you think you deserved it captain helm you know has spent the greater part of his life in ploughing the tempestuous ocean and though possessed of an excellent heart has not the least idea of the refined sentiments inspired by a liberal education  you were certain that your whole dependence was upon him yet refused flattering the harmless foibles which peculiarly mark his character   woodf you mistake me sedley i often did till this last affair  but when he commenced my rival my happiness was too much concerned to trifle any longer   sedl well and has he declared his passion   woodf no but as a preparatory step he has given lady younglove who is just returned to town with her daughter to understand that for the future she must not encourage my pretensions as i have nothing to expect from him   sedl so your hopes are all over in that quarter   woodf entirely i called yesterday to welcome my dear girl my beauteous flora to london and was refused admittance   sedl indeed   woodf true and i am now reduced to such distress that unless you can assist me with your advice and    sedl here is my hand  depend upon my utmost i feel too much myself though from a different cause not to compassionate you   woodf i expected no less from your generous friendship but how shall we act  what can i do   sedl upon my word i dont know  i own yours is a critical case  but we must not despair  i believe as matters stand we had best work by stratagem luckily i stand high in the estimation of your uncle as well as lady younglove   woodf you will find him inexorable and her    sedl not proof against flattery  all mankind have their weak side woodford and much may be done by taking a proper advantage of their follies   woodf i wish you may not be mistaken in the present case   sedl never fear  let me see panses no that will not do  stay i believe i have it  suppose i attack lady younglove myself and persuade her that i am dying for love of her   woodf no no that is impossible  twould be too ridiculous   sedl ha ha ha i will lay my life there is nothing easier  attack widows by storm and they cannot resist you  besides her time grows short and as she was in such a violent hurry to get a second husband there is all the reason in the world to imagine her still more impatient for a third   woodf but what end do you propose by this scheme   sedl to serve you but in what manner i have not yet determined  come let us home to my house and consider farther  nay nay no

miss belg i dont find any thing so surprising in that   miss bloom why no that is true but i have now rose a step higher and captivated a lord   miss belg lord or commoner i suppose he will share the same fate with the rest   miss bloom certainly my dear you would not have me be unjust   miss belg no really i would not therefore entirely disapprove of your making such fools of them   miss bloom you mistake child the generality of them were fools ready made to my hand   miss belg some of them might be so but i dont find you are in the least more favorable to men of sense   miss bloom oh i hate your sensible men and take a particular pleasure in tormenting them   miss belg that is very extraordinary  but why so   miss bloom because it adds more to my reputation to lead in chains one of those wise lords of the creation who has sense enough to know i use him ill yet not power sufficient to break his fetters than a thousand of those mincing whiffling trifling goodfornothing pretty master jessamys   miss belg well though i shall never approve of your scheme i almost wish for your spirits   miss bloom spirits my dear  lord what should put me out of spirits  time enough for me to pine and languish when the heyday of my charms are over  mine i am afraid will be but a short reign so am determined to make the most of it   miss belg then i find you do intend to marry   miss bloom yes yes some time or other  it would mortify me prodigiously to die an old maid  no no i assure you i have not the least ambition to lead apes no more than i have at present to be led by one myself  i would only play with the male creatures as a skilful angler does with his fish  amuse myself the sportive summers day bait my hook well for gudgeons see the pretty innocents nibble nibble nibble as fast as i could cast in  draw them out when i pleased  stroke the delicate things and then throw them in again  till evening sun having disagreeably lengthened my shadow pick out the hero of the stream and retire to my rustic cottage content with the pleasures of the day   miss belg but pray in the midst of this round of amusements do you never feel a pang for the loss of sedley   miss bloom if i really thought i had lost him for ever i should be heartily mortified   miss belg dont you think it begins to look like it   miss bloom why i am a little alarmed  for to confess the truth sincerely which in those cases i very seldom do  of all the men that ever addressed me he is the only one who has made an imprestion on my heart   miss belg why did not you use him better   miss bloom it is not in my nature to be serious long together therefore why should he expect it   miss belg consider the many obligations you are under to him  the many dangers he rescued you from which your innocent levity exposed you to   miss bloom that is true but then he should not have taken so ungenerous an advantage of them as to tell me that i did wrong and prescribe rules for my future conduct   miss belg were not those rules for your good   miss bloom yes but we are not always disposed to relish advice   miss belg i really think if you lose him you will never meet with such another   miss bloom if i am disappointed of him i shall never have any other that is past a doubt  and as a proof were he now to return i would frankly own that though i am innocent even in intention of acting wrong yet my thoughtlessness many times leads me into great errors which nothing but the sincerity of my heart can excuse   miss belg it is great pity you did not make this declaration before   miss bloom psha he must take me as he finds me  can he be so unconscionable as to expect that i should draw up my head hold down my eyes put my hands together drop him a low curtesy and say  i have been a naughty girl to be sure but pray forgive me this time and indeed and double deed i will do so no more   miss belg no but he might reasonably expect that you would dismiss your numerous train of followers  and as you have often sacrificed men of worth at the shrine of folly so in return to make a general oblation  offer up a hecatomb of fools at the altar of discretion   miss bloom do i bid the creatures follow me   miss belg nor dont you encourage them when they do   miss bloom ay that is because i hate ill nature   miss belg but are not you afraid your reputation should suffer   miss bloom oh my dear not in the least  every thing we do becomes us  our very frailties are pleasing   miss belg consider the    miss bloom positively i will not consider about the matter  so come along and always remember these neverfailing lines   if to her share some female errors fall look on her face and you will forget them all  end of the first act act ii scene captain helms captain helm

and you should make some allowance   helm no that is not my way  so if he has a mind to gain the wind of my affection he must sheer off from the little frigate he has so long kept in chase and let me

fourth act act v scene lady youngloves enter flora and frippery frip upon my word miss this is the most oddest affair i was ever extricated in during the whole current of my life  after getting so artificially off as you did for mr sedley to dissuade your lovyer to return you to your mamma again instead of flourishing away to scotland without redemption  well i own its above my compacity to find out   flora ay or mine either  i am sure i never looked so foolish in all my life as when i found we were not to be married   frip and well you might miss to have all your schemes confisticated in such a manner   flora and then frippery to be disappointed of such a delightful jaunt and exposed to the ridicule of all ones acquaintance  it is enough to make me cry my eyes out   frip ay my dear so it is  and pray what end did he impose by this wise scheme   flora why as by such a precipitate step we should entirely forfeit the favor of his uncle and my mamma without the least chance of recovery he persuaded woodford to wait the issue of a scheme which he is going to execute immediately  for my part if it does succeed i shall lose half the pleasure i expected in being married in scotland   frip you are right miss and speak the sensations of most of the girls who go there  why i might have been married three years ago to mr scraper lord supples footman but that we could not raise money enough between us to get there and i was determined never to follow the vulgar fashion of being asked in church   enter lady younglove lady young so my pretty runaway miss i have you safe

me for   sedley i am glad of it madam as i must speedily put you to the trial   lady young i think sir i can stand any trial you will please to make   sedley i wish we may find it so madam  by your misplaced and with justice i may say ridiculous inclination my lady for i cannot call it love you have been so far blindly infatuated as to make me sole master of your fortune without reserve    lady young how  am i awake   helm faith i believe not  but there seems a storm rising that will quickly call all hands to work   flora well i declare this is charming   sedley i am above making an improper

cheerfully prefer poverty and a cottage with the object of my choice before riches and the most splendid palace with the man i dislike   sedley right madam the temple of hymen was reared by virtue and

permanent felicity arises from the mistakes of the heart   finis
