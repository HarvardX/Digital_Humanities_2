hannibal at the gates or the progress of iacobitism with the present danger of the pretender  pene occupatam seditionibus delevit urbem dacus and aethiops hor london printed for j baker at the blackboy in pater nosterrow      price   d  hannibal at the gates or the progress of jacobitism etc how near the brink of ruin we have stood and how often we have been rescued from impending dangers by the very finger of providence the desperate struggles that have been made for liberty through the several stages of the last century are sufficient indications yet no sooner has the tempest abated and the horror of the scene cooled upon our minds but as if we were fond of making fatal experiments some restless and implacable spirits have troubled the air afresh and thrown us into the same hazardous circumstances again and what makes our case the more deplorable is that the same stale artifices by which the people have been so often deluded are without the least coloring or varnish trumpd up successfully at every turn when either the ambition or necessities of a few pernicious instruments are to be served a due reflection upon the easiness and credulity of this nation has made me often pronounce us the most unthinking animals in nature and even below the sylliest species of the whole field who are never caught twice in that snare they have been once intangld in it is really amazing that in a constitution so well guarded and where people daily feast upon the blessings of liberty that the bias should run so strong to slavery especially when the open and avowed enemies of freedom and the protestant interest lie within so small a grasp but then if we throw the insensibility of some the indolence of others the obstinacy of a third and in fine the ductile temper of the generality though in most respects firm to the essentials of our constitution into the scale with those few but watchful agents the wonder will soon abate it was the glory of former ages to have been always furnished with a set of bold and uncorrupted patriots who upon the least approach of danger spoke their sentiments freely and took all the legal precautions to secure themselves against a domineering faction even after the restoration of charles the second when so strong an acclivity to arbitrary power run through the whole nation and the people were so perfectly tired out with the many fantastic schemes of a false liberty that the true notion of legal right was in a manner turned into ridicule even at that time there was not wanting a set of brave and honest men of unblemished loyalty who checked the forward humor of the populace and restrained them from making an absolute surrender of their liberties the many enchroachments that were made in that reign notwithstanding all the precautions taken by some good men in power plainly shows what an easy prey we had fallen to tyranny if they had not timely opposed the torrent and though that healing parliament which sat for so many years after the kings return gave into the imperious measures of the court so long that they had scarce any thing left to make a free gift of least they should be thought to give so much as an umbrage to popular complaints yet the warm expostulations they were forced to at last explain to us their modest sense of the grievances afoot but despotick sway still increasing and tyranny ripening by their neglect the parliament of eighty began to search deep into the wounds the state had received and finding so many siuuss on every hand where the malignity had spread resolved to lay all open  the mists which had hovered so long about the eyes of the people cleared up and the nation began to see their danger in a true light and every man silently reproached himself for being so prodigal of his liberty they then had the mortification to see a popish plot in a manner stifled and only a few of the needy and lower rank of parricides brought with difficulty to justice still the busy part the abettors of tyranny and popery acted in diverting the stream of the evidence inspired the people with double eagerness and vivacity to put it in the right channel and were in a fair way of putting a period to the hopes of that accursed faction  the pulse of the nation at that juncture beat high for liberty and during the high ferment which so many wicked attempts upon liberty and religion had raised in the breasts of the people the necking blow was just giving to popery and slavery had the prudent foresight of the commons in preferring the bill of exclusion been seconded by the approbation of the upper house the unseasonable indulgence at that time granted to a royal branch through an excess of loyalty paved the way to succeeding miseries and there were not wanting a set of undertakers to give a wrong turn to the vigilance and bold execution of that trust reposed in the commons and such was the instability of the people that in a short process of time the vein of liberty had spent itself and the tide run so strong upward that there was no possibility of opposing it this brave attempt of the commons drew down an unexpiable displeasure upon some of the chief leaders in the enterprise but it was their glory to suffer in the justest cause to be in the first rank of martyrs for the laws and liberties of their country and their ashes will be still sacred to all in the true interest of britain  in this state of infatuation we continued till the prophetic fears of these gallant patriots were accomplished in a popish succession at length after a thousand violations of the laws and desperate pushes at the whole body of the constitution this poor deluded nation were pleased to awake once more out of their long and lazy dreams and seemed by a lively resentment of their former credulity and ill usage never to be imposed on again the scars which the short lived rage of popery and tyranny had left behind were deeply imprinted on the minds of the nation and men of the shallowest speculations could tell you then that popery under all the oaths restraints and bridles that could be laid upon it was inconsistent either with civil or religious liberty nay even the rankest clergy who had made the doctrine of passiveobedience a scaffold to their preferments and coveted dignities at the price of their immortal souls ashamed of practicing with the people any longer were so far from enforcing this battered topic that they rather put them upon the defensive part then all eyes crowded to their deliverer and mutually congratulated each other upon this seasonable rescue the nation then plainly saw to what extremities their foolish quarrels and distinctions had reduced them whigg and tory high and low were unfashionable names lost in the prevailing harmony of english liberty and the protestant interest moderation was then looked upon as a laudable quality and most people had seen so much of a zeal contrary to knowledge that they could not approve of fury in any dress the most orthodox churchmen professed a true primitive unanimity and coming to such a temper with all that dissented from them as gave every sober man a delightful prospect from the first opening of this happy scene  family revenges handed down to posterity through an inveteracy of principle and heightened by a warm reflection upon the ill offices done to each other in those bloody and unnatural wars seemed buried in oblivion in short one soul actuated the whole nation and all prepared to be happy in good earnest yet in those days and i believe most people then thought them the happiest that ever befell england we happened all to be in the modern phrase antimonarchical republican heterodox creatures or in a more concise way of talking whiggs detestable whiggs nay even the moderate papists and some of the first class amongst the nonjurors sir e  d s  r was a whigg when he signed the association at exeter though i am at a loss to know what he was upon the attainder of f  k h  w was certainly a whigg when he accepted of the golden key though there was soom room to charge his principle betwixt that and the felonious treaty a certain p  r toward the north was a whigg when he came to pay his homage to king william and it is pity such a convert was lost through a failure in some punctilios in his reception archbishop s  ft was no less than a downright whigg when he demanded the keys of the tower from sk  n  the examples of this kind are infinite and therefore let no man be startled when i tell him that every tory of eminence has been a whigg at a convenient time though the reproach is not convertible how the complexion of the kingdom came to change and from this unanimity against popery and tyranny the people split into different interests and have all along served the enemies of our country and religion in the quality of auxiliaries is no great labor to rehearse  though upon the exit of king james the the whole nation seemed to center in one persuasion and with a general voice proclaimed king william their deliverer because the majority run so strong on his side yet several mischievous passions lay brooding in designing men till they saw how far the opportunity might be improved to their respective interests the sticklers for a regency dazzled with the image of royalty kept fair with the times in hopes that if their schemes succeeded they should be powerfully recommended by the prince of orange to the guardianship of the realm but that project once blasted the sense of the deliverance soon cooled in their thoughts and a disgust at the establishment took place of it  others overbearing themselves upon some slight merit in the proceeding reign and who challenged their former posts as their right not finding their expectations answered soon fell into discontent and endeavored to blacken the revolution  another body deeply involved in guilt and whose crimes in a less merciful hand then king williams could not have been passed over with impunity thought by double application to merit a pardon but once finding the danger past returned to their former violence and meditated fresh mischief  a different class who expected the administration to be lodged in some peculiar hands and all others excluded from trust finding the kings favors extensive to good men of all persuasions soon forgot the amicable temper they had boasted of whilst the storm was threatening their liberties and religion and ranged themselves with the other malcontents  these fiery tempers rendering themselves obnoxious to the state by the violence of their proceedings made religion the stalking horse to their ambition and revenge from these narrow and selfish principles they formed a separate body under the character of rigid churchmen who made it their business to oppose the moderate in all their undertakings for the good of the public and to show their mortal aversion to any offers from the other side went roundly into all measures destructive of liberty and the protestant interest  with these factious spirits not a few of the clergy joined who after taking a premeditate oath of allegiance to the government cast about how to excuse themselves from perjury and serve king william with an halffacd devotion by trumping up the distinction of a king de jure and de facto this cursed distinction gave rise to all the after plots and violences designed upon his royal person and how they will be able to acquit themselves from the blood of those poor mistaken wretches who died for the intended assassination must be left as one of their own black prophets magisterially concludes to an higher tribunal  from these various impulses personal disgusts and miscarriage of vain hopes the first seeds of contention sprung which being cherished by too indulgent beams from the throne grew up to rankness and diffused their suckers through the whole land had a few of the wildest been cut down in time before they had gathered such an head or been debarred of the vital nourishment of state places and preferments we had not at this time been plagued with their baneful influences but the settlement was then in its infancy and clemency being one of the kings chiefest attributes the malignity instead of being cured by gentle applications grew epidemical when all these humors were afloat goodnature humanity religion and a sense of liberty were born down by the several gusts of passion and revenge the days of their ancient slavery were magnified and the memorable redemption in eighty eight was laid in the dust but when no blemish could be fixed upon the administration they brought out their old idol the church bleeding and in a desperate condition and giving out that presbytery was coming in like a torrent though the ecclesiastical promotions were under the direction of those very prelates who had equally signalized themselves against popery and presbytery it would puzzle a man of the nicest penetration to account for the actions of these madmen nay even when the game was entirely in their own hands they suspected foul play and murmured at the legal indulgences which others thought themselves sufficiently happy in of so usurping a nature is this torymonster that nothing but a monopoly of wealth favor and interest can glut his ravenous appetite the pride and oppression that is intermixed with the blood and spirits of this destructive race stifles all acts of benevolence in them and makes them by sympathy love popery and tyranny for the sake of persecuting in their subordinate stations but to draw the scene closer though all these sparks of rancour and malice against the present establishment glowed warm in the breasts of these restless animals yet they had the decency to smother them till the protestant succession in the illustrious house of hanover was fixed by parliament then the flame took vent all their passions blazed and every tongue was set on fire  before that time a jacobite was of no great importance in the eye of the people he had a mark set upon him and shunned by all who had the welfare of their country at heart in all public debates the leading men who favored that party and were qualified by law to do mischief were very tender of pointing out the subject of their grievances on this side or the object of their sincerest wishes on the other side of the water it was a point of too much delicacy to be professedly handled and therefore the best service they could do their colleagues the jacobites was by indirect means remote fetches and thwarting the public spirited attempts of all true protestant britons besides the succession before that act being precarious after the demise of our present queen if they could have commanded their tempers to wait so long kept them up in flush hopes that during the consternation they might have a fair chance for accomplishing their wishes this notable scheme of theirs was fully explained when they were brought to the test of voting for or against the clause in favor of the hanover succession for maugre all their attempts to stifle this home charge against them and the printed vindication of the tory members from any suggestion of that kind the best part of the apology is altogether sophistical and evasive for though in point of logical truth they did not divide upon the second amendment sent down by the lords in order to strengthen the interest of that august family and upon which the chief stress of the debate lay yet the whole management lay open to half an eye  the prime leaders proposing to give as little offense as might be upon so tender a point went artificially to work and tried the force of numbers upon the first amendment that being carried against them and being not of equal importance with the second which made it treason for any one to oppose that succession after the demise of the queen they were afraid of alaruming some of their own party who were unwarily drawn into the first disagreement and therefore had no great stomach to divide upon the second amendment it not being usual for the weaker side upon losing a previous question to divide upon a subsequent clause intermixed with the same debate so that if may be without any breach of charity or straining of inferences from the whole course of the debate that they were against all the amendments though they only divided upon the first if they had been sincere for the interest of the hanover line why did they not readily come into all the provisional securities for the safety of that illustrious house or rather why did they insist on the danger of multiplying treasons and aggravating the inconveniences that might arise from new treason etc it is plain from that minute the pretender was in open view if the first act for settling the succession in the house of hanover prompted them to curse that legacy of king william this strengthening act transported them beyond measure and since that time they have not labored to conceal their sentiments it was a very fashionable expression i remember at the beginning of this reign viz retrieving the honor of the english nation what honor had been lost to the nation we know at whose doors to lay the waste indeed popery and arbitrary power had been very much discountenanced in king williams reign and every man enjoyed a complete english liberty so that the meaning of that phraze could signify nothing except reviving the exploded topic of divine tyranny of former days and all the slavish positions under which the nation agonizd for some ages but they made their court wrong and in the reign of a princess who from her first accession to the throne declared how much she had the ease and liberty of her people at heart it was hoped that under an administration they so much longed for these restless spirits might have been composed and fallen into a true english interest under the influence of such an example but three years were scarce elapsed when they reviled the person whom they formerly called their stay and support libelled a protestant ministry attacked the supremacy and rose to all the outrage of threats and ill language could an enemy explain their meaning to more disadvantage than they themselves did upon these occasions was it not a plain indication of the interest they were engaged in they quarreled with king william for his overweaning love to presbytery they spoke disrespectfully of the present queen for no other reason but being too affectionate to the true church who then could be the person in view that they thought would support them better or what church was it they complained was not supported the church of england during these complaints was supplied with orthodox and learned prelates the queen had been beneficent to a prodigy there was no innovation so much as attempted but all discipline enforced with as much zeal as the times would bear well then it is plain they had always another church than that of england and another interest in view which they expected should support their authority by arbitrary measures  this is what that virulent faction has always aimed at and never can by their principles be cordial subjects to any prince who will not go the same desperate lengths they chalk out and let them skin over their resentments never so fair they cannot by their complexion accord with the true genius of england for they are either rebels in disgrace or too arbitrary for the constitution when once in power when we have abounded with such a set of men for many ages past i wonder how the constitution has been kept together and it still heightens my surprise that these principles acuated since the revolution by disgusts and confirmed antipathies have not left us a prey to every bold invader  our enemies wanted not information how loose they have always sat to the government for some years even under the restraint of a triple oath and that when their passions boil high they stick at neither honor conscience or bosom friendship to satiate their revenge but if any thing has contributed to our preservation from popery and slavery it is that our enemies could not depend upon that partys being constant to any one principle so that their malice has been rendered less formidable by their instability if this was not some sort of security to us the many open and tacit invitations that have been given to the pretender would not have been neglected  as the succession in the protestant line was the greatest obstacle to their dear minion the pretenders intrusion so all the hopes of that party centring in the little practisings they were able to carry on in the course of a single life they were resolved to loose no time in the prosecution of their dire attempt but because the topic was a little too harsh for any man to support under any plausible character they pitched upon one under legal disabilities to begin the quarrel as that piquering succeeded they resolved to manage the combat accordingly one spawned out of the vilest bog in the whole kingdom of ireland was deputed to try the force of his arguments upon the succession whether he kept pace with his masters sentiments upon every head he was pleased to descant on we have no warrant but it is plain that the subject matter of the paper was a continued thread of treason  the usurpation of king william was the least concern in the question his reign and the pretended calamities which had attended the revolution were but only incidents of the tragedy that had been acted the queen herself was confessed an usurper and with this salvo that she did well to hold the crown for her life in order to deliver it to the righteous heirs possession  this bold charge passed with impunity and even when it was offered to try the validity of that pretended trust in opposition to the claim of the illustrious house of hanover a good witness is not wanting to prove that a first minister of state in being at that time turned cooly off from the representation i shall not run over some aggravating circumstances which impartially considered involved some people of pretended merit in the same guilt with the author  these traiterous positions strengthened by impunity daily gained ground upon weak tempers and the countenance vast numbers of the clergy gave to those impious reasons made people receive them with less horror and whenever any perplexities happened to arise from a point of that high and nice nature they were so far from lessening them to the interest of the present establishment that they rather multiplied doubts still concluding with an eye to the pretender that right would take place at last but least these insinuations should fail of having a due effect upon the people they exceeded all common measures of impudence and would fain have persuaded the world that the queen was joining in a plot against herself her crown and dignity and covertly approved their sentiments under the notion of a secret and revealed will  this though whispered here took freer vent in a neighboring kingdom and obliged one of the ministers of state to oppose and condemn so base and treasonable a suggestion in a public speech it almost surpasses belief that those very men who had taken all the solemn oaths the prudence of the nation could enact should break them and run into all the excesses and desperate notions of the most flagrant papist or nonjurer but as their familiarity with oaths had rendered them inconsiderable so when the abjuration of the pretender came to be taken they were so far from hesitating about it that though there was no room in the oath left for insincerity and few suspected persons were thought capable of abiding so strong a test they came into it readily with this jesuitical salvo that the abjuration of any right the pretender might lay claim to was to be construed barely as respecting his legal right but that his divine or birthright was no ways vacated by that oath  as it is impossible to guard against such horrid distinctions by the most binding form of words so this formal renunciation of the pretenders right served only to confirm those in their zeal for his service who made it with that saving restriction this came to a full proof when the first news of the pretenders expedition reached us one might then have read in the countenances of these men how much they were elated with the prospect of that enterprise one might then have heard them explain themselves without the least reserve or caution and congratulate each other upon their having prevaricated with the government fo often for the promotion of their good old cause  the french court at that time was so well informed of the dispositions of these men as not to doubt of numbers who openly prayed and acted for the government appearing in vindication of that abjured right the several projects for distressing the state were as faithfully as maliciously executed by endeavoring to make a bankrupty of the public chest whilst the rampant clergy were busy in disarming the protestant britons by preaching up nonresistance to their rightful prince in opposition to their legal one as may be charitably collected from their notable distinctions it was not want of vigilance or inactivity in the late loyal and protestant ministry of happy memory that made them retard the march of the forces for the north but a prudent foresight of the distress which might have happened to this part of the government from swarms of disguised enemies there were too many upon the signals given from the nonresisting leaders prepared to resist according to their sense of the doctrine and upon the first sound of the trumpet in sion ready to mount but their hopes being defeated by the precipitate flight of the pretender it was no difficult matter to guess how they would have acted upon a nearer approach of danger by their subsequent behavior for when all the resistance was past which they had conjured up the pulpits without any manner of call or provocation from the necessity of our affairs sounded to arms afresh in their ironical nonresisting cant which amongst that class of men is the usual watchword for rebellion it is more than probable that the heads of the faction were in hopes of a second invasion and understood the first only as a faint to try the power of their friends and so were still practicing with the people upon the old topic to keep up the principle warm upon their imaginations  when no hopes appeared from that quarter their next attempt was made at home and flattering themselves with a majority of the nation on their side they essayed to do the work amongst themselves without the help of any auxiliaries from abroad  accordingly they pitched upon one of the most common prostitutes of virtue and modesty in the three kingdoms whose memory will always be sacred with the admirers of cain herostratus and guido faux to raise sedition upon the old passive topic matters in their opinion were so ripe that it was thought loss of time to conceal their impious designs upon the constitution so that in plain terms this partizan was appointed to fall directly upon the government defame the administration and blacken the revolution with all the gallant leaders concerned in so just and evangelical a work then the true intent and purport of this mysterious doctrine was obvious to every protestant when all the arrows out of that poisonous quiver were levelled at the queen who had so great an hand in that blessed change yet the faction with their usual impudence would have fastened contradictions upon the world and made us believe that the resistance the queen abetted at that time by her gracious and useful presence was fatal to her title in its consequences when that case was urged with an exception to the general rule of passiveobedience and never to be so much as attempted but in the last necessitous circumstances even no less than the entire subversion of the constitution but it is plain the unlimited obedience there pressed could never be designed to the present queen her title arising out of the revolution which was founded in resistance neither could it be any complement to lodge such a power with her as she was never fond of she governing herself and subjects by the laws of the constitution but the pretender being in view the model of his government was laid down and recommended in that arbitrary way he might be supposed to act and by the tenor of the libel even her majesty was as much cautioned against resisting the lawful and rightful heir as any of her subjects  still whatever malignant planet ruled this impudent prevarication met with votaries and what in sober times would have covered such a parricide with eternal shame and ignominy gave him a larger degree of sufficiency than before and turned to his glory amongst the poor deluded rabble  this vein of slavery and jacobitism increasing after the merciful award the faction still kept feeding the popular humors till at last they were neither afraid nor ashamed to tell the world that they could not be satisfied with any title below the degree of indefeasible and divine right these terms which were almost grown obsolete were renewed and crammed into many public addresses i shall pass over the dubious expressions and plain hints which to every narrow capacity seem obvious enough in some papers we find such an uncontrollable power devolved upon the crown which though our gracious queen never showed the least disposition toward assuming sufficiently explains into what hands the faction is willing it should fall but amongst all the late demonstrations of ardent affection to the queen and present establishment it is a little shocking that some have been so hardy to approach her majesty without so much as the least notice of the protestant succession in the serene house of hanover which the queen has upon all occasions professed she has so much at heart if those persons were sincere in their wishes for the perpetuity of the protestant religion and liberty in these kingdoms a small clause in favor of that house could not well be omitted on a subject which so naturally leads to it indeed smut the examiner who has commenced guide to some inferior communities has given in his verdict very learnedly upon this head and looks upon the mention of that august house as writing a sort of epitaph upon the person in possession but under favor i think that may be filled amongst the rest of his blunders for certainly no repetition of that kind can be ungrateful to a person whose chiefest glory it is to lodge so sacred a pledge in the hands of a family that will be sure to deliver it down pure and uncorrupted to posterity  as her majesty is the parent of her country and indeed the nursing mother of the protestant cause so it must be a pleasure to one of her tender sentiments to think and hear that the political child as well as the religious interest of her country is likely to be so well provided for and secured in the hands of so good and illustrious a race and wherever that petty scribler has learned his politics he really disserves his popish cause by such weak insinuations it is in a manner divesting her of that compassion for the welfare of her people which is so natural to her it is no less than sowing jealousy amongst her subjects as if she did not care to hear that family mentioned it is running counter to her majestys sentiments who has always that family at heart and can the mention of any thing that lies so near ones heart give any pain or uneasiness no sure rather please the ear and gratify the spirits and though the dislike to that great family appears but too open yet methinks in pure deference to her majestys esteem of it at least a cool mention might be made of the name but their aversion being unconquerable and the bent of their souls lying so strong to another interest they cannot put on so much as a specious disguise upon their rancour but openly wearing the livery of leslys good old cause pray that the scepter may late drop into the hands of the rightful and lawful successor which seems to be of no difficult interpretation with many other curious phrazes too long to enumerate if after this we should reckon up the defamatory libels sidereflections and open aspersions that have fallen from pens and mouths of the lowest rank against that illustrious house and which have given just occasion of complaint they would swell a volume all which in their natural tendency raise mean apprehensions of that family in the minds of the people alienate their affections by degrees and in consequence dispose them to receive the pretender the rigid tories had some difficulties in their way which no sober man thought masterable it took them up some time and required no small artifice to wean the generality from the high esteem they entertained for the house of hanover that point once gained they had other obstacles to get over as persuading the world into a belief of the legitimacy of the pretender which the party from time to time have attempted by reprinting the depositions lodged in chancery and contriving weak answers to them on purpose that falsehood might have the advantage of a good light crying up the vigor of king james and making wrong inferences of the young chevaliers legitimacy from a fresh imposture in the person of a daughter trumpd up since his exile in france  these weak instances which were universally exploded not many years ago having alate obtained some countenance from great numbers of people there was still another difficulty left to get over with respect to religion and this point has been solved with all the reason and address the affair is capable of for though several were tolerably well inclined to the pretenders interest from wrong postulatas of his legitimacy and the moving topic of a young innocents being debarred of his right yet the interests of religion stuck with many a great while to obviate any scruples about so tender a point the party soon vampd up an orthodox saint who had lurked in corners for writing treason against the present government for seven years together and least his character under the title of the rehearsal might be generally detested and odious they gave him the new name of white when all things were prepared for his intended route then the excrements of the party acquainted the world that in all probability there would be no great need of any comeovers or hanovers for that great casuist mr white had undertaken a journey to switzerland to convert the pretender such assurances from so reputable an author and prospect of the young gentlemans conversion from so blessed a missionary in thoughtful times no doubt must have gained credit equal to the value of the agents concerned but such was and is the delusion of too many at present even from those authorities to believe him well disposed to renounce his religion and become a protestant whilst others less modest of the pretenders party openly arraign the justice of parliaments and scorning to pave his way to the throne by any popular salvos put his title upon the foot of jus sacrum denying the legislature a power of excluding or disinheriting any prince of either real or pretended right upon the account of his religion though destructive of the true worship of god and the civil rights of the nation  by such impudent false and unwarrantable positions the poor credulous multitude has been set a madding and drawn in to weigh an imaginary right in the scale against substantial liberty and revived notions which have been buried in oblivion for many years and conjured up at this time only to root out the protestant religion and ruin the best of constitutions and as the uninterrupted progress of these wicked opinions has given no small confidence to the promoters of them so likewise has it strengthened many wellmeaning people in the belief of them who forming their judgment from the most popular and prevailing cries grow more and more confirmed when they find such principles not altogether discountenanced by authority  i shall not insist upon the penetration of the french court which some time since plainly saw where these humors of the people where gathering and occasioned the dauphins complementing the late queen mary upon some wonderful change working on this side in her favor but am sorry the prophecy seems so near at hand the pretenders health which used formerly to be softened with the gloss of universal charity or drank under some byname scorns such reserves at present and triumphs in it is full title the protestant reign of king william scarce finds a room in the royal line of succession but has been openly decryd for some time as a successful usurpation nay to that high pitch of impudence has this popish faction lately arrived as to interrupt the public solemnizing that great princes birthday and the miraculous deliverance of these three kingdoms nay even to insult the gentlemen and almost demolish an honest protestant vintners house in grace church street had this been done only by a needy rabble instigated by popish partisans and french money it had been more excusable but when armed authority appeared and instead of discountenancing joined in with these foul measures it cannot but aggravate our fears and make us conclude that our safety depends upon a very precarious title when those who are the proper guards against such insolence and should appear active in suppressing such riots are the forwardest in promoting them but what will be ever remarkable upon this occasion and no doubt fix a double portion of honor upon the head of a certain wise magistrate when affairs once come to be impartially debated is that one of the gentlemen who met to pay honor to the memory of the late king william was asked to find security for his good behavior and threatened to be bound over for so desperate an attempt whereas in doing less he had been guilty of ingratitude to his royal benefactor but we are not at a loss for the magistrate and his principles and he who was openly charged upon the pretenders invasion with making a run upon the bank in order to ruin the national credit cannot be supposed to have reformed his principles much since that time or to act lessstrenuously in favor of a cause at a juncture when there is no manner of necessity for clearing himself from such imputations it may in a very little time be reckoned a mighty indulgence to mention the name of king william in a dutiful manner without exposing ones self to the reproach and violence of the people and if the ringleaders of the faction are able to support the spirit at present reigning in the multitude to a convenient opportunity it is probable they may have their longexpected restoration of popery and slavery with as little expense of blood as in the late glorious revolution we had our redemption from it the several jacobite clubs which are said to be set up in all quarters of the town are changed from their first institution of drinking healths to the impostor under feigned names and at present are so many public training schools where the youth of the nation are disciplined into an opinion of the justice of his title and taught to compassionate his sufferings all the arbitrary proceedings of his supposed father are represented in fading colors the acts of violence and encroachments upon the civil and religious rights of the nation are imputed to the headiness of a few jesuits in direct opposition to the natural temper and tenderness of king james that the queen mothers bloody and revengeful temper meaning king jamess consort is very much moderated by her past sufferings and the whole court is resolved to conduct affairs by more temperate maxims in fine that the king in the protestant account a notorious bastard has so true a scheme of the disposition of his loving subjects as never to bear upon the laws or the mildness of a constitution they have been accustomed to and that having his grandfathers and fathers sufferings always in his eye he is resolved only to assert his own hereditary right and never to dispute any mans legal one  these are the baits by which the popish faction ensnare the youth who never saw the approaching dangers before the revolution and think them much magnified by the spleen of a malignant party with which all in that cursed interest asperse the true protestants of the kingdom and even those who were eyewitnesses to the oppression of former days have through an ease and plenty of above  0 years standing grown so forgetful and cold in their resentments of those outrages which were daily offered to protestants by the missionaries in black and red that they express very little dislike of seeing that dismal scene acted over again  so strongly has the poison worked through the whole nation as to be humanly speaking proof against the most sovereign antidotes and though it is scarce possible to trace the source of this great evil through the several intricate valves and small vassels it runs yet we cannot be so blind as not to discover it receives a supply from men of a better figure and way of thinking than are to be met with amongst the middle class of mankind  it is happy for this nation at present that we have such a pure orthodox and true church of england administration to balance the general inclination to popery and slavery and stem the majority of so many wicked tempers it must be an argument of great circumspection in men of such high characters if they escape falling under the lash of such virulent tongues and pens and are not maliciously brought in as abetting the designs of this popish faction after they have gone such a length in their course of impudence some time since as to give out that the queen secretly favored their wicked enterprises grounding their impious assertions without dispute upon her royal clemency and their own impunity it is no great complement at this time to the men in power neither do i believe they would be at all pleased that so many of the jacobite party should assume to themselves so much upon the late changes or that they are every day enlarging their prospect from the present posture of affairs one would be tempted to think by their confidence that they had received some assurances from the great but the characters of such a vigilant and faithful ministry secures all good people from any apprehensions which might otherwise arise from the effrontery of so daring a faction for we are told by the author of the review and that is an authority not to be questioned that if people will be quiet and set easy under this administration there is no fear of the pretender but that if they will compass sea and land and even go to the center in order to ruin it then according to the principles of flesh and blood the ministry will in all likelihood make the best terms to secure themselves but let our hopes from the men in power be never so well grounded and the expectations of the jacobite faction never so vain yet it becomes every protestant at this hour to consider upon what a ticklish bottom he is like to stand upon from the activity and insolence of that party and it ought likewise to put him upon his guard against being unwarily drawn into their wicked associations under specious pretenses to the ruin of his liberty religion and conscience that idle pretense of the churchs danger has been lately made the handle to confusion i wish before that notion has thoroughly spent it self it does not accomplish the destruction of the state for the cunning managers of the jacobite interest will keep up that plausible topic till the danger is just at hand and after having made an irreconcilable division amongst protestants of all persuasions will urge perseverance to those who have been led away by them from the true protestant and national interest and from the extremities they have reduced them to will propose a total apostasy as the only expedient left for safety and probation of their merit upon a change  it is plain to a demonstration that the papists ever since the   th of queen elizabeth have been playing the rigid church men against the protestants of a more capacious faith and charity and from those split interests have been near upon the point of determining the controversies and swallowing up all distinctions between protestants but since within these few years the sober and discreet part of the church of england which are the true and lively ornaments of it duly weighing the national interest of this kingdom both in church and state and seriously reflecting on the causes of our unhappy divisions have fallen into comprehensive measures and a primitive temper of forbearance these rigid spirits have have set themselves at open defiance with the moderate and drawn off so wide from the protestant interest that they are become the most virulent of the popish faction it therefore behooves every protestant briton to guard timely against the wicked insinuations of these men who cry up the hereditary right of the pretender and come to this undeniable maxim that even upon a supposition that this impostor was the legitimate son of king james the nation is involved in less guilt by keeping him out then by receiving him upon the most plausible terms and circumscriptions because the pretended or even the real right of one man after so many bloo struggles for the defense of our liberty and  never compensate the nation for the slaughter and devastation which must necessarily ensue upon such an intrusion for let the party soften the matter as much as they think fit whenever that unhappy day comes we must prepare to meet him armed with a true italian revenge bred up in all the destructive principles of a bigoted mother and the tyrannical notions of a french master  finis
