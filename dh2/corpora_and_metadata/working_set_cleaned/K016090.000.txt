edwin and angelina a ballad by mr goldsmith printed for the amusement of the countess of northumberland deign saintlike tenant of the dale to guide my nightly way to yonder fire that chears the vale with hospitable ray for here deserted as i tread with fainting steps and slow the wild immeasurably spread seems lengthening as i go forbear my son the sage replies to tempt the lonely gloom for yonder faithless phantom flies to lure thee to thy doom here to the houseless child of want my door is open still and though my portion is but scant i give it with good will then turn tonight and freely share whatever my cell bestows my rushy couch and frugal fare my blessing and repose no flocks that range the valley free to slaughter i condemn taught by that power that pities me i learn to pity them but from the mountains grassy side a guiltless feast i bring a scrip with herbs and fruits supplied and water from the spring then turn tonight thy cares forego all earthborn cares are wrong man wants but little here below nor wants that little long soft as the dew from heaven descends his gentle accents fell the modest stranger lowly bends and follows to the cell far in a wilderness obscure the lonely mansion lay a refuge to the unshelterd poor and strangers led astray no stores beneath its humble thatch required a masters care the wicket opening with a latch received the harmless pair and now when busy crowds retire to take their evening rest the hermit trimmed his little fire and cheered his pensive guest and spread his vegetable store and gaily pressed and smiled and skilled in legendary lore the lingering hours beguiled while round in sympathetic mirth its tricks the kitten tries the cricket chirrups in the hearth the crackling faggot flies but nothing mirthful could assuage the pensive strangers woe for grief had seized his early age and tears would often flow his rising cares the hermit spied with answering care oppressed and whence unhappy youth he cried the sorrows of thy breast from better habitations spurned reluctant do thou rove or grieve for friendship unreturnd or unregarded love say what is friendship but a name a charm that lulls to sleep a shade that follows wealth or fame but leaves the wretch to weep and what is love an empty sound the modern fair ones jest on earth unseen or only found to warm the turtles nest for shame fond youth thy sorrows hush and spurn the sex he said but while he spoke a rising blush his lovelorn guest betrayed surpised he sees new beauties rise expanding to the view like colors over the morning skies as bright as transient too the bashful look the rising breast alternate spread alarms the lovely stranger stands confessed a maid in all her charms and ah forgive a stranger rude a thing forlorn she cried whose feet unhallowed thus intrude where heaven and you reside forgive and let thy pious care an hearts distress allay that seeks repose but finds despair companion of the way my father lived of high degree remote beside the tyne and as he had but only me whatever he had was mine to win me from his tender arms unnumberd suitors came their chief pretense my flattered charms my wealth perhaps their aim each hour the mercenary crowd with glittering proffers strove among the rest young edwin bowed who offered only love in humble simplest habit clad no wealth nor power had he wisdom and worth were all he had and these were all to me whenever he spoke amidst the train how would my heart attend and still delighted even to pain how sigh for such a friend and when a little rest i sought in sleeps refreshing arms how have i mended what he taught and lent him fancied charms yet still and woe betide the hour i spurned him from my side and still with ill dissembled power repaid his love with pride till quite dejected with my scorn he left me to deplore and sought a solitude forlorn and never was heard of more then since he perished by my fault this pilgrimage i pay i will seek the solitude he sought and stretch me where he lay and there in sheltering thickets hid i will linger till i die twas thus for me my lover did and so for him will i thou shall not thus the hermit cried and clasped her to his breast the astonished fairone turned to chide twas edwins self that pressed for now no longer could he hide what first to hide he strove his looks resume their youthful pride and flush with honest love turn angelina ever dear my charmer turn to see thy own thy longlost edwin here restored to love and thee thus let me hold thee to my heart and every care resign and shall we never never part my life my all that is mine no never from this hour to part our love shall still be new and the last sigh that rends thy heart shall break thy edwins too here amidst sylvan bowers well rove from lawn to woodland stray blessed as the songsters of the grove and innocent as they to all that want and all that wail our pity shall be given and when this life of love shall fail well love it again in heaven the end
