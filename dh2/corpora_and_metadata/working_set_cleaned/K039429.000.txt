marcellus a monody  humbly inscribed to her royal highness the princess of wales  by mr delap m a fellow of magdalen college cambridge  multis ille bonis flebilis occidit nulli flebilior quam tibi hor london printed for r dodsley in pall mall and sold by m cooper in paternoster row       marcellus a monody ye virgintrain that whilom waked your lyres fast by the crystal springs of helicon to heavenly strains of joy those dulcet notes ill suit a nations universal moan when every hope with their lost prince is gone the thrilling voice of joy no longer floats over pale britannias sadlysilent shore marcellus is no more but oh the doleful change the plaintive muse in cypress crowned must pour her piteous loan of sigh and tear and heartempiercing groan come then melpomene begin the lay with rueful tears your sorrowing dirges steep such tears as erst your sistermuse did weep for her dear twin palici every stream shall stop to hear your theme then sadly murmur to the plaintive shore marcellus is no more and feeble echo from her aerie cave shall back return the note and every vale with all its flowers shall droop to hear the tale how can he lie unwept who knew to raise esteem and love in every loyal heart he was the pride of every shepherds praise graced with each decent and each princely part nor did the muse ungrateful pour her lays he often would listen to the poets art and often alone beneath the muses grot hid from a nations eye he sat and thought full many an hour his offspring prattling round in gentle dalliance has he fondly smiled full many an hour sequestered from annoys in tender amorous talk has he beguiled with the dear partner of his dearest joys mean while the foe of life with treacherous art in sly destruction preyed upon his heart and yet no fatal symptom did appear the blood still mantled on his rosy cheek as phoebus often the clouds with gold does streak while brooding storms engender in the air where was your knowledge then you sapient tribe that boast commandment over the pulse of life was not a princess tears sufficient bribe could not a kings a nations prayers prevail to make your nicest skill explore his ail some few more years the breath of life supply and keep him from the sky  ah me what boots your skill  not all the prayers that pale britannia and her king might pour not all augustas sadlyflowing tears not aesculapius sons with all their care might ward the black inevitable hour or could their princes vital band repair which in their mood the fatal sisters tore alas he drooped in lifes maturest age while albions scepter hung before his view and thrice the wise machaon did presage that febris her inflaming rage withdrew yet then renewing her malignant strife the deadly fiend unhousd his tender life then streamed the tear from every british eye but chief the unhappy sire in dismal plight detests the odious light and with loud wailings tears the arched sky and calls on death to bring a kind reprieve and lay his cruel sorrows in the grave but ah my muse how may thy voice record though well i ween thou sharst her piteous state the tender unimaginable woe of his dear consort for her ravished lord torn by the hand of unrelenting fate then hide the tears thou can not give to flow enough that when reviving life did chase deaths dismal image from her pallid face with manly show she masked her sorrows dread and greatly strove to cheer with kind relief her tender offsprings sympathetic grief who at their mothers wretched plight grew sad what heart so stony but did melt in tears see pale britannia wears through all her sons one dismal face of woe nor british eyes alone do overflow see even the orcades and frozen realms by oceans watery barrier sunderd far pay their full tribute of a tender tear mean while the awful tongue of death does pierce nights drowzy ear with tollings deep and slow and now the solemn pealing organs blow the winking lamps a dusky luster shed along the mansions of the dead where mouldering kings in silent dust repose and now with often interrupted sighs the lawnrobd prelate his last duty pays and dust to dust conveys and now entombed his sacred body lies free from the cares that this vain life enclose up to yon regions of eternal day the free unbodied spirit wings its way there in the bosom of its god does bide in pure immaculate unshaken bliss nor recks the loss of earthly kingdoms pride enthroned for aye in heavenly paradise and thou sad consort of a prince too good longer to visit this forsaken clime ah cease to weary the relentless sky with bitter penance and with bootless tears nor deem with vainlypious prayers to draw him from his blissful dear abode where now he never more may fear to die nor grieve save when your plaints would him recall not lent for aye to your fond hopes i ween and oh forgive the muse whose daring lays would grateful pour her artless loyal teen reckless that true to draw a princes praise asks the nice touches of a masterhand since she may see in your fair offspring planned the graceful dowries of their fathers mind see mercy truth religion liberty beneath the shine of your enlivening eye and every virtue that may bless mankind finis
