and heard it often repeated as i hoped it led me to a hut  i entered there and by the embers of a fire of turf i saw a ghastly man stretched on a bed of sticks and heath composed come near he said and listen to the dying voice of valma   rivine of valma    connan valma whom i had not seen since he for erin with his master sailed i found he did mistake me for his host and silent listened with a

the sword his it may be but whose it was i never knew before  rivine thou can no more deceive me the long train of treachery and lies the murder too has been detected miserable valma lived only to reveal it  now thou come with this proud trophy of thy work complete o thou sole relic of the first of men signal of death memorial of the brave companion of my woes perhaps the end why did thou thirst o durstan for his blood had thou not wronged him was not that enough but thou did wisely to consult thy safety for conscience told thee whilst the warrior lived the robber was not safe  durstan thy words are madness if i had killed him was he not my foe  rivine how did the hero fall  by fraud he fell for he was still invincible in arms alone a match for many in the field  durstan that sword the sight of which disturbs thy soul is not the trophy of a hero slain in evil hour i sound it  rivine found it where was not its owner near  durstan if he was near thou have conjectured right he lives no more for where i found it death and horror reigned  rivine now i believe thee durstan tell me pict how when without a master too thou foundst his sword who never yet was foiled in arms  durstan as in our way to thee we crossed those seas whose rage scarce summer tames a tempest rose a dreadful one as ever swept the main all night we labored in the jaws of death but when the morning dawned the tempest ceased red on the troubled deep the sun arose and showed a dismal object to our eyes fast on a ridge of rocks a wreck appeared which seemed the ruin of a noble vessel near as our safety would permit we sailed and viewed the fate which might have been our own  the ship was broken by the heavy seas parted in two and all about the rocks dead bodies floated on the tossing waves  rivine was there no living creature   durstan no not one low are the rocks their ragged tops are seen and barely seen above the smoothest sea but in a storm their place is known afar by the white waves that rage and swell and break like mountains over them there no man could live whoer aboard that luckless vessel sailed embraced the same inevitable doom   rivine was the sword there   durstan it was about to leave the wreck we sought some token of the dead by which they might be known that sword we spied caught in the cordage of a mast it hung and glittered through the water   rivine it is enough if at my feet his breathless body lay i could not be more certain of his fate in those wild waves the chief of warriors died to me he hastened through the seas and storms unknowing of his wrongs for me he died  kathul forbear my daughter for my sake forbear   durstan and for thine own o queen respect thyself   rivine i will for ever i renounce thee durstan to ronans memory i devote my days few are the days that of my life remain hear me amazed spectators ye who think rivine has forgot her sexs shame and judge me with more justice in my hand i hold the sword of ronan who he was and of what high renown is not unknown for through the kingdoms of the north his name flew on the wings of fame  his love to me and mine to him for i avow my love my sire approved  to him i was betrothed but in his absence durstan did seduce a faithless servant to betray his master he framed a message from the noble ronan rejecting me and setting free my faith then urged a fond exasperated maid and with the help of her deceived father precipitated her disordered mind to yield a rash consent  that was my crime which i deny not nor refuse to bear my punishment which like my crime is great despair consumes me withered like the leaf of autumn is my beauty now i stand on the dim threshold of the house of darkness remorse pursues rivine to the tomb  durstan who with a womans frenzy can contend thou have avowed thy hatred to thy husband and to another owned thy guilty love for loss of him thou ravst   enter messenger messenger king of the isles on moras top the fiery signal burns i saw a

watch as if she guarded my repose  exeunt end of the second act act iii scene a cliff on the seashore with a cave rivine and orellan orellan behold the habitation of orellan for threescore years and ten this rock has been my dewlling place and here i sit in sorrow silent and motionless from morn to eve till the seafowl that skim along the shore fearless alight and sitting at my feet scream their wild notes as if i was a stone or senseless trunk that could not do them harm  it was not always thus i was not born to misery nor in the wild woods bred of savage race fair was my morn of youth with thy brave grandsire i was trained to arms his chosen warrior and his trusted friend but love and jealousy surpised my soul drove me from men and blotted out my name this arm slew namora  rivine father forgive my importunity vouchsafe to tell what i in part have heard  orellan my storys old thy sorrow recent but to hear my woes will teach thee patience such as thou art now or as thou wast ever grief had made thee wan namora was like thine her beauty charmed contending princes but the generous maid preferred to princes fond orellans love daily we met in woods in groves in glades remote and secret one unhappy time returning from the chase i sought the grove entering i saw namora her white arms embraced a youth her lips were joined to his my bow was in my hand i bent it soon and pierced them with one arrow ere i reached the spot on which they fell namoras eyes were closed for ever the expiring youth was her brave brother to his native shore that day returned his sisters steps he traced to perish in her arms i kneeled me down and begged the warrior if he yet had strength to give me death he heard me not he died and left me living  this bleak cave i chose my everlasting mansion in those days the hollow shore resounded with my cries often the hunter hastened from the hill and often the mariner steered from the deep and wondered at me time that rage subdued to milder grief my tears incessant flowed like waters from the rock here have i mourned an age of man complete alike to me summer and winter autumn an the spring and night and day the same   rivine thus would i wish to waste my days a spectacle of woe without or change or interval i feel within myself a source and spring of sorrow that never will cease to flow till death shall stop it surely the spirits of the dead delight to be remembered and lamented father  orellan daughter they do  my own experience tells  once every year that day namora died a wondrous vision comes in the still air for not a breath then stirs the silent bay are heard the saddest yet the sweetest sounds that ever touched the ear or heart of man the melody of woe  then from the skies descend the shadows of the murdered pair pale as the colors of the lunar bow hovering before the caverns mouth they spread their arms they fix on m their pitying eyes and with a shriek they vanish into air does hoar tradition tell a tale like this was ever mortal destiny like mine  rivine could i but hope to see my love arise and look on me with pity i would live in the vast ocean on a rock alone but ronans injured ghost detests rivine  in the dark world of spirits thou shall join thy dear namoras shade but far from mine the angry spirit of my love will fly   orellan i have another charge besides thee daughter within my cave a wretched stranger lies who tasted all the bitterness of death but scarce yet knows his wonderful escape  rivine escape from what   orellan from shipwreck in the storm that raged last night upon the rocky shore  rivine from shipwreck ha is he a man in years or of the youthful time  orellan in prime of youth and beautiful he seemed though in the arms of death upon the naked beach he lay i found him there attentive i perceived that the warm life was not wholly fled i called a shepherd swain to give me help who from a neighboring hill surveyed the deep he came and willing in his arms he bore the youth insensible he brought him hither within he lies stretched on the skins of deers a sleep profound has seized him when he wakes he will not know if in a friendly place or in the dwelling of his foes he lies  i will go   rivine not yet a while   orellan thy color shifts from pale to red from red to pale again what do thou hope or fear  rivine a strange event yet like the fate and fortune of my life wild and incredible perhaps this youth saved from the wreck and sleeping in thy cell is ronan  orellan no delusive are thy hopes the various vest and floating robe i know of albions warlike race he wore not those his dress is splendid bright with foreign gold and marks the chieftain of a distant land  rivine enter and if he sleeps to me return i will behold and bless him where he lies then from his presence fly if it is ronan  orellan i hear a noise within the stranger comes his steps sound on the rock  rivine now now my heart thy moment this rivine retires to the sides  the stranger from the inner part of the cave sees orellan stranger thou venerable man preserver of my life for so methinks i ought to call thee tell me on what shore the waves have thrown me for the place imports almost as much as life  rivine it is he it is ronan   ronan rivines voice i am where i would wish my love is here  rivine thy love approach me not thou noble youth nor call rivine thine  ronan not call thee mine   rivine no never never more i am unworthy of thy least regard unworthy of the air that ronan breathes when thou shall know what cannot be concealed thou must abhor me  ronan i abhor rivine ah thou art changed indeed since i beheld thee anguish gleams in thine eye and wild despair contends with shame  rivine speak and save me from horrible conjectures  rivine spare a wretch whose heart is breaking fain fain would i speak and tell thee how rivine was betrayed  ronan betrayed to what betrayed   rivine will not the rock fall down and cover with a heap my shame follow me not this hoary sire will tell my crime my misery cannot be told  runs into the cave ronan it must be so thou confident of guilt perhaps the counselor  orellan young man attend to every circumstance of this misfortune and thou will pity her whom once thou lovdst  ronan tell me one circumstance i ask no more is she not wedded  orellan listen to my words and thou shall have an answer to thy question  ronan i have no patience for a tedious tale answer at once is she not wedded say then i may hear thy story  orellan it were better better for thee rash youth to let me tell how this disaster did overtake thy love   ronan will thou not say what the disaster is how tedious hard and obstinate is age  orellan unless i should deceive thee to thy hurt i can no longer hide from thee the truth  ronan then she is wedded   orellan yes   ronan do thou say yes   orellan unwillingly i speak the painful truth my soul is grieved for thee  ronan thou art the cause of what i suffer thy officious hand saved me from death to make me perish worse my latest thought when sinking in the storm was of rivine of her love her truth her grief eternal for her ronan lost  and now i find her in anothers arms of me regardless though my faithful heart full of her image for her sake despised the beauteous queen of erins warlike land  orellan young man thou wrongst rivine    ronan would that thou who say i wrong her were a young man too and strong and valiant to defend her cause let me behold the traitress and confound her guilty soul   orellan go give thy passion way pursue and seize her in thy frantic arms then throw her headlong from the airy cliff i killed the maid i loved i thought her false but she was truth itself  ronan and wedded too but who is he that durst invade my right what is his name she says she was betrayed who of mankind is he  orellan her husband   ronan oh   orellan the pictish king   ronan durstan my mortal foe the cursed oppressor of my native land from all mankind has she selected him whom

blueeyd maid old alpines daughter connan was her guard who shunned the combat and resigned the maid silent and pale my sad companions heard but from the banquet generous ronan rose and dared the giant to maintain his words by combat on the plain furious they met like two strong bulls contending for the herd they fought from midday till the setting sun gilded the vale then ronans arm prevailed and armor bit the ground fast by the lake marked with a stone is seen his lengthened grave eternal monument of ronans faith and of his glory but of shame to me if ever my soul forgets the heros love

bear a noble mind thy fame is great for justice as for valor with the pict thou have a rightful quarrel but respect this hospitable shore contend not here nor fight with durstan for his wedded wife  ronan not fight with durstan then let durstan fly and i shall follow to whatever shore he takes his flight  kathul i understand thee well  my son do thou regard thy sisters fame  fairer aspect much her conduct wore when thy loved friend was numbered with the dead than now when he in arms her husband braves  i go to meet the ancients of the land the hoary counselors who can compare the present trouble with the times of old and call experience to vouch their counsel under the spreading beech that shades the brook they sit and ruminate  exit ronan their thoughts i know cold are the counsels of inactive age patient of injury averse to arms i long for vengeance and my soul is sick of this delay but why should i defer my just revenge no truce was made for me i will send him a defiance   connan not to day nor yet to morrow do i wish the pict by ronans hand to fall   ronan if he should fall by any other hand i am not revenged we are interrupted ha what man is that who steps so haughtily before the rest  connan it is the pict    ronan i thought so   connan yet be calm your eyes flash fire your heart beats in your breast as it would burst your bosom  ronan mark me connan this hour let my own spirit guide itself he knows me not beware of naming me i will take my time to speak walks aside enter durstan attended durstan i sought the king  but thou who have usurped thy fathers power may in his absence answer   connan what is thy question   durstan a plain one whither was the vessel bound that left the shore just now with crowded sails  connan i know not what she is nor whither bound why do thou ask of me  durstan i do suspect she is dispatched to summon to your aid the warriors of the isles  connan perhaps she is credit thy worst suspicion break the truce and i will thank thee i desired no truce and never will have cordial peace with thee  durstan my faith young man is plighted to thy father and he shall own to vindicate my fame that durstan sought not to lay waste his isles nor stay his people   connan if thou art sincere and tender of the lives of blameless men with me decide the quarrel should i fall rivines dowry is a kingdom then  durstan not that i fear thine arm do i decline to answer thy proud challenge but thou art the brother of rivine  ronan wise thy words and just the reason thou assignst o king but i am not the brother of rivine and i accuse thee i defy thee too  durstan thou who art thou   ronan not less in blood and birth than durstan is of royal lineage born to ronan near allied ha do thou start and tremble pict at injured ronans name  durstan boaster i know no fear but thee i scorn who vaunts his lineage and conceals his name is of his race the stain  ronan soon shall thou know perhaps somewhat too soon the name i bear but first i will tell thee thy detested deeds and gall if possible thine iron heart  unlike a prince a warrior and a man meanly thou did seduce a servile soul to wrong his masters honor and his love and by the blackest artifice betrayed to endless misery a royal fair who dies of grief and hate to the assassin and still thou do presume   durstan away begone   ronan i will not nor shall thou from ronan go    durstan thou ronan   ronan i now robber do thou tremble unsheath thy sword each moment seems an age till i avenge on thee my mighty wrongs and give thy spirit to the winds of heaven

between their swords kathul my guests forbear and thou rebellious boy put up thy sword or shed thy fathers blood  ronan why do thou guard my foes king of the isles what is thine aim this is no sudden strife sprung from a light and accidental cause it is a mortal quarrel founded deep on wrongs not to be borne let honored age avoid the sight of blood   kathul hear me rash youth my aim is to be just and to prevent a combat whose event must fatal prove to my allies my children and my fame do thou hereafter on some distant shore pursue thy quarrel with the pictish king and bear the cause of albion on thy sword now i forbid the war and will propound impartial terms of peace he who believes his cause is just will readily assent  durstan although with us the odds of combat lie not less in valor and in number more if full assurance that my cause is good implies assent on mine thou may depend  ronan may my sword shiver when it strikes thy helm if it does not defend the better cause  kathul thy soul is like the torrent of thy hills o chief of desert morven fierce thy words but confident and suited to my purpose behold where yonder white and ragged cliff points the long ridge and terminates the bay there in a cave the seamark of the main a man unlike the rest of mortals dwells once great in arms abreast of mighty chiess the brave orellan trod the paths of fame but strange misfortune crossed the warriors way in early youth he killed the fair he loved then left mankind to live alone with sorrow bare is his bosom to the howling winds and wet his hoary head with foam that flies from the resounding surges of the main the coot the cormorant are his companions sometimes he says his cries bring from her cloud the pallid image of the murdered maid  ronan i know the sad orellan to what end do thou describe to us the man of sorrow   kathul he is the judge who cannot be unjust for his pure mind no partial passion knows the sole affection of his breast is pity the man of sorrow feels for human woes to him submit the cause of doubtful strife and let his voice determine of rivine  ronan is this thy counsel king and do thou think that it will be regarded shall rivine like flocks or herds in contest be adjudged no whilst i live rivine shall be free rivine shall determine of herself she has determined never to behold the face of durstan and i will defend the resolution which my soul approvies  durstan art thou the judge   ronan i am and thou shall find so follow my steps in such a strife as this the valiant know no umpire but the sword   exit kathul stops connan kathul by all the reverence thou owe thy father and by the love thou bear thy native land stay till thou hearst the pict    while kathul speaks euran whispers durstan connan what can he say who still though often defied declines the combat  durstan kathul i speak to thee in just respect to thy fair conduct and thy chosen judge to his decision conscious of my right i would submit my cause but since the pride of haughty ronan to the sword appeals i answer him  his challenge i accept and will to morrow with the rising sun meet him in arms here where we first encountered it is thine o king to regulate the combat   kathul durstan i disapprove    durstan i know thou do but thou can not prevent it must be so king of the isles farewell  kathul tarry a while enter my hall and of the feast partake the hall of semo shines with many fires  durstan fast by my ships upon the sandy shore i will pass the night the feast of foes i shun  often when the circling shell awakes the soul like flints the words
