the spanish lady a musical entertainment in two acts founded on the plan of the old ballad  as performed at the theater royal in covent garden  will you hear of a spanish lady how she wooed an english man old ballad london printed for the author  preface the author of this little piece having already thought it incumbent on him to explain in the public paper his motives for writing it and the reasons why it did not make it is appearance on the stage at that time he presumes a repetition of those will be the most proper preface to it here  the elegant simplicity of the old ballad which has been justly remarked by many writers of allowed taste had often induced me to wish to see it modelled into a petitepiece the advice of a singular conquest obtained over spain in the year      influenced me to attempt it i thought the scene might not improbably be laid there and that some few hints tending to illustrate and as far as so small a production might be able to perpetuate that glorious exploit would while popular praise and admiration was alive and warm atone for what deficiences might be found in the conduct and diction such a kind of undertaking being really new to me  with this view the piece was received licensed and rehearsed at covent garden the winter before last  but the disturbances which then happened at both theaters obstructed the intended performance  if now stands as a simple fable and may be considered merely as the story of the spanish lady brought forward into view if in the principal scene between the english officer and the lady i have not wholly destroyed the pathetic simplicity of my original i should hope with the assistance of the music which has been selected under the inspection of an eminent composer that the piece may not be found unentertaining to a delicate and a feeling mind wherever i could i have used the very words of the ballad which for the satisfaction of a curious eye i have hereunto annexed  in this plain dress my production now appeals to the candor of an english audience  and is  with the highest deference and respect dedicated to the brothers  persons represented men worthy a noble english officer mr

hard gale i never was so near going to the bottom you landmen now lie safe enough   ensign i dont know what you mean by safe the devil could not have slept in such a storm i will swear the fort shook about our ears with ten times the violence it did when the mine was sprung and i was more alarmed yet lieutenant that was no trifling work   lieutenant trifling no faith for that resolute dog the governor laid about him like a devil    st soldier poor fellow it so grieved the heart of me to see him when the cowardly rascals had all left him obliged to give up his sword that i could have cried for him if i had not thought it a shame for a soldier in action    d soldier ay but ben shall you ever forget our commanders usage of him upon that occasion i cod it is my opinion the governor was not very sorry to lose his friends when he found so good an enemy   lieutenant ensign can you tell me where your good commander worthy is i have a message to him from our admiral   ensign i expect him

i discovered last night at george ravages the very sight of it threw her into such an agony that i was obliged to leave it in her lap and run off it was too much for me   worthy you give me pleasure

stranger to nor am i wishing you should break through them all i presume to urge is that if you were inclined so to do here is a fair occasion offered you   worthy it is an experiment i shall not be induced to make yet were i ever so strongly inclined to it it must be length of time and very plain circumstances alone could convince me of the fairness of such an occasion i cannot bear that cruel misinterpretation of a womans behavior which supposes her good humor and affability can have no end but love  song i with scorn i view that insectrace who blemish womans fairest grace those fluttrers

happy the women that are united to them even to his foes he shows so lovely that his beneficence and humane care of all around him make him appear rather a father than a conqueror the hours that he
