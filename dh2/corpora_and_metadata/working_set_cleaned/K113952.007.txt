beauties rise for ever new yon lofty hill crowned with those stately trees that sinking valley that receives the breeze yon velvet downs where sheep unnumberd feed those fields which wave with corn that greensward mead proclaim aloud the wise creators hand for chance could never produce a work so grand all these in concert hymn their makers praise while with delight and wonder mortals gaze a harvest scene    behold the green fields yellowing into corny gold while over their ranks an old man half appears how hale he looks though hoard with seventy years his prospect mounts slowpaced he strives to climb and seems some ancient monument of time propt over his staff the reverend father stands and views heavens blessings with uplifted hands gleeful in heart computes the years increase

the taper in the blaze of day thou love to steal along the secret shade where fancy bright aerial maid awaits thee with her thousand charms and revels in thy wanton arms she to thy bed in days of yore the sweetly warbling shakespeare bore whom every muse endowed with every skill and dipped him in that sacred rill whose silver streams flow musical along where phoebus hallowed mount resounds with raptured song forsake not thou the vocal choir their breasts revisit with thy genial fire else vain the studied sounds of mimic art tickle the ear but come not nigh the heart vain every phrase in curious order set on each side leaning on the stopgap epithet vain the quick rhyme still tinkling in the close while pure description shines in measured prose thou bear aloof and look with high disdain upon the dull mechanic train whose nerveless strains flag on in languid tone lifeless and lumpish as the bagpipes drowzy drone no longer now thy altars blaze no poet offers up his lays inspired with energy divine to worship at thy sacred shrine since taste by taste is here meant the modern affectation of it with absolute domain extending wide her leaden reign kills with her melancholy shade the blooming scyons of fair fancys tree which erst full wantonly have strayed in many a wreath of richest poesy for when the oak denies her stay the creeping ivy winds her humble way no more she twists her branches round but drags her feeble stem along the barren ground where then shall exiled genius go since only those the laurel claim and boast them of the poets name whose sober rhimes in even tenor flow who prey on words and all their flowrets cull coldly correct and regularly dull why sleep the sons of genius now why wartons rests the lyre unstrung dr akenside and thou

castles rude remains half buried there lie many a broken bust and obelisk and urn overthrown by time and many a cherub here descends in dust from the rent roof and portico sublime the rivulets often frighted at the sound of fragments tumbling from the towers on high plunge to their source in secret caves profound leaving their banks and pebbly bottoms dry where reverend shrines in gothic grandeur stood the nettle or the noxious nightshade spreads and ashlings wafted from the neighboring wood through the worn turrets wave their trembling heads there contemplation to the crowd unknown her attitude composed and aspect sweet sits musing on a monumental stone and points to the memento at her feet soon as sage evening checked days sunny pride i left the mantling shade in moral mood and seated by the maids sequestered side thus sighed the mouldering ruins as i viewed inexorably calm with silent pace here time has passed  what ruin marks his way this pile now crumbling over its hallowed base turned not his step nor could his course delay religion raised her supplicating eyes in vain and melody her song sublime in vain philosophy with maxims wise would touch the cold

plain his rights and rich demesnes extended wide that honor and her knights composed his train and chivalry stood marshalled by his side though to the clouds his castle seemed to climb and frowned defiance on the desperate foe though deemed invincible the conqueror time levelled the fabric as the founder low where the light lyre gave many a softening sound ravens and rooks the birds of discord

sweetsinging at the silverwo king loom the travellers bewildered on a waste and the rude winds incessant seem to roar where in his groves with arching arbours graced young lovers often sighed in days of yore his aqueducts that led the limpid tide to pure canals a crystal cool supply in the deep dust their barren beauties hide times thirst unquenchable has drained them day though his rich hours in revelry were spent with comus and the laughterloving crew and the sweet brow of beauty still unbent brightened his fleecy moments as they flew fleet are the fleecy moments fly they must not to be

loudly blustering boreas blew when thrice the gallerys length i walked along and meditated much on right and wrong the past the present rushing to my view thus on the couch i at my ease reclined revolving over and over within my mind all i had suffered or enjoyed pleasure remembered present sorrow brings and from past sorrow satisfaction springs then my whole life my thoughts employed i viewed my failings and my virtues too and doubtless gave myself all merit due yet for impartial judgment strove from crime i cleared my conscience not from blame and dared my own an honest heart to

generous heart above deceit for spotless faith renowned is now commenced an awkward cheat since love an entrance found through pathless groves alone you stray by cynthias twinkling beam and steal from social friends away to haunt sabrinas stream and while with sympathizing sighs i ask your cause of woe i see your laboring bosom rise and grateful tears overflow i see the crimson blush declare the

pitying sighs her lovelorn basom tore the ready boat the tardy youth upbraids and frequent summons from the rowing maids   i come he cries  my ajutt loved adieu   forget me not my fair  be just  be true the words by grief half frozen on his tongue he sighed  she wept  and on his bosom hung then vowed unchanging love and fervent prayed the powers to guard him for his faithful maid and that no mermaid siren of the deep might snatch her love or give her cause to weep with sorrow tender as the constant dove who mourns the tedious absence of her love did anningait his lovely ajutt leave and from her wish his only joy receive with here is his own he joins and prays each power to guard his maid and hasle their nuptial hour then onward moves  now looks a last adieu while tender eloquence his cheeks bedew thrice he attempts his floating bark to leave and swim to ajutt over the dashing wave like some fair image ajutt lifeless stands surveys his boat and marks the printed sands till waves and rocks her prospect intercept her hut then sought and there in private wept but roused by hope of anningaits return each female art she tries in various turn one hour the greenest moss she culls with care and dries the grass for anningait to wear of softest skins a fishing coat she wrought of curious form like him of whom she thought a boat of toughest skins together sewed and as she worked each tender vow renewed then in soft numbers each good genius prays to guide her swain through terrors pathless ways and that his nervous arms might stronger prove than the fierce bear nor aught annoy her love that his swift darts unerring he might guide that his tough boat might bravely stem the tide that the cracked ice might never his feet betray nor his harpoon might ever fail the prey thus in lone sadness ajutt still remains nor joins the maidens on the jocund plains her locks unbraided over her shoulders flow in beauteous negligence and pomp of woe their rural sports she now no more adorns nor thinks of joy till anningait returns while he by calms detained or tempest tossed vainly attemps to reach the destined coast banished from ajutt all his joys are lost sighing he stands and views the ruffled main and thus to life compares the varied scene  o frail uncertain state where shall we find  a truer emblem of the human mind  than in the floating ice by billows tossed  it towers on high there sparkles and is lost  the sunbeams bright dissolve the glittering toy  and rocks below their hidden power employ  each cause concurs this certain truth to prove  no joys are permanent but those above  what art thou pleasure fleeting as a dream  which sudden blazes like a northern gleam  that plays a moment on our dazzled eyes  then palls and fades and in an instant dies  what art thou love the whirlpool of our rest  the fatal eddy of the human breast  the soft sensation that unseen obtains  such sovereign sway soon absolute it reigns  had not my eyes thy charms o ajutt traced  the sweet expressions that thy person graced  the winning softness and the attracting mien  which conscious spoke the graces dwelt within  then had i still with downy ease been blessed  slept like the careless morse in vacant rest  joyous as minstrels in the starry sphere  had felt no grief a stranger still to care  but if my lovely fair will true remain  how light each toil and overpaid each pain  that sweet reflection shall my peace restore  she is just as fair and we shall part no more  that thought my ajutt shall my nerves newbrace  i will hunt the raindeer to the utmost chase  a few weeks past then loaded i will return  and loves pure flame for us shall grateful burn  roefish and porpoise shall thy kindred feast  and thou shall smile on every friendly guest  the fox and hare shall ajutts couch enfold  and seals tough skins shall screen thee from the cold  the marble lamps with sweetest oil i will fill  to light thy tent and fragrant fumes distill  haste then o time add swiftness to thy flight  for without ajutt horrid were the night thus was the youth alternate captive led by smiling hope dismay and anxious dread till roused by spouting whales his ardour glows he with new courage to the combat goes ajutt a sweet recluse from all she loved retirement wooed by social joys unmoved true to her love as is the attracted steel in thought feels every woe that he might feel once as she strayed by gentle labor led drying soft skins to deck her lovers bed nornsuck a mighty chief among their swains returned from hunting on the distant plains the maid he raptured views with sot surprise and falls a victim to her conquering eyes fair without gaudy pomp or studied art her native beauty struck the heros heart by love oerawed whose power he now first knew speechless he gazed and wist not what to do but ready hope her healing succor sends and bids him gain the fairone by her friends for much he feared his suit to ajutt vain yet blessed the absence of her favored swain revolves with joy his birth and mighty store for great his wealth no greenland swain had more with these resolves her parents faith to try and hopes their power might win her to comply yet first presumes his passion to disclose and over her neck a dappled deerskin throws this with disdain the faithful maid returns and then for anningait afresh she mourns her fathers distant hutt he instant sought his worth explained and every tender thought which soon their sordid minds to his opinion wrought home when the maid returns with artful tale they praise young nornsuck hero of the vale his power his wealth they set in dazzling light his vast possessions for the approaching night how bright his form for true the youth was fair in graceful ringlets flowed his jetty hair his person pleasing and quick piercing eye that might for brightness with the eagles vie his ardent passion crowned the irksome tale but vain each art that dared her truth assail with silent scorn the amazing change she hears that they forget her vow and daily tears at last long urged she painful silence broke and thus her sentiments in anguish spoke  sooner shall whales their liquid world forsake  and seek for pastime in the half froze lake  sooner shall endless night over greenland reign  and cheering sunshine never gild the plain  than i in thought or word my love forego  fixed as my native frost unblemished as my snow then swift as bounding heart away she fled and traversed hill or dale as fancy led firmly resolved the hutt to see no more till anningait arrived on greenlands shore a willing exile from her fathers board her wants supplied from natures varied hoard she often high cliffs ascends and eager eyes the distant main in curling billows rise each time new hope her anxious bosom cheers nay more than hope for now the boat appears the wished for bark in loaded pomp returns wild with the joy no longer now she mourns but darts with rapid ease over hill and dale now scours the plain or skims along the vale till faint with joy she gains the pebbled shore and hails the bark and hears the dashing oar then with loud rapture calls her destined mate her life her lord her muchloved anningait but the glad sounds no anningait repays trembling she wonders at the unkind delays eager the cruel reason she demands when drop the oars from each ones nerveless hands aghast they gaze as anningait she calls nor know what fate the hapless swain befalls the youth impatient long before was gone in a swift boat unloaded and alone their tedious voyage love could not approve that so long kept him from expecting love but how or where he was they knew no more than she just lifeless on the crowded shore with horror struck immovable she stands and wets with copious tears the thirsty sands the virgin train in social woe attend and all bewail the anguish of their friend her kindred round now mourn then sooth her woes and from each friendly tongue persuasionflows they try to win her home and calm her mind but she was deaf as rocks and heedless as the wind with gentle force at last they brought her there and seek each lenitive to sooth her care then her soft couch with sleekest skins they spread and lead her gently to her longleft bed then prayed the downy god to seal her eyes and that sweet peace again might with her rise she thankful heard but knew their wish was vain from anningait thus torn all life was pain yet lulls her grief with sad reflections power that forth unheeded in the silent hour when the soft deity their pillows strewn and in sweet slumber every sense subdued she might with safety gain the lateleft shore and for her love each terror would explore with double pain the unwilling moments fly till all was hushed and closed was every eye then instant quits her once loved place of rest where peace long dwelt though now no more a guest softly she stole her sleeping friends to view and looked and sighed a tender last adieu now filial tenderness her bosom tore that those dear objects she might see no more but what o nature are thy feebler ties when love inspires thy sweet sensation flies  her fearwingd feet the distant shore soon gain seize the first boat then boldly plough the main nor more her native greenland ever trod  nor yet the youth  some think an angry god the potent genius of the floods and rock fierce haffgufa or dreaded amarock

while round thee beauteous blooming maid deftly the frisking dolphins played come and bring thy wanton boy cause of fondness source of joy and bid him take that golden dart that erst transfixed apollos heart when with full force and winged speed over tufted lawn and flowery mead now slow with long toil up some steep now down precipitately deep through many a grove and many a glade the god pursued the flying maid bring besides thy joyous train soft supporters of thy reign wanton smiles endearments charming mirth and coyness unalarming whispers kisses sighs and fears lovely looks and trickling tears joy of festive sprightly mien and innocence of look serene thy smiling train can never cloy if led by innocence and joy permit me goddess fond and free to join with them and join with thee ever present ever by thus let me live thus let me die rise we when the meekeyed morn does the spangled meads adorn when every bird from every spray tunes various his lovelabourd lay lo from yon cloud the flaming sun gins his stated course to run brightening rays incessant streaming dewdrops sparkling twinkling beaming refreshed nature smiles anew and brings her brightest charms to view on delia thinking will i stray heedless where i choose the way over distant hills and dales bleating mountains lowing vales by silent river rolling flood fringed meadow waving wood where flora does her sweets dispense and different prospects please the sense while sturdy oxen grazing nigh with loud lowings fill the sky and the swallow skims the ground and the lambkin bleateth round and many a cuckows echoing note wavering to the ear does float such pleasing sounds and sights inspire glowing love and soft desire sweet hour of pleasure then to choose breathe the soft strain and court the muse fairest delia be my theme by some whispering silver stream that through the painted meads does stray and swiftly trickling winds away and when the sun exalted high fierceglowing measures half the sky often oh my delia will we rove along some closeembowred grove  oh the soft joys that fill the breast joys the sweetest and the best when by allpowerful love excited each delighting each delighted we sit within some thickwove bower full fragrant made by many a flower with thrilling pleasure i the while eye the kind glance or dimpling smile or often in sweet suspension hung catch the music of her tongue else in sweet notes briskly moving airy fluttering wild and roving thrice and four times and again both chant to love the pleasing strain or if the gardens flowery pride call our vagrant steps aside here unnumberd charms invite roses red and lillies white here mid blooming fragrance straying sweetly smiling fondly playing often my willing hands prepare odorous garlands for my fair and mix around the charmers head the lillys white the roses red while love inspires each warblers throat smooths the strain or swells the note all around and all above all is joy for all is love but when the cooling evening breeze moves gently the reluctant trees then will we ofttimes stray unseen by winding walks of willows green and there the charms of music prove for music is the food of love inspiring often the warbling flute now with complaining strains that suit the vexed thoughts and barbed care of fixed sullen deep despair now more luxuriant strains employ quickening love and brightening joy such as might the soul beguile and make disturbed sorrow smile now the music varying floats then stops anon more still the notes smooth and languid soft and low tender trilling sweet and slow keep on the longcontinued sound and charm attention all around strait my breast has caught new pleasures throbs my pulse in fluttering measures grief defeated and retiring joys my raptured heart inspiring while my whole soul devoid of care hangs allenamourd on the fair and she wellpleased my looks surveys and plays and smiles and smiles and plays when nights brown shades invite to rest and nature sinks by sleep oppressed then too oh let me fond repair to flowery meadows with my fair let mimic fancy paint her charms and bring my angel to my arms let us together secret stray and all the night react the day auspicious goddess fond and free bestow these pleasures all on me for sure these pleasures thou can give and love with thee i will choose to live an ode wrote a few days before

sweet philosophy what if thou with hermitlook from retirements farthest nook markst the world in bustling show struggling over the waves of woe by the wind of black despair dashed away from care to care whilst thou calm on safetys shore do but hear the tempest roar what if thou the flowery pride of the meadows velvet side to the proudlyarching bower and the glittering court of power can prefer we envy not holy seer thy simple lot sisters twin are youth and pleasure meant to enjoy the sweets of leisure made for every blithsome sport purpose mild and gay resort age was formed for meditation not the toys of recreation with the smiles of wisdom fraught and the glow of solemn thought such is age philosophy such the mind that suits with thee but now joys of different kind wing the wish and fire the mind tumbling rills that warbling flow yellow meads with gold that glow wandering walks and rural ease such alone have power to please or perchance the lucid scene where the rays of beautys mien kindling every fond desire set the soul of love on fire or the loudlyechoing horn as it cheers the slumbering morn waking nature happily may lure us to the chase away farewell then thou willowd stream glittering bright with wisdoms beam silver came whose bowers among inspiration leads her throng clio breathes celestial fire music hangs her dulcet lyre yet farewell  to brighter joys pleasure

births like common things pass unheeded or unknown time but spreads or waves his wings the phantom swells the phantoms gone born for millions monarchs rise heirs of infamy or fame when the virtuous

brocade at a ball or the play her rival the butterfly vain to excess may be justly more proud if there is merit in dress the purple and gold in his plumage displayed than velvets more soft and more gay than brocade but with all this advantage of dress you may see that the butterfly still is less loved than the be for the be though he shines with no purple and gold we provide a good lodging to fence from the cold for his honey we love him although he will sting and despise the gay insects that flutter and sing and hence the coquet this plain lesson may find  that the useful alone are the
