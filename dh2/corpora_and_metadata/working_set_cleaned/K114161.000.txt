 dedication to mrs jordan madam in the hours of meditation when the mind was on its researches for a patroness to the following petit drama i was not long at a loss for one to whom i might with propriety pay my respects the very conspicuous figure you have made upon the stage brought your merits to my view and from those i thought there could be no impropriety in my laying this trifle at your feet the tutelary sisters melpomene and thalia who preside over all the scenic arts have taken you by the hand and placed you on a pedestal so high that envy lowers her scowling front whenever she casts her jaundiced eye upon your exalted station for you justly assimulate the pathetic manners of the one and fascinate with the bewitching archness of the other this perhaps may look like flattery but those who know me know that flattery is a talent which i never yet possessed and for the want of which perhaps i may have hatched some snakes and scorpions who have endeavored to breathe their venom upon the blossoms of my reputation in the present instance certain malevolant competiters attempted to sting my rising hopes and disconcert the eminent and arduous exertions of the performers to whom i am so much indebted on this pieces first assay  yet i had the satisfaction to see it baffle all their spleen and now madam i submit it to the approbation of the public and hope it will receive your protection  i have the honor to subscribe myself madam your most humble and obedient servant george saville carey store street bedford square advertisement the printer begs leave to

his hobby and that all mankind are at some period of life or other the dupes of fancy upon the whole they pronounce this farce to surpass mediocrity and that its merits justly deserve that kind

the public in general will be highly gratified by a sight and perusal of this comic piece  on it is first appearance at the hay market some objections were made to it is length particularly in the dinner scene but by the authors judicious curtailment for future representation every objection of this kind will be obviated it is however printed as originally written and such parts of it marked as were omitted in the representation it is presumed it will be performed this summer at many of the watering places throughout the kingdom and that it will be brought forward with some amendment and alteration next season at the kings theater  the printer  prologue written by a friend of the author the actor coming on the stage as if in anger with the prompter i wish your prologues all were in

out of ones wits at the lookingglass   dolly tying on your neckcloth truly  heavens what a sloven  why you have not above half tied it  i suppose you will be for making love to me with your collar

smoke like a couple of turks   gaby lord bless me i had forgot all that to be sure   dolly i knew you had you have a precious memory but my master would not be apt to forget you i fancy if you had not

gaby and dolly scene ii mr tintem is discovered in his morning gown and velvet cap surrounded with garden pots flowersticks and a pen stuck in his cap with which he marks some of the labels tintem they say that every man has his hobby horse and without one has something in pursuit life is as insipid as tripe without mustard or vinegar  my hobbyhorse is my flowergarden and i can ride that with safety for i shall never be afraid of that kicking me in the stomach or breaking my neck with stumbling  i expect my friend grub here by and by and think that i shall amaze him with the variety of colors which i shall present to him in my amphitheatre  mr grub has his hobbyhorse too but his horse is a butterfly  i often tell him that he is as fond of pursuing a fly as a fish or a swallow  but i must make haste he will be here soon and if we should not happen to have the dinner on table exactly at one he will be for stinging me with reproaches and buzzing in my ears like a gnat   enter gaby gaby did you ring sir   tintem yes to be sure  yet one would have thought that you had forgot it by your being so long in coming  what was you about   gaby nothing sir   tintem i suppose so  i should have been angry with you had you not told me the truth for that is one of the hardest things in the world to get at   gaby oh sir i always tell the truth   tintem you are mistaken i am afraid and have marred all you only told me truth by way of accident because you was too dull of invention and had not time to tell me a falsehood   gaby i never tell a falsehood sir but when i cannot help it   tintem well  i hope dolly told you that alderman grub was coming to dine with me to day   gaby yes sir   tintem and are all things in readiness   gaby yes  sir  no  sir   tintem yes sir no sir  there seems to be a lie and a true saying both in a breath which of them am i to believe   gaby which you please sir   tintem i suppose so  therefore i am inclined to believe that you have got nothing ready   gaby faith sir you have hit it   tintem hit it have i  why you audacious scoundrel i have a good mind to hit you i will knock you down you blockhead  where is my wig   gaby upon the block sir   tintem i wonder that you have it not on then is it dressed   gaby no sir not quite dressed   tintem i declare i have a good mind to give you a good dressing  go to your brother block and finish it immediately it is insufferable to have two blockheads in the house at once but first take this and bid the gardener to place it in the amphitheatre the third row between that of arrogance and indifference being a modist flower its blushes will be the more distinctly seen  exit gaby what a strange thing is fear it sits as lord chief justice of our conscience and often extorts a falsehood or makes us tell the truth by being overawed from apprehension of conviction  this fellow of mine take him in common as a servant is not a bad one  he has always an inclination to tell the truth yet his heart is never courageous enough to prevent his give way to a falsehood  but how goes time  pulls out his watch odds so it is almost twelve oclock we shall have master grub here by one  rings the bell enter dolly dolly did you ring sir   tintem aye how goes on the dinner   doly as fast as the jack and fire can make it sir  cook sir is broiling away like a posthorse in the dog days   tintem and if she should happen to be a minute too late my friend grub would have no more mercy upon her than the hasty rider upon his jaded steed   dolly cook you know sir is a little rough in her paces if he were to fall foul of her he might stand a chance to be flung and get his bastings   tintem where is my neice  mrs prateadace   dolly in her dressing room sir   tintem tell her it is twelve oclock  mr grub will be here presently bid her get ready to receive him and not be behind hand as she generally is upon these occasions   dolly oh never fear her sir she may be ready to receive him in order to please you but she will be the more glad to get rid of him to please herself   tintem what do you mean by that you impudent baggage  hey   dolly i can hardly tell what i mean myself sir  but there is a certain old gentleman that will acquaint you soon enough i warrant you   tintem an old gentleman  what old gentleman huzzy   dolly why sir the old gentleman that goes seesaw seesaw in the face of our clock who has got only one lock of hair on his forehead and a scythe in his hand  old master time   tintem was there ever such insolence  away with you then and dont stay loosing your time here but mind your business and take care that every thing be properly placed  exit dolly mean while i will go and take a peep into the garden and like a good and prudent minister see that my affairs be properly arrangd fit for the eye of public inspection  exit scene iii the house enter mr willingford disguised as a ballad singer with songs here is the place and this the temple wherein resides the goddess of my affections  while i like a poor and devoted pilgrim have wandered hither thus disguised to render up my offerings and soothe those pangs of love which rankle in my breast  i have taken this disguise lest i should be discovered by the imperious and avaricious eye of one that is fixed by fate as a guard to check the inclinations of her lenient bosom  therefore will put my little stratagem into execution by singing an old english ballad and see if i cannot attract the notice of some of the domestics to whom i may communicate my purpose and through whom i may perhaps have an opportunity of seeing the beloved object of my heart   song mr willingford of all the girls etc  dolly and gaby enter in the middle of the song and listen  and when it is finished go up to willingford and buy one each dolly faith you sing well master let me have one of your songs i like them vastly  willingford gives a song gaby and so do i come let me have one too  willingford gives him two nay you have given me too many  i only asked for one and you have given me two   willingford why did not you say one two and that makes a couple to be sure   gaby does it so mr sharpshins but one will do for me i thank you though i wish it had been dolly of our alley  instead of sally of our alley then i should have been singing it all day to my sweetheart here   dolly sweetheart  youre a pretty fellow for a sweetheart to be sure  come come come along in and mind your business or else instead of a sweetheart you may chance to meet with a sour face from my master by and bye   as they are going willingford interrupts them willingford dolly dolly   dolly dolly dolly  how the deuce did you come by my name so pat   gaby why i told him to be sure   willingford dont you know me   dolly know you

the world   gaby nor i either  not but that i am glad to see you dont you be afraid of that  ha ha ha i cannot help laughing at it  this is a comical kind of a joke   dolly come in sir for heavens sake and let me hide you or else it will be a tragical joke i am afraid   gaby aye away with you sir away with you for your own sake for dollys sake and for my sake well take care of you  though hide and seek is no bad game by the bye  i know one that will be glad to find you  exeunt omnes scene iv miss tintem in her dressing room reading miss tintem the story which i have been reading puts me exactly in mind of poor mr willingford and myself  his father died and left him nothing but a good education and the wide and hazardous world to ramble in  mine bequeathed me all he had by his will but left me no will of my own  he has made me over to the care of an avaricious uncle until i arrive at the age of twentyone which thank heaven is almost at hand yet he wishes to transfer me to a beastly creature who would fain present himself to me as a husband  but i will die first  i am told they cannot force me to marry any body against my will and that is a comfortable consolation  ah poor mr willingford when i think of thee    dolly speaking in a hurry from the staircase dolly miss miss missey   miss tintem what is the matter   dolly come down stairs and i will tell you   miss

inch of him and a pretty one too   miss tintem who is he then why dont you tell me   dolly why who should it be but mr willingford   miss tintem mr willingford  bless me you have struck me with astonishment  i hope my uncle has not seen him if he has we shall have a sad piece of work and all our hopes will be totally overset  where is my uncle   dolly in the garden   miss tintem and where is mr willingford   dolly i have taken care of him he is safe enough out of harms way i promise you   miss tintem is he   dolly aye that he is   miss tintem where is he then   dolly where do you think

endeavor to help you out  i am not in love you know  i have got no flurry on my spirits   miss tintem you are the best of creatures and shall never have occasion to repent this act of kindness   dolly i will tell you what then  you know my master and old grub always go poking and pottering about the garden after dinner and will be for holding their argumentations of an hour and a half long about their flowers their butterflies and the duce knows what   miss tintem well  what then  my dear good girl  what then   dolly what then  why then you will have nothing to do after dinner but to let mr willingford know that you are alone and you will not want company i warrant you   miss tintem after dinner  now you talk of dinner what is he to do  must the poor dear creature set starving in your bedroom all the time i dare say he has not dined  did you ask him   dolly dined  why i am told that your true lovers never want to eat   miss tintem prithee dont be foolish   dolly dont make yourself uneasy miss i was neither so foolish or so brutish but i had thought enough about me to take proper care of him   miss tintem in what respect   dolly in respect to his dinner  for i have sent him up a cold collection as they call it and provided him with some veal and ham the cold giblet pie some cold pudding by way of settling his love and a bottle of wine to wash it down whenever he pleases   miss tintem excellent  you delight me  bell rings that is my uncles bell  go and ask what he wants and let me know immediately  exit dolly i am delighted with the frankness and attachment of this good natured girl but extremely aggitated at the state of poor mr willingford sure it is the most provoking and tantalizing situation in the world  the man i love and whom i have not seen this month to have him under the very roof with me and even there deprived the sight of him when instead of receiving him as i ought to have him locked up in a state of apprehension and fear is hard indeed   enter dolly dolly miss my master is in the strangest mood imaginable and desires that you will come down immediately   miss tintem tell him that i am coming exit dolly he will find me in as strange a mood as himself  i have just as little inclination to set down to dinner as i have to hear the conversation that i am likely to be pestered with while i am at the table  exit miss tintem scene v changes to a dressing room and discovers mr tintem buckling on his shoes still in his cap with his hat over it he rings the bell enter gaby gaby did you want me sir   tintem where is my wig sirrah must i dine in

creature pushed me down and so to save my head from going into the fire i tumbled with my hands into the drippingpan which scalded my poor fingers so much that i was obliged to to run to dr serets in order as a body might say to get them nointed before i could make use of them again   mr tintem i wish you and the cook were both in heaven   gaby heaven forbid sir   mr tintem heaven forbid indeed

consider the hour master tintem it is dinner time and my stomach generally looks sharp after that  but my eye my eye mr tintem at this moment looks very sharp after something else  my dear miss tintem how do you do  my dear little sweetheart how do you do   miss tintem i thank you sir but very indifferent   grub indifferent  i am very sorry for that but i hope you will never be indifferent to me   gaby aside you seem to be but a very indifferent creature at the best   mr tintem come my good friend  sit down  say what i shall help you too   grub why sir if you please i will thank you for a little of the roasted pig  i am glad you have got a young pig there is nothing that i love better than a young pig and every thing that is young so does my dear little girl there i dare say doesnt she   gaby aside oh what an amorous devil   miss tintem would you wish me sir to be fond of nothing but what is young   grub no to be sure speaking with his mouthful   miss tintem then you never can expect that i can be fond of you   gaby aside that is a douser for you old one   mr tintem the devils in the girl to be sure you will never get mr grub for a husband while you pass such compliments as those upon him   grub oh never mind the little puss  for as to compliments and all them there kind of things i never minded them  nay to tell you the truth i always hated compliments eating   mr tintem i should think it strange indeed if you could ever love them especially if they came in the manner my niece bestows them on you   grub ah let the little thing say what she will she will never be able to make me quarrel with my victuals   miss tintem that i really believe aside   mr tintem will you give me leave to help you to a little of this roasted duck  i assure you it is highly seasoned and seems to be well dressed  a clean plate gaby   grub roasted duck  i was always very very fond of a roasted duck   gaby what a fond creature it is  aside   miss tintem i dare say that will be his answer to every thing upon the table aside   mr tintem shall i help you to a leg or a wing master grub   grub both if you please my very good friend   gaby it is a pity he had not the whole duck feathers and all aside   mr tintem that is right i like every body to speak their mind it shows the proper freedom of spirit and saves a great deal of unnecessary trouble   grub i likes freedom and i hates trouble  you may be sure of that by the speeches you must have heard me make in guildhall  i say nothing now but dont you think that we are in a sweet situation   mr tintem sweet not very sweet at present for you must confess we have been rather sowered of late   grub sowered  pray by what means   mr tintem why i think the sweetness of our situation has been greatly abated by the high price your company has set upon sugars   grub oh that has proved a monstorous good thing to our company   mr tintem but monstorous things are not at all times the most pleasant either to the eye or to the mind and i know of no monster so frightful to the greatest part of his majestys subjects as that monster called monopoly   grub a monopoly i never saw any of them there creatures in all my life  pray sir what are they like and what part of the world do these monopolies come from   gaby aside lord they are to be seen at exeter change or the lyceum every day   mr tintem from all parts i fancy but it is an animal that seems to thrive more in this country than any other   grub ah master tintem you seem to be more acquainted with these here matters than i am  you have traveled a good deal you know i am told that you have been to all the wateringplaces in england but as to my part i was never any farther than margate  i went there and came back by water which made me so sick of the journey that i dont think i shall ever go there again   mr tintem no indeed   grub no not i  besides they are such a set of imposing rascals that they would often charge me sixpence for a halfpennys worth of small beer and you know one can get a quart of good sound porter in london for threepence halfpenny   mr tintem ah you will find imposition in every part of the kingdom nowadays   grub a little more duck if you please   gaby i knew he would finish it aside   mr tintem how do you like it  dont you find the sauce rather predominant   grub i have not tasted any yet  i wish you would give me a little of it   mr tintem a little of what   grub why a little of the predominant as you call it  i suppose that is some new kind of sauce i wish you would give me a little of it   mr and miss tintem endeavor to smother a laugh mr tintem i beg pardon master grub but you cannot help being entertaining   grub aye that is my way  i am generally said to be the life of the company   gaby i will be hanged if he beant as great a gaby as myself aside   mr tintem will you drink a glass of wine   grub with all my heart and i dare say my little intended will not refuse to join me  i will give you a toast if i can remember one  oddsbobbs i have it  i will give you love without interest   miss tintem with all my heart sir   mr tintem that is good  i must join you in that  come love without interest   in the

and a basin in the other apply the bottle to his nose and the water to his temples immediately  i hope it is no apoplexy   miss tintem no i do not think it is that i fancy it was only the toast stuck in his stomach   mr tintem to gaby toast toast  why you damned villain have you put toast in the wine   gaby toast sir  toast  lord sir i never did such a foolish thing in all my life   mr tintem to miss why did not you say that the toast stuck in his stomach   miss tintem i only meant the sentimental toast which he had given himself   mr tintem oh he revives   grub recovering mercy upon me where am i   gaby in our house sir   grub oh my poor head  oh my stomach i thought that i should have been choked   dolly ah poor gentleman that would have been a pity indeed sarcastically   mr tintem bless me my good friend i have been sadly alarmed but i assure you i am overjoyed to see you so much recovered   grub i thank you my very good friend  i thank you  what do i see my dear little sweetheart  i warrant she has been ready to cry at my misfortune   miss tintem and dolly ha ha ha   grub is that the way you show your feeling  what do you laugh at my affliction   miss tintem i beg your pardon sir  i did not laugh at your afflictions but your expressions   dolly lord sir do you think that my mistress is to fall acrying every time you choke yourself with eating or suffocate yourself with drinking  ha ha ha   mr tintem gaby and you miss tarter take the dinner things away they take away and madam my niece you shall be confined to your dressing room without society   grub nay dont be cruel to her dont banish her this time her laughing was perhaps only an innocent frolic  a liberty you know that lovers will take with one another now and then   mr tintem sir she must not be indulged in this way  but console herself alone till she can behave better   grub oh the little piggywiggy  it grieves me to hear so cruel a decree   miss tintem it is no cruelty to me sir i can assure you   mr tintem there is for you again  come sir you and i will go and take a peep into the garden while she sits a little by herself so that she may be softened by reflection   grub ah master tintem you are a wag  you seem to know how to manage the ladies to a nicety  perhaps it may be all for the best  my dear little intended dont you mourn  dont you get piping now by yourself  a little absence they say is sometimes a great sedement to love  is it not deary   miss tintem you will excuse me if i laugh a little  i cannot help it now ha ha ha   mr tintem away with you madam we shall be back to tea  then see if you can prepare it in time and meet mr grub in a more agreeable humor   grub by by  dont you get piping i say   miss tintem ha ha ha  by by ha ha ha   grub what a sweet bewitching wicked little devil it is  exeunt omnes act ii scene i the garden enter tintem grub and gaby mr tintem a fine cheerful afternoon i protest   grub the weather is cheerful enough it is true but as to myself i am melancholy enough   mr tintem i am sorry for that  why should you be melancholy  what is the matter   grub that little niece of yours runs strangely in my head   mr tintem i am glad to hear that it is a good sign   grub and yet my mind is not perfectly at ease about her   mr tintem better and better still i should be sorry if it were   grub i am very much obliged to you for your kindness it seems to be a laughing matter to you but it is otherwise to me   gaby i wish he beant love sick already aside   mr tintem ha ha ha  quite touched i see  poor mr grub she seems to have got fast hold of you my friend   grub nay not not so fast as you imagine   mr tintem what is the matter with you then   grub why to tell you the truth i do not think that she seems to pay me so much attention as i could wish   mr tintem no   grub no  there is very litttle affection i am afraid about that tittering heart of here is  i doubt she does not love me truly   mr tintem not love you  never trouble yourself about that  i will make her love you   grub what whether she will or not  that must be a curious secret indeed   mr tintem aye i know the proper physic for the ladies when they happen to be disobedient   grub physic   mr tintem aye physic   gaby i wish they may not be going to give the poor creature lovepowder aside   mr tintem she is in my power at present and shall marry you whether she will or not and when she is yours you know what you have to do   grub what is that   mr tintem why you have nothing to do then but to keep her under your thumb   gaby under his thumb and if he does i wish she may not slip through his fingers aside   grub i am told there is a mr willingford a young spark to whom she turns a willing ear if so it will be a difficult matter to wean her of him   gaby you are right enough there old gentleman aside   mr tintem oh never let that give you any concern he is nothing but a boy and a beggar   grub as to his being a beggar that will be no impediment especially if he has been ingenious enough to coax her heart from her   mr tintem oh never mind the heart so you have got the body  possession you know is every thing   grub aye but the mind often sets the body capering   mr tintem confound your capering apprehensions i say  why you talk like a simpleton  what can you be afraid of   grub there was a confounded stags head and an awkward pair of horns in your hall which looked butt in my face as i entered your house to day and i cannot help thinking them omnious   gaby what a cowardly old fool aside   mr tintem mr grub mr grub take care what you say  my niece was the daughter of my brother  my brother was the son of my mother and my mother was the pattern of virtue  no mr grub if you have any qualms of that kind in your mind you have mistaken the stock the blood of the tintems is of a peculiar dye pure as the peerless stream and chaste as the mountain snow   grub and as cold too i am afraid   mr tintem cold   grub aye cold i think  why your niece always looks as chilly as an icicle at me   gaby one would think she was dead by his talking aside   mr tintem you dont like the match perhaps   grub yes my very good friend i likes the match very well  but  but   mr tintem you would like the money without the match i suppose   gaby the devil doubt him aside   grub no no  i dont say that either your niece is young and beautiful a little sweet creature any body might be fond of and i will do her the justice to say that i think she would like any young fellow better than me   gaby you never said a truer thing in all your life aside   mr tintem well well well drop the subject at present and after another interview or two you will be better able to judge of her disposition   grub i think so too and therefore let us go and amuse ourselves with a sight of your hobbyhorse as you call it   mr tintem and so you shall  go you on gaby and tell jonas the gardner to place this flower as i told you before then return home and fetch me the key of the pinery  i have forgot it  gives him the flower gaby where did you say it was to be placed sir between gnorance and impudence   mr tintem no mr impudence  between arrogance and indifference they are two very fashionable flowers  exit gaby grub and therefore must be a kin to the gentry gaby was talking of i suppose   mr tintem cousin germins i assure you  exit tintem and grub scene ii the drawing room in tintems house enter mr willingford miss tintem and dolly dolly there  i am glad you are once more got together and i wish that old harry would break the shins of him that parts you  exit dolly miss tintem what a comical girl   mr willingford what a good one she has been the providential instrument of our present blessed interview   miss tintem do not call that thing blessed which chance may have an opportunity of overturning   mr willingford my dear miss tintem i rest on hope and trust in providence you know i am a child of here is and chance must be a churl indeed should she at this moment thwart me in my wishes   miss tintem what are your wishes   mr willingford it rather surprises me that you should ask   miss tintem i do not doubt but you will be polite enough to resolve me then   mr willingford most certainly and that from my heart  ah me i wish that you were mine but that you know already and your asking me to tell you now seems as if you doubted me   miss tintem i do not doubt but when i consider the present state of things i am rather surprised that you should persevere in running after me especially when i shall tell you what a formidable rival you have to encounter   mr will a rival is it possible   miss tintem it is true and that is more   mr will i am sorry for it   miss tintem and so am i for he is a favorite of my uncles and a wealthy one also   mr will and perhaps you love him too   miss tintem you shall see him by and by then you will be able to judge if it be possible for me to resist him   mr will indeed this is a circumstance i did not expect this gives me a pain more exquisite then ever i felt before  is it possible   miss tintem is what possible   mr will that you should love him   miss tintem nay i have not told you that  you should stay till you are convinced amiable creature but i will torture him no further aside  come come cheer up  one would think that you suspected me  it carries danger with it if your doubts begin to quicken only on report   mr will  report is a dangerous fiend seldom to be credited but the doubts i have arose from what you said yourself and never did i hold your word so slight as not to credit whatever you have been pleased to tell me   miss tintem i do believe you and therefore i  i  i     mr will speak out   miss tintem it is  it is  time enough yet as the song says   mr will but shall i tell you what i hope you was going to say   miss tintem that might show too much conceit in you perhaps and put a maiden to the blush   mr will well  it it enough  i shall rest satisfied without doing the one or saying the other and trust to the event   miss tintem but to digress a little from the present parley dolly told me of all your stratagem how she discovered you and that you sang charmingly   mr will i am afraid dolly has deceived you   miss tintem will you give me leave to judge   mr will i can deny you nothing as i know you have generosity and candor enough to overlook defect when poor endeavor does her utmost to oblige   miss tintem i hope so   mr will i will try to sing you a little song which i made respecting the situation of a poor recruit whom i once met upon a journey lamenting that his ill stars had parted him from his favorite fair one   song the poor recruit i as i have plodded my way to some country town full many a wearisome day my purse has contained but a scanty halfcrown and that has soon melted away ii often weary and sad on some wintry road with rain i have been wet to the skin of my knapsack grown tired i have sought for abode at some friendly good alehouse or inn iii i have hoped that good fortune in turning her wheel would cast me perchance on the place where the wound in my bosom would instantly heal at the sight of my sallys dear face iv she grieves for she knows how i am destined to roam on the strength of my furlow to rest and then she often wishes her allen at home to bury his cares in her breast  enter dolly in a hurry dolly i beg pardon for interrupting you but i could not help telling you that gaby is just returned from the garden and says there had like to have been a sad piece of work about you both   miss tintem what was the matter then   mr will do they know that i am here   dolly no  but master and old grub had like to have quarrelled about you   miss tintem in what respect   dolly why mr grub had found out saving your presence miss that you had an affection for mr willingford   miss tintem that is odd indeed  affection for mr willingford  who could tell him such a piece of news as that  it is more than mr willingford knows himself   dolly lord miss  but i will say no more   mr will what had this quarrel like to have risen from   dolly what  why mr grub was jealous of you to be sure and talked about the pair of stags horns in the hall staring him in the face this morning which had given him the qualms   mr will i wish they had butted him in the stomach with all my heart   miss tintem i have not ability to find out all this mystery i confess   mr will it is no matter   dolly i dare say they will quarrel i am sure it would be the highest entertainment to you both were you to go and listen to their comical conversation   m will is this mr grub as you call him the gentleman you signified to be my rival   miss tintem the same i promised that you should see him therefore we can go and stand with safety and unseen behind the old yew hedge near the amphitheatre where you may at once behold his delicious person and hear his bewitching conversation   mr will agreed   miss tintem dolly you must be sure to take care should we be put to flight to find a ready shelter again for mr willingford   dolly put to flight  i know of no shelter in such a case that would be so convenient as a tight post chaise and four good horses to hurry you both out of harms way in an instant   mr will an excellent thought   miss tintem is the girl bewitched   dolly not so bewitched but i could tell you which would be the best road you could take   mr will bravo   miss tintem prithee girl dont be foolish come let us go and listen to the learned disquisitions of my sagacious uncle and the trite observations of your more formidable rival   mr will with all my heart   exeunt omnes scene iii the garden with a view of the amphitheatre enter mr tintem and grub mr tintem here they are mr grub  here are my beauties  there is a display for you  there is an arrangement all the colors of the rainbow the eye is ravished with beholding and the nose with smelling   grub this is truly a fine sight master tintem   mr tintem fine indeed though i say it mr grub  this is nature in her holidaycloaths you say you are fond of flowers mr grub   grub so fond of them that i always buy a halfpenny nosegay when i can and stick it in my bosom whenever i go to church on a sunday   mr tintem ha ha ha  a halfpenny nosegay mr grub  i beg your pardon but you make me laugh  a halfpenny nosegay truly  they must have been weeds my good friend  weeds  what sort of flowers could they have been   grub sometimes a bunch of primroses or the lillies of the valley at other times i have treated myself with a few pale snowdrops or yellow crocuses which in my opinion are the first of flowers   mr tintem the first of flowers  ha ha ha   grub you must acknowledge that they are generally the first in the season   mr tintem i will acknowledge that they are the first colored weeds which the spring throws up but we do not place them under the denomination of flowers   grub no   mr tintem no  you talk of putting a whole bunch of flowers in your bosom for a halfpenny when many a single root of some of the flowers now before you have cost me ten twenty nay thirty pounds   grub mercy on me  why you make me tremble at the very idea   mr tintem why should you tremble about it when i have told you it is my hobbyhorse and there are many of your highflying dashers of the turf will give you a thousand or fifteen hundred guineas for a hobbyhorse that shall crack a hole in the fortune or break the neck of his rider before he has had him a week   grub mercy on us  when i think on the follies and extravagancies of the age i bless my stars that i happened to be born with so much prudence about me   mr tintem come come mr prudence do not arrogate so much to your own merit  you have got your hobbyhorse too  i am told that you had the liberality when you was at mr lottums auction the other day to give twenty guineas for a frame of dead butterflies   grub why that is neither here or there as the saying is  we will not talk of them there things just now but as to the matter of that i dont know why i should not have my hobbyhorse as you call it as well as any body else   mr tintem to be sure  to be sure  yours you know is a fly and mine is a flower that is the difference  so we will drop the present parley and look before us   enter mr willingford miss tintem dolly and gaby behind the yew hedge gaby there they are hard at it   miss tintem hold your impertinence mr simpleton if we should be discovered it will mar all aside   mr tintem here mr grub here is a flower for you what do you think i call this   grub nay i cannot tell   mr tintem did you never see a sign which bore a resemblance to this   grub a sign  i have seen the sign of the flowerdelucey the rose and crown and the scotch thistle which i suppose is one of the flowers of edinborough  an inward laugh from behind mr tintem aye but that is not the idea  did you never see the sign of a general like this flower   grub a general   mr tintem aye a general   grub no truly   mr tintem why then i will tell you  that is the duke of cumberland   grub the duke of cumberland   mr tintem aye the great duke of cumberland  that flower made its first appearance in the botanical world in the rebellion fortyfive  was named in honor of the british hero of that day and such a flower as this is enough to immortalize the memory of any general in the world   grub what is it an evergreen then  a tittering from behind mr tintem an evergreen  bless the man  why you seem to have no idea of vegetation at all  no more taste for a flower than i have for a dead butterfly   grub yes i have generally got a good taste for them when they produce a good smell to me smelling but this flower seems to have no smell at all   mr tintem psha  what the duce has smell to do with the beauty of a flower  it is the color we look at  the color   grub odds so  i suppose so   gaby what a couple of comical creatures ha ha ha from behind   grub wist wist  i heard a strange kind of noise just now  you havnt any varment about the garden have you  no polecats or weasels  i am strangely fearful of those kind of gentry  and as to a rat  the very sight of a rat would turn my whole mast of blood into a posset shows great apprehensions which causes a laugh from behind there again i am sure there are varment about us   mr tintem vermin  the devil  it is only some of those cursed magpies who pestre the garden every day for the sake of the cherries   grub magpies i hate your magpies they are the most hateful omnious bird that flies  i was at cuckolds point the other day when i happened to be crossed by one of those infernal chatterboxes and in a minute or two after i had the misfortune to break both my shins over a hogtrough at my cousin crumplets the bakers door which laid me up for a week  a laugh again grub there again  there are certainly varment shows much fear   mr tintem the magpies i tell you the magpies  look you here my friend grub since you are fond of a flower that has got a smell  here is one i fancy that will tickle your taste and your smell at the same time grub takes up the flower pot aye that is right  take it up and smell to it  put on your spectacles and look at it  there is a turban there is your furr there is the very sash and sabre of the emperor himself   grub emperor   mr tintem aye emperor  that is the emperor of morocco    grub the emperor of morocco why you deal in nothing but grand names  this flower i perceive has got a charming smell this is something like a flower the emperor of morocco  grand very grand  a fine sounding name i protest grub turns up his eyes with a kind of rapsodical ardour and by accident discovers a fine butterfly lets drop the flower pot and tumbles over it then gets up in a hurry with his hat in his hand pursuing the butterfly and crying out damme there goes the king of bohemia   mr tintem in a great rage runs and picks up the broken pot and the flower crying damn your king of bohemia   grub damn your emperor of morocco i would not have lost my king of bohemia for all the emperors in the world  no not the emperor of the moon   mr tintem you wretch you nonentity you thing without an idea   grub you fool you frantic you daseyhunter you stem of a dogrose you bud of a crocus you stinking root of a daffy downdilly i would not have lost my king of bohemia for all the nonsensical flowers in your garden   mr tintem why you catterpiller you bug you beetle you gnat you grub  i would not have had my emperor destroyed for all the contemptible collection of insects which you have been scraping together these thirty years  and give me leave to tell you sir that you behave like a dirty fellow   grub damme sirrah if it were not for fear of your taking the law of me i would tell you a bit of my mind   mr tintem mind mind  why you have no mind you are a mere insect  but i will close your mouth for you presently  i will lop your greedy expectations i warrant you   grub i defy you  i defy you   mr tintem my niece you cockatrice my niece   grub your niece i would not give a fig for your niece   mr tintem that is as false as you are foolish you rattlesnake it is  you would say very different things and tell a different story if her fortune were before you  you would give all your soul for that  i wish poor willingford was here with all my heart you should see that i would give her to him before your face   grub no you would not  you love yourself too much for that  i know how fond you would be of giving her fortune to a beggar i dare you to that  i dare you to that   mr tintem i shall choke with rage   they walk petulantly backward and forward upon the stage crossing each other dolly now sir  now my dear miss  now is your time   gaby aye now or never   mr will aye now is the time indeed   miss tintem i am terrified to death   mr will never fear have a good heart think of the event  do not shrink while such a plea as ours depends upon the moment  from behind mr tintem mr grub give me leave to tell you sir that i think you have behaved like an arrant scoundrel   grub take care what you say or i will make the gentlemen of the great wig shake their heads at you  they will make a good breakfast of the word scoundrel in westminster hall i warrant you  therefore i would advise you to take care what you say   mr tintem you ought rather to be afraid of what i may do   grub why what would you do   mr tintem what   grub aye what   mr tintem if young willingford was here i would convince you in a minute   grub you would be for presenting your niece to him i suppose   mr tintem cripple me if i would not   grub cripple me if i think you would   mr tintem would to heaven he was here this moment  mr will coming forward with miss tintem in his hand now my dear miss tintem  they both go up to mr tintem and kneel at his feet mr will here we both are ready for your gracious confirmation   grub and tintem start back and look with amasement mr tintem how is this  you have taken me by surprise  this act is rather sudden upon me  yet after all may i be annihilated if i be not glad of it  now you hornet you beetle you butterfly  you shall see that i will keep my word  you shall see that i will dare to do what you dared me to  take her lad  she is yours  and heaven bless you both together   dolly falls on her knees heaven bless your honor for this dear goodnatured action   grub well said mrs nettletop   gaby huzza  huzza  huzza  the emperor of morocco for ever  down with the king of bohemia down with your grubs and your catterpillars   grub i dont like this  he has played me the devil of a trick  i dont like it  i knew those cursed magpies would prove omnious aside so master tintem you have finished the business rarely upon my word   mr tintem aye and it is finished as it ought to be  i hope i have convinced you that i am not only a florist but a pugilist  i think i have given you a fair trimming  and now i will sing with the poet  revenge revenge revenge shall appease my restless spright  sings much agitated grub why you seem as if you were crazy and foam at the mouth like a mad dog  you have made a fine hand of it truly to give your niece to such a vagabond as that who has not got a farthing in the world and in all likelihood will spend her fortune in a month   mr will sir i will convince you that he has bestowed his niece upon one that loves her and one that is too sensible of the principles of a gentleman and a man of honor than to suffer himself and this amiable lady to be treated with illmanners by such a scoundrel as you are   grub take care what you say a scoundrel sirrah   mr will you shall see that i neither fear what i say or care what i do if you dont leave the room immediately you shall feel the force of my resentment in respect to such a bloated piece of consequence as you are  go home and take this by way of hastening your journey  there  there  there take that   kicks him off the stage   grub oh you villain i will make you bleed for this treatment i will  exit grub dolly take care of the varment   gaby take care of the magpies   dolly and your cousin crumplets hogtrough  hollowing after him mr tintem he is rightly served  and now since the matter is over i am glad that it is done as it is done   miss tintem it gives me infinite pleasure sir to hear you say so much   mr tintem and i feel a secret satisfaction in having done so much but willingford how came you here so opportunely   mr will upon my hobbyhorse sir   mr tintem what you have got your hobbyhorse too have you  pray what kind of a hobby did you ride   mr will my hobby was a little rosey boy with airy wings called love led by a blind capricious guide called fortune who from my cradle has for ever thwarted me in my paths but now the bounteous goddess has brought me to the fountain of sublunary bliss and crowned me with the hand of this fair lady whom i love dearer than myself and will cherish with the utmost efforts of my life   mr tintem well said  you have honestly and fairly expressed yourself and confirmed me also that i have done right in this act  you have helped to take away a load which hung heavily about my heart and it shall be my hobbyhorse in future to make you both as happy as i can   the printer
