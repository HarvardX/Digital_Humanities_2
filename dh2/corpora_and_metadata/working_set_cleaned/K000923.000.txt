essay on the nature and cure of the kings evil deduced from observations and practice  price one shilling  an essay on the nature and cure of the kings evil deduced from observations and practice  the second edition with an addition of remarkable cases of poor sufferers cured by the author  seriously recommended to the perusal of all unhappy persons and families laboring under any scrophulous complaints which have hitherto eluded all attempts to remove them  facts are stubborn things london printed for james buckland at the buck in paternoster row and sold by t toft in chelmsford mdcclxiii  introduction to this second edition it is not from any vanity of appearing in print especially a second time after such ungenerous usage as i have met with from persons calling themselves reviewers but to make myself useful in my generation to unhappy sufferers as far as i am able i refuse not the poorest person my assistance as well as the rich if they come to my house the pleasure i feel by relieving the afflicted overbalances all the cavillings sneers and illnatured reflections of reviewers or any other writers for bread who speak evil of the things that they understand not let them answer me by solid arguments confirmed by as many real cures as i have done then i shall rejoice to hear so many more miserable objects have been relieved from their disorders by my stirring up the attention or ambition of others to practice with more success  as the kings evil is a disease few of the better sort care to own i must beg to be excused from naming such persons but only some few of their cases as to the lower sort i shall give their cases in the plainest manner i can that the people of common understanding without any physical knowledge may in a great measure judge whether their complaints are scrophulous or not i have also inserted the names and places of abode of such persons that by discoursing with the parties themselves their friends or neighbors they may be satisfied of the truth of the matters of fact and receive farther information as to their own complaints and as i make no profit by my practice it is evident i need no arts to influence people to declare untruths in my favor greater numbers of cures i might have added but hope these will be sufficient to satisfy any unprejudiced person that the kings evil or other scrophulous disorders may be relieved much oftener and with more ease and safety as well as with less charge to the patients than the generality of practitioners are willing to allow or the unhappy sufferers have hitherto experienced  the preface a lady of my family having many years made it her pleasure to endeavor the relief of all such poor persons as were afflicted with scrophulous disorders or the kings evil and were recommended to her by surgeons or other practitioners and having been very successful in curing many such cases as they had given up and recommended to her made me very inquisite with her after her method of practice she very readily informed me of the nature and way of applying her remedies but would never during her life impart to me the names of the things she made use of or the method of preparation but always told me i should find a full account amongst her papers after her death which i did being her sole executor with other things i found the following letter to her from an eminent surgeon  madam i once more solicit your heavenly benediction and the salutary effects of your renowned secret which the world is from god and yourself greatly obliged for in behalf of this poor unhappy lad  b p by name who is attended with the kings evil in his foot and has been so for eleven months who i entirely submit to your care providence being your peculiar guide in the mean while i remain in conformity to facts  your sincere convert and a public wellwisher etc   this letter among many others from surgeons and apothecaries together with the great cures which she daily did made me very seriously reflect how useful a person she had been to all the human species which had applied to her in time being chiefly of the lowest class of mankind whose health and limbs were their only livelihood these were often relieved with her purse and always with her medicines and advice gratis as also all others who applied to her for relief in this deplorable malady these considerations and the great number of unhappy poor unable to pay a surgeon or apothecary daily presenting themselves to me and i knowing the safety of the method and medicines used in this disorder was imboldened to endeavor the relief of my fellow creatures by following the ladys rules of doing good for charity sake which i have followed some years with such success for which i thank god as surprises even my own self such objects of compassion having been relieved as pass all belief of any but such as have been eyewitnesses of the facts from first to last since i have been in possession of the deceased ladys notes and memorandums i have read over many authors who have treated of this disorder dr gibbs on this subject writes that if we take a view of what the most eminent authors have said of this disease we shall find their notions of it to be of little use and very few accounts of their success in curing disorders of this nature and truly i am much of the same opinion but this great good have i learnt by reading their works and from thence observing the operations of my own prescriptions that i have much improved both the method and medicines i at first used i prescribe no painful applications cutting or cauterizing blistering or nauseous loads of physic but such things only as children of half a year old to the aged of seventy may have without the least hurt or pain and with great safety be administered to them and i can justly challenge any person that has been under my care and followed my very easy directions only to allege the contrary so that i can with great truth assert that i have done some good and no harm the cure of this distemper by the ladys method is no new thing but has been in some measure used one hundred and fifty years ago as i have met with in an old author and having seen such wonderful effects from it admire what can be the reason of its being forgot shall i say or not used by the gentlemen of the faculty but it is not according to their method of practice that i am no physician surgeon or apothecary the reader will easily see by my not using hard words or technical terms of art to puzzle and confound him and my patients all know i am none of the faculty by refusing fees all that come to me are welcome to my advice and assistance gratis what necessaries are wanted they may buy of whom and where they please the inward pleasure i enjoy on seeing any poor sufferers relieved by my means makes me very ample satisfaction for all the pains i can take for their recovery  august       0 john morley  an essay etc the scrophula or what is vulgarly called the kings evil i shall now consider the word scrophula says a learned writer signifies a praeternatural tumor or humor produced by a particular acidity of the serum of the blood either in gland muscle or membrane which it both coagulates and indurates or in the marrow which it always dissolves and also putrifies the bone let us consider a little this definition it says it is a praeternatural tumor or humor who doubts the truth of the kings evil tumors and ulcers being contrary to the intention and design of nature and consequently are praeternatural next it says it is produced that is a tumor or humor by a particular acidity of the serum of the blood this seems indeed to be the general opinion of most authors i have met with on this subject who usually follow each other like packhorses in the same track but that other causes may have the same effects i shall by and by endeavor to demonstrate the nature of acidity according to this definition both coagulates and indurates coagulation is performed on milk by acids that is turning the milk into a curd it supposes the acidity or sourness of the serum of the blood does the same that is curdles in the fine vessels it enters into but because vinegar lemon juice etc are acid on the tongue must they be so in the blood what mad work must vinegar or other acids produce mixed with it let every one judge pray think what quantities of vinegar newmarket jockeys drink for a month or two together to reduce themselves to a proper weight for riding races and then tell me of any instance of the scrophula being produced by that regimen besides if this was the case why should not the serum be as soon coagulated or curdled in the large vessels as in the finer which we see it is not though the serum of the blood contains a proportional quantity of this particular acidity in the large vessels as well as in the small and i am apt to think that the larger the quantity of liquor the sooner it will turn sour and more sharp the acidity which i take to be the reason why the vinegar makers use such large casks even to the holding a hundred barrels of liquor in one body  i have observed my patients that have had sores or ulcers in their mouths or throats have never complained of or perceived any sourness or acidity of taste from the purulent matter they have spit out though i have been very inquisitive in that particular but they have always declared they had a very salt taste from the matter discharged by spittle  that there is in the spirit of human blood a great hostility according to mr boil or an antipathy in reference to acids has been plainly intimated and likewise to many sorts of acid spirits as of spirit of salt spirit of nitre spirit and oil of vitriol etc and not only against factitious acids but natural ones too which he proves by many experiments as the curious may see in his natural history of human blood where he also says as far as he has been able to observe the spirit of human blood is manifestly preferable to that classis that many call volatile alcalies because it makes such great conflicts with diverse acid spirits as spirit of salt aqua fortis etc and it will immediately turn syrup of violets from blue to green etc performing such other things that may be expected from volatile alcalies as such and he seems strongly to intimate that there are very few if any acid particles at all in the blood or even in the digestive ferment of the stomach but that great quantities of volatile alcalious salts are contained in the spirit of human blood he proves by many undeniable experiments which if true must naturally destroy all acidity in the blood itself so that consequently it cannot be a particular or any acidity at all in the blood that produces the scrophula  though spirit of salt and oil of vitriol which are strong acids will produce a curdlike substance dropped into the serum of the blood so will oil of tartar per deliquium which is a strong alcalizate salt and also highly rectified spirit of wine and many other alcalious substances do the like  from what has been said it appears that there can be no acidity at all in the blood but much alcaline salt there is very capable of producing all the symptoms and scrophulous complaints attending this disorder  the induration spoken of in the same definition i take to be only the curdlike matter hardened by length of time and thrust or squeezed closer together by the addition of more of the same matter that the marrow in the bones is dissolved i have had no opportunity to observe by not seeing any amputation performed in this disorder that the bones often scale and throw off honeycomblike exfoliations or pieces and are also much corroded i have frequently met with but why will not a sharp corosive salt cause this corrosion on human bones as well as common sea salt on the softer bones and gristlelike substances of raw beef when long salted in the picklingtub i make no doubt but it will  the reason why this disease is called the kings evil as i apprehend is because it has been often cured by the royal touch of our kings in this island from edward the confessors time and how long before i have seen no account down to the late queen annes reign this has been the subject of much debate amongst the learned because great cures have been sometimes effected that way when other means have miscarried and other means have often succeeded when the royal touch has failed what then shall we say in my humble opinion there is something in the nature of gold itself very beneficial in this disorder i dont mean laid into the hand of the physician by way of fee or pocketed by a surgeon or apothecary but worn about the patients neck by a white satin ribband hanging down to the pit of the stomach how often are gold earrings and gold beads for necklaces worn for what people call kernels in and about the neck and throat and for sore eyes which are all common appearances in this distemper and not without some benefit as i believe many young women can testify  i verily believe that gold being continually worn at the pit of the stomach next the skin has often had great and good effects but then people will not attend with patience enough the success of such a gentle operating remedy for no doubt but the fine effluvia of the gold being constantly heated by the stomach and continually rubbed against it will insinuate many of its fine particles through the pores of the skin into the blood and spirits and mixing in time with the juices of the body have very salutary effects but then i would recommend a piece of fine gold without alloy as large as a    s piece to be used for that purpose but this is too chargeable an application for my poor patients use though i sincerely think in many cases it would be very beneficial especially to young subjects whose stomachs are warm and the disease in its infancy scrophulous cases says dr leigh may be ranked amongst the opprobria medicorum or scandal of physicians and after his description of the distemper in its various appearances and effects concludes i could wish our learned surgeons in this case would make their utmost applications for the discovery of some specific to correct this humor you see this learned gentleman ingeniously owns the nature and cure of this disease was very little known by any of the faculty in his time  sir richard blackmore says it exceeds the penetration and capacity of human understanding to unravel and display those anomalous clues and convolutions proper to strumous swellings and to set their nature and constitution in a clear and distinct view and that the acutest men cannot penetrate and clearly unfold the essential difference of this disease this i think sufficiently strengthens dr leighs observations of the small progress that has been made in the nature and cure of the kings evil having but just mentioned the opinions of these two learned physicians for more particular accounts i refer the reader to their works and shall proceed with my own thoughts and observations  setting aside then the doctrine of acid and alcaly let us consider the nature of salts and whether they are capable of producing the complaints and appearances appendent to scrophulous disorders that human blood abounds with great quantities of volatile salts is sufficiently demonstrable by observing only the sweat and urine which are composed of corpuscules or particles of very differing shapes and sizes as mr boil clearly proves who after many experiments has found that these saline concretions exhibit very different appearances some are strait some crooked with various interferings representing branches of trees hartshorn feathers etc yet says he these seem not to be constant representations depending upon the particular nature of human blood but casual figurations that depend upon several accidental causes and circumstances now this scrophula is very often an hereditary disease and conveyed by parents how fine then must the seeds if i may so call them of this distemper be yet so it is as every acorn contains an oak rapt up within its surface till time and vegetation discover its trunk and spreading branches so is it with this disorder if the seeds are born with us they lie dormant in our blood till a proper time and a convenient disposition of that liquor and the nervous juices of the body cause them to grow and expand into grievous complaints and terrible symptoms  the blood which seems to be the principal seat of this disorder is divided into two parts the one called the fibrous consisting of great numbers of fine smooth red globules continually floating in the other which is a clear lympid liquor called the serum or serous part which conveys these fine globules to all parts of the human fabric in some degree or other now if any of these red globules are broken change their figure or are obstructed in their passage by the serum becoming glutinous or being in too small or too large a quantity or disordered by any praeternatural commotion or ferment the circulation through the finest vessels will be the first impeded and hindered as in the glands etc now think if it is not agreeable to reason that as the globules and serum of the blood may both contain a larger portion of these volatile salts when the blood is disordered by any praeternatural cause and may not these salts shoot into very different figures and sizes from what they were in their natural state according to the nature of the humors or distempers that are latent in the blood and as these salts are frequently of very perplexing and entangling figures may we not reasonably suppose that those irregular figured bodies carried along in the road of circulation by crossing and entangling each other may cause stoppages and obstructions in the fine tubes and strainers of the body as the glands particularly are and by a continual accession of these perplexing bodies distend the obstructed vessels by length of time into tumors which are often indurated or hardened till sometimes by their corrosive quality they fret their way through the skin and break into ulcers what can this proceed from but the red globular particles or fibrous part of blood being stopped by the figured salts and the serous part strained as through a net or sieve from the fibrous the serum for want of these smooth red globular particles being mixed with it becomes clear tenacious and sizey the minute parts of the serum not being sufficiently separated and divided by those smooth globules as before and rubbing against each other are thereby rendered acrimonious and fretting and become productive of grievous complaints hard to be removed tumors and ulcers generated by these or the like means are brought to a good digestion with great difficulty and very probably not till the remaining red globular particles of the blood can be again mixed in some degree with the clear serum and form one circulating fluid of blood and spirits as before which i suppose to be effected by melting absorbing altering or removing those saline acrimonious particles that formed the obstructions  now let us consider likewise the fibrous part of the blood or red globules which being unable to pervade or pass this rete or strainer produced by these irregular figured salts and to accompany the serum in its progress are there stopped and being spqueezed and crowded close together for want of this liquor to float them forward through the fine vessels obstruct the spirits putrify and turn into a curdlike substance till it is digested by art or nature into a soft pus or matter and so expelled its nest what is more common than to see large scrophulous ulcers especially in the more fleshy parts look of a deep red color far round their lips or edges which i apprehend to proceed from these red globules being separated from the serum and stagnating in those parts until a proper digestion is procured and then the redness gradully disappears and at the same time you may often observe a clear transparent liquor stand in dewy drops on that red surface of the skin through which it has exudated which i think a sufficient demonstration that the serous part of the blood is in this disorder strained or separated from the fibrous and visible even to the naked eye and i have always found by experience that as the quantity of this clear limpid liquor has decreased the ulcer has discharged a more laudable pus the redness insensibly worn off and then the ulcer has healed up with very little application more than dry lint  should i attempt to mention all parts subject to this disorder i must name every individual of the human fabric for i know of none exempt from this terrible malady no not even the bones themselves for in my course of practice i have had this verified by repeated observations i have had a patient afflicted with tumors and ulcers from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot and in above twenty different places besides at once the major part of which have been cured by the application of dry lint only and the remainder by very simple applications and but very little physic but such bad cases require much time to make a perfect cure for anybody must think that a disease brought into the world with one and so interwoven with the constitution and grown up with it must have much time and patience ere it can be totally subdued and eradicated from the blood and spirits though i have never seen any dissections of the human body yet i may guess from what i observe without that the stomach bowels and intestines etc are no less disordered within which must infallibly be the source of many fatal consequences unless removed by art or nature as sometimes may be the case every the least tube or strainer in the whole human frame may possibly be tormented by the seeds of this disorder as they begin to expand and long before they arrive to a bulk perceiveable by the eye or touch unusual prickings and dashings and sickness at the stomach and uneasiness in many parts are common complaints in the beginning of this disease what can these proceed from but the assemblage of sharp saline interfering particles endeavoring to force their way through these fine strainers by stops and starts the upper lip swelled eyes inflamed the glands about the jaws neck throat and shoulders tumified show this disorder rather sooner though not always than most other parts the backs of the hands elbows armpits ribs and ancles are frequently affected and as the disorder increases the softer bones feel its effects which if they exfoliate are often cured if not usually terminate in malignant ulcers of a cancerous nature and bring the patient at length to an end  that the kings evil is a disease sui generis or after its own kind i can readily admit but then how often is it complicated and blended with others as the gout venereal evil white swellings in the knees etc which seem to have a near affinity with it by affecting the bones and joints much in the same manner but the various combinations and degrees of each particular malady that may at the same time seize on the human system i believe is impossible to be distinguished and ascertained then how can we range the various swellings common or extraordinary that arise on the surface of the body or lie almost concealed among the muscles and are attended with such novel appearances every day without knowing every particular degree of every particular disease and their consequences that may possibly be at once uniting in the same body and its members what may probably be the immediate cause of this distemper i have already hinted at but the more remote ones i may venture to assert are as numerous as the different appearances of tumors and ulcers in all parts of the body put together i should soon wade out of my depth if i attempted to unfold such intricate and perplexing combinations or the forms and essential properties of those fine particles of hidden matter as may contribute to the formation of the kings evil and have puzzled so many judicious and learned physicians and may still do so for ages to come  i shall now proceed to say something relative to the cure of this obstinate disease if we search the most eminent authors in pursuit of a cure for this distemper we shall find ourselves miserably disappointed says a late writer i say so too therefore as their prescriptions seldom answer the desired end i shall take no notice of them but pursue my own way of thinking i have no great opinion of discussing of tumors unless the face is likely to be much deformed by them especially of the female sex or when the eyes are inflamed and very troublesome then i think such a remedy is justifiable because the peccant matter is only removed from one part to another and not cured but still subsists in the blood and spirits and may possibly be thrown on a more noble and dangerous part and do much more harm than can be easily imagined  my patients have often told me to use their own way of expression that they have had swellings in their necks or other places and neighbor such a one told um if they did them with vinegar twould put them away which it sometimes did but in a little time others arose in their stead in other parts that would not yield to their old remedy if they were parish poor and looked after by the year they fell to my share because nothing was to be got by them and twould cost a deal of trouble and expense for physic for such poor wretches who were better out of the way how unhappy are poor people to be thus cruelly used by some mercenary physickmongers how many funest examples are in every ones memory if they would recollect a little of some neighbors or acquaintance that have even destroyed themselves by backing or striking in humors as it is called and repelling them to some mortal part this practice is too frequent with the fair sex i hope they will think seriously for the future and do so no more if any reasons occur to make repellents necessary i then order proper purgatives to carry off the morbifick matter cleanse the blood and prevent any danger from such a revulsion issues or setons i never use and often dry them up for i could never perceive any benefit accrue to the patient from them if ulcers discharge the offending matter lodged in or near them why should we invite it another way and not follow the road nature has pointed out what are ulcers but so many natural issues which will discharge themselves if a good digestion is procured as long as any offending matter subsists in or near them and then dry up of course unless hindered by art why then should we make an artificial ulcer that nature wants not nay is even detrimental to it by increasing a discharge which we are endeavoring to diminish and wholly subdue  salt water being much in vogue i shall give my thoughts on it as a remedy for the kings evil i had a patient troubled with a very painful inflammation of the eyes which had baffled the skill of all she had applied to in london and being a person of fortune be sure no advice was wanting she was sent to the sea side to drink the salt water which she did for a month and returned much worse when i saw her i soon perceived the disorder to be scrophulous she kept in a dark room not being able to abide the least gleam of light complained of intolerable dashing pains in her forehead and eyes which discharged great quantities of clear water so scalding and corrosive that it excoriated the skin where it flowed down the cheeks this ladys complaints were afterward removed by a most simple and easy remedy which i apply in those cases and seldom miss of a cure what i would observe from this is that the saline particles of the water which she drank so long added more matter of a similar nature to what was too abundant in the blood and spirits already which entirely convinces me that drinking salt water is wrong in scrophulous cases of the eyes and bathing for them i believe to be equally hurtful for we know many saline particles may in bathing be absorbed through the pores of the skin by the blood and so unite with those already there observe what lord bacon says as it seems salt draws blood as well as blood draws salt that is they reciprocally attract each other extirpating of tumified glands which is no unfrequent practice i have never used either by the knife or cautery actual or potential neither can i approve the method though i own its the most painful i have had some patients with me whose glands have been thus treated and to all appearance quite cured and for a time well but as the humor was not thereby eradicated out of the blood and spirits it broke out again in fresh places which brought them to me these fresh complaints i have afterward cured with easy and gentle applications sometimes indeed where the disorder has been mild and invaded but few glands and the seeds of the disease wholly contained in them extirpation has done the deed but if these tumified glands can be reduced to their natural state by a less dangerous and painful way though indeed not so quickly and no danger of any tumors arising elsewhere which shall we choose the more quick painful and uncertain or the more slow easy and sure method of cure how many have been salivated without receiving any good instances of this kind i have met with in my practice more than once a learned physician writes a salivation is found by experience incapable of eradicating this obstinate disease notwithstanding it has such peculiar specific and almost certain virtue to remove the venereal evil which plainly proves as i think the seeds or causes of the two distempers to be very different and confutes the vulgar notion that the venereal evil is the parent of the kings evil for if they both spring from the same original why are they not removed by the same means which we find they are not but when united in the same subject its rational to think they increase each others malignity and render the cure more uncertain and difficult  most people afflicted with scrophulous disorders in their eyes are very fond of hoodwinking or covering them from the light and air which is the worst method they can take for it not only increases the inflammation but invites the humor that way and consequently occasions a greater discharge from them which should be carried off another way and which is often of so corrosive a nature as to excoriate and fret the skin of the face as it distills down the cheeks i always make them throw away their coverings either going to bed or rising in the morning to prevent taking cold by too suddenly exposing their eyes and my success has always warranted this practice after disapproving others proceedings in the cure of this disorder it may be asked why i dont publish my own which i think so much better to such enquirers i answer the medicines i use are very innocent and common things but the preparation is curious and difficult and takes much time to complete should i divulge it very few people except the compounders of medicine would attend the process or take the trouble of it and how little good will a vitiously prepared medicine do is obvious to any one and as the common laborers and handicraftsmen their wives and children make the bulk of my patients it is above their capacity and of no use to tell them any thing about it more than what is necessary to their right managing themselves under the regimen i direct and to give them the plainest and simplest directions possible as well as to use the easiest means for their recovery as to the sellers of medicines i think they can have no claim to reap any advantage from my labor and experience the better sort of families infected by this disease are really more to be pitied than the very lowest class of the people for they are but too often amused with fallacious and flattering accounts of their own real disorders of this in particular and as dr radcliff truly observed kept in misery for their money and to every one in general i say nobody has any cause to complain of keeping the thing to myself for every one that pleases and has the kings evil may apply to me and reap the same benefit as well as if they knew the whole process great i know is the general clamor against secrets nostrums and old wives medicines as some please to call them but i would fain know if any prudent person would refuse to be cured by a safe and innocent medicine unless he knew the whole particular preparation and composition or because i dont choose to make that discovery of my methods that public curiosity or censure may expect did dr james publish the preparation of his fever powder yet i believe few people in their senses would scruple the use of it if the candid humane and generous physicians an surgeons smile on my endeavors for the public good let the envious snarling and covetous practitioners blame me if they please for not treating my patients secundum artem as they term it that is by not making long bills  i shall mention but one thing more many people who have seen the amazing effects of my applications often tell me they hope i will not let the secret and its improvements die with me i do not intend it shall for i carefully write down every patients complaints the methods i use and the success that follows as far as i can be informed by themselves or neighbors who come to me on their recommendation by which means i frequently hear of people i have cured who living at a distance and being free from their complaints take no further notice of me though all i desire for my trouble is to hear from themselves either by letter or word of mouth when they are well but all my patients are not so forgetful of their benefactor my papers and observations relating to the cure of the kings evil i hope will fall into the hands of my executor and may he use them to the benefit of mankind in general an the poor in particular with the same success and charitable intentions as i have done  finis philip winterflood late of halsted in essex a journeyman barber aged    now living at the sign of the periwig over against the white horse at mileend near london was about eight years ago miserably afflicted with several strenuous ulcers under both breasts and being a fat man some of them were above an inch deep and discharged much foul corrupted matter and had done so a long time had evaded all methods of cure and when i saw him was a very deplorable object this person had the disorder hereditary many of his family having been greatly afflicted with it he has traveled many parts of england since and been seen with much admiration by many persons who have talked with him i cured him in about six months and he continues well to this day and has sent me several poor patients who have traveled on foot near fifty miles to my house who i believe dont repent their journeys  widow of joseph prentice of halsted aged  0 years some years ago had the evil in her eyes and was relieved and held well several years but her eyes growing very bad again with great dashing pains in her head and a small tumor arising on her shoulder she applied to me i cured her eyes and the tumor subsided with very little trouble and she remained perfectly free from her complaints till her death some years after  jacob hogyott son of samuel hogyott husbandman of grinstedgreen in halsted aged    had a large scropholous swelling under his chin and many scropholous tumors and ulcers on each side the neck some broke and run clear water and some good matter this lad i cured in nine months and is now gone to service and capable to earn his living as a husbandman was recommended by mr vaughan a very eminent surgeon who could do him no service  rebecca brown daughter of jerry brown of coln engain essex husbandman aged    years had several running scropholous sores about her neck and shoulders otherwise a florid well looking girl my very easy methods cured her in about four month  jonathan wade of braintree recommended to me for the kings evil by mr stapletyon surgeon of braintree essex when he came to me he had two large running sores near the elbow on the left arm and one about an inch above the ancle on the left leg and a sore in the palm of his left hand had all the sores six months before i saw him most of his relations had the evil about a year after his brother came and told me he was quite cured  william brown belongs to gosfeld in essex aged    had the evil much in both eyes very much inflamed with great pains in the forepart of his head run sometimes clear water very salt and sometimes corruption from the corners of his eyes and very impatient of light his mother had the evil in her family and came to tell me her son was now quite well by my means  sarah norman daughter of francis brewer on the burrwalls at bath in somersetshire aged    years her upperlip much swelled and both eyes much inflamed these disorders i soon cured by a very easy method  edward potter son of richard potter of pedmarsh in essex aged    years sent by mr manistree apothecary of halsted had when he came to me a sore on the back of both hands and four running ulcers in the calf of his left leg he is now quite well and his father has got him out to service and came to thank me for the cure of his son  robert wade of bocking in essex shoemaker aged    years a sore on the inside of the right knee and a large swelling broke about a week before he came to me and run clear water on the outside the left thigh from a small orifice and very hollow for two or three inches above and below about eight months after his first coming to me he came to thank me being quite well  sarah everitt daughter of john everitt of earls coln husbandman aged    years she had a large swelling on the left side the neck and the same side of the face and under the chin much swelled had this complaint four years before she came to me she had been with a surgeon who tried to cure her but not succeeding pronounced it the kings evil gave her up and then she came to me and is now well  ann mead wife of samuel mead of great wrating in suffolk husbandman aged    came recommended to me by mr john smith surgeon of little theorloe for the evil very bad in her eyes in november      and in april      i received the following letter from her  sir this comes to acquaint you that by gods blessing and your kindness to me i am quite restored to sight i am so well recovered that at present i have not the least disorder in my eyes i return

in wapping london had a large tumor very hard and livid on the lower part of the left breast next the arm which had been extirpated by mr caywood surgeon and apothecary near by judged to be a cancer but as he did not cure it about a month after she came to me then the whole breast was inflamed with two more tumors rising on the lower part and some small scropholous complaints running about these tumors afterward broke and discharged matter as the other which are all now well and one other large tumor about the middle of the breast i dispersed without breaking the whole breast is now quite firm and well smooth soft and of its natural color and size as before except the sear which still remains as a proof the surgeon had been there whilst in the country under my care the surgeon let her know she had better come to london and he would go with her to an hospital to have her breast taken off before the cancer should be fixed for then it would be incurable note many scrophulated breasts are mistaken for cancers and have been treated as such to the irreparable damage of the poor sufferers  a young lady in london at the age of   years had two scrophulous ulcers on each arm one both

touch of himself or others his captain who was a surgeon and knowing several of his relations were greatly afflicted with the kings evil pronounced it such he soon after was discharged as incapable of service i restored this man to the full use of his hand fingers and thumb by the means i make use of in scrophulous cases which i think is a proof this was a species of the kings evil he was afterward

her joints when i first saw her she bathed daily in the salt water which had so swelled and inflamed her leg she could hardly stand i begged her to leave off bathing which she did and in fortyeight hours she found ease and in some months after i had a letter from her that her complaints were by my directions entirely removed  a young lady in norfolk aged    years about three years ago had a small hard tumor under the left nipple which seems now no more but when she came to me had a smooth flatish soft tumor about the bigness of half a crown gathering above the nipple of the same breast which had been under the management of a regular physician sometime without any apparent advantage but is now by my assistance entirely removed  mrs brown wife of mr brown at the bell in clare suffolk aged    years brought me the following from mr hawes a surgeon  sir mrs brown the bearer hereof has for some months labored under a disease in her breast which the surgeons term a schirrhus various applications has been tried and many medicines taken which have only served to alleviate her complaints without laying a foundation for healing this disease has so near an affinity with the evil that i do not think but it may be really called such i wish you may be so fortunate as to direct somewhat that may be serviceable and am  sir your humble servant rich hawes cavendish aug          mrs brown was a fat lusty woman about a year ago had a large tumor rose in her right breast and gathered in nine several places and opened by a surgeon and discharged much but that being though insufficient to lessen the breast two setons were made quite through the breast which was very large close to the ribs in the form of a cross and as the silk rotted out in ten or twelve days more silk was put in and she had seven or eight ulcers in other parts of the breast several surgeons met to take off the breast and told her if it was not taken off she could not live to michaelmas day following that her breast would rot off in a week or two if not cut off this was the state of the breast when i undertook it november the  0th following i saw this woman all the ulcers well healed and the breast firm and the woman in good health a spirits without any complaints whatever feb         she was with me again and showed me her right breast sound and firm but told me that about three weeks before on taking cold she felt a dashing pain in her left breast which she showed me there was a smooth soft tumor rising on the upper part above the nipple which had increased fast with some dashing pains i ordered her proper remedies for this new complaint april the  th her husband came to tell me the tumor was broke and discharged in several places round the nipple i ordered accordingly and sept the  th      her husband came again and told me her breast had been quite well   months past and his wife in good health a spirits no complaint at all and that the day before he came she was brought tobed of a fine girl and both like to do very well i saw her some days after examined her right breast which had lost the nipple all continued firm and also her left breast but she had no milk in it but no complaint whatever note it is very easy to observe from this case that if mrs browns right breast had been taken off it would have availed nothing from the other being disordered in the like manner after having cured mrs browns right breast i received from the beforementioned mr hawes the following  sir i must now congratulate your success in curing this disease which is more rife by far than used to be and likely to make sad ravages among mankind mrs brown i hear is purely i am  worthy sir your most obedient humble servant r hawes cavendish nov          febr the   th      her husband came
