the lues venerea rationally handled in its original cause with its cure  nemo unquam legendo fit artifex  by j a surgeon  london printed and sold by t bickerton in paternosterrow cha pickman in uppershadwell and j cluer printer in bow churchyard price   d  the preface by what can be collected from authors the lues has in all european countries been found an obstinate distemper the ill success of former practice one would be apt to attribute to wrong hypothesiss and the processes consequent thereto did not many particulars at this day justify their complaints and show us the same difficulties remain about the nature and cure of this distemper as ever no nostrum as yet how infallible soever in the opinion of its possessor will answer to all symptoms or to all patients under the same circumstances i have had trial of several communicated as such but finding nothing extraordinary in them i conclude the art of curing here as in other diseases lies as much in the managemen as in the medicines themselves tha they be administered in season an adapted to constitutions so that to sa mercury is the foundation of cure will be of little import to a reader o this subject unless at the same tim the skill of using it could be conveyed and this will never be attained in any great perfection without practice however an attention to rules is no altogether unworthy a regard for which reason i have ventured on thi essay wherein i have as it fell in my way made a summary of the best opinions in the therapeutick part ye with no restraint to my own sentiments which through the whole i have endeavored to make appear rational if it shall be thought so by the proper judges it may possibly hereafter receive an improvement  lues venerea those who fetch the original of this distemper no farther back than the siege of naples by the french      thence calling it the french and sometimes the neapolitan disease must only mean that it received its present name there that it became more common or that luckily about that time some remedy was found better adapted to its cure than any before known for no doubt it reaches in antiquity the first ages it being irrational either to suppose a world drowned for their sins strangers to the vice that contracts it or that their wickedness any more than ours deserved exemption no providence we may safely believe stamped an immediate punishment on this as on all other intemperance and sin ab origin that the pains and sufferings succeeding a vicious course of life might if nothing else would restrain us to virtue and be both a natural and moral good to us we find moses describing a leprosy levit    and    that corresponds with the symptoms and seems to have been a species of this distemper so does the difficulty of the cure deuteronomy    where it is said the botch and scab of egypt of which thou can not be healed and those many laws found here relating to a leprosy would suffer a greater disappointment than seems intended as well from the obstinacy as infrequency of the distemper if applied only to what we now strictly understand by that term the same may be said of many ancient physical authors who with the like or greater plainness have described the symptoms though not under the modern titles  in the prosecution of this subject i propose to set forth the nature and manner of insection in all those symptoms commonly understood by a clap viz the gnrrhea chancre phymosis etc and then exhibit a method of cure mentioning the symptoms occasionally under either head as they serve to enlighten each other and first of the gonorrhaea  the gonorrhaea is benign or malign the first sort is an emission of humor from the glandulae prostatae a weakness only and commonly proceeding from great strains and where the natural strength has been too far exerted in any sort whether by labor or venereal pleasures it has its symptoms as well as process of cure very different from the malignant which at present i shall make the only subject of my enquiry and that under two heads    by showing how either sex becomes infected and    a cure for that infection  and  st of the woman her i look on must be primarily and originally infected that is sine amplexu infecto to introduce the being of this distemper in the world for let a man correspond with what variety he pleases provided they are sound he receives no malignancy which could it be so with her i cannot see why we ever should thus unhappily have had its knowledge but experience too fatally contradicting this is a conviction that coition with numbers has first of all and probably does still at some times effect the same as at other times communication with an infected person and this i shall endeavor to make out in a few words  such who say the promiscuous mixture of different sperms excites a ferment which in a little time throws off such an exspumation as we call a running do agree that numbers though sound carry infection we only differ in the manner they accomplish it which i rather suppose to be thus when the venereal appetite is jaded with the too intemperate efforts of several men it will be next to impossible for those parts to suffer the continued frictions made there as common women do without excoriating and fretting the membranes of the vagina and such excoriations how small soever in the beginning meeting with an ill habit of body together with the natural incalescence and moisture of the parts will soon degenerate to an ulcer which ulcer will be the distemper and perhaps herein lies the difference between a fluor albus and gonorrhaea when thus contracted that the one is a weakness from too frequent irritations made there and the other besides that extrinsical accident has an ill habit of body joined that induces intemperies  what i think gives credit to this opinion is the customs of the jewish mohammedan and many other countries who allow a plurality of wives and an unlimited number of concubines restraining their sex at the same time to one for this though an inferior motive of the law argues the world to have previously experienced such a liberty in them more destructive of health and a sound constitution than in us among other creatures there is an instinct answering such a purpose of the law whereby the females are provoked only at certain seasons to propagation and abstain after conception nature intimating by it a lesson of chastity to the fair that it should be their peculiar as well as most ornamental virtue  against it i can form to my self only two objections first that it may be alleged the activity of some men this way might prejudice a weak woman the same as a number and secondly it may be asked how an ulcer in vagina can acquire malignity enough to communicate infection on coition when the greatest degree of virulency in another ulcer produces no such effect  but to these it may be answered that the strength and activity of any two in health will seldom be found so disproportionate as to become hurtful when it is the disorder ensuing can be no more than a fluor albus or a weakness without malignity and as to the other why an ulcer here should sooner impart its mischief than any other is that the parts concerned are in all respects more commodious for giving and receiving any injury and that the heat raised and excited by lust gives a force and activity to the salts generated under the corruption whereas any other ulcer though never so virulent cannot emit effluvias in such force or numbers nor to parts so susceptible of their reception but if they had those advantages it is likely their effects would be equal many ill consequences following from an ulcer with virulency in any part incautiously dried up  that lust also is a very necessary adjunct for communicating infection and giving force to those virulent miasms that are as it were darted by it from her we judge by that particular power and influence imagination is found to have in the commotion of these parts in this case it is so much that many infected women avoid hurting their husbands principally on the moderation and coolness of their enjoyments whereas a stranger inciting more intense and vigorous desires as seldom escapes the same may be said where two or three with weaker or stronger inclinations lie with one and the same infected woman that one perhaps shall be caught and the others come off unhurt chiefly as the fancy on either side is brisk and lively inclined or disinclind  venereal contact seems of such necessity for communicating infection that with me it is a very unlikely thing for venereal matter ever to do it without those who have asserted the contrary of this have done it in such improbable instances which whoever can assent to will be very unreasonable if they deny their acquiescence in what i have advanced of numbers for instance  the practical scheme page   says it is not always necessary a woman be clapped to give it a man but that he may take off all the virulent matter left in the passage by a preceding gallant and she remain perfectly well or that she may give it him by only taking the corrupted matter from her body in her hand and wetting his privities  and others relate its highest degeneracy or a pox to be contagious by wearing the clothes lying or cohabiting with an infected person especially if we suppose it of that stage of the distemper wherein the body becomes overspread with cutaneous eruptions and blotches  there are but two ways in this latter case for the former i have no notion of whereby contagion can be supposed to pass and that is by their throwing off a greater quantity of noxious and virulent effluvia able to contaminate where they reach or else like what is related in the philosophical transactions concerning contagion in the itch animalculae are bred in those globules dispersed about the skin which making their way through shift from place to place and so carry infection they living says the relation two or three days when from the body  but how well these assignata may resolve other contagious distempers they will here be found but light in the balance fact baffles philosophy and if all those who have suffered this way are like what have fallen to my share there is not one who could stand by any other pretense than coition whence we ought to account the distemper a mark of divine displeasure and a present bodily correction for our sin that the sense of our own interest might work on us and bring us back to temperance and virtue  how a man becomes infected women we have adjudged sometimes to become infected by the admission of numbers though sound and healthful but a man cannot by the same means because among other reasons there is this invincible one that nature is not able to support the repetitions of those acts to such a multiplicity or in such measure as with her who is passive but could that be i believe also he might so contract it insatiable and impotent efforts or too painful enjoyments through the straitness of the vagina frequently discovers something like this in what we call simple gonorrhaeas and christallins which perhaps time and an ill habit would change and make to become virulent did not pain or the debility of nature prevent a further use of the cause that first produced them and hinder our actions from keeping pace with the viciousness of our wills and inclinations for this reason therefore venereal symptoms thus contracted never settle or terminate in a pox and i am apt to think all malignity that does so to him or is contagious must always be from an infected person and always by coition for a clearer understanding of which and the manner of communication i shall cite two or three celebrated opinions about it and then subscribe my own  dr keil says it is conveyance is by the elasticity of the air thrusting the morbifick matter into the excretory ducts of the proslatae which are empty on coition and that a simple gonorrhaea is nothing but a corrosion of the spongious borders of those vessels terminating in the urethra  some think a gonorrhaea to be the effect of a fermentation made between the infectious liquor and that of the prostatae and so without corrosion an efflux thrown off like yest from beer  lastly dr cockburn supposes a gonorrhaea to be the encrcase of that liquor that is discharged by the excretory glands of the urethra and done by the venereal stimulus in the same manner as cantharides applied would do the quantity of matter discharged being in proportion to the stimulating force they are affected with and this stimulus he says increasing its acrimony does in process of time make ulcers in the urethra this he farther opposes to dr keils opinion by saying the urethra will admit very little and that there is no muscle membrane or machine alleged to help it for ward  but these opinions besides their opposition to one another are deficient in carrying their aim singly to a gonorrhaea without any attempt at the cause of a chancre chordee or phymosis which men often become infected with without a gonorrhaea i shall therefore begin my enquiry here being assured that they at least want another and different explication which perhaps when found will facilitate also our search in a gonorrhaea and if i am right in my conjecture they arise from the strength activity and solidity of the salts hid with the corruption which being dispersed about the vagina are volatilizd and made fitter for communication by the heat of lust and received by the enlarged pores of the penis where by their pointedness they shortly effect an erosion  the manner of this imbibing or suction on the mans side is not absurdly accounted for by the general relaxation that attends all sensual pleasures of which coition is perhaps the greatest now as it most exquisitely affects us the parts are relaxed and made more easily susceptible of any venom to be transmitted and that again from her becomes enabled to insinuate and escape through the pores by the pungency of their salts and power they are darted with and if the degree of relaxation in any part be in proportion to the pleasure as in the agreeable objects of any other sense it is where though some degree of it results to the whole man yet something remains peculiar to the sense of which it is an object then the instruments of generation by being most relaxed will be also most fitted on that account for the reception of morbifick matter  hence the genital parts should always suffer first and amorous men soonest  and if virulent matter thus externally lodged can act like cantharides and produce a chancre chordee or phymosis then i believe we may also without any repugnancy to reason think this outward application of it in coition sufficient to produce a gonorrhaea the difficulty against it being only how this taint can be transmitted hence to the prostatae which will not be so hard to imagine if we consider what has been already said of the power impelling and the aptitude to receive we find all parts of the body porous and by many experiments receptive of any proper matter incumbent on them conveying and mixing a portion with the humors of the body as in bathing etc  in all translations of tumors whether by revulsion or derivation this sympathy and communication of parts is evident and particularly in the present case where on an improper handling the virulency will revert into the blood and produce all the symptoms of a pox and indeed all outward applications to any malady deeper than the skin without this would be impertinent why then should it be thought so extraordinary for infectious matter armed with other properties than bare fluidity to affect these glandules at so small a distance since it must be acknowledged the several parts of a member have a much easier communication with themselves than with the whole as we often see in the quick and ready translation of a gonorrhaea to the groin and testicles and vice versa  the only remaining objection to this transmission by the pores is that the greatest corrosions at the glans and praeputium are rarely attended with a gonorrhaea whereas were such corrosions thus effected as it would be an argument of a stronger infection and the corrosiveness of that venereal matter to be greater it should as seldom miss this seems to be from the contraction pains and swelling that attend those ulcers whereby the passages to the prostatae are straightened and obstructed but a slighter degree creating no such impediments easily passes and is sussicient to propel that humor from the glands which in a less proportion is their nature and office from hence we may learn a gonorrhaea to be the mildest species of infection  if any one should yet object and think the mucous glands of the urethra more easily reached than the prostatae and so to be the seat of a gonorrhaea i shall no further insist but only remark to the favorers of such an opinion that a running is not produced by an ulceration or corrosion of the ostiolae of the glands terminating there for such would be an irreparable loss and is the very cause of some gleets being incurable but it is rather from the constituting vessels of those glands being rendered weak and flaccid that were before vigrous and elastick parting easily for that reason with their contents  from the whole of this explication we may see a reason for that custom in many foreign countries of washing the privities well after coition to wit that they find it preventive of infection and perhaps circumcision was not instituted by that renowned lawgiver moses or the impostor mahomet nor practiced by ancienter nations without a view to the cleanliness of this part and prevention of foul and loathsome distempers  those who account for a gonorrhaea thus do not say a disuria is from an excoriation in the urethra but that the sharpness of the infection thinning and carrying off the mucus from the membrane that lines it is made more sensible of the pungent salts of urine passing through which the would confirm by the nature of patients complaints who dont speak of the heat of water as a pain confined to one particular spot of the passage but diffused and seems an equal vellication of the whole membrane  i come now to the second and most useful part  the cure of this distemper and first its description avirulent gonorrhaea or clap is the emission of infectious matter from the corroded glandulae prostatae or those of the urethra accompanied with a disuria or in other words the involuntary flowing of matter through the urethra with pain inflammation and heat of urine these are its pathognomick signs and the degree they are in with respect to consistence and color in the running as yellow green or the like or pain in water are what we may take the measure of virulency from and will be found more or less in different subjects according to the malignity of the infected person and constitution of the receiver  a disuria is a necessary consequence of the running it being a pain from the acriminious salts of urine wasting through the parts which that has excoriated  the cure i shall lay down under these two intentions  first to conquer and carry off the malignancy and  secondly to heal and strengthen the debilitated parts  mercury only is able to answer our first intention and effectually to subdue the poison of this distemper the reason why it has a power beyond other medicines for this purpose is its gravity and because its constituent parts are extreme small smooth and sphaerical the latter qualification fits them for an admittance into the smallest passages even those almost indiscernible ones of the glands and its weight breaks all coagulations and fits the morbifick matter for natural secretions and whatever slights some may put on this common road of proceeding yet till better convinced in the virtues of the several applauded specificks that have appeared abroad in the world i take leave to defend it as a safe practice for although a tedious or an ill cure may now and then happen it is not justly so much a charge on the medicine as the method when we leave off too soon or continue it with purges too long a practice equally mischievous but more of this by and by  i am surprised that every body by their practice should allow mercury to be the only foundation and retreat for cure in the last and stubbornest stage of this distemper a pox and yet deny its virtues in a milder season it must be confessed there are too often seen many ill effects from this mineral and on a serious reflection i cannot but think most of those deplorable objects found in hospitals or elsewhere whose ruined constitutions are attributed to the lues to be with more truth and justice ascribed to mercury but then this is not the use but abuse of it an unskilful management often precipitating patients and that in a short time into such miserable circumstances as the distemper left to it self could not in years if ever have produced from this prepossession many take a handle to recommend their infallible nostrums which when good for any thing still have this for their basis  the ingenuity of making mercury specifical will lie in the measure and manner of administration that it suit such degrees of infection and such constitutions a point wherein one man will excel another according to their different capacities and opportunities of experiment all other ways are supported by nothing but a brass front the many successless attempts of those who publicly invite men to safe and speedy cures have pretty well exposed their credit and people see it to be nothing but a competition in cunning who shall betray with most success without the least candor or regard to the promises they make nor is it a small disparagement to arcanas here that they are generally lodged with the illiterate i shall further strengthen this argument for mercury in opposition to other specificks by a short excursion on the practical scheme because it has made the loudest noise of late and has been famous if not for attracting poison yet for attracting the pence populus vult decipi  a compounded medicine as is the practical schemes though it should seldom miss the ends it is given for and so be said to act electively yet by being compounded is properly and significatively ranked under the name of an arcanum which the elder brethren have chosen with judgment the term of specific being usually applied to single natural bodies such as he has mentioned  p    and though they may be diversely mixed for conveying and using them with advantage yet the term is retained singly to that body which is said to be specifical as for instance in the cortex whatever form or vehicle we give it in there is nothing but it self has any claim to the title therefore making the virtue of his composition to be the joint force and result of all  p    is not only a misapplication of it but a confession that this specificality lies in none of them singly or if it does it is as yet a hidden thing to him for he goes on and tells ye  p         and certificat p    their united force like a loadstone draws the contagion to it and exactly hits the different constitutions of any age and that from the recency of the distemper to their being in a deplorable state and for further proofs of these absurdities he says  p    persons after having taken the specific will void large quantities of nasty corrupted stinking water of such an unsufferable stench they will not be able to bear the smell and give but any dog that will take it a quart of this urine and he will in a little time break out with pocky sores recoverable again with so small a dose of the specific as contains to the bigness of a pea whsch will discharge it in such stinking corrupted urine as the persons was who made it a plain confession it was the effect of the medicine yet serves him for a conviction of the great power of this remedy and indeed granting the relations true it must be allowed as was the gamboge the poor weavers took to be of stupendous efficacy  p     i shall not wrong this gentleman i believe in supposing his scheme to be like other shorter schemes that are daily thrust into our hands for drawing in of customers he differs only in having altered their concise way of writing and recommending in many words what they have done compendiously the admirable virtues of their incomparable noverfailing antivenereal pill through a great part of his book he insinuates to his readers such astonishing performances from the specific as come but little short of infallibility it is a cure says he  p    for nineteen in twenty a very small exception yet serves a double end being both good news to the afflicted title of a quack bill and a salvo for miscarriages for should the reverse of this be and the uncurd    in  0 they might every one singly lament themselves and he with them as the unhappy excepted person and their certificates must be wanting because like his cures it would not be allowable to publish their names and abodes and indeed he that gives out a bill of promises on this head is much more safe from detection and reproach than any other because to contest the thing is taking a public shame and may be one reason the infallibility of a cure is oftener and more confidently asserted here than in any other case the certificates published on these occasions to confirm the unbelieving are few enough to be a concerted cheat and if real is only a cunning in common with the fraternity  the pictures which escape they wisely keep but hide all those that perish in the deep mrs averys case poor gentlewoman  p    the certificate may be granted very bad and the cure as extraordinary yet to show the world something of a parallel and that others parts of it do not want for wonders i refer to the following story transcribed from the patients own lips abbreviated and drawn into a certificate will run thus  i t h of  having been for many months afflicted with a swelling in my belly gripings great pains in my limbs and in a weak and languishing condition for which i had been a long while under the prescriptions of several eminent physicians but to such purpose that i was reduced even to deaths door at last in a despondency of mind i betook my self to little dr le f at the upper end of three calley on examining my case and what had been done for it he shook his head and said his brethren had very much mistook the illness or else they would not have bottomed their hopes on medicine internal or external that the planets were more concerned in this affair and had united their selectest influences against me he bid me be cheery and confident in him and only lend him my servant next morning at three of clock with some of my urine to epping forest knowing his wisdom i showed all the tokens of a glad compliance my weak state would permit and begged him as a christian to use his utmost skill for my recovery he promised he would and accordingly took my man with him as appointed at his return he told me my business was done that i should have only one severe fit of gripes more but be perfectly recovered in a week after the doctor had taken his leave my curiosity led me to enquire of john what had been done at the forest and he told me all he knew was that he had seen the doctor bore several holes in an old oak put my water in them and then filled them up with trunnels again muttering withal some words inwardly which he could not understand my heart akd for the success of this mystical way of application a whole day but praised be god his words had truth to a tittle i had next day or next but one the expected fit and before the expiration of a week as he had foretold walked about to admiration  what may complete the authors praises and recommend the cure to the public is his taking but twelve guineas for it the presents that were afterward added though very short of a requital were as i hope to be s  forced on him  to the truth of all which premises i freely and without fee do certify this  0th etc j t   but to return from this digression i begin the cure with a strict regulation in living particularly an abstinence from spirituous liquor and salt food and prescribe directly a mercurial bolus  mer dull gr xij cons ros q s f bolus hora somni sumend purging it off next morning with an infusion of senna after the first or second time i increase the mercury in the bolus and give stronger catharticks  pil ex duobus j rez jelap bals peruv ana gr ij calomel gr vj fiat pil not v mane vorandus  vel pil

draught  purges are given after mercurials i believe not so much from a supposition that their virtues immediately reach the part affected and subdue the poison directly as from a distant view of altering the habit of body and carrying off those vicious humors that would else probably take their course that way and heighten the fury this opinion is founded in practice where nothing is commoner than from two men infected by the same woman to see the one cured in a few days when the other perhaps requires months which can be from nothing sooner than their different habits  purges are designed likewise to prevent any ill effect from too great a quantity of mercury remaining at once in the body  this may suffice for their defense in general there remains another material consideration in the use of them and that respects the frequency of their repetition and rightly to understand a proportion in this we are to consider that as the malignancy of a gonorrhea nature her self in good constitutions would run off in a due quantity of time and that our administrations are but her assistants thereto the faults may be equal in leaving them off too soon or continuing them too long by the former the infection is not conquered and by the latter the constitution is enervated and natures efforts weakened instead of being assisted in consequence of this i repeat the mercurial bolus and purge no oftener than reason tells me their strength will admit without a hypercatharsis fainting or loathings which is with some every other day with others twice a week or less and in the intermissions give largely of the following apozems or emulsions  sem   frig j aq meant s lbij sal tartar j siat emulsio sacchar candid ad gratiam edulcorand  amygdal dull no xij sem papav is

an injection may be serviceable also as is soft and can leave something of a mucilaginous substance to lubricate and defend the urethra  solvatur g tragacanth vel arab vel ichthiocol in sero lactis colatura tepide injic  while we are continuing the use of these it will be proper to weigh with our selves what are the signs of our first intention being answered and sufficiently authorize us to leave them off for there is no doubt a period which the skilful discern wherein a change for healing balsamic medicines is necessary and required and which as we come short off or exceed may be either way pernicious for first if while the signs of malignancy abide too sudden a check be given to the running either by the unseasonable use of astringents or too quick and strong purging in the beginning which turns to the same then it will either revert and taint the whole mass of blood or produce by a nearer translation acute pain tumor and inflammation of the groin or testicles which may prove of as unhappy consequence particularly in the last the pains are agonizing and attended with fever syncope and nausea and the membrane wanting fat never without danger of corruption and gangrene  again if on the other side the proper season is missed of doing it and there is too cautious and long an adherence to mercurials or irritating medicines whether catharticks or diuretics the running goes on without end and at last brings an irrecoverable laxity on the parts converting a venereal to a troublesome seminal gleet to avoid these extremes i take the proper indications for such an alteration to be absence of pain and soreness about the groin and testicles when the distention of the yard is gone off when the heat of urine is considerably abated and when the running is of thick and equal consistence changed in color and lessened in quantity for as the contrary of these are what constitutes its virulency so their remission must be signs of amendment and a proper stadium for changing the method it is not to be expected a running should ever so entirely change as not to leave a stain which some do sillily imagine no it will be sufficient that there are considerable alterations in the respects abovementioned the better those appear indeed the safer shall we be in stopping it and let the remaining matter revert where it will separate from signs of malignancy it can be of no more hurt than the drying of an issue or other simple or common ulcer  the second intention is to dry up the running and heal and strengthen the debilitated parts the former part of this intention i have compassed sometimes in athletick constitutions by a single quick purge which shows that a cathartick without any other property than its stimulating power increased will turn astringent and dry up the liquor of the glands but as circumstances will prevent this from being the constant effect of it and that like mr averys case it will be far from happening every day i shall select some of those preparations i have most successfully experienced and range them in their order of healing and astringency to sort with the better or worse appearance of the indications above and doubt not but a due observance to the season of their administration together with a thick glutinous diet which under this intention should always be directed will make them answer as effectually with

contraction and tensity to the fibers in general and therefore must close the orifices of these ducts in particular  iii the other symptoms of virulency which denominate a person clapped and that as well without as with a gonorrhaea are the chordee phymosis paraphymosis chancre and bubo these i choose to speak of separately in their cures because they require besides an internal use of mercurials local applications  a chordee is a painful contraction of the fraenum in erection caused from an inflammation of that membrane which on that accounr being thicker is consequently shorter and must excite a pain when the erection of the penis stretches it  dr cockburn distinguishes another chording pain arising from a sore or ulcer in the urethra as often as it comes to be compressed by an erection of the penis and infers from it how far within the urethra the seat of a gonorrhaea is but against this i object  that if an inflated penis can so painfully compress this ulcer on all sides why should not a greater compression with the hand do it without erection  secondly if a gonorrhaea be an ulcer in the urethra and the chording pain a compression on that ulcer then they must be inseparable companions and no gonorrhaea could be without it  and thirdly i have known the chordee often continue after a running has been stopped which by this allegation could not be true supposing as we reasonably may that where there is no running there is no ulcer the proper local remedies to it are fotuss of milk wherein lilly elder or marshmallowroot has been boiled and a little sacchar

most and when compassed without great care will turn fistulous  i have run over this section with little more than placing some proper prescriptions under the several heads of chancre phymosis etc avoiding any nicer disquisition in the choice of them or season of their use not because they are entirely void of efficacy but because i am satisfied neither they or any other arcana will alone answer the purpose they are all short of the eulogiums bestowed on them and if not impertinent to the ends proposed are yet vexatious and tedious and since they are so and have a greater tendency to a pox than a gonorrhaea its expedient and i think a very good practice presently to resort to turbith for a revulsion or else by some other equivalent merourials to procure a spitting there is nothing these symptoms better or sooner submit to for as the mouth grows sore there follows a mitigation the matter is diverted the shankers heal and the parts suddenly regain their pristine form and tension  eight or ten days continuance in a moderate salivation will ordinarily suffice to vanquish them but if the distemper proves more deeply rooted requiring one of stricter confinement and regimen take the following rules  section iv the symptons of the pox are cuticular eruptions blotches ulcers in the throat and palate nocturnal pains of the head shoulders and shins caries nightsweats alopecias falling off of the nails gummas nodes talpas consumption and marasmus  how a clap comes to end in such contumacious and intractable symptoms may be partly attributed to the malignancy of the original infection partly to the predisposition or ill habit whereby the blood becomes more easily receptive of that venom but most often to an irregular management of cure and use of specificks it exceeds my design as well as capacity to unriddle further the nature of this venom in its several appearances under that general denomination of a pox having only intended here the short history of a salivation by which the most of them are effectually to be removed  a salivation is dangerously undertaken with aged people with such as are lean or dejected through trouble or misfortunes or much emaciated but especially with those whose lungs are any way distempered that are hectical phthysical and consumptive because as this habit is acquired by the glandulous secretions being increased mercury pejorates the mischief and the more so if such indisposition has proceeded from a former ill use of it dr moulin assures us from experiments that mercury is very prejudicial to the lungs because they want that strong brisk motion the muscles have in other parts and by their lax and spongy texture are extremely unfit for clearing themselves of so troublesome a guest this says he we daily see from persons often fluxd who are afterward observed to die of consumptions that will not give way to any course of medicine to which likewise agrees many interspersed places in mr martins collection of bawdy letters  mercury ordinarily operates by a flux through the salival glands and by the parvity of its compounding parts has a peculiar aptitude thereto the benefits from it seem as much from the uninterrupted continuance of its operation as any specfick virtue in the mercury for the blood has leisure by such a length of time as a salivation takes up to separate its noxious and incongruous parts which are daily washed and spewed out by the thin liquors continually taken and consequently the remainder after such a defaecation becomes more homogeneous  a salivation is raised by mercurials and that either externally or internally used two or three purges always precede as preparative and after that if we intend it by unction make up the following ointment and draw on a pair of gloves and stockings after the use of it to keep the linen and bedcloaths clean  argent vivum iv axuug porcin xij m an ounce of this is to be used at a time for three days successively beginning the first illination on the wrists and ancles only leaving the patient to chafe it in with his hands warmed before the fire the second higher about the joints of the knees and elbows and the third yet further up but cautiously because the nearer you anoint to the abdomen the more likely the body will be of being laxative and elude its proper operation if these three inunctions answer not the purpose we must still repeat it and help forward with a bolus of turbith  this way by unction i preser especially in weak bodies the other more certainly ausing nausea vomiting looseness faintness and the like accidents that interrupt  regular course of proceeding and give great uneasiness to a patient but since unstion has also its faults and is offensive by ts smell and nastying the cloths since many also differ from me in this preference and give it to mercurials internally administered and lastly since the rules to prevent those symptoms mentioned will require more attention in the internal than external use of mercury i shall choose to finish the course in that method and for easier apprehension divide the flux into  beginning a state and a declension  in the beginning or first attempts to raise a flux the only thing to be feared and guarded against is a diarrhaea which diverts the operation of the mercury from the salival glands this we must take notice is prevented or abates and goes off in proportion as we can procure a soreness in the mouth and jaws and increase the dribling and therefore a very great stress lies in the manner and method as well as in the administrations themselves and in a good ordering the patient as to diet and confinement  first we have said two or three purge are to precede and the reason of this is that besides preparing the body for succeeding mercurials they leave an astringency that makes a patient less apt to it after wherefore those of them that leave more than others of that property behind best suit the purpose as the potio communis purgativa sydenham  secondly in administering mercurials the bolus should contain but a small dose at first  mer dull gr x laud l gr ij cons ros q s fiat bolus quaque nocte sumend and be increased two or three grains every repetition because large doses of it in the beginning exert too much force in the primae viae and by the effect of their own irritation are passed off with their contents whereas a small one without giving such disturbance leisurely intrudes it self and in the circulation arrives at and wounds the salival glands and when once it has obtained that path the subsequent doses more easily follow and suppress all fears of a diversion  thirdly the diet has its use toward this end and should be dry and astringent rice toasted cheese yolks of eggs in mulld whitewine a hartshorndrink and roastmeats in general are proper food minding to continue the most nourishing of them the meats as long as we can to support the strength through for in the progress the throat will be too sore to bear swallowing any thing but liquids    another means conducive to it will be guarding against cold which would by constipating the pores make the body loose cutis densitas alvi laxitas  these few rules premised we may go on with the mercurial boluss for three or four nights successively and if the spitting in that time is found to have advanced but slowly or the body is laxative alter it for one of turb min a gr v ad viij giving an anodyne draught at the end of its operation  two or three turbith boluss following the other and increasing their dose a grain every repetition  a v ad viij may be expected to raise the flux but constitutions differ and will be always an exception to any stated number i have known two boluss of calomel raise a salivation and i have seen lbis of mercury by unction ineffectual and here it may not be altogether unfit to mention the opposite consequences that at some times proceed from the use of such a quantity under different symptoms i have known nocturnal pains of the head and shoulders that have been removed by using such a quantity in unction though a spitting never succeeded and yet the same persisting when the case ha been eruptions and stinking putrid ulcers has not only failed as to the salivation bu rendered the case deplorable by increasing their number and quantity of matter and consuming the patient in colliquativ sweats but in this reason and experience must be our guide we must be abl to know when the mercury operates kindly and whether the patients constitution and courage will support him through the course because now if the success i doubted we may safely divert with catharticks which in the increase will be dangerous and impracticable for my own part i have seldom missed more or less o a looseness in the raising a salivation and have persisted in the use of turbith when a patient has had sixteen or eighteen stools in a night but this has been in robusistrong bodies and with this caution o giving a respit for a day or two a half horn drink and an anodyne draught  if in the beginning of a flux there should be a more than ordinary pain in the jaws and mouth and the saliva running o bloody we are not to be startled at it they are the common attendants of mercury and reach no further than the parts immdiately affected a days intermission from mercurials will palliate and in a great measure correct such uneasinesses and to prevent their return and aggravation we may perfect the remainder of our work by unction which does not affect with so much pain as mercury received by the mouth does  the spittle at first is thick and clammy but as it increases in quantity grows thin and serous  the state by the state of a salivation i mean all that time from a patients spitting about a quart in    hours till its height and return to that quantity again which may include a fortnight or more and during this the exactest regulation is required to promote the flux and avoid the danger of a diversion the beginning has less regard in regimen because the fauces as yet suffer solid and nourishing diet to pass and sustain nature but in this their soreness will admit of nothing but soft liquors as thin broths and gruels which as they afford very little nourishment and that the flux is still greater a faintness and debility of necessity follows that will constrain us to stricter rules the patient must be altogether confined to the bed he must be kept between the blankets the bed well lined the room close and warm and a julap pro languoribus the head and jaws should be covered also with flannel it repels the effects of cold and is anodyne  lastly the mouth should be frequently washed with the liquids they drink to cleanse and scour the glands from filth that they may the more freely spue out their contents for this purpose therefore and also for quenching the continual thirst they will be under from a large spitting plenty of them must be in readiness and they should be used warm because cold in this general ulceration of the mouth would create great pain check the flux and hazard the falling out of the teeth if there should be a necessity to check its activity flos sulphuris is the medicine  i account the salivation well raised if i can make it amount to about two quarts in a natural day and continue it so for eight or ten but let the highest quantity be what it will whenever it lessens regnlarly it signifies the mercury to have spent its utmost force and power and puts us on considerations for our third and last branch the recovery or state of declension  the declension a flux that has advanced kindly to its height will as gradually decline and in the close of it calls for physic and diet drink to expel the remains and recrements of the mercury they are not given till the swelling and soreness of the jaws and mouth are well abated and the draining little some there will be while the mouth continues sore because while the fibers are excoriated there will be a proportionable vellication that will express the juices within their contact and this might continue an inconvenient length if the humors were not diverted and the ulcerations dried in the end by
