a farther argument against ennobling foreigners in answer to the two parts of the state anatomy with a short account of the anatomizer  t  l  nd blasphemes the holy ghost the bribed of bribes accuses of foreign rogues the traitor boasts the king who was your lord of hosts that ra  l how abuses a letter to a member of parliament london printed for e moore near st pauls      price   d where may be had the first part price   s  a farther argument etc introduction such is the pride and invincible obstinacy of mankind that nothing is more against nature than to acknowledge their mistakes not the power of their reason not the sense of modesty no not the influence of secret convictions can prevail with them ever to own themselves in the wrong no although they know it and discover to every own they converse with that they do so hence the innumerable writings of men obstinate in error have in a great measure proceeded and the world has been filled with the labors of heretics who have in all ages broached false doctrines and infamous opinions even so gross as satan himself never had the front to suggest and yet rather than be thought to recant what they had once advanced they have thought fit to maintain those false doctrines and infamous opinions at the expense of religion conscience and all manner of reputation  this i take to be the case in due proportion to circumstances of the author of the late libel entitled the state anatomy such i must call it because it libels and slanders persons governments and nations and as this has long been his practice in other things for which a certain author of note said of him that he had made the world believe him a worse heretic than he is so i see a great deal of ground to think he has gone upon the same foundation in bringing forth now a second part of his libel in vindication of the first notwithstanding it is manifest that he was so convinced of the error of the first that the very nature of the thing now extorts a confession that he had been justly reproved an example of this to make things clear as i go is in nothing more evident than in the great bustle he makes in his second libel to clear himself of his having most scandalously forespoken the house of lords telling us positively before their lordships had so much as debated it that they really would receive more foreigners into their body and pointing out to them who should be the men this he will not have called leading or dictating to the house though there are innumerable precedents when the house have thought otherwise and resented it accordingly as well from greater as smaller persons than this author  this hard task however he undertakes though most people think he will as ill come off as he did from endeavoring to prove himself no heretic when yet he owns himself to be of some opinions contrary to orthodox christians  it is nevertheless to be acknowledged to him for i shall do him justice though he does no justice to others i say it is to be acknowledged to him that he grants leading and dictating to so illustrious a body as the house of lords is an unjustifyable practice but when he comes to wash his hands of the fact hoc opus hic labor est i shall examine it by it self presently but before i enter upon that part it is meet to attack his detached parties which he has prepared to satyrize those he intends to fight with for it is to be observed that he takes a new method with mankind scarce ever practiced by any man before and this is to find out an author who he thinks fit for his encounter and call him the writer of the book which he contends with it matters not with him whether he is the man or no and thus having dressed up this man of straw he begins the fight this he has done in the case before me where finding it greatly for his purpose that de foe author of the true born englishman should pass for the author of the argument against enabling foreigners etc he has singled him out and fallen upon him in a most merciless manner for he has recommended him to the revenge of his foreigners what mercy he will find there may be guessd at he has also as far as his good wishes may have effect recommended him to the resentment of the government he has exposed ridiculed banterd and in a word as far as in him lies murdered the man and yet all this while this man as i find was no more author of this book than the man in the moon nay as i hear for i have no knowledge of the man he has been sick in his bed all the while in carrying on this tragi comedy he takes care to summon for evidence all that this d f has said upon the same subject in his pamphlets and poems formerly written and to confront this with what i have said now whereas if it were true that the said d f had been author of all those things and those too it had amounted to no more than this either that he had been wrong before and was now better informed or second that he had contradicted himself and wrote one time one thing and one time another a fault which modesty should have taught toland to have passed over in silence that it might not be retorted upon himself and after all neither of these things would prove at all that what mr toland had said was right or would have made his libel one jot better than it was before besides the scandal of having taken a wrong aim and charging a man falsely with writing this book who really has no manner of concern in it or about it in the next place i observe mr toland is of opinion that i should not have published his name when i answered his libel the truth is he should have taken care to have had the secret better kept knowing how ill his name recommends any cause he embarks in the defense of and how much disadvantage it is to those he serves to have him known to be their advocate upon these considerations i should have forborne his name had it not been made public before by his echo mr boyer who in his monthly fables called falsely the political state harangd for him thinking  by mistake to make his book sell this man openly told his name for which i hear the bookseller owed him no thanks since then his own friend did him that injury for i hear it gave a great check to the sale of his book why should he blame the author of the answer who only named him at second hand after it was no more a secret and who even then did it with caution too knowing how scandalous a sorger of names to books that same boyer was and how little was to be built for truth upon what he had published who is the easiest man to be imposed upon the most unconcerned at doing any innocent man an injury and the backwardest to do justice when he was convinced of it of any man alive which i shall prove in a part by it self  chap i a farther confirmation of the visible design there has been for some time carried on among a party to propose the introducing foreigners among the nobility and a little of the liberty mr toland takes with truth  mr toland begins this subject for me with two notable falsities first he says boldly page  0 these are his words i never knew or heard of any such design as he affirms there was to introduce these two noblemen or any other foreigners into the house of peers stop there and go back to page    see his words again my proposal says he contains nothing new or strange with respect either to the dispensation or the persons how can this be if such a design was never heard of before oportet mendacem the next falsity is as evident as the former and is taken from his own words also page     viz as to the two foreign noblemen in consideration of whose service i proposed a legal dispensation with the fifth limitation of the act of succession an outcry was immediately raised as if all the foreigners in christendom were to be preferred here whereas i expressly confined my proposal to those two persons here again mr toland lets us see that great wits have short memories for either he did not write the memorial called the anatomy or else he had forgot himself strangely for look into his said anatomy page    he expressly recommends monsieur robethon by name thus  viz nor can it enter into my thoughts but that a way will be found out to recompense the merit of the no less able and indefatigable mr robethon there is one more plainly proposed by name and to let us see that even this is not all that is desired he modestly adds page    i am far from extending this to many others pray observe not to many others this i think strongly acknowledges he is for extending it to some few others and yet this man has the front to say in his second part page    that he expressly confined his proposals to two persons is this the man that charges d f with falsehood and gives him the lie in public print was ever any thing more notorious and is this the man that disowns their being a design laid to propose the bringing in foreigners and more foreigners than he names into the peerage whereas he here acknowledges there is a design to bring in some but not many thus he confesses in one book and denies in the other talks honestly per accident and knavishly per incident but this is not the first time mr toland has discovered himself to be ambo dexter in his arguments as well as in other things and though i will have nothing to do with the quarrel between d f and him for by his treating d f there must be some malice among them yet when i am observing the liberty mr toland takes with truth i cannot pass by one of the coursest shuffles that i have ordinarily met with in the world it is in his fighting with his man of straw aforesaid after he has played the buffoon with him a great while as if he was bringing him instantly to the old bailey or westminster to be arraigned and that he was to be the informer against him he then falls to down right giving him the lie as a man who there was no measures to be used with and he proves d f a liar in this quaint method  he complains that d f had said in some of his writings that he had seen the original letter which he toland had sent to the dissenters this is a lie says toland for it was only written by an amanuensis i kept the original by me  now would one not think that toland might have learnt ever since he was expelled the university a little more justice in dispute than this let his enemy be who he will real or imaginary i shall only ask him in a few words whether let it be written by a servant or not by a servant was not the letter which he actually sent to the dissenting ministers properly the original i will give him a particular case  viz as in drawing writings the rough draught of a lease or indenture is drawn by the attorney or scrivener and it is afterward written over fair or engrossed by a clerk or amanuensis yet that ingrossment being executed is called the original deed and it would be looked upon a most egregious shuffle for any man who had seen the said writing to say if he was legally asked that he had not seen the original because he had not seen the draught if mr toland drew a draught of a letter to the dissenters and then caused his servant or amanuensis to draw it out fair the first perhaps having alterations interpolations etc in it and on viewing the fair copy caused his name to be set to it which is executing it and then sent away i desire to know which is the original that which is first finished and executed or that which is drawn out rough to be redrawn out for such finishing  but this is by the by i note it as a specimen of his sincere way of arguing and his bold giving the lie on such grounds as these and i have remarked this that the world may see what advocates such a cause as this has singled out among mankind to defend it  non tali auxilio nec defensoribus istis tempus eget  however i shall say the less of this here because i may yet give a compleater history of the character of this mr toland to undeceive the world about him and also of his fellow labourer in this drudgery that french papist in disguise who flattering every side in his turn writes now for a tory ministry now for a whig and under the pretense of serving the whigs has always been the first to publish the manifestos of rebels declarations of the pretender and such like stuff of whom i say together with an account of mr toland the public not the secret history is as ready for the press as needful for the public and to which i shall refer for the most execrable practices that any have been suffered to be guilty of unpunished in a christian government  chap ii of leading dictating or prescribing to the house of lords by the pamphlet called the state anatomy  for the reasons already given i leave for a while talking any more of the person of this author and come back to his discourse i find him very much concerned to wash off what sticks to him in this article of dictating to the house of lords it will soon appear whether he does this to purpose or not to purpose i need spend no time to prove that leading and dictating to the house of lords is a scandalous insolent and offensive practice and what the house has always thought fit to resent toland has given me up that point in his second libel which therefore according to my title i must anatomise here page   his words aae these they must be mad themselves who can think any man else mad enough to prescribe to any public assembly much less to the legislative body of the nation thus the point is granted and there needs no more dispute about that it lies then before us to enquire whether what mr toland in his lybel has offered to the house of lords can be called dictating to them and leading them or no  i will abate him all he says to recommend the gentlemen this i will call only proposing to the lords which he says any man may do but when he comes to say there is no need to fear but that the lords will do it p    and again that it would savor of ingratitude and partiallity not to do it p ibid what shall we say to that modest part is this prescribing to and leading the house of peers or is it not  let me be allowed to make a short comment upon this worthy text the house of lords will consent to make baron bothmar and count bernsdorf peers they cannot honorably refuse it and they would be ungrateful and unjust for to be partial is to be unjust if they should not these are words well deserving to be remarked i would be very glad to hear when ever such words were spoken of the house of lords and not resented and yet this man is not so mad as to dedicate to the parliament as if telling them they must do a certain thing or be ungrateful and partial was not dictating for the farther asscertaining then what is or is not dictating to the house i appeal to that illustrious and most honorable assembly whose journals are full of eminent precedents as well in cases where men have offended in the point of dictating etc as also of the constant resentment of the house in such cases  has this most venerable body been so jealous of their privileges and so nice as to forbid any lybeller or author so much as to print the name of a peer and to make the offender liable to an action of scandalum magnatum though he said nothing offensive nay though he spoke in the praise of the person named and shall it not be an offense against the privileges of the house to reproach them in print with ingratitude and partiality if they do not do this or that which the libeller says is fit to be done  shall the house be so jealous of their privileges as to make a fence round their actions like the rails in ancient times to keep off the people from approaching mount sinai so that authors are forbid to print and write any thing that is said or done within their walls at their peril and shall it be no subject of resentment to pretend in print that they will certainly do this or that before they have so much as debated it or spoken a word about it is not mr redpath and mr walker and others now in custody of the black rod for but an unwary trespass of this kind and shall toland publicly say they shall or will do this or that and cannot omit to do it without ingratitude and partiallity and yet wipe his mouth and say he has given their lordships no offense  i will not say the house cannot omit taking him up without partiallity but i may say that if it were any body but mr toland i should wonder at his impudence and should say that if he escaped he would have very good luck  chap iii of the great succcess of the proposal the great service done by the anatomizer to the interest which he pretends to assist and an enquiry into the real advance of their cause by it  were the people who they write for and those who both of them think they please made but once sensible of the just characters of the persons who have whether mercenarily or officiously undertaken their cause were they made sensible how they perform and how they expose rather than assist the cause they undertake they would be ashamed of them and say to them as was lately said by a noble lord to a certain author who claimed some reward for his great services in vindicating his lordship you will extremely oblige me sir if you will be pleased to say no more about me let a judgment be made only by the success of the present undertaking and let mr toland ask himself sedately whether he thinks that the cause he has espoused has gained or lost by him let him go to the baron bothmar and count bernsdorff and ask of those noble persons whether they think he has served them or not and whether they think themselves nearer or farther off from a peerage by his argument  it cannot be true that he himself believes he has bettered their cause it appears that he thinks otherwise by his shifting off from them the scandal of employing him taking the blame of it all upon himself declaring they know nothing of it and that they are so far from desiring him to do it that they do not so much as court or desire the honor of being peers or to that purpose now if he found upon his starting the proposal that the nation came generally and readily into it he would never strive with so much earnestness to conceal the design endeavor to bring in the proposal as a brat of his own private conjectures hatched for not bodies particular interest directed by no body and only offered by a fortuitous efflux of thought without the assistance or so much as the approbation of the persons named or pointed at  if this were the truth of the story he must acknowledge himself mighty officious and that he has run before he was sent i doubt he will find as few people to believe this part as he has found to approve the proposal it self but be that as it will if his projected scheme of enobling these two foreigners with his suggestion of one afterward which he names and his not many others which he slily insinuates are to follow i say if the method he has taken to introduce these has effected the thing if the generality of the nation approve the proposal and he sees the game sure before them why should they oblige him to acknowledge thus that they disown him and his schemes why is he not rather publicly caressed and his book acknowledged but on the contrary the heads are pulled back no body cares to own him and he himself applies diligently to clear those noble persons of having any hand in the conspiracy with him as indeed i believe he has reason to do  no body cares to own a plot when it has miscarried and if toland designed to do his principals a service by the proposal if it had succeeded he is the honester and cannot be blamed to do them a service by keeping them out of it now it proves abortive  perhaps he will say i triumph without a victory very like so but let him speak for himself whether it be a victory or no if he has the victory if he is as sure of the success as he thought himself at first why is he so concerned and why does he keep such a bustle to wash the dirt off of any and why so apprehensive least the world should think they were in the conspiracy why so forward to take all upon himself i think i may without any boasting say he has not so good an opinion of his cause as he had when he began it let him deny it if he can  nor will the fulsome encomiums of a vain french scribbler assist him in this point at all i think i may venture to say that all mr toland has said in this case has but served to make it more difficult than he found it and the gentlemen who he has named if it is as he says without their consent no question if they know what a champion they have that has espoused in mere knight errantry their cause would civilly desire him to say no more about them  now having brought it to the question of his success he joins issue with him on his own merit also and then the remaining question in debate is whether has the design miscarried by the scandalous nature of the proposal or by the scandalous name of the proposer would ever men of any forecast have singled out a man scandalous among christians to have started their friends cause into the world he says he is not a socinian and perhaps he may not be to now but let him tell them what he was expelled the university of  for and how he comes to obtain the general title of a heretic in principles if he had given no occasion for it not that reproach always argues guilt but let him tell the world himself the occasion if he thinks fit i forbear it because it is not the present business i shall find another time for it  as to the present case i cannot but observe how i have heard many people who were not much concerned to enquire about it before start at the proposal now because it is handed into the world by such an agent and i leave it to universal judgment whether the manner the arrogant manner of proposing it has not justly shocked the nobility and gentry of england as to the proposal it self to have them told they will do it before they were ever so much as asked to have them told it will savor of ingratitude and partiallity not to do it before ever they so much as denied is not this bullying the peers into it is it not a bussoonry upon the nation if this has made the case better than it was or has not rather justly filled many minds with resentment who were neither prepossessed one way or other let any reasonable person determine  in the mean time i can assure him it is a very great satisfaction to many good and impartial men that this design of proposing the breaking down the pale of our nobility is thus detected and exposed but i must confess that when some gentlemen came to me the other day and gave me thanks for the service i had done in setting it out in so clear a light as is done in the argument etc i told them frankly the thanks were all due to mr toland who by so insolent an attempt had justly alarmed and opened the eyes of almost as many as had read his libel and had even in denying proved effectually that this proposal of his was no new thing  no indeed it has been no new thing either that some persons aimed at being so enobled or that a party aimed at complying and getting those who alone could do it to comply with their desire and this is a sufficient reason to be given for what i owned in the argument namely that it had been digested for some time viz as long as i had understood from good hands that there was such a thing intended and which i thought it my indispensible duty to oppose and expose  chap iv of the nature of malice and of the unjust suggestions of mr toland in his second anatomy in order to expose the author of the argument to the resentment of the government  i despise all the sly and knavish insinuations of this malicious envenomed lybeller in order if he could to expose me as a jacobite i wish all that are blindly and ignorantly jacobites may in heavens due time be better informed and all that are maliciously so and from principles of hatred to the protestant succession and the person of king george were as toland is viz contemned and exposed i wish them like him expelled from the society of the best of men and made to know their crime by their punishment there is not one sentence or syllable in the book entiuled an argument etc which is intended as a reflection or disrespect to the person or government or conduct of king george and of that sentence which he maliciously wrests p    viz till at length posterity may be offered two turks i say to him honi soit qui mal y pense i know no venom in it nor can he without infinite sarcasm and lybelling the most innocent actions of the king say or suggest that there is any room for a satyr in them  all his boasted advantage and the triumph he makes upon quotations out of de foes pamphlet require no other answer than has been given already viz that de foe has no concern one way or other in that book and if mr baker the publisher were not just at the point of death while this is at the press a particular account of that part would be given but it is none of my business to vindicate de foe however injuriously he may be treated all i have to say is that if mr toland is disposed to make honorable amends for the insolent language which he gives me under the cover of charging the work upon a fellow that neither he nor i know any thing of he shall at any time have the occasion to know who is not concerned in this work by knowing face to face who is concerned in it and i say the same to that cowardly frenchman boyer also  i repeat again what i have said that there is not the least design or intention of disrespect to the person or government of king george in all my answer to tolands lybel but a single and disinterested zeal for the liberties of my country i honor with the profoundest duty not the king only as on the throne but all his royal posterity and raee as capable of and designed by heaven to reign in their courses of time and yet it is no impeachment of this duty and zeal to say that from the best of kings have proceeded the worst of tyrants our laws are made as fences and securities not against good but bad kings were the divine genius to be immortal as i said in the argument were all the kings who shall proceed from the loins of his present majesty to inherit king georges principles his justice moderation love to his people and knowledge as well as desire of their welfare and prosperity i would be as easy to give up all our constitution to him and to be governed by his mere will and discretion as i would be to any man that ever wore a crown  but as virtue honor probity wisdom judgment do not descend by inheritance and are no entail with the crown but kings may hereafter arise that knew not joseph it is a duty to our posterity that we endeavor to preserve the fences of our liberties unbroken and hand forward those invaluable rights to our children entire as we receive them  but this mercenary this bringer of a railing accusation he is for breaking down this fence and dispensing with this law making a precedent to serve a present turn and party which may hereafter be an argument to bring in all the instruments of tyranny which an arbitrary unguided prince may stand in need of for the destruction of the kingdom and this though as i said before without the least designed reflection they were of any nation or religion even turks and mahometans whether those who are for thus breaking in upon our constitution to gratify foreigners or they who are for preserving our constitution whole and unbroken are the best patriots let impartial posterity inquire  nor am i in this offering in the least to derogate from the just esteem due to the honorable persons who he mentions but i ask him this question is there no reward can be suitable to the character and merit of those gentlemen but that of being made lords can the king be at a loss and is the kingdom of great britain empty of means to reward these persons however great their merit is there no way to make them amends but this one method will nothing else satisfy them or be suitable to their deservings that this libeller should say not to do it would be to be ungrateful and partial i remember when the glorious king william intending to reward the late e of portland with a vast grant no less than the revenue of the principality of wales and the house of commons applied to his majesty not to do it the king readily acquiescd and expressing his royal gratitude to the e of portland for his many signal services his majesty said he would think of rewarding those services some other way i shall make no comparisons but believe the libeller himself will not pretend that any man can have deserved better of his present majesty than the late e of portland had deserved of king william yet when he found the way he had designed to reward him gave any uneasiness to his people his majesty resolved to reward those eminent services some other way and i dare say the posterity of that noble person do not complain of the kings being unkind to them  i am ready to grant that the services of these noble persons now proposed are as great as my opposer pleases to suppose them yet i say without lessening those suppositions that great britain is able to reward them fully though they are not received into our peerage and yet not merit to be libelled by toland as partial and ungrateful  but be that as it will let his majesty propose to his parliament what he thinks fit the parliament will always act as becomes them the house of peers will never act undutifully to the king no not in those things which they cannot grant nor will they act unfaithfully to their country no not in those things which they cannot refuse but this is not to the case in hand for it does not appear that the king has any desire to have this thing done nay mr toland does not pretend to it but let us see here how the vain man exposes himself for while he acknowleges no body to be privy to the proposal but himself he contradicts and confounds himself most pitiously he protests pa  0 that he never knew or heard of any design to introduce those two noble men or any other foreigners into the house of peers exore tuo call mr toland to detect mr toland pa    my proposal contained nothing new with respect either to the thing or to the persons these are the words quoted before but are absolutely necessary to be brought in again here because this man can have the assurance to pretend after this to be believed upon his word that no body ever heard of this before  but suppose we should believe him for once and imagine that neither the king intended to enoble these persons that these two persons did not desire to be enobled or that the house of peers ever intended to repeal or dispense with the act for this end how then can he have the front to tell the house of peers to their faces that if they do not do it it savours of ingratitude and partiality he may be defied to show an impudence like this since the liberty of the press which we now groan under has plagued us i am sorry to use such words in print but when we are talking to such men such language is forced out of our mouths as only proper to people of such flagrant merit  again if neither the king the house of lords or the two foreign noblemen themselves have so much as had any thoughts of this matter how will this false accuser make good his charge that the opposing it is pointed at the government or the ministry the charge is pointed at those conspirators who are in the design and as he declares neither the king the ministry or the parliament are acquainted with it then they are not pointed at but we know who are in it perhaps better than he pretends to know and as they are not too big to be charged so i must ell him it is not his raillery and pretending it points at the government who are not concerned in it that will wipe it off  the case is in short this the design is blown the plot is discovered and thereby defeated he thought it was ripe before it was so and brought it out too soon he knows it well enough for his own friends blame him for it and now he has no remedy but to cry out jacobitism and treason in his opposers as if all the men who are not for recommending foreigners to the nobility must be jacobites or that all those who were not for a standingarmy in time of peace were for the pretender and yet he confesses that i declared i was for an army when there was any danger of the pretender and while either a foreign enemy or private disturbance threatened the country  but the man is enraged because he is frustrated he had said the house of lords will open the door to foreigners and now he is assured they wont nay he knows he may with much more title to modesty say they will not than he could before say they will and this makes him raving at every body that comes in his way  but let him rave the nation is awake britains may be surpised into such things as may be dangerous in their examples like this but in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird while they are awake and there eyes are open they are in no danger  i observe that this toland makes himself merry with de foes verses from the true born englishman i have only this to say in that case that if that satyr was just upon our country and nobility it certainly infers that as we are now arrived to an excellence which we believe is not outdone by other nations either in science or religion and moral virtue we should keep were we are and mix no farther if we can help it unless we are sure to improve but to let that go for a jest as it was intended our business is not now so much about mixing of blood though that is not insignificant but about mixing our politics the argument which i brought from the treatment we gave to the scots nobility at the late treaty of union is good sense and to the present purpose and the scots nobility are not now insensible of the weight of it though this unfair cavilling libeller bustoons it and pretends that i allege they were kept out as foreigners had he been in temper to understand common sense he would have seen the contrary he absurdly suggests that i hint they were kept out as foreigners no no he cannot but allow that i and every one else knows that after the union they were no more foreigners but united but the argument is just nevertheless a fortiori if these though our own brethren were not allowed to sit in the house of lords but with such nicety restrained to a representative and this in especial manner because of our judicature being reposited with the peers how much more then should we be backward to bring strangers and real foreigners to partake of that supreme authority which the scottish nobility were denied  let any man but observe the wretched temper of this slanderous libeller the author of mercurius politicus has called this a new argument this book he says de foe has the chief hand in also which upon good enquiry and good evidence i am assured is false too but let the author be who he will i say he has called this a new argument which forsooth toland will not only not allow but says it is nonsense let us see the nonsense of it and if it be not a new argument let him tell us when it was made use of before be it new or old the force of it is full against him  the scots nobility ancient beyond history and illustrious beyond objection yet was denied upon the late coalition of natural privileges were denied i say to be admitted into the english peerage other than by a representative because it was not thought that the supreme judicature of england could be communicated with justice to those who had not an equal concern in the interest of the people of the nation  now to add a word or two to that part would it not appear partial against our brethren of scotland especially now after they are our brethren that while they are excluded foreigners shall be admitted let him give a just reason for this if he can  but to carry this a little farther because his ignorance suffers him to pretend that the reasons for admitting the scots nobility only by a representative number was to assert the proportion only to the value of estates he shows by this that he has folly and gross ignorance equal to his dishonesty for though it is true that the proportioning the value etc was regarded in the asserting the number of the scots representitives in the house of commons yet this was the least consideration if any at all in fixing the number of the peers for the limiting of which there were reasons not proper to recite here and had he not been perfectly void of any notion of what was then doing he would have known something of those reasons  but not to resume the debates of those days seeing he puts me to it i shall start another case as new as the former and yet as pungent as can be desired to the present point of admitting foreigners at the time of the treaty of union notwithstanding the whole scots nation was to be incorporated into one body with the english and that the subjects of both were to enjoy equal privileges yet so resolutely did our english nobility insist upon not encorporating the peerage of scotland with themselves so jealous were they of pulling down the fence about their own incommunicable judicature that the union is said not to allow even the crown it self to create a scots peer already a peer a lord by an english title so as to make him an hereditary lord of parliament this is eminent in the case of the late duke hamilton as duke of brandon and albeit the scots do dispute this point we do not find the house of lords take yet any notice of that dispute  and shall this libeller tell us the house of peers will be partial and ungrateful if they admit not germans and strangers into their body while at the same time they have barred the door against their own encorporated brethren of scotland let toland or any of the conspirators tell us what was the reason of this nicety if it was not that the english nobility had seen reason to think they ought to be exceeding cautious of ever making more mixtures by creation at least with the blood of their nobility rather let him prove that it would not be partial and ungrateful to the scots nobility if foreigners should be received while the scots are excluded and where is the general kindness which was promised and exhorted to from the throne to be preserved and cultivated between the two united kingdoms i say where is this mutual kindness if such partiality should be practiced on our side  if indeed an encorporate union shall come to be treated between his majestys foreign dominions and the island of great britain then the case will be altered and we should be all willing and ready no doubt to receive a representative of the hanover nobility into the body of ours such as to the king and parliament shall seem convenient but as to the ennobling foreigners it is firmly provided against by the constitution and our libelmaker prosesses that neither does he know that his majesty intends it or these foreign noble persons who he has presumed to name desire it i am sure the house of peers have not debated it what assurance then must he and the party who dictate to him who for that reason i justly call conspirators i say what assurance must they have to be officious in a thing of this consequence to their country  it has been suggested and i have reason to believe it is so far true that the thing is in its embrio that the scheme is young and that the people concerned were willing to let the proposal take wind this way to see how it would relish with the british gentry and it was no imprudent step i acknowledge to do so for had they made the attempt at once before they had made a judgment of things they would have run the hazard of a miscarriage much more to their disadvantage  be it as it will they have now made the experiment and i dare say they will not find upon telling noses that they have made one convert by mr tolands anatomy on the contrary there are some testimony of many eyes being opened by the detecting and justly exposing the traitorous contrivance and i leave them to the trial when they will find the persons concerned in another condition to repel them than perhaps they expected  it might be worth while to note here how quaintly he would make it criminal in me to speak of some honest and loyal patriots remaining in the administration as if i thereby insinuated that some there were otherwise and that there were misunderstandings amongst the ministry that i would have it thought they were not all of a piece and he would have this be thought malicious now by what has since happened in the ministry it may be asked without any reflection whether if i had looked that way though that is not granted i were in the right or not but it has been this mans talent many years to be an accuser of the brethren and if it be true that he was expelled a university for faction and error if it be true as i have heard that he once impiously attempted to draw up a new gospel no wonder he would now frame a new constitution but this i shall have a farther occasion to talk with him about  all the residue of his book viz his answer to the clergyman his letters to the archbishop and to the dissenters and his wrangling and unseemly language upon de foe are worth no notice at all either by me or any one else perhaps such language may be suitable to the foreign noble lord without a name who he pretends to write to and who if he be any body it is like is one of the not many more who he pretends to solicit for after these are got in and who are all to be british peers ad graecos
