comic muse the buskin wears and gives her self no small romantic airs struts in heroics and in pompous verse does the minutest incidents rehearse in ridicules strict retrospect displays the poetasters of these modern days when the big bellowing bombast rends our ears which stripped of sound quite void of sense appears or when the fiddle faddle numbers flow serenely dull elaborately low either extreme when vain pretenders take the actor suffers for the authors sake the quite tired audience lose whole hours yet pay to go unpleasd and unimprovd away this being our scheme we hope you will

the cheerful trumpets gladsome clangor the noise of drums and thunder of artillery he sleeps supine amidst the din of war and yet it is not definitively sleep rather a kind of doze a waking slumber
