an easy way to prolong life by a little attention to what we eat and drink  price two shillings  an easy way to prolong life by a little attention to what we eat and drink containing a chemical analysis or an enquiry into the nature and properties of all kinds of food how far they are wholesome and agree with different constitutions  with some directions respecting our way of living  collected from the authorities of some of our ablest physicians  by a medical gentleman  london printed for the author and sold by j bell near exeterexchange in the strand  advertisement the observations throughout these pages are not only supported by the authorities of some of our best medical writers but are the result of experience and practice and that reader who has sufficient resolution to pay a proper regard to the directions here given will in a very little time congratulate himself for his discretion and thank the author for the benefit he has received from him he presumes to advance nothing but what is undeniably true and if he has not wrote like a physician it is because he wishes to be understood by all classes of people he begs leave to say that once reading this work is not enough it should be perused again and again  n b he has not given his authorities because he would not break in upon the readers attention he is aware that the doctrine will of course have its enemies but of that he is regardless  an easy way to prolong life health being the greatest blessing upon earth it is natural to imagine we should be studious to preserve it and yet if we take a view of the actions and conduct of mankind in general we are led to suppose that it is not the greatest good instead of paying any regard to it we frequently indulge our appetites at the expense of our constitutions the human body is a piece of mechanism that requires care and attention it may be compared to clockwork which if not kept free from dust and other extraneous injurious substances will presently be out of order life is generally speaking shortened or prolonged according to the care we take of it  in the first age of the world the life of man was nearly a thousand years but after the flood it was abreviated to half its length three generations later it was reduced to one fourth of its original term and man seldom lived above two hundred years about the time of moses it became shorter still commonly not exceeding one hundred and twenty years and now it is reduced to little more than half that period  but though we find this gradual declension in the several ages of the world yet we must understand that it was not equally so in all parts at the same time for difference of climate and difference of living caused a difference in the length of life hence some of the inhabitants of the earth lived three times or four times as long as others  now why the days of man should be thus shortened and his term of life so much reduced is an object worth our enquiry and if we compare the manner of our living now with that of the first age of the world we shall see evident reasons for it every generation having more and more impaired its constitution by a degenerate course of living incompatible with the laws of nature and as we must of necessity admit of hereditary infirmities we have reason to expect unless by great reformation of the injurious customs of later ages that life in future will be shorter still  it is true there is another rational cause namely that when the number of men upon the earth was small it was necessary their life should be prolonged for the purposes of population but as they increased this became no longer necessary and the wisdom of the creator found it requisite to shorten their days lest the earth should be overstocked for were men to live nine hundred years now with the present increase of the species there could not be provision for one tenth part of their number but notwithstanding this it is a matter of melancholy consideration to think how much longer a man might live with temperance than he does at present and how soon the gratification of a little momentary pleasure hurries him out of life perhaps to the destruction of his family and the loss of happiness hereafter  in the infancy of the world man sought only after the necessary requisites of his being and was contented with that competent subsistence which nature required but in process of time he grew dissatisfied with the bare necessaries of life that wholesome provision that would have greatly prolonged it and hunted after variety and excess to please and gratify a sensual appetite thus one age taught another to be irregular and disordered dictated new inventions to succeeding generations and transmitted their ruined practices to the following ages to imitate and complete  hinc illae lachrymae  after this manner and by such means is the life of man beset by innumerable infirmities and diseases thus is he cut off before he is well aware of it  now as it is natural to man to covet length of life we have reason to suppose he will be glad to pay some attention to those things that will either prolong or shorten it and as length of life depends upon health health is the principal thing to be considered  the practice of physic was anciently distributed into three branches the first of which was confined to surgery the second to the administration of internal remedies the last to a due regulation of diet the two former have in no age received more useful improvement than in the present but it is greatly to be doubted whether or not an attention has been paid to the latter in proportion to its dignity and importance  many are the causes of ill health but the principal one is the variety and excess of food to this then at present we shall turn our enquiries but before we proceed it may not be unnecessary to give the reader some little insight into the nature of digestion and the properties of food in general  when food is thrown down into a healthy stomach it naturally dissolves and ferments it being a natural property of the stomach to produce fermentation the aliment being dissolved and fermented is again rendered solid by the juices of the stomach and the nutritive fluid being expelled from the solid part is passed into the intestines where it is absorbed by certain vessels that open into them and is converted into blood the remaining part of the food being retained in the stomach during this process is afterward evacuated but this fermentation in the body is not exactly similar to fermentations out of the body as in fermentations out of the body the air contained in the substances fermenting is let out which may be found by experiment but this is not the case in healthy persons and in proper food within the body fermentation there takes place without any extrication of air in weak stomachs indeed and in the digesting of some particular foods extrication of air will often so distend the stomach as to occasion flatulencies and pain but this is always irregular and unnatural  now if such extrication of air should happen or the food we take be such as will not in the stomach readily dissolve ferment become solid or redissolve or in short if it be such as shall in any way resist the powers of the stomach digestion will be imperfect and the whole system disordered it being only such part of the food as is digested that nourishes the body  if the digestive powers of the stomach be weak natural fermentation will not take place but such fermentation as we observe in flour when mixed with yest that is the air in the substances we eat will be extricated and sometimes to such a degree as to distend the stomach greatly and bring on what is called wind belchings and pain in this case vegetables will turn acid and meat will putrify before either of them are passed from the stomach this occasions heart burn a certain sign of indigestion and if this weakness of the stomach continues and putrefaction runs to a great height sickness vomiting and purging will be the consequence and sometimes fever now should any quantity of this putrid food be absorbed by the vessels and in its passage through the body be carried into the blood it will weaken the whole system and if not timely prevented bring on such a general putrefaction of the blood etc as to prove fatal  if what we eat be of hard digestion that is such as will not readily dissolve or break down or ferment in the stomach either owing to the nature of the food its hard texture or the weakness of our digestive organs it will remain too long before it be passed off and produce a sense of weight fullness oppression and cold as is the case with salted meats in weak stomachs it is the same if it will not redissolve after it is coagulated or become solid  so again if it be too easy of digestion that is if it be such as will not remain long enough in the stomach owing either to its want of tendency to become solid again after it is dissolved or to the strength of the stomach preventing it the nutritive part will not have time to separate and the body will not be nourished  further it must be observed that circulation is carried on by a contraction of the heart driving the blood from its cavities into the blood vessels which immediately on receiving it contract likewise and impel it on through the whole round of the system to the heart again now if the heart and vessels contract too quick or with too much force it occasions a strong quick pulse and fever and will often throw the blood in such quantities upon the brain which is a tender delicate part as to bring on stupor apoplexy delirium and death and it is the property of some substances to stimulate or increase this action of the heart and vessels and of others to diminish it food of a viscid clammy nature glary like the white of an egg will adhere to the sides of the stomach and by so doing throw the blood from other parts of the body in such quantities upon the brain as to oppress it and sometimes occasion apoplexy how this is brought about is unknown but experience shows us that it is so  persons have been so disordered by eating muscles which are of a viscid nature that without some timely assistance they would have died in these cases the head swells the face becomes of a black red the eyes are ready to start from their sockets and a stupor succeeds but by administering a vomit and making the stomach discharge its contents and by opening the jugular vein the patient has sometimes recovered  from hence it appears that some kinds of food are wholesome others unwholesome and that there is none universally proper it must be adapted to the constitution  now there is a period in the life of man in which the organs of digestion are weak and yet at the same time there is a necessity for much nourishment this period is infancy for as at this time the body increases fast much nourishment is required to help and forward the growth milk being naturally provided and therefore probably adapted to it we may suppose it to be a food of easy digestion and considerable nourishment examining then the properties of milk will give us some insight into the nature of food in general  milk is not a simple substance it is a mixture of three namely coagulable matter expressed oil and sugar coagulable matter is that which will unite and become solid leaving the rest thinner and more fluid viz the curd and expressed oil is such as can be procured from any substance by pressing as oil of almonds olives and the like by expressed oil in milk we understand the cream  the most simple food then does not appear to be the easiest of digestion if it was we should have expected that milk would have consisted of one substance only  that the coagulable matter is capable of affording considerable nourishment may be gathered from our experiencing that animal mucilage nourishes the most mucilage being that substance which has sufficient moisture to keep it together as for example  sound good meat  this coagulable matter in milk is fluid indeed when taken but there is a juice peculiar to the stomach very different from an acid that renders it solid we find the stomach of a calf though cleared of every thing that is acid to have this property an infusion of a few grains of the inner coat will coagulate or curdle several quarts of milk  with respect to cheese for i shall not have a better opportunity to mention it it has in general a costive quality but it differs in proportion to the quantity of oil in the coagulable part the more rich oily parts there are in cheese the more nutritive it is and soluble that is the readier it will digest the leaner the cheese the more difficultly it digests cheese is liable to become rank and putrid we must then consider it as having all the effects of animal food when advanced to putrefaction at this time it ceases to be nutritive and can only be considered as an assistant to digestion cheese indeed as food is only fit for the laborious and robust  having mentioned cheese let me drop a word or two upon butter a quantity of pure cream eaten is undoubtedly unwholesome being from its disposition to get acid and rancid very difficult of digestion but in the form of butter it may be used with advantage it is a strong nutriment fit to accompany our vegetable diet especially such vegetables as are naturally dry of themselves in this case it gives them the properties of rich oily substances  but to return  it appears then that milk and of course all other food must become solid in the stomach and after that undergo a fresh change that is be redissolved for digestion for which purpose it must remain some time there before it be passed off  now that the expressed oil which is the cream helps digestion is evident from milks not digesting so well when it has been skimmed the curd being harder for the cream and the sugar being mixed with the curd separate the different parts of it more from one another so that the natural fluid of the stomach will penetrate the easier and fermentation go on the better if new milk is too rich or heavy for a childs stomach let it be diluted or mixed with water it should never be skimmed  and as to sugar it being from its nature more apt to ferment will of course facilitate digestion  that expressed oil affords nuch nourishment we find from men and animals being able to live a long time upon nuts almonds etc such containing a quantity of this oil but expressed oil alone produces sense of weight on the stomach owing to a relaxation it brings on preventing the stomachs contracting and expelling its load and if taken in quantities it will bring on sickness  that sugar also affords great nourishment is evident from animals thriving on the shoots of young plants which contain a great deal of sugar and from some negroes living wholly on the sugarcane but sugar alone is viscid and by adhering to the sides of the stomach will stimulate it and disorder the system and if diluted with any watery fluid would be so thin as not to be retained in the stomach long enough for digestion but mixed with the coagulable part of the milk it is sufficiently retained either of these substances alone then viz coagulable matter expressed oil or sugar would be hard of digestion but blended as in milk they are easy of digestion  immediately after childbirth when the milk begins to flow in the mothers breasts it contains a larger quantity of sugar and water for there is always a small quantity of water in proportion to the coagulable matter some months after child birth the coagulable matter increases and the sugar proportionably diminishes for as the infantstomach is weak the solid part of the milk is at first less so that a looser mass is formed much easier to be dissolved as the child grows stronger its stomach can bear more of this coagulable matter and digests it if it be firmer this points out that a young child one of a month old will not thrive in general on breastmilk eight or nine months old  we also learn from this that weak stomachs require food of easy digestion strong stomachs food of harder digestion thus chicken etc will nourish people most recovering from sickness and bacon etc will best recruit a labourer  having thus far considered the properties of milk the food nature has designed for the infantstomach we shall be able to discover the wholesomeness of other foods by examining their different properties and we will begin with vegetables  the vegetable substances capable of nourishing are as follow    farrinaceous matter or flour this is generally contained in grain but sometimes we find it in the stems of plants and sometimes in their roots    vegetable mucilage as for example gumarabic etc that this is capable of nourishing is evident from whole caravans living on it for a long time when they can procure no other food    sugar    expressed oils and    native vegetable acid or the juice of four fruits which tends to take off the putrescency of animal food that is to prevent meat from corrupting while it continues in the stomach  for animal food without a mixture of vegetable is apt to continue too long in the stomach before it ferments in this case it will sometimes begin to putrify before it be passed off which putrefaction getting into the blood will often bring on a putrefaction of all the fluids of the body this is a complete seascurvy which if not timely remedied always terminates dreadfully salting provisions makes them harder of digestion and though it prevents meat from corrupting soon out of the body yet as the salt seldom if ever penetrates sufficiently into the substance of the meat so as totally to secure it against putrefaction when in the body if it is not immediately made to ferment by the addition of vegetable food or some vegetable acid thrown in with it it will be apt to putrify before it digests and contaminate the whole system hence we see how liable mariners are on a voyage where there is a scarcity of vegetables to be afflicted with the scurvy and how soon they get rid of that disorder when they once get on shore again to the free use of herbs and roots  now these five vegetable substances i have mentioned go naturally through fermentation and are converted into blood  with respect to the fibers the solid part of vegetables we find them frequently pass through the body without being altered as for example peace and the skins of gooseberries currants etc now as the texture of the strongest tendons of animal food is constantly destroyed in their passage through the body while such parts of vegetable food shall be evacuated as they were taken in it is a question whether these last were digested if any of them are it must be such only as are young and tender  but to return farrinaceous matter is contained in the seeds of all vegetables but in many it is so mixed with other substances as to be unfit for use thus we find it in peace beans etc but in too small quantities for the purposes of life  so again we meet with it in nuts as walnuts chestnuts almonds filberds common nuts etc but these contain too much oil to be wholesome for common food besides they yield a bitterish astringent matter which adds to their unwholesomeness bitter almonds acorns etc which contain a great deal of this matter are more unwholesome still the oil contained in nuts will often give a sense of weight in the stomach and stimulate the system during digestion especially when eaten raw besides the farrinaceous matter in them have a viscidity that renders them hurtful to the constitution but roasting them will destroy this viscidity and then they may be eaten safely and will afford much nourishment they may be rendered easier of digestion by mixing them with flour it is the cocoanut mixed with flour that forms chocolate  farrinaceous matter is found also in many roots as in potatoes etc and sometimes in the pith of trees as in the palm tree  we use the pith of one tree which we make into sago by moistening it with water beating it up so as to separate it from the fibrous part of the tree drying it into a cake and afterward reducing it to powder thus it becomes easy of digestion and does not stimulate but still as it passes off too soon from the stomach it does not afford much nourishment however it is very proper food for weak stomachs as in fevers  in the east they eat rice in england wheat in germany rye in some parts oats and barley and in africa indian wheat this is the grain commonly used for food and it appears to be well adapted to digestion  farrinaceous matter is in its nature solid capable of being dissolved in water and forming a jelly if before we dissolve it in water we expose it to heat it coagulates or becomes solid thus if we bake it we convert it into bread after which it will not so readily dissolve but bread dissolved by long boiling is less viscid than a solution of flour would be and consequently more wholesome was flour used with water raw it would be so viscid as to clog and cloy the stomach we therefore prepare it to take off this viscidity  flour is not apt to undergo that fermentation in the stomach so as sufficiently to correct the putrescency of animal food we therefore ferment it first that is we make it into bread another reason for our converting it into bread is that in fermentation extrication of air takes place which leaves a number of holes making the bread spungy by which means when eaten it soaks up the fluid of the stomach and facilitates digestion  in order to coagulate the flour that is make it into bread and give it a whiteness which is the nature of all coagulants to do bakers mix with it a quantity of alum which if not so great as to give the bread a taste can do no harm to adults but a small quantity will do much mischief to infants panada therefore for children should by no means be made of bread in which any alum has been mixed it is for this reason physicians prescribe biscuitpowder  sometimes bakers use whites of eggs and sometimes spirits of wine to coagulate the flour as in french bread the first is innocent and the last evaporates during the baking and can produce no ill effect for if bread is not perfectly coagulated it will sometimes ferment a second time in the stomach particularly if it continues long as in weak stomachs and turn sour but baking it a second time will totally prevent this thus rusks and toasted bread are often prescribed for disordered stomachs as being least liable to do mischief for the least extrication of air in weak stomachs is injurious  but farrinaceous seeds and roots are not sufficient to correct the putrescency of meat we therefore make use of vegetables that were not originally designed for food namely potherbs of these  the one sort are cabbages colliflowers brocoli and all the varieties of this class of plants they contain naturally a stimulating oil and a bitter astringent juice so as not to be fit for use but we find this only in wild cabbages etc by cultivation this oil and bitter juice are destroyed and such as grow in our gardens consist of little more than mucilage and sugar and of course are fit for food  the method taken to destroy these noxious juices is to grow the plants in the dark or with as little air as possible this is done by planting them in a rich soil and thus making them so luxuriant that the leaves shall embrace one another by which means the body of the plant grows in the dark and with little or no air hence the inner leaves become white and are free from those hurtful juices the outer leaves may be eaten but the inner ones are most wholesome so young plants are more wholesome than old ones as whatever of these juices they contain they are not near so rank  another kind of plants we use are parsley fennel thyme mint sage etc and some others of the same kind these contain a stimulating oil that would be injurious to the constitution if eaten in any quantity and on that account are only used as condiments with a seasoning to other foods cellery is of the same kind but by earthing it up and thus making it grow in the dark and with little or no air we destroy its noxious oil wild cellery if eaten would blister the mouth  the several species of onions garlic shalots etc are of another class we cannot destroy the oil in these but by boiling  lettuce endive dandelion etc contain much opium and when wild are very bitter and dispose to sleep consequently are unfit for food but by cultivating them in rich soils and covering them from light and air by tying them up we render them wholesome  spinnage beets and other plants of that kind when wild contain also a very bitter oil so as not to be eatable but by cultivation in rich soils they lose this oil  in the same manner asparagus contains oil so stimulating that if eaten wild would blister the tongue but by cultivating it in rich ground and making use only of the young shoots we avoid this inconvenience but i shall take occasion to mention this and every other article more fully hereafter  none of these plants alone afford much nourishment we use them to correct the putrescency of animal food and particularly in the summer as not stimulating  they are apt to ferment and turn sour in a weak stomach and in fermenting will let loose the air contained in them and occasion wind when persons find this they should refrain from eating them till their stomach grows stronger for by continuing to take down such things as disagree with them they not only disorder themselves for the present but will in time so injure their digestive organs as to be hereafter attended with dreadful consequences  peace beans kidneybeans etc are more flatulent or windy still especially when eaten unripe as is always done such persons therefore with whom they disagree should by no means eat them  with respect to esculent roots these contain mucilage sugar and farrinaceous matter that is flour the two last afford much nourishment but the mucilage does little else than forward fermentation the more mucilaginous and watery these roots are the more apt they are to ferment and correct the putrescency of animal food and consequently the fitter to be eaten in warm weather but the more sugar and flour they contain the more they nourish  turnips radishes onions etc are equally as liable to ferment and correct putrescency as the herbs springing from these roots and as they contain a greater quantity of sugar than their respective herbs they are more nutritive  carrots parsneps artichokes jerusalem artichokes etc contain much sugar and farrinaceous matter but very little mucilage these are wholesome nutritive and easy of digestion  the sugar adds much to the nutritive quality of the farrinaceous matter in all these substances  potatoes yams earthnuts etc contain flour almost alone with very little sugar but more water than we find in farrinaceous seeds however the farrinaceous matter is the same in both and is coagulable by heat we boil them and roast them to destroy their viscidity  it was but lately that these roots were introduced into europe for food they are as nutritive as wheat flour but cannot be so well made into bread without a mixture of flour as they will not readily ferment without some such mixture one reason for our not growing them so generally as wheat is that they are more apt to fail in the produce the crop is not equally certain  it is not yet determined whether mushrooms are animals or vegetables they have all the properties of animalfood and must be considered as such  fruits fruits contain sugar native vegetable acid and mucilage and their skins contain more or less an astringent juice but so little of it as not to render them unwholesome nay it is rather of service as it stimulates the stomach causes it to contract strongly and thus prevents the fruit becoming acid and flatulent the sugar acids and mucilage are capable of fermenting and being converted into blood as sugar affords more nourishment than any other substance such fruits as are sweetest are the most wholesome viz figs grapes etc  sugar is even more nutritive than flour but it is seldom thoroughly digested being so very soluble it passes off from the stomach before any change can take place in it but entangled in the cells of fruit it is retained longer in the stomach so as to yield some nourishment so again it is not apt to ferment in the stomach alone but mixed with the mucilage of fruits fermentation readily takes place besides the acid of fruits helps to correct the putrecency of animal food  the more diluted sugar is the more apt it is to ferment hence watery or mucilaginous fruits with little sugar as goosberries currants cherries etc afford but little nourishment but then they tend more to correct putrescency  such as contain much sugar and less water and mucilage are not so apt to ferment consequently are not so proper to correct putrecency but then they are more nutritive than such as contain more mucilage and water and less sugar they afford so much nourishment that in many countries they are used as food thus figs dates etc in portugal are eaten as common food  by evaporating the water from fruits that is by drying them we lessen their disposition to ferment consequently we make them less flatulent and more nutritive  the fermentation of some fruits in the stomach have by letting loose the air sometimes so distended it as to prove fatal but we may correct this by adding sugar to them or spices however such as find they disagree with them if they value their health should refrain from eating them  fruits containing a great quantity of native vegetable acid afford so little nourishment as lemons oranges etc that we seldom use them but as a power acting on the stomach to correct the bad properties of other food as will be shown hereafter  sour fruits eaten in autumn have been accused of bringing on violent continued purgings but without any reason indeed some four fruits will act as purgatives and the purging shall continue but this must be owing to the state of the body predisposed to purge for we find that when fruit purges a body not predisposed to purge no purging continues when the fruit is evacuated in hot summers when there is great plenty of fruit dysenteries or continued purgings are apt to be general but this is owing to the heat of the weather for persons will be afflicted with dysentery who eat no fruit in short in such disorders they counteract and those who eat no fruit are more apt to purge than such as do nay if large quantities of fruit should purge it will not prove dangerous it will act no further than as a dose of physic  there is one species of fruit very different from others namely cucumbers melons etc this fruit either ripe or unripe contains a great deal of mucilage of a particular kind break them in two and you will see much of this mucilage ooze out so as to glue the two parts firmly together now this mucilage prevents the other parts of the fruit from fermenting consequently causes indigestion and brings on in the stomach a sense of weight coldness and sickness for though the substance be soft it will not readily dissolve cucumbers have been known to lie in the stomach three days undigested we are led to use them in the summer as cooling food but they are very injurious to the constitution besides they contain a quantity of essential oil which no vegetable substance does very disagreeable and hurtful to a weak stomach if they are eaten therefore it should be with oil and pepper as correctors of their noxious qualities there is a natural bitter in the skin of the cucumber which will serve to digest it if eaten at the same time but this should only be done when the cucumber is young as it afterward becomes injurious to the stomach  having now treated of the properties and wholesomeness of vegetable food we will proceed next to animal and herein we will first consider the propriety of using it  it has been given as a reason for not using animal food that it was inconsistent with humanity there can however be little difficulty about this as there are a great number of animals that must live on animal food wholly not being able to eat vegetable it was therefore the intention of the creator that animal food should be eaten all that is to be considered is whether man is that animal that is destined to live upon animal food the pythagorean doctrine heightened by superstition has been a means of making numbers of people viz the whole of the gentoos the whole empire of hindostan and part of china larger together than france spain italy and england wholly abstain from meat  it is also to be observed that the race of particular animals is seldom diminished though we destroy many of them the increase of animals being much below what might be propagated one man and one woman might in the nature of things have thirty children but in general they may have ten five boys and five girls at every generation then were men propagated to the utmost they could increase in number five times so that in a very short time a nation must become exceedingly populous it is the difficulty of procuring food and obtaining the necessaries and conveniences of life that prevents this propagation a proof of the superintendency of providence now as it is in man so is it in other animals it is possible for a sow to bring forth ten pigs at every litter so that were this species propagated to the utmost in a few years the increase would be prodigious tenfold in one year and a thousandfold in ten years here also the difficulty of obtaining food prevents increase there being always a desire of propagation between the sexes  this is more evident if we observe the great increase of rats in a granary where they multiply in proportion to the quantity of corn there lodged  these things considered we may readily see that in destroying annually a number of any one species of animals so far from diminishing that species we shall rather increase it as in such a case we shall be anxious so to do so by sending a number of inhabitants out of a country we do not depopulate that country unless we exceed a certain bounds animals then living on one another is the means of increasing animal life considerably there can be therefore no reason why animalfood should not be used let us examine then whether this food be proper  most quadrupeds are confined naturally to particular climates and most of them in their organs of digestion fitted for animal and vegetable food some have it only in their power to obtain animal food and some only vegetable but man seems destined to cover the whole face of the earth no climate being yet discovered unfit for his residence his powers are fitted for animal as well as vegetable food and his digestive organs equally adapted to both and if we consider mankind in their most simple state where they are most guided by instinct we find as many shepherds and hunters living on animal food as husbandmen living on vegetable  animals destined to live on animal food have their intestinal canal shorter than such as live on vegetable food that is in order to be understood by such as are unacquainted with physical terms have less length of gut and as longer retention in the stomach is required for animal food than for vegetable and mans digestive organs are adapted to this it appears that man is destined to live equally on animal food as vegetable further the teeth of man are a medium between the teeth of carnivorous animals and and those of grameniverous besides his health is better supported by a mixture of the two than it would be was he to live upon one the laplanders indeed live nine months on reindeer and the greenlander lives upon fish it is possible therefore to live on animal food alone however were we obliged to live upon one sort wholly it would be best to live on vegetable for animal food alone would frequently bring on diseases a mixture therefore is best in short man is endowed with greater variety in his system and constitution than any other animal he being destined to live in all parts of the earth  let us next consider the differences between animal and vegetable food now as we said before fermentation which takes place in food within the stomach is different from that which takes place out of it if the stomach then be weak so as not to bring on fermentation natural to it the fermentation that would take place out of the stomach will take place in it hence it is that in weak stomachs food turns acid and putrid this first occasions heartburn a sure sign of a weak stomach and if the putrefaction should run to a great height the consequence is sickness vomiting purging and sometimes fever and should a small quantity of such putrified matter as was observed before be absorbed by the vessels in its passage through the body it will depress the strength and without a timely remedy cause a general putrefaction of the fluids through the whole system thus the mischiefs of animal food putrefying are greater and more dangerous than such as arise from undigested vegetable food as this turns sour only  another difference is this vegetable food during digestion stimulates less when the stomach is distended with food the whole system during digestion is more or less stimulated but more so with animal food than with vegetable now the more our system is stimulated the quicker is the circulation and the more feverish we become  as animal food fills the blood vessels fuller with blood than vegetable it naturally increases our muscular strength but then it loads the brain every part being fuller of blood in proportion and occasions heaviness and stupor whereas vegetable food from not loading the system with blood rather diminishes muscular strength but enables the mind to act with greater force vegetable food therefore is fitter to give clearness of ideas and animal food is best adapted to labor a physical demonstration might be given of this but to a general reader it would be idle however habit has a great effect in this case man accustomed to labor and to eat vegetable food as are the porters of constantinople may be capable of great muscular exertion but this does not prove the power of vegetable food over animal so a horse fed on grass and kept in exercise will be better able to work than one fed on hay and corn for twelve months together without exercise but this neither is any proof  the next thing to be considered is a maxim generally laid down by all authors on this subject namely that simplicity of food is more conducive to health than a variety but experience teaches us the contrary milk as we before observed which affords great nourishment is a mixture of three nutritive substances and we may venture to affirm that if an alderman was to eat as much of beefstakes as he does of other things at a cityfeast he would bring on sickness and vomiting put variety of grain before a hen and she will eat of that she likes best but before the day is out she will eat of the other instinct leads her to this as most conducive to her health  almost all food contains oil and the stomach can better bear a variety of this oil than a quantity of one particular sort besides animal and vegetable food correct the ill qualities of one another animal food corrects the flatulency of vegetable and vegetable food the putrescency of animal indeed a mixture of some foods will disagree as fish and milk fish coagulating milk too firmly for easy digestion but there is no rule without an exception  the mischief of variety of food is its tempting us to eat too much but if we avoid eating too much variety is best provided that variety consists of things easy of digestion  but the most singular and curious circumstance with respect to food is this the powers of digestion are adapted to the want of blood in the blood vessels if they are not sufficiently full for the purposes of health the appetite is great digestion is strong and much blood is formed but if they are full enough there is no appetite digestion is weak and no blood is formed for let a man swallow as much food as he can without an appetite though he is able to digest it it will not be converted into blood so watchful is nature of her health  eating too much food in general for a length of time does harm it weakens the organs of digestion debilitates the constitution and wears it out hence arise gout apoplexy and all the diseases attendant on old age in disease men eating too much never escape with impunity  we shall now proceed to the properties of the different kinds of animal food there are two substances in meat capable of nourishing mucilage and expressed oil  animal mucilages differ much from one another but considered as food they do not the only difference of consequence is as far as depends upon their texture when the fibers of an animal are large they are not easily dissolved of course they are difficult of digestion beef is on this account more difficult of digestion than mutton the fibers of the one being larger than those of the other on the same principles when food is coagulated firmly it is also difficult of digestion the firmer the coagulum that is the less fluid it contains the more difficult it will be of digestion animal food whose fibers have but little fluid between them that is dry meat is more indigestible than moist thus lean animals are harder of digestion than fat ones and the lean part of fat meat is easier of digestion than the lean part of lean meat by the same way of reasoning meat roasted or boiled a great deal is not so digestible as when roasted or boiled but little for when the fluids are expelled by heat the fibers approach closer to each other and when in the stomach will not admit the juice of the stomach so readily to penetrate it consequently fermentation will not take place so soon  the readier animal food dissolves in water the more digestible it is a flounder boiled in an equal quantity of water is sooner dissolved than mutton therefore flounders are easier of digestion than mutton the juice of the stomach being little else than warm water helped by fermentation but fish though readily soluble in water has a property in it that renders it indigestible which is a certain glarinels or viscidity but when the stomach is strong enough to digest it it is easier of digestion than either flesh or fowl  meat apt to putrify is sooner digested than such as is not pidgeon will putrify sooner than duck of course pidgeon is easier of digestion than duck now as the fluids in animal food tend to hasten putrefaction by depriving it of those fluids by long boiling or roasting we render it harder of digestion by boiling meat till it be free from gravy we can keep it from corrupting for six months a further proof that meat much dressed is less wholesome than such as is little dressed such meats however as putrify the soonest are injurious to weak stomachs as this putrescency stimulates during the time of digestion  it is with a view of rendering meat easier of digestion that we keep it some time after it is killed before we eat it as soon as meat is killed it begins to putrify and putrefaction is the most effectual breaker down of animal substance and a great assistant to solution which is the immediate forerunner of digestion but the length of time meat ought to be kept should be proportioned to its tendency to putrify and the heat of the weather it is eaten for example much sooner in summer than in winter  but the property in which meats differ most is their viscidity or glariness such as are viscid adhere to the sides of the stomach and stimulate much in quadrupeds young animals have this property such as veal pig fawn and lamb but in a smaller degree young birds have the same bad property and all fish in a great degree particularly shellfish which on this account have often proved poisonous and fatal to many when these have proved fatal it has been ascribed to the copper vessel in which they were dressed but a little observation would show the contrary when persons lose their lives by the ill effects of copper sickness vomiting and purging take place but when poisoned by shellfish the head swells the breast is oppressed and stupor is the consequence  animal food dissolved in water forms a gelatinous solution or jelly which is of a viscid nature and in some degree produces the same effect as viscid foods it stimulates but does not yield much nourishment at the same time it is difficult of digestion and of course improper to be taken by diseased or weak stomachs jellies though long prescribed to strengthen the system after a fever have lately been found prejudicial and the use of them are therefore exploded  essential oils inherent in some animal food render it difficult of digestion the essential oils of vegetables are often agreeable to the stomach and stimulate it so as to forward digestion but those of animal food though agreeable to the taste are injurious pork geese ducks salmon etc contain much of this oil and are of course highflavoured they may be agreeable to the taste of strong stomachs but if eaten in too great quantities or if the stomach be too weak they will disagree with it and have the same effect with viscidity that is they will stimulate the system and sometimes bring on a fever animal food then that is viscid that contains much essential oil or will not readily dissolve is apt to remain too long in the stomach and do harm but that which will readily putrify and dissolve is retained but a short time in the stomach and is of course easily digested for digestion depending on the contraction of the stomach if the stomach be so disordered as to lose any of its contractile powers either by the oil or viscidity of the food the food will be retained too long in it  we seldom use animal food without some preparation those preparations are either exposing them to such heat as will coagulate the solids and fluids or after such coagulation dissolving them in water by coagulating any animal solid we take off that viscidity which almost all have when raw and the stomach consequently bears it much better thus we can digest twice the quantity of oysters roasted that we can raw  in coagulating animal substances by heat we often expose them to great fire as in roasting which coagulates the outer parts forming a crust as it were round the inward fluids and retaining them this gives them an empyreumatic oil offensive to the smell in boiling we avoid this empyreumatic but then we take out the essential oil in frying we retain both oils so that fried meat is more difficult of digestion than either roasted or boiled  chicken partridges veal etc are more wholesome when roasted than boiled mutton beef pork etc are easier digested when boiled  all quadrupeds that feed on vegetables are used somewhere or other for food such as the ox the sheep the deer the goat the hog the hare etc in some countries horses are eaten in others squirrels rats and mice animals that live on animal food alone are seldom eaten as the lion the cat the tiger etc few make use of dogs or any animals of that class those who do feed them on vegetables such animals as live on animal food alone being on account of their putrescency and of the great quantity of essential oil contained in them both disagreeable o the stomach and difficult of digestion  birds also are made use of for food except birds of prey that is such as live on other birds and we except them for the same reasons that we do beasts of prey we prefer such as live on insects to such as feed on fish because they are tenderer such as live on fish acquiring a toughness  all fish have been eaten and all shellfish which have sufficient muscular flesh to render them worth eating  those birds that are not very putrescent in their nature and are most free from essential oil are the easiest of digestion as for example moorgame poultry partridges pheasants etc and of quadrupeds the deer the sheep the ox etc the older animals of this class are easier of digestion than the young ones mutton for instance is easier of digestion than lamb beef than veal venison than fawn and that on account of the viscidity of the flesh of young animals fish is more difficult of digestion than flesh especially in weak stomachs and of fish those that have least flavor that is such as have least essential oil in them are white and have some degree of firmness will digest much sooner than such as are of stronger flavor flounders whitings etc are easier of digestion than salmon foals etc  but still quadrupeds afford more nourishment than either birds or fish and those animals of stronger flavor viz pork geese duck salmon etc afford more nourishment and are fitter for such as labor or take a great deal of exercise than animals of the same class that are easier of digestion  now to correct the ill qualities of the different kind of food and to assist digestion we make use of a variety of things such as are called the decoraments of the table which in themselves afford little or no nourishment these are spices acids salt oil and sugar  spices act as stimulants it must here be recollected that digestion depends upon the contracting power of the stomach it being that which prevents the food turning acid or putrid now if the action of the stomach be weak that is not sufficiently powerful food will not be properly digested  spices then are powerful stimulants that is they increase the action of the stomach and are agreeable to it such as the aromatic spices viz cinnamon cloves nutmeg mace pimento etc which are the produce of the warmer climates but they are at the same time inflammatory tending to increase the circulation of the blood and bring on fever we use mustard onions horseraddish etc for the same purpose these stimulate universally but are not inflammatory because their powers do not continue long whereas spices stimulate for a considerable length of time mint thyme sage etc parsley fennel celery etc are stimulants but not so powerful as mustard onions etc nor are they inflammatory  spices seem adapted to different climates and different stomachs in warm climates and weak stomachs spices are more wholesome than in colder climates and stronger stomachs in warm climates the heat of the atmosphere upon the skin keeps up constant great circulation there the internal blood vessels are of course empty and the interior parts consequently weaker viz the stomach etc it requires therefore more powerful stimulants to assist digestion and the natural weakness of the stomach prevents their inflammatory power hence we may observe that spices are more wholesome in summer than in winter and that persons of luxurious life who live without exercise whose stomachs are of course weakened and impaired may eat them with greater safety than such as are strong laborious and healthful  in colder climates and with temperate livers the stomach is naturally strong very little stimulants therefore are required inflammatory ones must of course do mischief if any then are used it should be those of the second class viz mustard onions horseraddish etc nature seems here to have provided for herself for we find spices only in warm countries none grow naturally in cold ones but the second class are principally natives of cold climates if any of the spices are made to grow in a cold climate part of their stimulus is lost and if the second class of stimulants are made to grow in a warm climate it is the same pepper grown here loses its stimulating powers and an onion grown in spain is not so strong as one the produce of england they seem destined then for particular climates in hot countries therefore spices are necessary but in colder ones they are prejudicial if the stomach then be weak which in time will disorder the system it may be proper to use spices but if not weak on no account to use them for they have sometimes done so much harm as totally to destroy digestion unless great quantities have been constantly thrown in with the food  a little spice used with the more flatulent vegetables is frequently serviceable as by increasing the action of the stomach it brings on digestion before that fermentation takes place which in weak stomachs would be attended with extrication of air thus we use pepper with greens peace etc to correct what is called their windiness and we use pepper with broth to coagulate the fluid more firmly and correct its putrescency both which are brought about by the action of the stomach lemonjuice barley etc is often added to both for the same purpose so we eat mustard with salted pork and beef salted fish etc in order to assist digestion by increasing the action of the stomach salted provisions being being more difficult of digestion than such as are fresh  the second class of substances to assist digestion are acids none but the native vegetable acid viz the juice of four fruits is capable of affording nourishment nor would this if pure it is owing to the mucilage mixed with it that it nourishes acids then offist digestion merely  acids produce many effects in the first place they stimulate the glands of the stomach creating by their stimulus that sensation we call hunger digestion being considerably affected by the appetite if there is no appetite though the stomach be strong there will be no digestion we frequently then employ acids a little before meals to create an appetite thus in hot countries where owing to an increased circulation of the skin the internal circulation is diminished and of course the stomach weakened the inhabitants accustom themselves to the drinking of beverage or lemonade before dinner to increase their appetite  acids also promote secretion of the glands of the stomach so as to supply the food with a watery menstruum that is fluid proper and sufficient to promote fermentation  they act also as sedatives or quieters of the rest of the system taking off that stimulus occasioned by digestion hence they are beneficial in warm climates and in weather where the heat naturally stimulates the system and that stimulus is liable to be increased by digestion hence as was said before fruit is exceeding wholesome in the summer and at certain times if taken in moderate quantities  acids tend likewise to coagulate animal solids and fluids and assisted by the coagulating fluids of the stomach they take off the viscidity of food thus we use lemon or vinegar with fish particularly shellfish indeed shellfish should never be eaten without some acid they being as was before observed in their nature so remarkably viscid and of course so prejudicial to the constitution it is for the same reason that we use acids with veal lamb and all young animals namely to correct their viscidity of all acids vinegar provided we attend to its quality is the safest  acids check also vinous and acetous fermentation that is such fermentation as should by no means take place in the stomach it is for this reason we use them with substances of loose texture that are apt to turn sour in the stomach and become flatulent or windy thus we eat vinegar with sallad and greens of all sorts so in all weak stomachs where food is apt to turn sour and cause heartburn the use of acids has been found to correct and take it off it is on this account that fruit has been introduced after meals acids then are useful for many purposes in digestion but taken in too great quantities they are hurtful as they will produce a disposition to flatulency pain and weakness in the stomach and bowels which is afterward cured with difficulty  the next substance in general use with food is salt which affords no kind of nourishment neither will it digest but passes through the body without any change it is however universally used where it can be got nay all animals prefer food that is saltish to such as is not this general instinct we should suppose would not be given but to some purpose yet it is difficult to say of what use salt is in digestion it stimulates the glands of the stomach and promotes secretion of the watery menstruum but of what other use it is we know not  we often preserve food with salt and thus preserved it is considerably more difficult of digestion the fibers are hardened they are not so readily dissolved and they go through the proper fermentation of the stomach with difficulty thus it is that we cannot live so long on salted provision as on fresh for as was before observed the salt does not penetrate thoroughly into all parts of the meat therefore when in the stomach before fermentation takes place in the outer parts the inner will putrify and by infecting the fluids of the body bring on the scurvy as we see it does in persons upon a long voyage and yet salt may be used in the greatest quantity so as to prevent putrefaction of food without rendering it totally unfit for nourishment  oil is another substance that may be used to help digestion it taking off the viscidity of food hence it is that we eat salad with which oil has been mixed with the meat of young animals as with veal lamb etc and with some kinds of fish which from its glariness tends much to disturb digestion oil also takes off the disposition in loose vegetables to ferment improperly and thus prevents flatulency it is for this reason we use it with sallads greens etc but oil in weak stomachs disposed to acidity is apt to produce sourness in the stomach and bring on heartburn sickness vomiting and purging why it should have these contrary effects we cannot say but experience shows it to be true  sugar is another assistant of digestion by preventing the bad effects of some food and affords considerable nourishment in itself a diluted solution ferments more readily than a more centrated one that is the more water you put to sugar provided you exceed not certain bounds the more readily it ferments sugar mixed with a certain quantity of water presently becomes vinegar now the looser vegetables and fruits such as salad currants cherries etc contain in them a more diluted solution of sugar than the firmer vegetables or the sweeter fruits it is on this account that we frequently eat sugar with them another reason why we eat sugar with such vegetables is to take off the acesency and flatulency which they are apt to run soon into by rendering them more difficult to ferment sugar also corrects the putrescency of animal food but not so much as vegetables do for this purpose it was much used in england before kitchengardens became general  it is not above   0 years since greens and other vegetables were imported from holland a kitchengarden being then a great curiosity salted meat at that time was much eaten and the seascurvy very general persons were then accustomed to eat sugared mutton and sugared ham at present the custom is not so much abolished but that we eat sweet sauces with various kinds of food  sugar has been said to spoil the teeth this observation may in some cases be just as where the teeth may have a more than ordinary degree of sensibility or it may perhaps by sticking about them and turning acid corrode them but faults of this kind are oftener imputed to it than it deserves the finer the sugar the purer and less noxious it is preserves are far from unwholesome  and pickles may be considered as spunges filled with vinegar  having thus entered into the several properties of eatables let us now proceed to drinks  water is necessary to digestion and nourishment for there are salts constantly forming in the blood besides such as are thrown into it by the stomach whoever has accidentally tasted their own blood will be convinced of this by its saline taste there is always also a small part of the blood in some degree putrefying now if these salts and this putrescency were accumulated to any great degree it would prove fatal water then is necessary to wash away these salts and this putrescency besides the saliva and natural juice of the stomach is not sufficient of themselves to dissolve the aliment and carry on fermentation water then is a great assistant but pure water is not so proper for either of these purposes for water will run off too soon that is it will not remain mixed with the food long enough to go through fermentation with it neither will it alone carry off the putrescent or saline substance in the blood mixing mucilaginous matter with it as in wine beer cider etc enables it to answer these purposes thus we see the saliva or spittle which nature provides is a viscid fluid or a mucilaginous one  wine being in a state of fermentation itself tends to forward fermentation in the stomach for any substance going through one fermentation generally forwards fermentation in another accordingly we find persons accustomed to drink weak wine cannot digest their food with water alone but will have eruptions on the skin during the time that their meat is in their stomach besides wine is as necessary to a weak stomach as spices for if it be not too strong nor taken in too great quantities it stimulates the stomach makes it contract freer and thus forwards digestion in warm climates the inhabitants could not preserve their health without it the heat of the weather keeping up such a circulation of the blood on the surface of the body as to weaken the internal parts and render digestion difficult accordingly we find that nature has provided them amply with the means of procuring wine hence it follows that a glass of wine occasionally taken in summer is more beneficial than one drank in winter as the one helps digestion while the other tends to destroy it  was man to live the life of a savage water would be a sufficient drink as eating only a small quantity and using great exercise his digestive organs would be much stronger and sufficient for digestion without any other assistance but according to his present method of living eating daily too much and taking little exercise he requires wine however the wine should be diluted with water for was it to intoxicate to any degree it would overthrow the design for which it was taken prevent the stomach from eating sufficiently and interrupt digestion going on by wine here we mean all vinous liquors as wine cider ale small beer etc  if we drink pure water it will find its way out of the body by urine or sweat without carrying any of the saline or putrescent parts of the blood with it but if we use mucilaginous fluids as wine beer etc they remain some time in the blood mix with the saline and putrescent substances of it and gradually carry them off water then is the necessary drink but it is much helped by brewing that is wine beer etc if moderately taken as we have mentioned is the best liquor we can use  having said so much upon the nature of digestion and the property of food in general let us run over them again a little more particularly and first let us speak of fruits  stonefruits in general are of a soft lax texture and their juices dilute by which means they are easily dissolved in the stomach it is for this reason they are apt to be eaten in large quantities hence as they are more liable to fermentation than any other and produce a copious acid they are apt to irritate the intestines and bring on purging and vomiting apricots and peaches are less noxious than either the cherry or the plumb being sweeter and richer the later fruit is in general the richest  apples and pears being of a firmer texture and containing a less active acid are not so liable to a noxious fermentation as the stonefruits and will continue longer in the stomach and of these pears are more wholesome than apples for the pear being specifically heavier than water will sink to the bottom of the stomach and be sooner digested while apples swimming near the top will elude the action of the intestines and by irritating the left orifice of the stomach will often produce uneasy symptoms  strawberries and rasberries are of a very tender texture therefore easily dissolved passing off before a very active fermentation can take place which is likewise prevented by their sweetness on all these accounts they are very innocent  currants are an acid fruit have very little sweetness of course very little nourishment and are liable to all the bad qualities of stonefruits  goosberries are much sweeter more nourishing and more innocent and without the husks are very easily digested and on account of their sweetness less subject to active fermentation  grapes are a richer fruit containing a great quantity of sugar on which account they are more nutritive than any we have mentioned and if eaten when perfectly ripe and in moderation are innocent  when we apply heat to these fruits that is when we bake or boil them we change their qualities dissipate their active acid and dispose them less to ferment hence universally baked or boiled fruits are safer than fresh it is to destroy their disposition to fermentation that we frequently eat them with milk or cream whose oily nature produces that effect wine is also used to obviate the bad effects of fruit but this depends upon its spirituous part and therefore pure spirit were it not otherwise noxious would be most eligible if wine be used it should be strong and mellow another method of using them is with sugar this surely renders fruit more nutritive and to sour fruits must be a judicious addition sometimes we use oily matters as butter in applepye this from its antifermentative quality is a proper addition but in weak stomachs is apt to produce heartburn etc it is safer to eat the mild fruit before meals the the sour fruits after  we come next to the herbs beet and spinnage are watery and insipid they contain but little sugar or mucilaginous matter and of course afford but little nourishment on account of their little acidity and loose texture they are less flatulent than some of the other herbs  dandelion endive lettuce are all of them milky plants and it is almost a universal rule that those which afford a milky juice are remarkably acrid and many of them poisonous but these i have mentioned have been excepted however they are all opiates in some measure when old for this reason we only use them when very young and we blanch them to free them of their acrimony which is done by tying them up and thus depriving them of light they are flatulent and as such should be never eaten without pepper or something to answer the same purpose  cellery contains a poisonous acrimony on which account it is blanched for use though it is never wholly deprived of its acrimony in this way boiling does it more effectually and gives it a mucilaginous sweetness consequently it is most wholesome in broths and that in the summer when the stomach can bear stimulating most  asparagus is only wholesome when in an intermediate state between root and plant when old it is remarkably acrid but when young it is sweet and mucilaginous  artichokes if young and boiled are of a tender texture easily digested and not flatulent they are sweet and of course remarkably nutritious  mushrooms are very nutritive and much a kin to animal food that is they resemble meat in their properties and as such may be eaten by strong persons in considerable quantity the morelle and trusle are of this kind but on account of their stimulating powers are more used as a fashionable ornament to our dishes than as any proper food  the next to be considered are our esculent roots the raddish as being so acrid is used only as sallad or after meals to help digestion it is most wholesome when scraped the turnep is at best when deprived of its acrid skin but a watery weak nutriment very flatulent or windy and if eaten in great quantities will purge  the carrot and parsnip from the sweet mucilaginous matter contained in them are very nourishing but the carrot more than the parsnip as containing the greatest quantity of the two  the leek the onion and the garlic are in their recent state acrid but innocent when by age or climate this acrimony is too great we do not use them as food when boiled this acrimony is destroyed and a remarkable mild substance remains very nutritious especially to those who can digest them raw  but of all the culinary herbs potatoes are the best they containing a kind of flour are on that account very nourishing and less flatulent than any consequently very wholesome the more mealy they are the better  the next in order are peace beans french beans etc they contain a degree of oil and sugar mixed consequently afford pure and strong nourishment as appear from experiments made on domestic animals viz hogs etc but as they are of firm texture and not easily digested their use in food should be confined to the hardy and robust they are more flatulent than most vegetables therefore improper aliment for weak stomachs when eaten young before they come to be ripe they are indeed less flatulent on account of their not having attained the oil they afterward gain but then their nutriment is proportionably diminished french beans being eaten in their cod are not so flatulent as the other two and peace either ripe or not being of a more tender and soluble texture than beans are not so often eaten the pea is used for culinary purposes as puddings etc etc  so much for vegetable food let us now consider the particular sorts of animal and first with respect to beef and veal were we purely to consider tenderness of texture the youngest animals certainly would be always preferred but when we talk of them as nourishing food beef is for the reasons i have mentioned more nutritive than veal for when an animal is very young we commonly have an aversion to it the whole of it then is as it were a semifluid mass which we cannot take in sufficient quantity and which from its watery consistence must be but little nutritious it is the same with respect to mutton and lamb venison and fawn pork and pig etc mutton has commonly been preferred to all the fleshes of quadrupeds and indeed besides its being more perfect has the advantage over them of being more generally suited to different climates beef requires a very nice intermediate state rich pastures and temperate air which it seems to enjoy chiefly in this country whereas sheep can be brought to almost the same perfection in the bleak northern as in these mild southern countries  hare being an animal much exercised acquires a firmness of fibers and is difficult of digestion and when killed after a long chase when much of the oil of the body is absorbed its muscular parts are much firmer and tougher than when killed in the seat the rabbit being of very little exercise is one of the white meats without viscidity and is one of the lightest and most digestible foods in use  with respect to the hog it being the only domestic animal we know of no use to men when alive is therefore properly designed for food besides as loathsome and ugly to every human eye it is killed without reluctance pork is of very tender structure increased perhaps from a peculiarity in its nature viz taking in fat more readily than any other animal pork is a white meat even in its adult state and then gives out a jelly in very great quantity and on account of its tenderness etc is very nutritious  the next class of animal food is that of birds of which there are several kinds the cock hen chicken and capon are entirely domestic there being no country in which they are found wild they take little exercise and live mostly on vegetables hence they are food of a tender structure easy of digestion and as a white meat gelatinous when very young they are extremely viscid when old tough and ligamentous so that the proper time of using them is in a middle state between these two extremes that is when about a year old such as eat them younger eat them when unwholesome now a barndoor fowl is far preferable to one that is crammed as exercise is necessary to give perfection for by this means the fat of the animal is equally dispersed through the muscular parts whereas when the bird is fatted hastily the fat is accumulated in particular parts  turkies are of the same kind with the cock hen etc equally tender and equally easy of digestion with respect to wild fowl such as the pheasant the grouse the partridge and the quail they approach in their nature to the tame fowl but are of a higher flavor are more tender and rather easier of digestion  we come next to waterfowl of these the duck both wild and tame contains a great deal of essential oil and will not so readily digest in the stomach however the wild duck from its being much exercised being generally carnivorous is more soluble than the tame duck and of course easier digested the tame goose is manifestly less viscid than the duck but is of a firmer texture digestion with regard to this bird is not so constant it depending on the disposition of the stomach but the teal though much of the nature of the wild duck is the most tender and savoury the least viscid and the most wholesome of this kind  the next class of aquatics are the woodcock snipe the gray and green plover etc of which the woodcock and snipe although they live chiefly on infects are of a tender structure approaching to the white meats of the cock and hen  i have given the reader to understand that exercise produces firmness an opportunity now offers to illustrate it the woodcock is obliged to fly much about while the partridge walks more and flies less hence it is observed that the wing of the woodcock is always very tough while that of the partridge is very tender and on the contrary the leg of the woodcock is very tender while that of the partridge is very tough hence the old doggrel distich if the partridge had but the woodcocks thigh he would be the best bird that ever does fly   with respect to pigeons another class of birds they are in their nature hot and alkalescent that is very much disposed to active fermentation in the stomach and perhaps more so than any other bird of this kind that lives on grain we attribute this to much exercise when young they are tender and easily digested as to smaller birds viz the lark the thrush etc there is probably a difference according to their exercise and food but it will be sufficient to say that when taken at a proper age they are tender juicy and wholesome  we have a good opportunity here to mention eggs it is obvious from their nature and use in the nourishment of the foetus that they contain a larger proportion of pure nutriment than any other food notwithstanding this eggs are not of easy digestion and from the proportion of nourishment they afford cannot be eaten in any large quantity  we will now proceed to fish but first let us mention the turtle an amphibious animal now become a great delicacy from some particulars in its economy from its little motion and its living on vegetables it is of a very gelatinous nature and highly nutritious  the texture of fish in general is more tender than that of flesh they have nothing of a fibrous structure like flesh of course they are easier digested than meat especially such as are not of a viscid nature we have had occasion to say something on the different kinds of fish before as indeed we have on most sorts of food but as it is a matter in which mankind are highly concerned it may not be unnecessary to be a little more particular  those of the salmon kind as the seasalmon the rivertrout the smelt the charr etc are of a tender substance sufficiently juicy and nourishing but like other fish they are heating and apt to breed humors in the skin the salmontrout is undoubtedly more stimulating and less gelatinous than those of the white kind  the next class such as the barbel the carp the gudgeon the tench the chubb the roach the bleak and the bream is drier and less tendinous less strong and heating and of a nature less gelatinous the perch is something of this kind of a firm texture but tender substance easily digested neither glutinous heating or remarkably stimulant  the next class is seafish and that of the whiting the haddock and the cod these give a gradation in tenderness glutinosity and stimulus to the whole system the cod being the firmest most viscid and most heating of the three  the lump is a remarkable viscid fish approaching in quality to the eel and exceedingly nutritious to those who use it the mackerel is of drier substance and less nutritious the mullet is between the carp and the haddock less dry than the one and more juicy than the other the pike though rapacious and carnivorous is dry and in some degree oily and one of the least heating of any we take in  another class is that of the herring the sprat the anchovy and the shad which are of an oily juicy nutritious nature in their heating quality next to the salmon stimulating the system and quickening the pulse to a considerable degree  the next class is that of the flounder kind viz the common flounder the soal the plaise the turbot and the holibut these are all of a tender oily juicy nature more viscid than the preceding class but less so than the following they are set down according to their qualities the flounder and soal more tender the turbot and holibut more viscid  the last is the eel kind as the sandeel the common eel the congereel etc these are of the same quality with the viper viscid nutritious and difficultly perspirable by long retention in the stomach heating and oppressive  with respect to the crab the shrimp and the lobster they come under the name of insects they are of a nature that if boiled will give a jellied broth and are apt to stimulate the system very much producing heat anxiety and fever as to oysters they are nutritious and though long retained in the stomach as little heating to the system as any the muscle they say is poisonous but where the poison resides we cannot tell the ill effects sometimes on eating them must proceed from their viscidity  upon the whole we beg it may be understood that what has been said respecting foods holds good only in general difference of constitution will produce different effects thus according to the old adage what is one mans meat may be another mans poison if persons are so rash as to determine the quality of any particular food to be good because it agrees with them it is in vain saying any thing to them upon the subject what is wholesome today may be be injurious to morrow and though at present they find no ill effects from the use of certain things they may lay the foundation of diseases and unhappily experience them later in life  but before we dismiss this subject we must take notice of the use of coffee and tea much dispute has arisen about their virtues one would imagine frequent experience would long ago have silenced such disputes their effects are undoubtedly very much mixed depending on the warm water the virtues attributed to them such as assisting digestion relieving the stomach from a load of food from crudities and from headachs arising from them promoting the secretion of urine and perhaps of perspiration may be all fairly attributed to the warm water the same also will have the effect of keeping from sleep tea it is known weakens the tone of the stomach by frequent use debilitates the system in consequence and brings on tremors and convulsions the same effects are not so remarkable in coffee but still experience shows them to be of the same nature coffee contains a great quantity of oil of a binding quality that corrects putrefaction it is found to moderate fermentation in the stomach and to be a powerful quieter of the system that is it will decrease the force and circulation of the blood and take off the quickness and fullness of the pulse or in other words it will often abate a slight fever for this reason it is recommended in a morning for a headache which it will frequently remove so far indeed taken medicinally it may be useful and as it assists digestion one dish may not be injurious to those who sit long after dinner and who have strong constitutions but in delicate habits it often occasions want of sleep tremors and many of those complaints called nervous newmann obtained by distillation from one pound of coffee five ounces five drachms and a half of water six ounces and half a dram of thick foetid oil and four ounces and two drachms of earth in short we may conclude that coffee and tea however their effects be varied by habit or particular constitutions certainly weaken the tone of the system and diminish the force of the nervous power  having now treated fully of the several kinds of food we will next consider the quantity time and order necessary to be observed in taking it for health depends as much upon a proper attention to this as to the food we eat and in this let the palate or inclination be first consulted nature has endowed the stomach with such sensibility that in health if strictly attended to she will in general call or long for that which is proper and reject or loath that which is improper it is this natural longing that has frequently pointed out in disorders food which without the assistance of medicine has often recovered the patient eat then by no means that for common food which you dislike paulo pejor sed suavior cibus and potus meliori at ingrato praeferendus agreeable food though it be rather worse in quality is preferable to that which cloys be it ever so good  in the next place examine your stomach never eat any thing that lies heavy in it or rises in it any thing that is long in passing off or any thing that is flatulent or windy that occasions belchings heart burn gripes or fluxes these being sure symptoms of improper digestion the consequence of which is bad if therefore from a depraved appetite you should long for such food as you experimentally found to disagree with you by no means indulge it by a resolution to withstand such temptations we may keep off a number of disorders for indigestion is the forerunner of half the diseases we are liable to  another thing to be considered is the choice of food whether such meat as you wish for be in season or not for that which at one time of the year is good may at another be hurtful for example pork during the winter is wholesome but in summer it is not fit to be eaten our taste will guide us in this as much difference as there is in taste between a thing in season and out of season so much is there in the goodness and of course in its wholesomeness  it has been long a custom to keep meat a considerable time before we dress it under a notion of its becoming more tender and easy of digestion they say when putrefaction has begun to take place in meat out of the body it will the sooner break down in the body this may probably be the case but what it acquires in tenderness it loses in its nutritive quality it is not sufficient that your meat does not stink the spirituous part of it must be preserved that which gives lively and pure nourishment meat therefore long kept is not so wholesome as that which is fresh killed with respect to digestion it goes on sufficiently soon in a healthy stomach whether the meat be tough or tender it is not meant to say that all meats are sufficiently soon digested it has already been shown to the contrary but what is meant is that in meat of the same kind and age it is of no great consequence to the eater in point of firmness whether it be tender from being long kept or tough from being dressed when fresh killed  custom is another thing to be considered in the choice of food what we have been longest used to generally agrees best with us change of diet is apt to cause some alteration therefore when a new diet offers itself as upon change of places and countries we should at first be sparing upon further use we may be bolder nay even with those to whom a change of diet becomes necessary it should be brought about by degrees nulla subita mutatio est bona no sudden change is good  the next thing we should study is the quantity temperance and moderation in eating is natures great preservative plures gula quam gladius  the throat has destroyed more than the sword some are apt to think the more plentifully they eat the better they thrive and the stronger they grow but this is not the case a little well digested will render the body more vigorous than when it is glutted with superfluity most of which is turned to excrementitious not alimentary fluid and must be speedily evacuated or sickness will follow our stomach is the best judge in such cases we should never eat to satiety or fullness but desist with an appetite thus shall we be refreshed light and cheerful not dull heavy or indisposed no certain quantity of food can be prescribed as a general rule what is convenient to one may be too much for another and too little for a third a strong laboring and active person may eat more freely than the weak the studious and sedentary or such as take their ease indeed the active require greater supply by our loading the stomach fermentation is checked and of course digestion impeded for the natural juice of the stomach has not room to exert itself it therefore nauseates its contents and is attended with belchings the spirits are clogged obstructions ensue and fever is the consequence hence arise various ill symptoms and depraved effects throughout the body enervating the strength decaying the senses hastening old age and shortening of life though these bad effects are not instantly perceived yet they are the certain attendants of intemperance for it has been generally observed in great eaters that though from custom a state of youth and a strong constitution they have felt no immediate inconvenience but have digested their food suffered surfeit and bore their immoderate diet well if they have not been unexpectedly cut off they have found the symptoms of old age come on early in life attended with pains and innumerable disorders in winter indeed we may eat more freely than in summer because the stomach is stronger for the reasons i mentioned before the circulation of the blood not being increased by the heat of the weather on the external parts of the body but both in winter and summer we should feed with moderation and if we value our health ever make it a rule to rise from table with an appetite should we ever be tempted to eat too much at one time we should eat the less at another that is if our dinner has been larger than ordinary let our supper be the less or if possible none at all for there is no man however careful of his health that in this matter does not occasionally transgress  the next caution to be mentioned on this subject are the hours of eating let not the common custom of meals invite you to eat except your appetite concur with those times a sufficient distance between hours of eating should be ever observed lest we charge the stomach with a fresh supply before the former be passed away for if any half digested matter remains to be mixed with the next meal it frequently occasions a foul stomach besides the stomach when empty receives the food with delight and will be eager and sharp in digestion and each part as it passes along will perform its office readily and sufficiently however as some stomachs will digest their contents sooner than others and if long empty will naturally draw up from the intestines putrid vapors which will destroy the appetite for how often do we fast till we lose our appetite and greatly disturb the head and animal spirits for the head from the great quantity of nerves spread upon the stomach readily sympathizes with it on these accounts let such as feel a gnawing as it is commonly called within them not wait till the stated hour of meals but eat a little that the stomach may have something to work on hence it appears that there can be no general hour of eating children with craving appetities do and may eat often young persons in health that labor and use much exercise may eat three times a day morning noon and night but to such as are in years such as are weak as do no work use no exercise or lead a sedentary life eating twice in the day is sufficient or persons weak and old may eat often but then it should be but little  if persons confine themselves to two meals a day one had better be a supper than a dinner provided they sup early because during the hours of sleep the body is composed and at rest and at this time receives its greatest nourishment but late suppers are very offensive to the whole frame especially to the head and eyes from the vapors that arise from a loaded stomach our food should be tolerably well digested before we lay down to sleep and this is not well done under two or three hours our ancestors used to sup at six and go to rest at ten hence they could comply with that well known advice after supper walk a mile in order to quicken digestion and dispose the body for rest  we should not eat presently after exercise nor when we are hot but forbear till the spirits are retired and settled neither should we come to meat burdened with care or business for owing to the sympathy between the brain and stomach as was observed by means of the nerve disturbed mind will impede the functions of the stomach it is for this reason we eat in company cheerfully with our friends mirth and good company are great helps to a dull stomach creators of appetite and forwarders of digestion and it is for this reason lively music has been introduced at feasts  we should take care also to chew our meat well for the saliva with which we thus mix it is a great help to digestion besides in breaking it down with the teeth we save the stomach the trouble to eat greedily therefore and swallow our meat hastily is not only indecent but hurtful with respect to drinking at meals we should do it little and often especially if our food be dry and solid great draughts cause fluctuation and disturb fermentation  thus having gone through the several properties of the various kinds of food and shown how far they are wholesome or not and how far they agree or disagree with different constitutions in order to complete this treatise upon health we should proceed to consider the articles of exercise temperance rest sleep etc on each of which a great deal may be said but as that would swell these pages to a size that might probably deter the reader from a perusal of them it
