principles of judicial procedure with the outlines of a procedure code by jeremy bentham   note by the editor the subject of judicial procedure was a very favourite one with the author and one to which he was continually in the habit of recurring for more than thirty years the consequence was an immense mass of mss on this subject extending to several thousands of pages was found at his decease very many of the chapters were written over and over again each of them varying in some particulars and all of them were more or less in an unfinished state in preparing these mss for publication the principal object throughout has been as far as possible to present the text in the very words of the author the arrangement i am fully aware is not so logical as it ought to have been or as it would have been if the author had lived to finish the work the difficulty was occasioned by this circumstance in some chapters which in strictness ought to have followed others allusions were made to the contents of those others as if they were already known to the reader and therefore they would not have been so readily understood unless they had been made to follow without making greater alterations in the text than i felt myself justified in doing the plan pursued with respect to those chapters which treated of the same topic has been to incorporate the separate matter of each into one and cancel the rest although much has been done in this way and also in cancelling other repetitions yet i fear some still remain which should have been omitted if this be found to be the case the only apology i can offer is that in a task of this responsible nature i considered i should be erring on the safer side by retaining too much rather than too little by far the greater portion of the work was written between the years    0 and      both inclusive parts of the introduction and the first chapter were written so long ago as   0  and may be distinguished by the style in order fully to appreciate the merits of the arrangements here proposed reference must be made to all that concerns the judicial establishments and the minister of justice in the constitutional code the authors great work on evidence should also be consulted in the appendix will be seen the commencement of an initial sketch of procedure which was written under circumstances somewhat interesting in the autumn of      the author visited paris for the benefit of his health on his return he was detained at boulogne by a contrary wind for nearly a fortnight and there at the end of that time this sketch was written it was the first thing written by the author for nearly three months during which his indisposition continued the paper on account taking judicatories was intended by the author to be attached to the procedure code although it partly belongs to the constitutional code two very instructive communications follow on judicial matters in the east indies one is from sir alexander johnston the distinguished chiefjustice of the island of ceylon the other from a highly valued friend of the author who is now in india i have not therefore been able to ask his permission to publish his name richard donne london  0th december            preface of the present publication the particular object is the preserving the country from being saddled by institutions which under the profession sincere or insincere of contributing to the formation of an appropriate code of procedure will have the effect rather of retarding or even preventing it and at the same time adding to expense by which no fruit in the shape of benefit will be produced a procedure code fit to be invested with the form of law could not be prepared otherwise than by and with reference to the codes of law penal and nonpenal to which it has for its object and purpose the giving execution and effect the present production instead of following precedes both these codes if applicable in other respects it will not be found on that account inapplicable to its intended purpose with regard to prospect of success the sense of the public mind may as well be taken by this uncompleted and provisional publication as by a completed work the characteristic features and fundamental principles—all will be seen brought to view only in respect of matters of detail will there be anything to add to defalcate or to substitute as of the plan here proposed with its supposed features of aptitude so of the system at present in force with its supposed features of inaptitude on this occasion i shall be found i hope to have rendered sufficiently apparent the complete inaptitude of the established system with reference to its professed purpose and thence the absolute and indispensible necessity of a code entirely new from beginning to end this supposing it done will be no small thing done what is more here is much which in the character of a proposed code all persons who feel inclined may take in hand and take for the subject of consideration and publication and by this means towards ultimate success so much advance will have been made it might perhaps not be a great deal too much to say of it that in its present state it might form a warrant for the appointment of a committee of the house of commons and the consideration of it the subjectmatter of a portion of the labours of such a committee and while the committee was occupying itself in the requisite labour on its several points including what regards the judiciary establishment which is already in print i shall if alive be occupied according to the measure of my ability in making such amendments as i find a demand for the reason for this hurrying is the fear of seeing real improvement obstructed and even improbabilized by the creation of new offices with enormous salaries attached to them let me ask how many centuries would it take to remove the already generallyacknowledged abuses at the rate of progress at which the operation has been and is performing by the recent statutes no objection however to these in the road to reform every inch made is better than none introduction by procedure is meant the course taken for the execution of the laws viz for the accomplishment of the will declared or supposed to be declared by them in each instance laws prescribing the course of procedure have on a former occasion been characterized by the term adjective laws in contradistinction to those other laws the execution of which they have in view and which for this same purpose have been characterized by the correspondent opposite term substantive laws   for in jurisprudence the laws termed adjective can no more exist without the laws termed substantive than in grammar a noun termed adjective can present a distinct idea without the help of a noun of the substantive class conjoined with it as in fact every act by which a course of procedure is commenced has for its end or object the bringing about the execution of some law of the substantive class so in point of utility it may be said that the course of procedure ought to have in every instance for its main and primary end at least the accomplishment of the will manifested in the body of substantive laws for this is not only a use of it but the only use for it the ultimate utility of it will therefore depend altogether upon the utility of the substantive laws the execution of which is in eachinstance endeavoured to be brought about unless the substantive law be conformable to the greatest happiness of the community the use made of the body of adjective laws on that occasion cannot be conformable to that same end but though this may with truth be given as the main and primary end of the course of procedure it cannot however be given as the sole end because in the pursuit of that same end a variety of inconveniences are apt to occur and indeed in a certain degree cannot several of them but occur—in every instance hence result as so many collateral or subordinate ends the avoiding as far as possible the giving birth to those several inconveniences the code of procedure then is composed of the system or assemblage of adjective laws of the substantive branch of the law the only defensible object or end in view is the maximization of the happiness of the greatest number of the members of the community in question of the adjective branch of the law the only defensible object or say end in view is the maximization of the execution and effect given to the substantive branch of the law the present proposed code is composed of an aggregate of arrangements having the above for their object or end in view of every extensive body of law the end mainly at least if not exclusively in view has been the greatest happiness of those by whom the body of law in question was made consistently with the nature of man and the preservation of his species no other could any extensive body of law have had for its end in view for proof of this position see the constitutional code in a representative democracy if rightly constituted the possessors of the constitutive or supreme authority are the aggregate body of the members fitted for selfgovernment and the possessors of the legislative authority are their delegates and would represent their interests in the case of an aristocracy the interests of the members of the aristocracy or the majority of them would prevail and in the case of a monarchy the interest of the monarch in a mixed monarchy composed of the monarch and the aristocracy it would be the conjunct interest of the monarch and the members of that same aristocracy that is to say of the majority of those who act on the theatre of legislation in the case of a mixed monarchy composed of the monarch the aristocracy and the delegates or say deputies of the people the conjunct interests of those same three authorities thus much as to substantive law but in the case of adjective law or say procedure law to a greater or lesser extent the law has had for its authors in proportions infinitely diversified legislative authority in its several modification and the judicial authority—in a word the judges who under the notion of interpreting where in fact there was nothing to be interpreted—have been suffered in effect to legislate the consequence is that in correspondent proportions this branch of the law has had for its object or end in view the interest of this class of the functionaries concerned in the making of it but more especially in the mode in which their remuneration has commonly been allotted to them is their interest in a state of diametrical opposition to the interest of those for whose benefit the laws are everywhere professed to have been made by the author of these pages no share in that profit was ever aimed at or desired nor at present could by possibility be received his interest is therefore in the state of the greatest possible harmony with what he has made his duty and accordingly wheresoever it may have happened to him to have erred the error will have had a deficiency not in moral but in active and intellectual aptitude for its cause among the arguments employed and which since some recent occurrences have been made use of for stopping the progress of improvement and securing against diminution the addition made every year to the number of those who by and for the benefit of lawyers are punished for not knowing what they have been carefully kept under an impossibility of knowing one is—you cannot provide for everything therefore you ought not to provide for anything more than what has been provided for already to understand the force and value of this argument—the aptitude moral and intellectual of those by whom it has been employed—employ it to other branches of art and science without going out of the field of legislation apply it to substantive law apply it   to medicine you cannot cure all diseases—why give yourselves so much trouble in the endeavour to cure any more than you can already for the enactment or say establishment of any law or of any mass of the matter of law—of two species of power—the intellectual and the political—the concurrence or say conjunction is necessary intellectual that of the legislative draughtsman political that of the legislator the political cannot in the most improved state of society be with propriety in hands other in number than a select few in the least improved it has everywhere been of necessity in the hands of a single person but before it comes to be presented to the legislative assembly in the legislation chamber there is another tribunal in which with great advantage to the public every question of law which is invested with a certain degree of importance may be introduced—and that is the publicopinion tribunal for the purpose of introducing into this tribunal a proposed law the right of initiation appertains at once to every person who can find adequate inducement for giving exercise to it in the legislative assembly proposed laws cannot without confusion be taken into consideration and compared together in any considerable numbers but by the publicopinion tribunal they may be subjected to this operation in a number altogether unlimited to introduce or attempt to introduce into the legislative assembly a mass of law of a new complexion before the minds of men were to a certain degree prepared for the reception of it would be lost labour and a hopeless task not so the like attempt in relation to the publicopinion tribunal why set about drawing up a perfect body of laws—that is to say one which to yourself you expect will appear so—why give yourself any such trouble suppose the task of drawing it up accomplished can you seriously expect to see it in that place put to use—can you flatter yourself with any such hopes answer no but to a person who has leisure and who has the means of living while the work is going on that consideration is no sufficient reason for declining the task in the present instance the work must of necessity be the work of many years—say six eight ten years now suppose it a settled rule that no such work shall be begun to be drawn up till a probability of its being immediately taken into consideration in the legislative assembly and ultimately adopted has presented itself—what is the consequence answer that the necessary time in question—the six eight ten years—will be lost the public for that whole length of time deprived of the receipt and enjoyment of this allcomprehensive instrument of felicity oh but this is innovation—oh yes—unquestionably it is innovation but what follows from misery whatever be the shape of it a change to tranquillity is innovation from war whencesoever it comes change to peace is innovation war misery wickedness in every shape—are they then to be perpetuated—all for fear of innovation whoever takes in hand these pages will do well in the first place to lay out of his mind everything that belongs to the existing system baptized the technical he will see there when the time comes nothing but confusion—a purposely and most elaborately organized system of confusion of itself it accordingly explains nothing explanation it requires itself throughout so far from being capable of affording it in the here proposed system styled the natural he will see the course prescribed by common experience and common sense the purpose being to give execution and effect to a system of arrangements and ordinances by elicitation made of the truth of facts the question will always be whether this or that one of the arrangements made or supposed made supposed only in the case of the unwritten law has application to the individual case in question for arriving at the truth the natural course it will be seen is the same in all cases under the technical system the course pursued is different according to the various judicatories employed with their different portions of the field of law logical or geographical assigned to them or occupied by them with corresponding different sets of powers and duties—common law equity law civil law penal law ecclesiastical law admiralty law general sessions law petty sessions law and so on—all differing so widely from one another while pretending to be directed to one and the same object—the discovery of truth in regard to facts by means of evidence all of them good it is impossible they should be all bad it is altogether possible they should be and will accordingly be seen to be all unapt—relation had to such their professed and falsely pretended purpose all good—relation had to their nonprofessed but disguised and endeavouredtobeconcealed purpose—viz the promotion of the particular and sinister interest of the institutors at the expense and by the sacrifice of the universal interest of the proposed system these are the leading features—   expense of litiscontestation defrayed as far as possible by the public   cases of necessity excepted attendance   of parties in their own case not less universal and punctual than that of third persons in the character of witnesses   with ample precaution against abuse necessary expense of evidence and professional assistance provided by the public for those who are not themselves in a condition to defray it   for the verity of whatever statement is made on a judicial occasion or actually or eventually for a judicial purpose effectual provision will be made—and that the same in all cases—by appropriate punishment and without the intervention of any useless ceremony chapter i general view—ends of judicature when the whole body of the law has for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number the whole of the adjective branch taken together may be said to have two specific ends the one positive maximizing the execution and effect given to the substantive branch the other negative minimizing the evil the hardship in various shapes necessary to the accomplishment of the main specified end between these twopursuits the conflict is all pervading and perpetual whatsoever arrangement is taken for the attainment of the one end it can scarcely avoid being in a greater or less degree obstructive to the attainment of the other end if whether it be with a view to compensation merely or to compensation and punishment together measures of adequate strength for securing eventual forthcomingness on the part of the defendant—person and property included—be not taken injured individuals who are or would or should have been prosecutors or say pursuers remain without redress—without indemnity for the past or security for the future if measures of more than adequate strength are taken evildoing defendants not only may be made to suffer more than is necessary but what is worse hardship to an indefinite amount may be made to fall on the heads of men who have not in any way been evildoers and then not only with and by but even without any evil consciousness or evil intention on the pursuers side in this way the judicial establishment how well and faithfully soever the duties of it may be performed may be made the instrument of oppression and even of depredation no intellectual aptitude—no active aptitude—no appropriate knowledge or judgment on the part of the judge—can render him completely secure against so deplorable a result no otherwise than through the medium of such information as comes in his way or is obtainable by him can he ever act or forbear to act if that information is false and by means of its falsity deceptive a wrong judgment is on his part unavoidable on this occasion as on every other the grand security of securities is publicity—exposure—the completest exposure of the whole system of procedure—whatever is done by anybody being done before the eyes of the universal public by this means appropriate moral aptitude may be maximized—appropriate intellectual aptitude may be maximized—appropriate active aptitude may be maximized the greater the tutelary influence exercised over the judge by the public eye the more intense will be the attention on each occasion bestowed by him in the endeavour to obtain adequate knowledge and give maturity and correctness to his judgment as well as quickness to the exercise given on this occasion to his active faculties still however against deception by false assertions and false evidence in other shapes the soundest judgment can never be secure what remains then is to provide what security can without preponderate hardship be provided against falsity uttered by an individual coming in the character of a pursuer with the view to subject to a hardship a defendant on whose part no wrong has had place of the necessity of making arrangements of this sort—of the difficulty that attaches upon the endeavour—no adequate conception can ever have been formed by those whose thoughts have been confined within the bounds of the field occupied by the arrangements taken with this view in any body of law that has ever been in force in every such body of law the expense and vexation attached without distinction to the operation of legal pursuit in every case tend with a force proportioned to the aggregate force of the complicated mass of hardship to the prevention of ungrounded and illgrounded suits such is its tendency and such to a prodigious extent is its effect independently of all intention and desire on the part of those by whom the system was framed or those by whom application is made of the powers established by it to the production of this thus far salutary result not only is no such endeavour or desire necessary but in spite of their most strenuous endeavours to the contrary it could not be prevented from taking place at the same time while without and to an even universallyindefinite extent against any such intention this mass of hardship is in this shape productive of good effects in another shape it is to an unmeasurable extent productive of evil effects it is an instrument   put into the hands of the oppressor—of every oppressor who is rich and wicked enough to purchase the use of it at the hands of those who according to the intention of those by whom it was made continue to reap the profit—an instrument by which under the yoke of onetenth of the population ninetenths are kept in an oppressed state and but for the salutary though scarce perceptible influence of the publicopinion tribunal would be kept in a state of the most abject slavery that on the part of rulers the evil is everywhere the result—not of oversight or deficiency in intellectual aptitude but of purposed intention and endeavour—is matter of demonstration for everywhere not only are the obstacles in question left in full force without any endeavour to remove or lessen them but addition and to a vast amount is made to their force—made too by instruments of their own manufacture—made by them with the manifestlyresulting effect and thence with this unquestionable purpose namely—the creation of lawtaxes and lawfees lawtaxes imposed by the rulers for the increase of their own excessive opulence lawfees which in their legislative capacity they suffer their colleagues and instruments to exact for the increase of their own exorbitant wealth thus amassed by the application of oppression to the purpose of depredation thus then the endeavours of the philanthropist in the law may be expressed by this one problem how to unite the maximization of redress for the injured in the character of pursuers with the minimization of hardship on the innocent in the character of defendants these being the ends the means may be stated as follows—   in so far as necessary under the name of security for eventual justiciability on the plaintiffs side a condition imposed to the obtainment of the judicial services for the alleged purpose of seeking redress for injury   in case of an unjust demand for the prevention of needless and unprofitable vexation and expense such as might otherwise be imposed on individuals in the situation of defendants by individuals placing themselves in the situation of plaintiffs a provision made not only of eventual compensation but also of punishment to be inflicted on those alone in whose instance the existence of blame in one of two shapes has been established these two shapes are—  evil consciousness   temerity or rashness by evil consciousness understand on the part of him by whom a suit is commenced or carried on a consciousness of the injustice of it—of the nonexistence of all adequate ground for it by temerity or rashness understand the absence of that due attention by which if bestowed upon the subject he by whom an unjust suit is commenced would have been rendered conscious of the injustice of it by way of punishment suppose lawtaxes enforced against such suitors as have been found to blame tax for vexatious pursuit tax for vexatious defence in certain cases assistance should be rendered at the expense of the public or of spontaneouslycontributing individuals assistance afforded to persons to whom whether on the pursuers or on the defendants side the inability to defray the expense of pursuing the necessary means of obtaining justice would otherwise render them destitute of the means the sources of such expense are— procurement of evidence in the case where expense is necessarily attached to the elicitation of it namely—  in the case of oral evidence the expense of conveyance to and from the abode of the proposed witness to and from the seat of judicature   the expense of demurrage at the seat of judicature   loss of time which to those to whom time is an indispensable source of subsistence is tantamout to expense   in the case of written evidence the expense of making the necessary transcripts there is also the correspondent expense in the case of appeal the sources of receipt in all cases are—   voluntary and gratuitous contributions on the part of judicial assessors and others to whose cognizance the case has happened to make its way   under the eye of the judge purchase of assistance for this purpose by engagement to repay in case of success together with a premium adequate to the risk   a fund to be provided for this purpose at the expense of the public as to blame independently of any which may have had place at the origin of the suit on the part of the pursuer in the case of a pursuit accompanied with the consciousness of its groundlessness on the part of the defendant a defence under the like consciousness of its groundlessness—blame may have place on either side and this as well on the part of him who knows himself to be in the wrong as on the part of him who being in the wrong knows not that he is so such will be the case in so far as on either side of the cause arrangements are taken having for their effect whether they have or have not had for their object the production of needless vexation or expense on the part of the opposite side as to the provision of fine or other punishment for vexatious pursuit or defence if security in that shape were not provided observe the evils that would ensue  0 for the purpose of minimizing vexation and expense or rather for the purpose of avoiding to create it one fundamental general rule is exceptions excepted—obligation of personal appearance at the judgmentseat on the part of all parties as well as witnesses of this arrangement the necessity to justice that is to say to all the necessary ends of justice will be shown further on for the purpose of the argument let it here be previously assumed now then observe the consequence every person being compellable to appear at any time and thus at all times at the instance of any person or any number of persons appearing in the character of plaintiffs—and no person prevented from appearing in that character or punishable for the vexation produced as above—the whole life of any person or of persons in an indefinite number might be completely occupied by calls to this effect a tyranny exerciseable over all would thus be put into the hands of all—a tyranny and of such sort as would have amongst other effects that of a licence to commit murder by cutting off from men in any number the means of earning their subsistence of the demand by which commencement is given to a suit what in every case is the object answer in every case to give execution and effect to the corresponding portion of the law good but as many as are the different remedies and so many as are the different forms and proportions in which they are capable of being applied and to suit the individual wrong or individual right in question require to be applied—how can the same course of procedure or even any small number of different courses of procedure be in itself applicable or be capable of being made applicable to each answer in this way what they have in common is this—for the judge to be able to give execution and effect to the appropriate portion of law involved whatever it may turn out to be what is necessary is—that the means of execution be in his power—at his disposal—in his possession or at his command these are the person reputation property and in certain respects condition in life of the parties and in particular of the defendant together with any such miscellaneous valuable right as it may happen to the party to be in possession of but omitting for shortness reputation and condition in life for placing the person and property at the judges disposal the means requisite are exactly the same whatsoever may be the disposition which by his ultimate terminative decree he may deem it advisable to make of them in regard to the person to keep it in confinement for a single day or for the whole of life—or supposing the law to permit it to substitute death to life thus it is that in the case of the most trifling pecuniary demand and in the case where the whole property of the defendant—his personal liberty during the whole of his life or even his life itself—is at stake the means if not of actual execution of being in a condition to order and effect actual execution will be in every case the same in regard to these same means of execution one considerable difference alas will be found to have place between the means of execution applying to the case where the remedy required is of the most burthensome kind to the proposed defendant and that in which it is of the least burthensome kind the more urgent the need which the party on the pursuers side may have of the remedy sought by him at the charge of the defendants side the greater the need there is of the judges putting himself in the possession of the physical faculty of applying the appropriate remedy how burthensome soever to the defendant but in many cases the determining to wait till full proof can have been made of the justice of the demand would be in effect to render the fulfilment of the duty of giving execution and effect to the appropriate portion of substantive law impossible for in the meantime and while the proof was in collection person and property would be out of the reach of the judge thus in cases of a certain degree of importance the need of a sort of provisional means of execution of which in these cases the eventual good has a preponderance over the actual evil in regard to the means of probation the coincidence is still more entire be the demand what it may—be the appropriate means of execution and effect what they may the evidence adapted to the purpose of obtaining credence for the alleged matter of fact in question will be the same the means requisite to be taken for coming at the source of the evidence and eliciting it from its sources in the best shape will always be the same true it is that in this case as in that of giving execution to the law the proper answer to the question whether to obtain the alleged evidence or to leave it unobtained will depend upon the ratio of the lot of evil to the lot of good—the evil in the shape of delay vexation and expense from the elicitation of the evidence—and the good from its conduciveness to right decision in other words the security it affords against deceit and mendacity by either of which execution and effect would be prevented from being given to the law on this occasion if of halfadozen different sorts of judicatories under the same government—each of them for the ascertaining of the truth in relation to one and the same alleged matter of fact pursues a different    course in relation to evidence—in the wrong they may be all of them and are—in the right courses more than one there cannot be means of communication of persons needful with persons needful and of persons needful with things needful—be the demand what it may be the particular mode of execution what it may be the facts of the case what they may be the appropriate sources of evidence and the mode of eliciting it what they may—the means best adapted to the purposes of effecting the communication necessary between the persons and things in question cannot in any case be different as to the question—will it in the present case for the purpose of obtaining the evidence be worth while to employ the means of communication necessary for that purpose in this case as in the former the balance may in some cases require to be taken in hand and the good expected from employing the necessary means of communication weighed against the evil inseparable from the employing them chapter ii ends apt and unapt by the apt ends of judicature understand the ends of justice as per chapter i by the unapt all other ends the powers of judicature are the powers exercised by judges as such—exercised by judges as to a greater or less proportion in pursuance of their own will but everywhere and at all times under the controul of a superior authority in pure monarchies that of the monarch—in the english monarchy that of the monarch with the aristocracy under him constituting together the parliament all power has had everywhere and at all times for the end of its exercise the good real or supposed of those by whom it has been exercised in the formation of the english system of judicature the judicial has ever been the active the ordinarilyoperative power that of the monarch with the rest of the parliament the controuling only the authority always capable of exercising that power and now and then but very rarely actually exercising it the formation of english procedure began before parliaments were established of this system the pretended ends would of course always be or at least have been and on inquiry would be now the ends of justice—the ends of justice as above enumerated the real end and if not the sole end at any rate the main and ultimate end the good of the judges—of those members of the judicial establishment who have borne their respective parts in the framing of it—the obtaining and securing for their use the greatest possible portion of the objects of general desire and in those large masses which none but those amongst whom the powers of government are shared can possibly possess these may be styled the sweets of government power wealth factitious dignity ease at the expense of official duty and vengeance at the expense of justice hence then another but not inconsistent account of the ends of judicature is this maximization of depredation and oppression of depredation wealth is the fruit of power oppression and vengeance the only end of the english system that is ever brought to view is—the keeping up the customs commenced in the darkest ages in every political community as yet in existence widely different from the only proper have been as yet the actual ends of judicature judicature is a branch of government the judicial system of the aggregate official establishment in every political state the actual ends of government have been the maximization of the happiness of the aggregate of the persons bearing respectively a part in the exercise of the powers of government proportioned to the share possessed by the judges and their associates in the profession out of which they spring in the powers of government has been in every political state the degree in which their interests have been promoted in and by the arrangements of law at the expense of all rival interests in pure and absolute monarchies the men of law of whom the judges formed a part having neither power nor influence but what they derived from the monarch have found themselves under the necessity of taking for the main object of their labours the sinister interest of the monarch and it is but by stealth and in virtue of and in proportion to his ignorance or carelessness that they have been able to introduce any arrangements favourable to their own sinister interest at the expense of his very different has their situation in this respect always been in england the grand instrument of despotism a standing army not having sprung up in england till a system of government suited to the purpose of the judges and other lawyers had been formed by lawyers the monarch in the measures taken for the advancement of his own sinister interests felt himself under the necessity of letting in their sinister interest for a considerable share of the benefit other hands still more obsequious could he have found them would of course have been employed by him in preference but no such    hands did the nature of the case afford in the field of law covered as it was by a jungle of their own planting none but themselves could find means to move awed by parliaments which though in esse as unfrequently and for as short a time as the craving rapacity of the monarch could contrive were continually in posse it was only by an obscure and tedious road that the judges could make their way in the prosecution of their designs while by fresh power and fresh sources of profit as occasion offered thrown into his hands these everdependent creatures of his were ministering to his rapacity he through ignorance or indolence connived all the while at theirs while by fines and confiscations they were filling his coffers by fees or addition to salary he connived at the rapacity practised by them for their own benefit this object however they found it beyond their power to accomplish without a variety of false pretences lies accordingly were the instruments by which on every occasion the dirty part of their work was done and in such numbers and of so gross a texture were lies of rapacity uttered by them that in the career of rapine and mendacity all the most profligate of their brethren of the trade in other countries were left far behind in the accomplishment of their object thus were they obliged to proceed in a retail way and by short steps taking money no otherwise than by the offer made of their services to the parties—in the shape of fees and these fees considering the poverty of the greatest part of the contributors separately taken unavoidably small ones at one time indeed they had formed higher projects instead of picking it up by driblets in the shape of fees they had begun to work for themselves as they had been used to do for the monarch and confiscated whole estates at once to their own use as they had been in the habit of doing to his this being in a reign of remarkable weakness that of henry the sixth it was by this weakness that they were probably emboldened to make so daring an experiment the experiment was accordingly made but though made with impunity it was not made with success a parliament there was which however impotent and disinclined with relation to any considerable good was still willing and able to save its members and others from having their estates swallowed up in the gulph which had been thus dug for them contrasted with the beheadings and embowellings which in the hands of these same functionaries had been ordered for crimes of so much lighter a die it is curious enough to observe the gentleness of the means employed by the parliament in its opposition to this project a simple prohibition and that clothed in the softest language in this way it was that in england the actual ends of judicature became as they are and as they continue to be so widely different from the proper ends of judicature in regard to the number of suits what the proper ends require is that the number of sincere suits and applications that are not rash be maximized that of insincere suits and applications minimized that the number of those that not being rash are sincere be maximized—why because on the part of every person who in his own opinion and that of his circle has a right to a judicial service from a judge and by the state of the laws finds himself precluded from the obtaining the effect of it a feeling of oppressedness—an opinion of injustice on the part of the system of judicature—has place the number of those that are insincere minimized—why because if in the opinion even of him who would institute them they are unjust and by reason of the vexation produced by them on the part of the defendant oppressive—so everybody else may safely stand assured they are in regard to rash suits that are not insincere as to the number of these also what the ends of justice require is that they be lessened why because by those also vexation is produced but for the lessening the number of these arrangements of a nature so severe as those which may and should be employed for the lessening the number of the insincere should not be employed lest along with those which are sincere yet rash those which are sincere and not rash be repressed and thus the opinion of injustice and insecurity in a correspondent degree diffused what in this case the ends of justice require is that maximization be given to the number of those rash suits in which the burthen of vexation is definitively by means of compensation taken off the shoulders of the party in the first instance vexed and set down upon those of the vexer—the author of the vexation for in proportion as these conjoined effects are produced the quantity of vexation is reduced on the part of the injured class and with it the extent of the apprehension of the like injustice now as to what in relation to this subject is required by the actual ends of judicature—required with more or less energy and effect in every as yet known system of judicature but with most of all by the english in regard to the number of suits that the number of lawyerprofityielding suits sincere and insincere be maximized of that of profitless suits minimized that the number of lawyersprofityielding suits be maximized—why because—but as to the cause the case speaks for itself—lawyers labours and lawyers profits proportionable    that the number of profitless suits be minimized—why because for every such suit there would be lawyers labour of such as were employed and no lawyers profit to sweeten it the lawyers whose only profit if any came from the parties and could not be compelled to serve the parties would of course if the inducement were taken away leave their books and escape from the service of judges if paid by the public and on condition of not receiving anything from the parties their interest and inclination would of course prompt them to wish that of suits thus barren the number should be minimized but they could not as the hireling lawyers could so far as regarded suits in which if instituted they would have been concerned reduce it to nothing by lawtaxes profitless suits are reduced but lawyersprofityielding suits in a certain proportion reduced with them by lawfees profitless suits are reduced though lawyerprofityielding suits are also reduced yet in so far as limits are set to rapacity by prudence the balance on the profit side is increased in england not to speak of other countries not only at no time has the system of procedure acted upon been in fact directed to the ends of justice but at no time by any person concerned in the carrying it on has any such profession as that of its being directed to the ends of justice been ever made with what face indeed could they have been by any english lawyer laid down as the exclusively proper ones or so much as simply the proper ones seeing that the ends uniformly pursued by english judges who with here and there the exception of a scrap or two of legislativemade law have been at the same time their own legislators are in a state of perpetual opposition to the ends of justice hence it is that from beginning to end an english book of procedure book of practice is the name of such a book among english lawyers presents no other object than a system of absurdity directed to no imaginable good end an allcomprehensive code of substantive law having for its end in view in so far as the ruling one and the subruling few can be brought to admit of it the greatest happiness of the greatest number each part of it present to the minds of all persons on whose conformity to its enactments its attainment of such its end depends—an allcomprehensive code of adjective law otherwise called a code of judicial procedure having for its end in view the giving to the utmost possible amount execution and effect to the enactments of the substantive code—such is the description of the instruments which the people in so far as apprised of their most important interests look for at the hands of the government—such are the securities which in a government in the breasts of the members of which any regard for the greatest happiness of the greatest number had place would lose no time in bringing into existence such are the indispensable instruments of felicity and security which the implacable enemies of both—the lawyer tribe underall its diversifications—will leave no stone unturned to prevent from coming into existence the actually existing indiscriminate defenders of right and wrong in one house—the quondum indiscriminate defenders of right and wrong now exalted into exclusive defenders of wrong in another house it is a maxim with a certain class of reformists not to give existence or support to any plan of reform without the consent and guidance of those to whose particular and sinister interest it is in the strongest degree adverse not to do away or to diminish any evil but by the consent and under the guidance of those

otherwise an extortioner with whom he has a fellow feeling with whom he is in partnership whose profit is his profit this fact has been held up to the view of mr peel and mr peel will do nothing without the advice and consent of lord tenterden whose wisdom magnanimity disinterestedness and public spirit he can never sufficiently admire upon the money which—instead of being secured to and divided between the distressed debtor and his frequently no less distressed creditor the gaoler dignified with the title of marshal of the prison called the kings bench prison—this gaoler can contrive

such conception to have found entrance as that the money of a debtor would be more beneficially disposed of if divided amongst his creditors than if divided between the marshal and the chiefjustice of the kings bench—and to move for leave to bring in a bill for this purpose—what in such a case would be the course taken by mr peel he would cause it to be understood that if the bill were entrusted to

indicted for manslaughter by driving a load over the body of the deceased was acquitted why because he did not do the act no but because by mr nobodyknowswho who drew the indictment the condition of the cavalry in respect of sex and aptitude for marriage nomenclature is in this instance an operation of the most perilous delicacy had been averred and by those who should have proved it had not been proved by the care of mr peels sublaborators in one of his bills a clause had been inserted by which the necessity of the averment in question and proof made of it would have been saved but by the wisdom of a majority of those wise men of the west it had been perceived that by the omission of matter so indispensable in the eyes of the common law too great a laxity in pleading would have been introduced one reason had been alleged why the defendant if a murderer should not suffer as such and the reason was that by the drawer of the indictment the nature of the road had not in point of law been explained—whether it was a kings highway or what else it was this objection formidable as it was was overruled by the learned judge lord chiefjustice best whose liberality and sense of justice stood thus conspicuously manifested but the objection about the condition of the cavalry was too material and too strong even for his herculean shoulders this objection was pronounced by him a fatal one to have found it obviated by a clause in an act of mr peels had been his hope but alas on inspection the clause was not be found thus it is that by the deliberate and so recently declared judgment—that judgment a unanimous one of the twelve wise men of the west—it is conclusively established that not to speak of other functionaries of the law the power of granting effectual pardon to all criminals—murderers in particular not excepted—belongs incontestibly to every person by whom the function of penning the instrument of accusation is performed with this licence wanting to himself is every murderer who by his murders or otherwise having provided himself with the money omits to offer to the draughtsman whatever sum may be requisite to the insertion of the mercyadministering surplusage wanting to himself disrespectful to the luminaries of the law—the twelve judges—is the draughtsman by whom so advantageous an offer is refused what danger for him can there be from the acceptance of it so many of these omissions    as there have been in time past none of them producing any suspicion of sinister design so easy so frequent such omissions without sinister design—who shall be uncharitable enough to pronounce intentionality in any future instance whatever it be by the functionary in question true it is that in consequence of the omission a good sum of money say a thousand pounds has been received but from thence does it follow that it was really his intention that guilt should escape forbid it candour—forbid it justice the judges are they not ministers of justice this draughtsman is he not a minister of justice likewise let but a man be the minister of justice and whatsoever be the quantity or quality of the mischief in the production of which he is instrumental—whatsoever be the quantity of the money which he gains by its being produced—in such sort that were not the mischief produced the money would not be received it is not to be supposed that it was his intention that mischief should be produced it is not to be supposed that whatsoever be the money gained by producing it he will ever intentionally contribute to the production of it in future captain macheath when pistol in hand he said to the passenger give me your purse or you are a dead man and he received the purse with five guineas in it accordingly—was it his intention to receive the money and convert it to his own use yes for his style and title was captain macheath but suppose his style and title had been mr justice macheath—or suppose that after having been convicted of the robbery instead of the gallows he had been raised to the bench—would he even in the last case have been guilty—would it have been his intention either to have received the money or to have shot the passenger in the case of his not receiving it oh no the patent of appointment would have relation backwards nothing more easy nothing more conformable to precedent the king can do no wrong upon the throne the kings judge can do no wrong upon the kings bench—can he lord tenterden—can he protector and partner of the tipstaff chapter iii procedure—its relation to the rest of the law a procedure code is an accessory code which as we have seen has for its end in view and occupation the giving execution and effect to a correspondent principal code hence comes a natural supposition the substantive code should as mathematicians say be given or the adjective can have no meaning the substantive being throughout a necessary object of reference to a certain extent and degree this is correct and undeniable to a certain extent it does not apply if it did apply to its whole extent this work would from first to last be unintelligible and useless the procedure code in so far as it is clear it ought to be has for its purpose and end and occupation two things the exercising for the avowed purposes mentioned in the substantive code powers of all sorts over persons and things and in the next place coming at the truth of the case in regard to matters of fact to wit such matters of fact as are necessary to give warrant and justification to the exercise of those same powers—say means of execution and means of proof or in one word evidence of these two desiderata the first mentioned is the first in the order of design and in the order of importance but in practice that which is to constitute the warrant must precede the operation for which it is to afford the warrant here then comes the line of distinction—the distinction between that part of the proposed system of procedure which may be given without the previous exhibition of any part of the system of substantive law and that part which cannot the means for coming at the truth as to matters of fact are the same in all cases the means for obtaining and exercising the powers necessary to the giving execution and effect to the ordinances of substantive law are the same in all cases but of this general application of machinery different ordinances of substantive law require the application of different engines or instruments to be brought into exercise on which occasion which instrument shall be brought into exercise and how applied—this will depend upon the particular portion or article of substantive law to which for the purpose of giving effect to it application is to be made of it taking possession of a mans body for the purpose of securing on his part compliance with ordinances—ordinances of the substantive law and thence those of adjective law employed in giving effect to them this power once possessed is in its nature applicable to any one purpose as well as any other to the exaction of service in any shape—to the infliction of punishment in any shape so in regard to taking possession of a mass of property to the above purpose is added in this case the allotment of it in kind or in value in satisfaction of debts due so in regard to the means of communication—of communication between person and person—of communication between persons and things whether for the purpose of execution    or the purpose of proof—the catalogue of these will require to be a perfect one in a word on looking over the titles of the several chapters of this work it will be seen that the points therein respectively brought to view require all of them to be settled for every extensive substantive code that can be imagined but different judicial services—judicial service in different shapes—require so many different operations to be performed for the application of the general apparatus of powers to their several particular purposes different modes of punishment require so many different operations or sets of operations to be performed in the application of the general powers over person property reputation and condition in life—to be applied to the purpose of inflicting the particular species of suffering allotted to each species of offence these then must all be given ere the procedure code can be complete in the present outline that which can be done and accordingly is done is the bringing to view the course which it is supposed is the best that can be pursued for the purpose of giving execution and effect to the whole system of substantive law—execution and effect down to that stage in which the execution in each instance in the instance of each service and in the instance of each punishment is actually to be done the tenor of the definitive decree must be accommodated and adapted to the particular service—to the particular punishment on this occasion will be seen one broad feature by which the here proposed code will be seen to stand distinguished from all codes that ever were established if the one course here chalked out be the straight one all those others will be recognized to be composed of aberrations exhibiting variety of absurdity and to the unhappy people productive of variety of wretchedness another corollary of which a general intimation may here be given is the comparative smallness of the diversity between the course of procedure required for the giving execution and effect to the nonpenal branch of substantive law and the course requisite in the case of the penal branch for giving appropriate execution and effect to the nonpenal branch appropriate proof must be obtained and employed and appropriate means of execution provided and applied and with little if any difference these will serve as well for penal as for nonpenal cases in the penal cases of the greatest severity reluctance as to compliance on the part of the defendant will be greater than in any nonpenal case and for surmounting reluctance adequate provision so far as the nature of the case admits must in every case be made the reluctance will be as the affliction but in cases decidedly nonpenal the affliction may with little exception be as great as any which in the far greater number of penal cases it will be found necessary to produce be a mans property ever so vast it is frequently for a purely nonpenal purpose—satisfaction to creditors—necessary to divest him of it and many a man rather than undergo this affliction has doomed himself to and actually suffered imprisonment for life—for life and that a very long one as to the aberrations—those aberrations by which the course of procedure has been rendered a course of such afflictive intricacy—they will be found all springing from one source—the opposition of the actual ends of judicature to the ends of justice—the opposition between the interests of those by whose will that course has been regulated and the interest of the people whose destiny has been disposed of by it by this one circumstance every anomaly will be seen to be accounted for—every object rendered plain and clear without it every object will be obscure—the whole system will continue to present to view the same chaos as at present doubtless without a continual eye to the mass of substantive law in all its branches no such outline of the course of procedure as the present could have been delineated but in regard to the objects which it was necessary should be kept in view by the writer it was not necessary that they should be presented to the view of the reader in a case of civil procedure the previous existence of any offence is not supposed what is supposed is the existence of a right on the part of some individual to apply to a court of justice requesting the court to confer on him another correspondent right but by conferring on the individual so applying the right so applied for it can do no otherwise than create on the part of some other individual a correspondent obligation or mass of obligations if the individual on whom the obligation in question is thus sought to be imposed submits voluntarily to have it imposed on him there is no lawsuit in the case so likewise if without inquiring to know whether he is willing to receive it the judge imposes it upon him of course but if the case be such that the judge before he proceeds to impose the obligation so required to be imposed causes application to be made to the party in question to know whether he be content to have it imposed upon him and upon such application so made to him he refuses to submit to have it imposed on him unless upon further order to be pronounced by the judge upon hearing the reasons for and against the imposition of the obligation thus contended against—in such case a cause suit or litigation takes place    and such cause suit or litigation is termed a civil one in this case as in the case of a penal one an offence is still supposed as liable to be committed nor without the idea of delinquency can this case any more than the other be understood for in this case a judgment with an order thereupon grounded is supposed in the event of the plaintiffs gaining his cause to be issued by the judge but to the idea of a judicial order the idea of an act of delinquency is necessarily annexed for the order has no force if any act performed in breach of such order be not considered and treated as an offence both an act by which a penal suit is commenced and an act by which a civil suit is commenced suppose an act of delinquency or offence the difference is that the acts by which a penal suit is commenced suppose an offence committed already whereas an act by which a civil suit is commenced does not suppose any offence committed already—does not suppose any offence as being about to be committed for certain it supposes only that an offence will eventually be committed if upon the judges having created as above the obligation corresponding to the right required to be conferred any act in breach of such obligation should come to be committed we proceed to the consideration of the several ends of procedure considered in respect of the penal branch of it the ultimate ends of penal procedure are two of these the main and positive end is the infliction of the punishment in question including the administering of the several species of satisfaction attached to the lot of punishment in question in the cases where mixed species of satisfaction respectively have place the negative ultimate end is the noninfliction of the lot of punishment in question in each case as the individual in question in the event of his not having committed or been a partaker in the alleged individual offence is entitled to have this protection of the innocent collateral or incidental ends of penal procedure the avoidance as far as is possible of the several inconveniences which in a greater or less degree are inseparable from the course of action by which a penal suit action or prosecution as it is called is carried on these inconveniences considered in respect of their origin may be termed by one general or common appellation juridical or legal vexation of juridical vexations the principal modifications may be enumerated as follows—  st consumption of time understood in a way supposed to be unpleasant  d confinement in respect of place obligation of being in some place in which it is unpleasant or prejudicial to a man to be obligation of not being in some place in which it would be pleasant or advantageous to a man to be  d pecuniary expense loss or charge  th anxiety of mind a pain grounded on the apprehension of being subjected to one or more of the modifications of inconvenience above mentioned of these several modifications of forensic vexation the pecuniary expense is the most prominent and this partly because the existence of it in a degree worth regarding is capable of being more precisely ascertained than in any of these other cases partly because the amount of it is capable of being more exactly measured these inconveniences or some of them have a mutual tendency to increase and generate each other confinement in respect of place will oftentimes be productive of pecuniary expense pecuniary expense or the apprehension of it will be productive of confinement in respect of place viz in as far as for the purpose of saving the expense a man either stays at home instead of going a journey or goes a journey instead of staying at home as he would have done otherwise the avoidance of delay is termed an end of the second order because delay itself though indisputably an inconvenience is not in its effects distinguishable from the inconveniences of the first order—the inconveniences to which the several ends of the first order respectively bear reference for into one or other of these same inconveniences it may in every case be resolved in speaking of delay it must all along be understood that to the business of the branch of procedure in question as to every other business a certain portion of time is altogether necessary by delay therefore neither more nor less is understood than the consumption of any portion of time over and above the portion of time absolutely necessary—the portion of time that would be sufficient for the accomplishment of the several ends of procedure in their respective greatest degrees of perfection whatever it may be so far as the delay continues so far the main positive ultimate ends of procedure remain unaccomplished from delay again in certain cases may arise a result contrary to the negative ultimate end of procedure in other words from delay may arise the conviction and thence the punishment of the nonguilty as for example by the deperition of evidence necessary to the proof of innocence from delay may arise forensic vexation in any of its already enumerated shapes the avoidance of precipitation may be ranked as an end of the second order for the same reasons that apply to the case of delay but the mass of inconvenience of which it is liable to be productive is upon the whole even less considerable or at least less diversified in the case of delay there is a certain inconvenience for so long as it lasts    there is a denial of justice in the case of precipitation there is no inconvenience but what in the first instance is contingent the inconveniences appertaining to precipitation are no other than the disaccomplishment or frustration of one or other of the two ultimate ends of procedure in other words they can scarcely consist of anything else but either the nonconviction of some one who is guilty or the conviction of and consequent punishment of some one who is not guilty supposing it to be productive of either of these ultimate inconveniences precipitation can scarcely be productive of any one of the collateral or incidental inconveniences viz local confinement and expense unpleasant occupation anxiety of mind on the contrary the effect of it is to reduce these several collateral inconveniences to a quantity inferior to that in which they would exist otherwise in this point of view so far from being productive of inconvenience it is productive of advantage—an advantage which would be clear and desirable upon the whole were it not for the chance of danger of which precipitation is productive viz the danger of giving birth to one or other of the two abovementioned ultimate inconveniences—the inconveniences corresponding respectively to the two ultimate ends of this branch of procedure the idea of precipitation may be thus fixed and explained a certain quantity of time is supposed to be necessary to give room for the several actions and reflections on the part of the several individuals concerned which are considered as necessary to afford to the judge the best chance for rendering justice i e for the accomplishment of the two ultimate ends of procedure above mentioned precipitation is considered as taking place when in any part anything is supposed to be struck off or defalcated from the supposed necessary length of time thus if a cause be supposed to be of that importance that after the hearing of all the proofs a less time than a week cannot it is supposed be sufficient on the part of the judge to be employed in the consideration of them and the time employed by the judge in the consideration of them is no more than a single day in such cases the judge must by the supposition be deemed chargeable with precipitation if then in consequence of such supposed precipitation the judgment actually given by the judge is repugnant to one or other of the ultimate ends of justice in this case the mischief correspondent to such ultimate end is actually produced but in the opposite case i e if the decision of the judge be conformable to the ultimate ends of justice no mischief at all is produced by precipitation the contingency is not reduced to act on the contrary so far from being productive of inconvenience the supposed precipitation is productive of advantage upon the whole since by virtue of it as much time as corresponds to the delay thus saved is saved thus again if the time allowed by the judge for the appearance of a witness is but three days and the time which a person whose opinion is supposed to be the standard would fix upon as necessary for the purpose is four days the judge would of course in the opinion of such persons stand chargeable with precipitation if then the witness accordingly for want of sufficient time fail in making his appearance within the time in question and for want of his appearance an unjust decision is given by the judge—a decision contrary to one or other of the two ultimate ends of justice—in such case the contingent inconvenience attached to the supposed precipitation is converted into a real one but if notwithstanding the supposed precipitation the witness does make his appearance within the time and that without any forensic vexation produced on the part of him or anybody else for example without injury to his health or to the value of his time or increase of expense—in such case the supposed precipitation turns out to be no real precipitation or at least not to be productive of any ultimate inconvenience nor of any prejudice to any of the ends of justice on the contrary the consequence and only consequence of it consists in a real and positive convenience since a portion of delay to the amount of a day is saved however even on this supposition a certain degree of inconvenience may be produced by the precipitation upon the whole since the idea of a judge whose conduct is marked in general with precipitation cannot but be productive of a general alarm for want of the requisite measure of delay and consideration each person conceiving himself liable to appear in the character of a suitor will become apprehensive of seeing the ends of justice contravened to his prejudice he will be apprehensive lest if he become an accuser the party whom he accuses be for want of due consideration on the part of the judge acquitted though guilty lest in the event of his coming under accusation he may for like want of consideration on the part of the judge be convicted if the enumeration made as above of the several objects to be aimed at in the character of the ends of procedure is proper as far as it goes and complete the several ends will furnish so many principles by which the propriety of every regulation proposed in the character of a regulation of procedure may be tried should any consideration present itself which serving in the character of a reason to evince the utility of the provision to which    it is thus applied shall at the same time appear incapable of being ranked under any of the above principles in other words though good in itself i e serving to evince the utility of the provision in some other respect it should be found not to be of a nature to evince the subserviency of the provision in question to any one of the above ends—in such case the enumeration of these ends—the enumeration of the correspondent principles—will in so far turn out to be incomplete on the contrary if no such independent reason be to be found it follows that in this single chapter is contained a test by which the propriety of every imaginable provision of procedure may be tried and determined and in that case the pains taken in the investigation of them and in exhibiting the nature of their relation to each other will not have been ill bestowed this catalogue of ends is it correct and complete and the relation between the several articles accurately made out and established the foundations of the rationale of procedure are then laid and laid for ever a standard is constructed by which the propriety of every rule and disposition of law in this behalf that has anywhere been established or can ever come to be proposed may be tried and determined a rule of established practice established anywhere in this behalf is it defective in any respect or supposed to be defective it must be in respect of its tendency to produce some of the inconveniences corresponding to the above ends a rule—is it proposed anywhere as promising to occupy a useful place in the code of procedure its utility if it possesses any must consist in the tendency it has to be subservient in some distinct and assignable way or other to the attainment of one or more of those ends to the prevention or diminution in some way or other of some one article or articles in the corresponding list of inconveniences a system of procedure with what skill soever directed will be liable notwithstanding to give birth to a variety of mischiefs or say inconveniences these mischiefs various as they are will however be found all of them reducible to the following heads— in the penal branch   impunity of delinquents   undue punishment viz punishment of nondelinquents or punishment of delinquents otherwise than due in the nonpenal branch   frustration of wellgrounded claims   allowance of illgrounded claims   expense   vexation   delay   precipitation   complication so many mischiefs as are liable to be found in a system of procedure so many mischiefs to be avoided in every such system so many mischiefs the avoidance of which may in any such system be considered as respectively constituting so many ends to be kept in view if the catalogue of these mischiefs be complete no provision that can be proposed can be entitled to a place in any such system but in so far as it can be shown to be conducive to the attainment of one or more of these several ends if at the same time it is seen to be more conducive to one of these ends than to another or others to which it is sure to be repugnant a comparative estimate will then be to be made and for the purpose of this estimate one point to be ascertained will be the comparative importance of the end or ends on both sides i e of the mischiefs concerned on both sides in the next place the degree of conduciveness on the part of the provision in question with reference to each such end in casting an eye over the catalogue of these mischiefs some may be observed the avoidance of which—the complete avoidance—is in conception at least a possible result to this head may be referred the four first articles and the eighth—impunity of delinquents—undue punishment—frustration of wellgrounded claims—allowance of illgrounded claims and precipitation others there are of which not even in conception can the exclusion appear possible to this head belong the articles of expense vexation delay and complication of these it will be seen immediately that to a certain degree they are inseparably and essentially attached to the business of procedure in these instances the object is not to exclude them altogether that being plainly impossible but on each occasion to reduce their respective degrees or quantities to minimum to the lowest pitch possible in looking over the same list again in another point of view another remark that may be made is that in some of the instances the result thus given as mischievous is mischievous in its own nature to this head belong evidently enough the first six articles—impunity of delinquents undue punishment frustration of wellgrounded claims allowance of illgrounded claims expense and vexation in other instances the result though still indubitably mischievous can hardly be said to be so in itself it would not be so were it not for the property it has of giving birth or its tendency at least to give birth to some one or more of the articles in the list last mentioned to this head belong the other remaining articles—delay precipitation and complication among the mischiefs of the first order two and two only are such that the ends corresponding to them can be said with propriety to constitute the direct and ultimate ends of the system of procedure these are in the  0 penal branch impunity of delinquency in the nonpenal branch frustration of wellgrounded claims in the penal branch the avoiding to administer punishment when undue is certainly an end of very high importance and altogether necessary to be attended to with unremitting and anxious care it cannot however with any propriety be stated as constituting an ultimate a primary a direct end of the system of procedure why because if there were no system of procedure at all this end would be but the more completely and effectually accomplished this same observation may it is equally evident be extended with equal propriety to four other of the above ends—to that which consists in avoiding to give allowance to ill grounded claims and to those which respectively consist in avoiding to give birth to those unhappily inseparable accompaniments of every system of procedure viz expense and vexation in other shapes the two ultimate ends—avoidance to produce or suffer impunity on the part of delinquents—avoidance to produce or suffer frustration of wellgrounded claims—these two ends though thus for the sake of unity symmetry and analogy expressed in a negative form of words—in a phrase of a negative construction—are capable of being expressed more naturally and perspicuously by a phrase in the positive form accomplishment of the punishment of delinquency—effectuation of wellgrounded claims in the penal branch the application of punishment with its attendant masses of satisfaction in the case where the offence imputed has really been committed the avoiding the employment of such coercive measures in every case where the offence has not been committed in the civil branch the collation of the right demanded in the case where the collation of it is required by a correspondent provision of the substantive law—the collation of such right and therewith and thereby the creation of the correspondent group of obligations the avoiding the employing those same coercive measures in the case where the creation of the correspondent right is not required by the substantive law— all these measures both in the penal branch and in the civil the observance of all these conditions is comprised in one expression viz rendering justice—taking that course in every case which coincides with the track marked out beforehand by the finger of the substantive law it being established that the proper end and object of the system of procedure is to render justice as above explained—the justice that will naturally be understood as that the rendering of which is the end or object thus spoken of—is the real justice of the case meaning by real justice that which is such in contradistinction to whatever else may appear to be such—in other words as before that the course taken shall be what really is conformable to the indication given by the correspondent portion of substantive law in contradistinction to what if there be a difference is in appearance and but in appearance thus conformable the distinction thus made wears the appearance of subtlety and even useless subtlety but when applied to practice it will besides being explained be shown to be in more points of view than one of very considerable importance it will be seen in the first place that between real or abstract justice and apparent justice there is in many cases a very palpable difference in the next place that when they fail of coinciding it is rather apparent justice than real and abstract justice that is the direct end and immediately important object of the system of procedure in another work i have already had occasion to hold up to view as a distinction of cardinal importance the distinction between mischief of the first order and mischief of the second order and so in like manner of good in so far as that result is among the effects of the action in question instead of evil as before but it is only good or evil of the first order that constitutes the effect produced by real justice the good and evil of the second order depends wholly and solely speaking of immediate dependence upon apparent justice if the decision given being a decision by which a man is subjected to punishment be conformable to apparent justice—in other words if the universal persuasion the persuasion entertained by everybody to whose notice this case presents itself is that the man was guilty—in such case though by the supposition the decision is contrary to real justice and though in virtue of the suffering of the party punished mischief of the first order is produced yet the mischief remains barren no mischief of the second order or alarm is by the very supposition produced by it suppose on the other hand the party accused is really guilty of the offence a decision is given pronouncing him so and he suffers accordingly the decision is in this case by the very supposition conformable to real justice but if it be unconformable to apparent justice in other words if according to universal persuasion the man is looked upon as not guilty a mischief of the second order is produced—an alarm and that alarm by the supposition is as strong as if the party thus looked upon as innocent had been so in reality in the same way mutatis mutandis the distinction between real and apparent justice may be applied in the nonpenal branch of procedure the distinction being thus explained    it remains now to bring to view by way of example a case or a few cases in which it is realized and from thence to show what however will appear pretty clearly without much showing the importance and utility of this distinction in practice when having been prosecuted a man who in the general estimation of the public appears to have been guilty is acquitted by the observation of such acquittal—by such impunity as in that case is said to be manifested by it a mischief of the second order an alarm at any rate is produced a general apprehension is entertained of similar manifestations of delinquency and similar mischiefs as the probable result of such similar offences offences are apprehended in the first place from the agency of the individual himself thus triumphing in impunity and encouraged to go on in the path of guilt by the experienced receipt of the profit of the offence clear of the punishment endeavoured by the substantive law to be attached to it offences of the like description or indeed in a greater or less degree of all descriptions on the part of other individuals—of all individuals who standing exposed to temptation may by the observation of the impunity enjoyed in the instance in question be disposed to yield to it such are the evil effects which in a greater or less degree take place as often as a man who in the general opinion of the public appears to have been guilty is observed to have escaped punishment if the case were such that as well in the case of guilt as in the case of innocence reality and appearance always went together—in that case no such spectacle of impunity could by the supposition ever be exhibited but in fact this want of coincidence between real and apparent justice is observed to take place in but too many instances on this occasion the repugnance admits of two evils both equally conceivable one is that the party appearing in the eye of public opinion guilty shall notwithstanding at the conclusion of the suit have been treated by the judge as innocent in a manner unconformable to justice in other words shall have been acquitted the other is that the party appearing in the eye of the public innocent shall notwithstanding have been treated by the judge as guilty in other words shall have been convicted in a manner unconformable to justice of these two cases the former is a case that as will be seen is but too frequently realized a variety of causes each of them adequate to the production of the effect and accordingly each of them very frequently producing it will be mentioned further on the other is a case which though not absolutely without example is happily there is reason to think very seldom realized in regard to impunity that the case of a man who though guilty and as such prosecuted has notwithstanding been acquitted is a frequent one no person whatever—no judge no advocate no person how partial soever in his affection to the established system will ever attempt to deny the utmost that any such person could ever think of affirming and even this is more than persons so situated will in general be disposed to affirm is—that when a man has thus been treated as innocent and as such acquitted he has accordingly been innocent in reality and that the decision though apparently unconformable to the disposition of the substantive law was in reality conformable to it—that the decision though not conformable to apparent justice was conformable to real justice the argument thus supposed would very seldom indeed be found conformable to the fact but what is material to the present purpose is that even though it were conformable to the fact it would not be sufficient for the justification of the system of procedure in which the contrariety in question were manifested that a system of procedure be good—that it be well adapted to its proper end it is not sufficient that the decisions rendered in virtue of it be conformable to real justice it is necessary that they should be conformable to apparent justice to produce real justice the only true way is to produce that which shall in the eye of public opinion be apparent justice in point of utility apparent justice is everything real justice abstractedly from apparent justice is a useless abstraction not worth pursuing and supposing it contrary to apparent justice such as ought not to be pursued from apparent justice flow all the good effects of justice—from real justice if different from apparent none on the other hand in this same distinction may be observed a circumstance which operates in some degree as a remedy to a great deal of injustice—injustice which will be seen to be no less entitled to the appellation of real than apparent injustice in some cases in some countries it will happen from causes that will be elsewhere mentioned that although particular instances of injustice at once real and apparent are manifesting themselves every day yet from the operation of these causes a considerable degree of confidence will notwithstanding be entertained in the system of procedure as having a general tendency to produce in the decisions given under it a conformity to the prescriptions of justice in this case the opinion though erroneous and founded on prejudices capable of being pointed out will in the way above spoken of be productive of salutary effects were the system viewed in its genuine colours the alarm produced by it—the alarm of insecurity—would    be extreme and universal but by the effect of this prejudice the alarm is lessened the mischiefs resulting from the imperfection of the system cannot be the prejudice ever so strong escape wholly from observation but the mischiefs instead of being ascribed to their real cause the imperfections of the system of procedure are ascribed to the nature of things that justice very frequently fails of being done is a truth too palpable to be disputed—too palpable to pass unobserved or unacknowledged but the notion is that whenever it can be done it is done that if in any case it fails of being done it is because in that case in the nature of things it cannot be done the confidence in the system remains in a manner entire—as entire as if its title to that confidence were ever so real and indisputable chapter iv judiciary establishment the arrangements in this proposed procedure code bear reference to a correspondent judiciary establishment without which execution and effect could not be given to them for the list of arrangements proposed for the establishment of it see the chapters in the constitutional code from xii to xxvii inclusive of the leading features of the system of arrangements the following summary intimation may in this place notwithstanding the scantiness of it be not altogether without its use exceptions excepted and those few and narrow and for special causes—   number of judges in a judicatory in no instance more than one judicatories each of them single seated principle in one word the principle of singleseatedness   to the cognizance of every judicatory belong all sorts of cases or say suits principle in one word the principle of omnicompetence   from every judicatory in every case appeal lies to one other judicatory and no more the judicatory appealed from the immediate judicature judicatory appealed to the appellate judicatory   attached to every judicatory are—  a registrar   a government advocate   an eleemosynary advocate the eleemosynary advocate for support to the interests of the otherwise helpless among suitors   presiding each over a certain number of immediate judicatories are appellate judicatories the number such as the experience of the need manifested of their service shall have indicated in federal commonwealths and countries in which the population is thin distance great and means of communication comparatively rare it may be of use that they be scattered over the country and where sublegislatures have place for every sublegislature and in the town which is the seat of it there should be an appellate judicatory and thus by the efflux of suitors to the judicatory and of members and other functionaries of the legislature a good public filled with appropriate aptitude—moral intellectual and active—may in each of these seats of business be created and preserved but in england on the contrary where the communication is so prompt and the occasions and means so abundant the demand for a number of appellate judicatories in so many places distant from each other seems hardly to have place the metropolis the immediate centre of all business which at all times will be sure to afford a public with the aptitude of which no other town can bear comparison may serve for all of them   to every judge belongs the power of locating deputes permanent and occasional in number to

expense necessary to effect the forthcomingness of such evidence as the suit may happen to furnish a fund partly composed of fines or say mulcts inflicted for pursuits accompanied with temerity or evil consciousness chapter v procedure—its subjectmatters as in the case of substantive law constitutional law penal law and nonpenal law included so here in the case of procedure law the subjectmatters of legislation are distinguished into—   persons   things immoveable   things moveable   money   occurrences persons are distinguishable for the purpose of the procedure code into functionaries and nonfunctionaries functionaries into judicial functionaries or nonjudicial or say extrajudicial functionaries for a list of these functionaries see constitutional code chap xii judiciary collectively as to things immoveable and their distinctions see constitutional code chapter ix ministers collectively §   statistic function so as to things moveable so as to money so as to occurrences occurrences may be distinguished into judicialprocedureaffecting and miscellaneous as to the judicialprocedureaffecting occurrences they will be found comprisible under one or other of the four heads following—   states of things   actions or say operations at large   actions or operations consisting in the utterance of judicial formularies   judicial formularies or say instruments by a judicial formulary or instrument understand a written or quasiwritten discourse uttered on a judicial occasion and for a judicial purpose by some person or persons belonging to the list as above of actors in the judicial drama or on the judicial theatre in the case of each such actor distinguishable in respect of the occasions as they occur in the course of the judicial drama—will be the instruments which may come to be uttered by them as above commenced in every case will be the judicial transaction by some person acting in the character of an applicant and not by the judge exceptions excepted on no occasion can the judge as such give commencement to any judicial proceeding for exceptions see constitutional code chapter xii judiciary collectively §  sedative function for purposes other than that of giving commencement to a suit may judicial application be made to a judge so many species of applications so many species of applicants persons to whom written judicial instruments emanate from a judge are either—  functionaries   nonfunctionaries functionaries are as above either—  nonjudicial or   judicial judicial functionaries are with reference to a judge of the grade in question either of the same grade or of a different grade if of a different grade they are either of a superior or an inferior grade coordinates are those of the same grade superordinates those of a superior grade subordinates those of an inferior grade subordinate to every judge are all nonfunctionaries on a special occasion for a special purpose a functionary who in ordinary or say in general is with reference to the judge in question superordinate may be subordinate addressed to a subordinate functionary or nonfunctionary a written instrument expressive of the discourse of a judge is a mandate a judicial mandate to the nature of the judicial mandate addressed to him will be referable the nature of the response if any transmitted or addressed to the judge in compliance with or in consequence of it the persons to whom in consequence of a judicial application made to the judge judicial mandates are addressed will be determined by the course taken by the application and where the application is terminated in and gives commencement to and is thereby converted into a suit by the course taken by the suit    the course taken by a suit is composed of or say marked out by the several operations successively or simultaneously performed by the several actors at so many successive times posterior to the commencement of a suit the applicant for whatsoever purpose applying will as above have made his appearance without mandate or judicial instrument of any other kind received from the judge his examination for the day finished the judge will either dismiss the application altogether or continue it chapter vi allcomprehensive arrangements §   general division on no occasion can it fail to be matter of satisfaction to the mind to feel that it has within its grasp the whole of the subjectmatter which it has taken for consideration but on every such occasion a movement necessary to this purpose is the occupation of the universal vantage ground by ascending to the summit of the porphyrian tree to endeavour to communicate to the mind of the reader this pleasurable sensation is the business of the present chapter expressed at length judicial procedure is the subject of the present work this being premised and understood procedure alone is the denomination which for brevitys sake will in future be employed on every occasion procedure has alike for its object the giving execution and effect to this or that article of the substantive branch of the law on every occasion the substantive branch of law has for its objects one or other of two results giving effect to some right or applying the appropriate remedy to some wrong correspondent to these two objects of the substantive branch of law are the two species of processes called suits in adjective law correspondent to effectuation of rights is a simply requisitive suit correspondent to application of remedies to wrongs are inculpative suits judicial procedure is an aggregate of connected actions exercised by divers actors the first of which has or professes to have for its object or say end in view the giving on some individual occasion for some individual purpose execution and effect to some determinate portion or portions of the substantive code or say branch of law procedure may be divided into—  operations   instruments   stages operations are—  application   probation   security finding   counterprobation   execution applications are either contestational or noncontestational the contestational are suits suits are simply requisitive or inculpative the instruments of procedure are—  personal   real   written personal the functionaries real the judiciary apparatus see constitutional code written the contents of the register stages are—  original inquiry   quasi jury inquiry   appellate inquiry §   operations operators and operations on this occasion as on every other be the end what it may to one or other of these two heads will be found reducible whatsoever in the relation and character of a means is contributing to the compassing or say accomplishing or fulfilling of it operator the real entity operation the fictitious emanating as it were from the real entity the idea attached to the word operation is a modification of the idea designated by the word action as that is of the idea attached to the word motion instead of the word operators a convenience will be found in the use made of the word instruments and though the existence of the real entity an operator is precedent where it is not concomitant to the quasiexistence of the fictitious entity designated by the word operation—yet for developing the idea designated on this occasion by the word operation and bringing to view the several sorts of actions it was found to claim by an indisputable title the precedence in the instrument called language or say discourse at any rate in all the generally known modifications of it note on this occasion an imperfection the inconvenient effects of which will be continually exemplifying themselves the want of two different appellations for the designation—one of the act or say the operation—the other of the result whatever it be of that same act or operation the consequence is the necessity of employing for the designation of two ideas so widely different one and the same word unfortunate indeed is the existence of this imperfection it pervades and fills with perplexity the whole texture of the language every word that terminates in tion and many of them that terminate in ment both derived from the latin and common to the italian french spanish and portuguese as well as the english is infected with it application is the act of a party—the partypursuer—requiring execution execution and effect to be given to some article of the body of the law execution when ordered is the act of the judge rendering the service required at his hands by the suitor    probation is the act of the suitor necessary to give warrant and authority for the service so demanded at the hands of the judge execution requires to be distinguished and divided into ultimate and provisional probation requires in like manner to be distinguished and divided into provisional and definitive and that on the part as well of defendant as pursuer of provisional execution the need is accidental only not general and constant it consists in the doing that for a time and in such sort as to be eventually undone should the case be found not to require the performance of definitive execution of which provisional execution the performance is no otherwise consistently with justice performable than as necessary to secure the eventual performance of definitive execution should the case be found to require it by accommodation understand that operation which is performed as often as a person who is not a party to the suit steps in and lends his assistance to a party on either side for the purpose of saving him from an injustice or hardship coupled with injustice to which he might otherwise be subjected in the course of the operations necessary to the prosecution of his pursuit or defence in so doing the person by whom the accommodation is afforded to one or other of the parties at least and perhaps to both subjects himself of necessity to one essential and frequently to several distinct and contingent hardships no other person is admissible for the purpose of liberating a party on the one or the other side of the suit from an otherwise inevitable present disadvantage thus in actual english technical practice the two persons who under the aggregate appellation of bail are admitted to render to a party defendant the service which consists in causing him to be liberated from an imprisonment of indefinite duration to which the rigour of the course of procedure would otherwise subject him are not admitted to the performance of this beneficial service but upon condition of either eventually reconsigning him to that affictive situation or discharging in favour of the pursuer the obligation to subject him to which was the object of the suit subject to these conditions the initiatory allegation has to the purpose of warranting provisional execution so shaped as not to be productive of irreparable damage the effect of probation provisional probation but for the purpose of rendering the provisional execution definitive it requires to be subjected to the controul of any such counterevidence as may be adduced by the defendant together with evidence probative of facts if any such there be the tendency of which is to do away with and render of no effect any facts to which it has happened to be sufficiently established by the evidence advanced on the pursuers side intimate is the connexion between all these several operations necessary are all of them but one to wit auxiliary bondsmanship to the due termination of every suit on the pursuers side in two opposite orders they are capable of being brought to view—  the order in which they are contemplated   the order in which they are performed in the order in which they are contemplated they stand thus—  application   execution execution being the only object to which the application is immediately directed   probation having for its object the engaging the judge to take measures for eventual execution probation commences with application abhorrent to natural procedure is the distinction between allegation or information and evidence in technical procedure alone—in that system alone which had for its object the generation of lies for the purpose of maximizing the number of groundless suits and defences—could any such distinction have originated so many instances in which admission and effect is given to allegation which for the purpose of being punishable in case of mendacity is not considered as evidence so many instances in which admission and effect and thereby allowance and encouragement is given to mendacity innumerable are those instances not a suit that does not commence with one of them and of the endless chain of them the first links are occupied in depriving of liberty any man at the pleasure of any other by whom the faculty of exercising oppression in this shape is ready to be purchased of the judge at the estalished price §   instruments correspondent to operations are instruments for every operation there must be an operator if by a single action the operation is performed there is no room for an instrument associated with the word operator is the idea of an intelligent being with the word instrument that of a nonintelligent being if then the appellative instrument is applied in speaking of a person it must be in an improper and figurative sense but to save words using the word in this figurative sense will notwithstanding its impropriety be frequently found a matter of convenience of the abovementioned operations the system called procedure has been found composed to one or other of these heads every operation performed in the course of it will be found reducible for every one of those operations therefore there will be found instruments beings being either persons or things hence    we have personal instruments and real instruments but portions of discourse in a written form partake of the nature of those two subjectmatters of consideration and operation being the discourse of persons communicated by a sort of things and the use of them being so extended and so continual—hence the need of speaking of a third sort of instruments to wit written within the import of which must be understood to be comprehended quasiwritten for the purpose of those which though not exactly of the nature of written signs are nevertheless employed sometimes in the production of the effect personal instruments are suboperators—instruments in the hands of a superoperator prekensors for example in the hands of the judge   correspondent to application—the operation—the fictitious is applicant the operator the real entity   correspondent to probation—the operation—the fictitious is probator the really existing entity probator is accordingly the term presented by analogy unfortunately the idea it presents is too ample—it is that of the success of the operation termed probation whereas little less frequently is the one followed by nonsuccess than by success to keep clear of misrepresentation to the office here brought to view another term by which nothing is decided as to success must be found instead of probator say then evidenceholder—an appellation unfortunately twoworded for a singleworded one could not be found instruments of application personal instruments are the applicants applicants may be either principal or auxiliary—lending their assistance to the principal and will be either professional or gratuitous thus on the occasion of every judicial application whatsoever may be the object so in particular on the occasion of that sort of application to which it happens to be converted into a suit real instruments of application none written instruments of application are any such portions of discourse in a written form as it has happened to the application to give existence to instruments of probation are personal real or written personal instruments of probation are persons considered either in the character of narrating witnesses or as posseasors of sources of real or of written evidence in all three cases there will be an advantage in speaking of them by the common appellation of evidenceholders holden in the breast until it is uttered is the evidence of the narrating witness narrating is the epithet applied to one species of witness to distinguish him from a very different sort of witness though the two characters are so frequently as it is always desirable that they should be is one person a percipient witness in the breast of the percipient witness is the source of the information—the organ of the narrating witness is the channel through which it is communicated to the judge turbid are the ideas of lawyers under technical procedure correspondently scanty and in proportion inadequate their vocabulary obvious at once and necessary is the distinction between the percipient and the narrating witness never till in this work or those which have emanated from the same source have words been employed in giving expression to it yet how important is this distinction—small indeed it will be seen is the probative force of the narrating witness who has not been a percipient witness in comparison of that of him who has probative force—not even that term did the technical vocabulary contain in it yet without it in what way or by what discourse can you express that which there will be found such continuallyrecurring need to express yet another distinction for giving expression to it say—litigant witness or nonlitigant witness and as synonymous to nonlitigant witness say upon occasion extraneous witness in every modification of the technical system of the testimony—the narrative of a party litigant has more or less use been made yet in none of them has he been spoken of in the character of a witness on the contrary between the character of a party and that of a witness the existence of a sort of incompatibility has been tacitly assumed yet in domestic procedure—in that procedure which being coeval with the origin of the species was in existence and use before the technical system existed even in imagination—seldom is a narrator to be found who is not either himself a litigant witness or imbued with the same affection and liable to be turned aside from the path of truth by the same biases and oh what inconsistency—what twistings and turnings when of one and the same party litigant the testimony is admitted in some cases excluded in other cases—in some cases rigorously exacted in other cases left optional and from the commencement of the reign of technical procedure to the present time how enormous must have been the mass of that injustice of which this exclusion and the unilateral and thence partial admissions deduced from this source must have been productive for these exclusions coupled with these admissions had there been any ground in reason human society antecedently to the institution of the technical system could not have continued its existence but of this hereafter    accommodators novel as it is as a substitute to the longwinded and manyworded appellation—the person by whom accommodation is afforded to another—this or some other universal appellation must of necessity be employed necessity warrants the appellation—practice will ere long familiarize the import of it a work of beneficence is on every occasion the work of the accommodator of benevolence generally and thence presumably of beneficence constantly and unquestionably beneficent accommodator is therefore a denomination by which without impropriety in any shape the accommodator might be designated but for as much as there cannot exist an accommodator who is not beneficent the word beneficent is not necessary and after this explanation may be spared correspondent in some sort though very imperfectly and inadequately to execution is executioner in a sense coextensive with that of execution—in the phrase giving execution and effect it is spoilt for use by the association it has contracted with the idea of an operator exclusively employed in giving execution to a mandate of penal law productive of an effect in the highest degree afflictive for by the word executioner when presented by itself will be presented the idea of a functionary employed in giving termination to life in the person of a defendant in the suit another conjugate of the word execution and like executioner the name of the really existing entity is executor but for use as applied to the present purpose this denomination is also spoilt executor being the denomination given to the species of trustee to whom by the will of a person deceased the disposal of his property reckoning from the time of his decease has been intrusted in case of need for the designation of the person employed in giving execution and effect to a portion of law the term executant may perhaps be found employable correspondent to communication is communicator unfortunately this word labours under the same imperfection as the word probator has been seen labouring under included in the idea presented by it is that of the effect endeavoured at as being actually produced the appellation on this occasion needed is one by which a person employed in making or endeavouring to make communication of the subjectmatter in question shall be designated in case of need as the word executant so the word communicant both of them related by analogy to the word applicant may perhaps be found employable correspondent to recordation is recordator—for shortness termed recorder correspondent to the synonymous appellation registration is registrar in this case these is no difficulty no difference between endeavour and performance he who records not anything is not a recorder he who records anything is a recorder be the recorded matter ever so little or ever so much and so in regard to the registrar §   judication before any application can be made there must be in existence an authority to which at any time it can be made this authority is that of the judge sitting in that which has been called the judicial theatre of the several classes of persons who are as it were actors on that theatre—of their several fimetions and duties a description has been given in the constitutional code chapters from xii to xxix inclusive reference to that portion of matter must be understood to be made in and by everything that here follows coeval with application and probation is judication as to application under the natural system of procedure all application is probative without the judges being at the same time applied to and acting at the very time that he is applied to an application cannot in any case have place without permission to proceed no applicant can be suffered to proceed hence then it is by application made by an applicant that the first moment is occupied but it is by the applicant and the judge in conjunction that occupation is given to the next moment and thereafter to the number of minutes whatever they are during which at the initiative hearing the intercourse continues on each occasion to what judicatory shall or may application be made the answer is short and will naturally be satisfactory to that judicatory from application to which the aggregate convenience of the several parties may most effectually be promoted and provided for no difficulty can have place in those cases which will always be of by far the most frequent occurrence these are where the residence of both or all parties is within the territory of the same judicatory and where the subjectmatter of the suit is also within that same territory the only case in which any difficulty can present itself is that in which the actual residence of the party applying to be admitted pursuer being in the territory of that same judicatory the actual residence of other parties copursuers or defendants is in the territory of a different judicatory—the actual residence of each one of them being at the same time capable of being different from the habitual residence hence by ringing the changes upon these differences the following different cases are producible for holding communication between a judge    and a judgeable the communication beginning with the judge there are two modes—the oral and the epistolary all other circumstances equal the oral it will be seen is by far the best adapted to each of the several ends of justice to the avoidance of nondecision and misdecision—to the avoidance of delay vexation and expense but when the residence habitual or actual of the judgeable is at a certain distance from the judicatory then comes the question—whether the advantage in respect of avoidance of nondecision and misdecision to wit through the inferior instructiveness of the evidence when elicited in the epistolary mode in comparison of the oral mode preponderates or not on this consideration exceptions if any excepted no otherwise it is understood can application if made be entertained than when made in the oral mode and what is moreover understood is that the judicial locations will be to such a degree numerous and the plan of partition by which they are marked out to such a degree equal that from the attendance of a person at the judicatory no considerable inconvenience will in general be produced chapter vii practical general rules §   rules as to minimization of evil on each occasion have constant regard for all the several ends of justice that is to say minimize the sum or the balance of evil composed of the evils opposite respectively to these ends of the several elements of value as applied to pleasures and pains thence to good and evil magnitude—the compound of intensity and duration—being the most apparent be careful not to overlook those which when the good or evil in question is distant are most liable to be overlooked or undervalued—namely propinquity and probability in like manner in the case of any maleficent act or practice whether on the part of persons at large or on the part of judicial functionaries forget not to take into account the evil of the second order—to wit the second order composed of the danger and the alarm the publicly diffusive evil any more than the evil of the first order—composed of the singleseated and the domestically diffusive evil §   rules as to irreparable evil as to irreparable evil it may be such either—  absolutely or   relatively absolutely to wit in its own nature relation had to the nature of man in general relatively to wit relation had to the condition of the particular individual or individuals concerned death is so in its own nature pecuniary evil—pecuniary loss—is in its own nature in a greater degree more easily reparable than evil in any other shape evil of a comparatively inconsiderable amount may be irreparable relation had to the individual or individuals concerned evil which whether absolutely or relatively considered is irreparable in itself may also relatively considered not be irreparable in the way of equivalent death is the only shape in which evil on the part of the immediate sufferer is certainly and invariably irreparable in the way and by means of compensation there is no evil to which it may not happen to be in the instance of the individual in question reparable in the way of equivalent relation had to the individual in question an evil is reparable and exactly repaired when after having sustained the evil and received the compensation it would be a matter of indifference whether to receive the like evil coupled with the like compensation or not what is manifest is—that to no person other than the individual himself can it be known whether in his instance between an evil sustained and a benefit received on account of it any compensation have place or not considered with a view to its irreparability the evil which an individual is liable to suffer is susceptible of the same division and distinction as the sorts of offences to which an individual stands exposed in the evil which is the result of the offence may be seen the sole reason or rational cause for the endeavour on the part of the legislator to exclude or minimize it in this case to minimize evil have more especial care to exclude all such as is irreparable irreparable evil may be produced—  for want of a judicial mandate   by a judicial mandate the sides liable to be affected by it are—  the pursuers   the defendants side of the suit causes or sources from which irreparable evil is mostly liable to flow are—   deperition or ultimate nonforthcomingness of the means of execution   deperition or ultimate nonforthcomingness of the means of proof or say sources of evidence deperition or ultimate nonforthcomingness of means of proof includes if complete deperition of the means of execution to wit in favour of that side to the interest of which in case of the proof the execution would have been subservient of a failure of the means of rommunication deperition or ultimate nonforthcomingness    as well of means of proof as of means of execution may be the result by execution understand as well reciprocal as direct direct it is called in the case where the object of it is to render to the pursuer the service demanded by him reciprocal where it has for object the rendering to a defendant compensation for or security against vexation and expense produced by the pursuit when there are two antagonizing lots of evil considered as liable to be produced the one on the pursuers side of the suit—the other on the defendants—two evils both irreparable or the evil on one side reparable on the other side irreparable forget not to take into account the magnitude and value of each on this occasion let not the imagination be deluded by the impressiveness of the idea attached to the word irreparable loss though certainly irreparable to the amount of a shilling will not be to be guarded against with so much anxiety as a loss though perhaps reparable to the amount of a pound in a wrongimputing yet not penal private suit the irreparable evil to be guarded against is deperition of the means of compensation or other means of satisfaction for the wrong execution in respect of the service demanded by the pursuers at the charge of the defendants side in a purely public penal suit the irreparable evil requiring to be guarded against for the sake of the pursuers side is the impunity of the defendant in the case of his having been in the shape in question a delinquent in every sort of suit the irreparable evils requiring to be guarded against for the sake of the defendants side are—  on erroneous or inadequate grounds conviction and consequent burthen of compensation or punishment or both imposed upon the defendant he in truth not having been guilty not having committed the wrong imputed to him or any other similar to it   the evil composed of the vexation and expense to which by means of the suit he may be subjected—the evil correspondent and opposite to the collateral ends of justice §   rules for the guidance of the judge in the exercise of his ulterior powers on each occasion the direct and first care and endeavour of the judge will be the fulfilment of the direct ends of justice to wit by taking such course or doing that which in each individual instance shall be most conducive to the fulfilment of the direct ends of justice positive and negative further to wit the causing to be rendered when and in so far as due the service demanded by the pursuer his next care will be the fulfilment of the collateral ends of justice to wit by minimizing on each occasion the quantity of evil in its several shapes delay expense and vexation at large at the charge of the several classes of persons in relation to whom his powers will have to be exercised when and in so far as the collateral ends of justice on the one part are seen to antagonize with the direct ends of justice on the other it will be his care to pursue that course by the taking of which the balance on the side of good is greatest upon the whole on each individual occasion as a security for the maximization of the aggregate of good and the minimization of the aggregate of evil he will settle in his own mind and make public declaration of the reasons by the consideration of which his conduct has been determined which reasons will consist in the allegation of so many items in the account of evil on both sides magnitude propinquity certainty or say probability and extent—being in relation to each head of good and evil taken into the account proportioned to the clearness with which those reasons are conceived will be his own assurance and satisfaction of the conformity of his proceedings with the ends and dictates of justice proportioned to the clearness with which they are expressed will be the satisfaction afforded to the superordinate authorities to whom he is responsible for these purposes the constitutional code on the principles of which this procedure code has been grounded gives to his legal power a latitude to which in general there are no fixed limits and at the same time maximizing according to its utmost endeavours the efficacy of the checks provided for preventing such his powers from being employed to any sinister purpose with a view to the collateral ends of justice the following are among the cautions which he will have to observe— the applicant having been received in the character of pursuer or pursuers proxy and in support of the application his evidence appropriate or simply indicative or both elicited—the judge will not in relation to any other person of whatever description a proposed defendant proposed witness if any or proposed copursuer if any perform any operation liable to be productive of vexation or expense unless in his view of the matter taking such evidence for correct a probability has place that at the charge of the proposed defendant the service demanded or some other more or less analogous to it is due to the minimization of avoidable delay he will have especial regard of delay every moment beyond what is necessary to the direct ends is detrimental to the direct ends  0 as well as to the collateral ends of justice to the direct ends by the intermediate eventual decease of the pursuer by chance of deperition of sources of evidence on both sides and in case of personal evidence not already in writing danger of diminution of clearness correctness and completeness by faultiness of recollection to the collateral ends—to the prejudice of the pursuers side in so far as in the right by and in proportion to the vexation attached to the nonpossession of the service due—and incidentally by and in proportion to the expense the need of which may have been produced by intervening accident to the prejudice of the defendants side if in the wrong in the greatest number of individual cases it will not be since the longer it continues the longer he remains exempted from the service sought to be exacted at his charge but in so far as he is in the right he stands exposed by it equally with the pursuer to sufferance to the prejudice of the direct ends of justice by deperition and deterioration of evidence as above and proportioned to his assurance of his being in the right is the vexation he experiences from the apprehension of being ultimately regarded as being in the wrong and on that account unduly subjected to the service which though not due is demanded at his charge but of two or more applications made at the same time no one is there which may not of necessity be made to suffer delay by the just demands made by others in an indefinite number upon the judges time what may also happen is that by deferring that which in the natural order of inquiry would be the next judicial operation to be performed advantage may be produced preponderating over the disadvantage to any or all the ends of justice as often as this is the case the judge will accordingly defer to some future time indicated the performance of such next judicial service but for reason and justification he will bring to view the particular incident or incidents by which exception has appeared to be made to the general rule in buonapartes civil code the parties being in the judicatory of the justice of the peace admitted into the presence of each other and the judge—great is the anxiety expressed to prevent confusion on the occasion of such altercation as may naturally be expected and on that account for the prevention of that inconvenience no person other than the judge is authorized to put a question to any other in this anxiety no cause for disapprobation can assuredly be found especially when the character of the people he had to deal with is considered in english judicature all cause for any such anxiety is effectually excluded not existing in the presence of the judge parties cannot quarrel or annoy each other in the presence of the judge saving the sparingly exercised right of the judge to put questions to no party on either side is any question put by any sort of person but an advocate nor unless between advocate and advocate or in an extraordinary case in guarded terms between advocate and judge can altercation in any shape have place among the cares of the judge will in like manner be the minimization of the number of persons of whatever description operated upon by the exercise of his power as also in the instance of each such person the number and vexatiousness of the operations imposed upon them respectively accordingly between the individual by whom in each instance the compliance necessary to the reddition of the service in question is to be produced he will avoid interposing without necessity any intermediate hand the reasons are—   by every such intermediate hand so interposed is produced a chance of delay and a chance of ultimate failure   by every such intermediate hand so interposed is produced vexation if no compensation or no more than inadequate compensation be accorded and in so far as compensation is accorded expense middleagencysparing is the name given to this rule of the application capable of being made of the middleagencysparing rule examples are as follows—   as per constitutional code chap xii judiciary collectively giving to each immediate judge once in possession of a suit the faculty of operating for the purpose of it in the territory of any and every other immediate judge instead of an address from the judge of the originating judicatory to the judge of the territory in which such several operations have to be performed for though for various purposes notice of what is done may be requisite for the information of the judge in whose territory the operation is to be performed so is it also at the same time for every needful purpose sufficient by deferring the operation till after an answer from the judge in question had been received or time for the reception of it elapsed proportionable delay would be produced and that without need or use when for the purpose of justice at the charge of any person whether in the situation of defendant or any other the transfer of any subjectmatter of property is to be made let not the cooperation or consent of such person be made necessary to the validity of such transfer if at the hands of the person in question disclosure of any matter of fact relative to such property be necessary it will be exacted accordingly but to no effect    for which such disclosure may be requisite can concurrence in any way in the act of transfer be needful or of use §   inflexible regulations none for minimizing evil the main caution is in no case on no occasion to lay down inflexible rules in particular inflexible rules as to quantity—rules of which on any occasion the effect may be to prevent the minimization of evil in the individual case calling for decision at the hands of the judge the pretence in this case is the avoiding to place arbitrary power in the hands of the judge but the good thus sought is illusory in the hands of a judge power in whatsoever degree arbitrary is no otherwise an evil than in so far as its effect is to produce evil in a tangible shape—to wit human suffering—in the breasts of individuals but where an inflexible rule as to the quantity of anything is laid down the chances against its not producing evil in excess are as infinity to one against abuse of power the only effectual or efficient security is composed of responsibility substantial punitional and dislocational responsibility legal and moral for the prevention of the abuse of power on the part of judges the appropriate place is accordingly not so much in the procedure code as in the constitutional code for exemplification of the evil certain of being produced by inflexible rules in regard to quantity take the three capital objects—matter of satisfaction matter of punishment and length of time first as to the quantity of the matter of compensation or other means of satisfaction if there be a case in which of the compensation thus inflexibly fixed the quantity be deficient—in such sort deficient as to be inferior to the profit obtainable by the wrong—it operates by the amount of the difference as an inducement to commit the wrong instead of operating as a means of repression for the prevention of it so likewise in the case of punishment if in the case of any crime the punishment is all things taken together clearly inferior to the profit obtainable in the individual instance in question by means of the crime the effect of the socalled punishment is to operate by the amount of the difference not as a repressive bond for the prevention but as an incentive and encouragement towards the commission of the crime to one offence by which in the individual case in question the delinquent has gained £ 00 let £ 0 and no more have been the sum fixed on the obligation of paying which constitutes the sole punishment imposed the effect of the law is to operate as a bounty upon the commission of the prohibited act—of the act thus inexpertly prohibited—as a county to the amount of £ 0 subject to the deduction of the expense and the equivalent for the vexation in other shapes attached to the situation of defendant in these cases in the article of satisfaction and punishment provision against improvidence in this shape belongs obviously to the field of penal law not directly to the field of judicial procedure of improvidence in this shape the marks are in a particular degree conspicuous in buonapartes codes now as to the fixation of length of time length of time allotted for the performance of various sorts of operations in general the pretence or expected good is avoidance of delay but in general besides the production of the opposite evil precipitation and thence the evil correspondent and opposite to the direct ends of justice it has for its effect increase of delay or increase of expense and vexation or all three a year was the maximum to which frederick the great of prussia fixed the greatest length of a suit at law in his dominions not small was the service he was regarded by himself and by many another wellwisher to justice as having by this exploit rendered to justice what was the consequence in the first place wheresoever the quantity of business necessary to the avoidance of the evil opposite to the direct ends of justice positive and negative could not be performed within that time—production of the evil correspondent and opposite to the direct ends of justice in the case of a to a certain degree complicated mercantile account for example in the case of the death or insolvency of a large capitalist having extensive dealings with foreign states this could not but be frequently exemplified and in any case by the expatriation of a single witness if a necessary one the same impossibility of rendering justice within the so allotted compass of time would be produced of a rule thus improvidently allcomprehensive delay the very evil sought to be thus remedied would naturally be not uncommonly among the fruits this being the length allotted to the sittings a judge to whose sinister interest delay showed itself favourable would avail himself of the ordinance to run on to the full length of it this he would say is what the ordinance requires well to this ordinance i have paid unquestionable obedience under the english system generally speaking fixed lengths of time are allotted for every operation lengths of time without any the smallest regard to the quantity of time necessary to the ends of justice—the different quantities demanded by different distances between place and place—the differences in respect of the degree of complication    in the causes—the abodes of parties and necessary witnesses in a word not any the smallest regard is in any part of the system of fixation paid to the circumstances nor therefore to the interest or feelings of any of the individuals concerned in so far as the time is rendered unsusceptible of enlargement here in many instances to a certainty is evil to a vast amount necessitated—evil in that shape in which it is correspondent and opposite to the direct ends of justice in so far as it is susceptible of being enlarged here is a quantity more or less considerable added to the fixed quantity of delay vexation and expense for application must be made to the judicatory—application for the additional quantity of time in support of the application evidence must be produced—application with fees to solicitors advocates subordinate judicial officers and perhaps judges—evidence carefully manufactured into the most unapt delusive and expensive shape thus goes on the game of leapfrog between strictness and liberality—each being in this as on every other occasion covered by a thick coating of wellpaid and selfapplied applause in english practice whenever you see or hear the word strictness expect to see injustice you will seldom be disappointed of the judicatories selfstyled equity courts dilatoriness is to the knowledge of everybody the characteristic and most glaring cardinal vice but could any unpaid eye endure to look into it precipitation might be seen carried to a no less high degree of perfection precipitation by which in an extensive class of cases the production of the evils correspondent and opposite to the direct ends of justice is habitually and with certainty secured even at the commencement of every suit in this kind of judicatory the time allotted is in most instances—considering the work that is to be done by it and the lengths of necessary journeys—too short to admit of the work being done for remedy on payment of £   s to judges and co two several additions may be made by the half of which it is rendered in most cases too long a temptation is in every case held out to purchase a third length of delay but under this indulgence lies a trap in which the comparatively inexperienced lawpractitioners are frequently caught and this in such sort as to produce to the dismay of their respective and unsuspecting clients the evil correspondent and opposite to the direct end of justice—the client loses his cause because willingly or unwillingly his lawyers have been deceived §   substitution to inflexible rules of the several rules laid down in this code there is not one that is meant to be regarded as inflexible no one is there from which in case of necessity the judge may not depart but as often as he thus departs the constituted authorities the publicopinion tribunal included will be looking to him for the reason—the specific reason or reasons by the contemplation of which such departure shall have been produced and as often as he does this without the assignment of any specific reason he will be considered as having violated his official duty every such reason will consist in an indication of the evil which in the individual case in question would result from compliance with the rule and with a proof that by the aberration either no evil in any shape has been produced or none but what has been out weighed by concomitant good so in regard to exceptions in many instances where a rule is laid down in the terms of it reservation is made of exceptions and a string of exceptions is thereupon subjoined to every such rule the judge is at liberty to add an exception but for every such exception an appropriate and sufficient reason will be looked for at his hands §   which side is most likely to be in the right antecedently to the view presented by the inquiry into the particular fact of the individual case the general presumption arising out of the several relative situations will be in favour of the pursuers which is as much as to say in disfavour of the defendants side the general reason is that without some ground of assurance and belief in respect of the correctness of his judgment it is not likely that a person would engage in or would subject himself to the vexation and expense attached to the character of pursuer even in case of success—together with the still more ample eventual quantity in case of ill success thus on the score of mere selfregarding interest particularly when the force of the additional restriction applicable by sympathetic affection is added—a moral power which how weak soever in comparison with selfregarding affection should not in this any more than any other case be left altogether out of the account at the same time the greater the success with which the endeavour to attain the ends of justice direct and collateral is crowned the less will be the difference produced in that respect between the two correlative situations the less the vexation and expense attached to the situation the less effective will be the restraints the tendency of which is to prevent a person from embarking in it    in so far as the present proposed code is rightly directed to those exclusively legitimate ends strong is the contrast it will be seen to form with the english system of procedure not to speak of others less renowned for a supposed regard for the ends of justice chapter viii judicial application §   judicial application—what the system of judicial procedure it has been seen has for its proper object the giving execution and effect to the ordinances of the legislature the functionary by the exercise of whose function execution and effect is given to the ordinances of the legislature is the judge the means by which that result is produced is the rendering to a person who having need of it makes application to him accordingly for the sort of service by the rendering of which the result is produced name of such appropriate services—judicial services the species of application by which such judicial service is called for call it a demand the aggregate of the whole operation produced by a judicial demand from the demand to the last operation by which execution and effect is given to the portion of law in question both inclusive—call it a suit in law or for shortness a suit in english practice—by a denomination manifestly inappropriate and productive of continual confusion—it is also called a cause but the case in which a demand made at the hands of a judge for services tending to the giving execution and effect to some corresponding portion of the text of the law is the service called for—is but one out of several cases in which for judicial service tending to the production of that effect application may be made and that application complied with accordingly of divers sorts of application by each of which judicial services of the tendency in question are applied for and demanded—the application called a judicial demand and by which if ordered commencement is given to a suit is but one by a judicial application understand an application made to a judge as such—by any person other than a judge as such by any person who is desirous of obtaining judicial service in any shape a judicial application may accordingly be made by judicial service understand every such service as a judge as such is warranted by law in rendering to any person or persons the services which it belongs to a judge as such to render will be mostly those which are rendered in contentious or say contested cases—that is to say cases in which a suit has been instituted and continues depending but neither are cases wanting in which without any suit instituted it belongs to the judge to render certain appropriate services so many of these cases—so many are the different purposes for which a judicial application may be made certain cases moreover there are in which for the adjustment of the different interests concerned judicial services may be necessary even where no disagreement as between party and party has taken place of this sort is the case where the demand made to the judge is simply requisitive and not with relation to any party either criminative or inculpative §   applicants judicatory—what it being desirable in so far as practicable that the territory in which the person in question will be most likely to be called upon to pay judiciary attendance should be the territory in which he has his most ordinary habitation in contradistinction and in preference to every more distant judicatory hence it is desirable that by persons in general considered in respect of the need they may have to make judiciary application it should be understood what in the case of an applicant is meant by his judicatory—as in the case of a judge by his territory by the applicants judicatory understand the judicatory belonging to and situate in the subdistrict in which as housekeeper or inmate as per election code the applicant has his settled habitation if any such he has if in each of divers subdistricts he has a settled habitation or divers settled habitations so many as there are of these subdistricts so many are his judicatories to an applicant who has a settled habitation elsewhere but not in the subdistrict to the judicatory of which he makes his application—as also to an applicant who has no settled abode—the judicatory whatsoever it be to which on the occasion in question he makes such his application is on and for that occasion his judicatory say his occasional judicatory of the facility thus afforded to persons in the character of judicial applicants no increase of vexation to persons having occasion to act in a judicatory in any other character such as that of a defendant or that of a witness in a suit will it will be seen be the result in every case therefore any person whose desire it is to make application to a judicatory for any purpose may in the first instance make application to his own judicatory if the design of his application being to commence a suit against any person the domicile    of that person is within the same local field of judicature the case is in that respect the ordinary case if such intended defendant has not any domicile within that same field the case is in that respect an extraordinary case it constitutes one of the natural causes of obstruction to the course of justice provision for which is made elsewhere on hearing him the judge will inform him what course to take §   order of making application for all persons waiting to be heard as applicants the station is in the visitors gallery as to which see constitutional code on entrance into the gallery the intended applicant receives from the doorkeeper a ticket the tickets are numbered in numerical order he who at or after the opening of the door came first received a ticket no   he who came next no   and so on immediately as the business of an applicant is finished the judge or registrar makes a sign to the doorkeeper of the gallery the doorkeeper calling to the expectant applicant whose number entitles him to be next heard looks at his ticket and directs him forthwith to the applicants station if applicants more than one are desirous of speaking on the same occasion and in support of the same application they must first have agreed among themselves as to the order in which they shall speak if the whole number persist in speaking together they will all of them be made to withdraw until they have agreed upon the order of procedure as above if with desires mutually opposite a number of applicants offer themselves to speak on the same occasion in relation to the same matter each struggling to be heard before the rest the order of procedure will be decided among them by lot §   personal attendance purposes for which the personal attendance of an applicant in the justicechamber while making his application may be necessary or useful with reference to his own desires are—   furnishing appropriate evidence as to facts collative and ablative say appropriateselfservingevidencefurnishing   furnishing indicative evidence as to the above say indicativeevidencefurnishing   furnishing at the instance of the judge any such evidence as though the tendency of it may be contrary to his desires may be necessary to the preserving of other persons from vexation and expense contrary to the ends of justice say furnishing selfdisserving or confessional evidence   furnishing security against undue vexation imposable upon others on the occasion of the application say responsibilityaffording   furnishing means of coenduring communication with him for the purpose of the application say accessibilitysecuring or meansofcommunicationaffording   receiving from the judge warning against the damage liable to be sustained from sinister interest of proxies professional or even gratuitous say tutelaryadvicereceiving   receiving at the best hand i e in an immediate way the advice of the judge as to proceeding or not proceeding in the application as to the mode best adapted to the ends of justice say ulteriorcourseconcerting or settling as to responsibilityaffording—evils against which on the occasion of a judiciary application appropriate security may be necessary are—   waste of judicatorys time thence delay or even denial of justice to those who otherwise would at so much the earlier time have been litigants   undue vexation and expense to persons whose interest according to the service demanded by the application may come to be detrimented by ulterior proceedings but in so far as the applicant though he be not the principal can give as good security against these evils as the principal could his attendance may be as useful as the principals as to accessibilitysecuring or meansofcommunicationaffording—the uses of securing adequately lasting means of certain communication with the applicant are two viz—   securing to him if granted the service demanded   securing the public and individuals against the evils just mentioned hence the persons communication with whom should be secured are—  the principal at any rate   the applicant if a person other than the principal but in so far as this security can be as effectually afforded by the applicant as by the principal the principals attendance is needless for this purpose as to tutelaryadvicereceiving—as to this purpose in so far as the need has place the demand for the principals attendance is strongest true it is that if the need exists it may be made visible to him by the record of what passed between his proxy and the    judge and that for the purpose of such advice the judge may if he sees reason command the principals attendance but on the matter of the record he may be more or less illqualified to form a judgment for this purpose and there may be reason for his receiving the judges advice though by indolence or some other motive the judge may be prevented from commanding his attendance for that purpose as to ulteriorcoursesettling—if the case be such that the principal has need of the judges tutelary advice as above the ulterior course which it will be most fit for the procedure to receive may depend upon the nature of such tutelary advice these considerations will serve as a memento to the judge to be on the watch for the need which may have place in relation to this tutelary advice as to confessorialevidencefurnishing—for the prevention of evils to other interessees true it is that the attendance of the principal may after the attendance of the proxy require to be exacted but supposing it exacted time enough for such preventive purpose the exaction of it in the first instance is to this purpose needless §   applicants—who on the occasion of a judicial application applicants require to be distinguished in the first place into principals and proxies a principal applicant is he by whom the application is made on his own account a proxy applicant is he whose application is made on an account of another or others in respect of a jointinterest the same person may be applicant on his own account and likewise on account of his cointeressees in relation to the benefit or the burthen which is the object of the application the applicant may be possessed or not of special interest or any peculiar and selfregarding interest in the subjectmatter of the application a person the purpose of whose application is the procuring some benefit for or the averting some burthen from an individual or a community with whom he is not connected by any special tie of selfregarding interest is an applicant not possessed of any special interest in the subjectmatter of his application a special interessee may be so either on a purely selfaccount or on a purely trustaccount or on a compoundaccount in so far as a person is interested on behalf of another to whose interest he stands bound to give special support he is styled a trustee on behalf of such other or others and the interest he thus possesses is styled a fiduciary interest and the law by which he is so bound is styled a trustcreating law the person on whose account—for whose sake the trust is created is styled a principal in the trust or say a benefitendary when a trust is created by law as above it may be either with or without the instrumentality of a person or persons operating to that purpose when it is with such instrumentality the person or persons so acting may be styled trustee or trustees in this case there are three parties connected and jointly interested—to wit   the benefitendary   the trustee   the trustor or trustors or say the trustmaker or trustmakers in some cases the trustor and trustee may be the same person in these cases the trustee is a selfconstituted trustee or say an uncommissioned trustee when it is by the benefitendary that under the sanction of the law the trust is created and a person or persons constituted and created trustee or trustees it is by contract between such benefitendary on the one part and the trustee or trustees on the other examples of trusts and trustees created by act of law without the instrumentality of any person or persons are as follow—   a husband acting and applying on account of his wife   a father in quality of natural that is to say lawlocated guardian to his son or daughter under age   a mother in default of her husband in quality of natural that is to say lawlocated guardian to her son or daughter under age   a guardian in the case where without need of his own instrumentality he is lawlocated as such in relation to a person under age   a guardian in the case where without need of his own instrumentality a person is constituted such with relation to a person labouring under mental derangement examples of trusts and trustees created such by act of law by and with the instrumentality of the trustmaker but without    the instrumentality of the beneficiendaries are as follow—   a testamentarilylocated postobituary administrator the beneficiendaries in this case with or without the administrator himself are the cointeressees as above in the mass of property left vacant by the death   the case where a person desirous of conferring a benefit on a certain person or persons invests a mass of property in the hands of a trustee or trustees in trust to be disposed of in a certain way mentioned for the benefit of a person or persons in the character of a beneficiendary or set of beneficiendaries examples of trusts and trustees created under the sanction of the law by the trustor and trustors and the beneficiendary and beneficiendaries in the way of contract are—   the case of a general agent and his principal a general agent to wit or trustee to whom the principal as beneficiendary entrusts the management of his pecuniary and other interests in general to this head belongs the case of a steward receiving the whole income of his principal   the case of a special agent acting in the capacity of a steward of a particular landed estate   the case of the manager of a manufacturing concern   the case of an agent or factor acting in the sale of a particular article or set of articles whether in the way of ordinary sale or in the way of auction   the case of an agent or factor acting as such in behalf of a principal habitually or temporarily resident in a foreign country in the constitutional code throughout but more particularly in those chapters which concern the business of the administrators department may be seen mention made of divers functions as exercisable by public functionaries for the benefit of the public in the instance of many if not all of them functions of the same nature and thereby susceptible of the same denomination are exercisable and everywhere habitually exercised by individuals in the character of trustees on behalf of individuals and bodies of men in the character of beneficiendaries examples of applicant cointeressees are— where a partner attends on account of himself and his copartner in respect of the partnership estates a person attending on account of the mass of property belonging to an individual or a partnership in a state of insolvency a person attending on behalf of a bodycorporate associated by law and being or not being a member thereof a person attending as a representative or member of a body of persons associated either promiscuously or on a special occasion and for a special purpose but not incorporated by any legal instrument a person attending in a case of alleged and supposed necessity in the character of a selfconstituted trustee for any of the classes of principals above mentioned on the ground that by negligence or sinister design or by reason of a blameless want of appropriate information on the part of the proper trustee or trustees the interest of the principal would but for such application be exposed to suffer irreparable damage §   interessees—who a person who on any account makes judicial application to a judicatory becomes by so doing or assumes himself to be an interessee interessee is a word bearing reference to some subjectmatter by an interessee understand a person possessing a legal interest an interest sanctioned or considered as being about to be sanctioned by law in the way of profit or loss in some assignable subjectmatter such interest a man may possess either on his own account or on that of another if and so far as it is on his own account it is a selfaccount interest if and so far as it is on account of another person or persons it is a trustaccount a person who with reference to the same subjectmatter is a selfaccount interessee and a trustaccount interessee may be styled a jointaccount trustee an applicant applying on behalf of a number of selfaccount cointeresses is with relation to them a representative he is on that occasion their representative if he is one of their number a jointaccount representative if he is not of their number a trusteerepresentative of an interessees becoming such the cause is either his own agency alone or the agency of some other person or persons alone or his own agency in conjunction with that of some other person or persons in the first case he is a purely selfconstituted interessee in the second case a located interessee in the third case a consenting located trustee a located trustee is located either by the law that is to say by the legislature alone with or without his consent or by the law and some other person or persons jointly in the first case there is no trustor in the second there is a trustor or set of trustors of cases in which a trustee is located by the law alone examples are as follow— a father in respect of the power exercised by him in relation to and over his children a husband in respect of any such power as is given him by law to he exercised in relation to and over his wife a guardian in respect of the power over the person and property of his or her ward    in so far as established by law without need of concurrence on the part of any person a trustee may be such either without power or with power over persons or things a selfconstituted trustee as above is a trustee without legal power without commission from any beneficiendary or any located trustee or the law—undertaking the performance of a certain service for the benefit of the beneficiendary he constitutes himself in so far a servant of such beneficiendary and for damage done to any person on the occasion of such service or supposed or pretended service he is compensationally and in case of sinister design and evil consciousness or temerity punitionally responsible of jointaccount representative applicants examples are as follow—   a person applying as member of a private partnership   a person applying as member of a jointstock company   a person applying as one of two or more trustees located as such with power over a mass of property placed at their disposal for their own joint benefit wheresoever a trustee is located as such a trust is said to be established by a trust understand a power burthened with obligation—with the obligation of giving to the power such exercise as in some particular way to render it serviceable to some person or persons determinate or indeterminate in any number up to that of all the inhabitants of the political state parties to every trust are—first a person or persons by whom the service is intended to be rendered second a beneficiendary or beneficiendaries to whom the service is intended to be rendered if it were by a single individual that the trustee or trustees was or were located he in relation to them is locator—sole locator if divers individuals each of them is a joint locator a trustor by whom a trust is established by the location of a certain trustee or certain trustees with power for continuing the trust and preventing its extinction by successive acts of location may be styled the founder of that same trust §   application how commenced at the proper station the applicant sits or stands in silence until addressed by the judge judge to applicant—what is it you have to tell us of—   a service which you claim for yourself or any one at the hands of any one   a wrong for which you claim for yourself or any one satisfaction at the charge of any one   a public offence as to which you are ready to give us information   or anything and what else after utterance of the introductive question ending with the words tell us of the judge makes a short pause to give time to the applicant to say prepared sir or i am prepared—if such be the case by the word prepared the judge understands that the applicant is sufficiently prepared to state the nature of his application under one or other of the above heads without need of assistance from the judge if no such intimation is conveyed then only it is that the judge proceeds to enumerate the several abovementioned purposes and modes of contentious application that the applicant may settle with himself and declare to which of them the matter he has to state belongs if for want of appropriate aptitude the applicant is unable to give in the first instance an intelligible answer to the above questions in such manner as to refer the case to any one of the general heads already brought to view the judge will continue hearing and interrogating him till the import of his application is sufficiently ascertained for giving facility to these examinations as well as for other purposes a set of appropriate tables will have been provided and kept hung up in the justicechamber in such manner as to be legible to the greatest possible number of persons at once as also the like in smaller form in such sort that one copy may be held in hand by the applicant and another by the judge examples of these tables are as follows— table   table of services exigible or rights obtainable containing a list of the several sorts of effective services which by the corresponding judicial services performed by the judge one person may claim at the hands of another without the imputation of wrong from the not having rendered them adding to each service the several efficient causes of the right or title to receive it table   table of wrongs private and publicoprivate with the correspondent remedies consisting in modes of satisfaction with or without modes of punishment added or substituted to satisfaction as the case may be table   table of purely public wrongs with the correspondent remedies for these several tables heads and matter may be seen in the introduction to the principles of morals and legislation and in the traitè de législation civile et pénale if the applicant can read the judge causes such of these tables as may serve for his assistance to be put into his hands having in his own hand or view copies of the same if the applicant cannot read the copy which    the judge has assists him in putting questions or giving instructions to the applicant as the case may require if the application be contentious the conversation will proceed as per chapter xii initiatory hearing if the application be uncontentious the applicant will name it as above by its appropriate generic denomination to save time these denominations will not like the others be recited by the judge they are of comparatively rare occurrence nor will they need any of them to be made by any person who is not able to explain himself sufficiently on the subject to wit either by perusal of the code or by previous conference with some friend from whom sufficient instruction and direction will have been obtained in any case it may be either on the applicants own account or on account of some other person that the application is made but how the matter stands in this respect the judge will without difficulty understand from the applicants statement interrogations to that effect need not therefore be included in the judges address as above for the several cases in which one person may make application on behalf of another see chapter xii initiatory hearing at the commencement of the conversation or at any time in the course of it if it be clear that the applicant can read the judge with his hand may point to and if near enough touch the spot on which the legend containing the warning against falsehood is displayed as to which see chapter judiciary collectively ch xii in the constitutional code in the case of an information he will take the same course as above for ascertaining the nature of the wrong complained of or the service to which the party in question has a right if it be the case of a wrong as it commonly will be and most commonly that of a crime he will collect from the informant whether he be or be not desirous or content to be a pursuer alone or in conjunction with some other individual or the government advocate or both which done he will determine as to the complying or not complying with the desire in this case more particularly a question table to come under consideration will be whether the fact spoken to in the information be the criminal act itself or only a fact capable of operating in the character of circumstantial evidence and in both cases whether according to his account the informant was in relation to the fact in question himself a percipient witness or whether all he has to speak to is his having reason to believe that another person known or unknown to him may probably have been in relation to it a percipient witness in this latter case comes the demand for investigation as explained in another chapter as already observed there is no sort of case in which there may not be need of such investigatory process nor any in which the service rendered to parties by the employment of it may not outweigh the vexation and expense but in england it not being employed but in cases regarded as belonging to the highest classes of crimes or in judicatories into which the eye of the public scarcely penetrates those higher classes of cases are the only ones in which the need of it can be expected to present itself to the generality of readers as to the person if any to whom the address shall be made by the judge before any is made to the defendant—here again is a point in relation to which an option will be to be made by the judge so likewise in regard to the three several modes of address above mentioned on this occasion too will come the consideration whether to consign the function of pursuer to the government advocate and no sooner does reason sufficient for this operation present itself than the judge will perform it accordingly that his opinion and decision respecting the points above mentioned may be heard §   application—its purposes in regard to purposes the leading principle seems to be that to all purposes that can with propriety be termed judicial the faculty ought to be open to exercise and to render the purpose judicial it is not necessary that on the occasion in question a suit should actually have been instituted it is sufficient if either a probability having place that a suit of a certain description will be instituted it will in probability be conducive to the ends of justice that the service aimed at by the application should be granted or that if the service be granted a suit conducive to the ends of justice may in probability be instituted and the ends of justice thereby attained in a case in which but for this same service a suit might otherwise not have been instituted and thereby the ends of justice might have failed of being attained cases there are in which though strictly speaking the business is not of a judicial nature inasmuch as no contestation hath as yet place and though at the hands of the judge no judicial termination of a suit may come to or be intended to be called for—yet among the powers necessary to be exercised for the accomplishment of this desirable purpose are some of those which are indisputably attached to the office of judges of this sort is the evidenceeliciting power and function on the present occasion will be added certain    powers the demand for the exercise of which is created by some accident or other event by which it cannot without previous inquiry that is to say elicitation of evidence be ascertained whether or not there may not be litiscontestation and in consequence of it demand for the exercise of powers exclusively attached to the office of judge had the state of facts been previously known the powers necessary to the production of the desirable effect—for instance the staying or reparation of calamity in this or that shape—might have been exercised by other efficient hands but no such hands being in readiness and those of the judge being in readiness it is by them that the powers in question are exerciseable with more effect than by any other and by them that it is accordingly fit they should be exercised the purposes for which an individual may make application to a judge as such are either—  ordinary   extraordinary the ordinary are—  contentious   simply informative the extraordinary are—  consultative   damage preventive   prospectiveevidencesecuring purpose—contentious by the contentious purpose understand the purpose to institute a suit at law when from the declaration made by the applicant it appears that this is his purpose and when by the judge his prosecution of this purpose is allowed the suit is declared to be instituted and the hearing thus going on is declared to be the initiatory hearing in relation to this same suit the applicant in this case is a pursuer purpose—simply informative in contemplation of a certain criminal offence or wrong from which he or some other individual or the public at large has suffered damage or as he supposes was in danger of receiving damage—an applicant who is desirous that pursuit on the ground thereof be made by some one else for example by the constituted authorities but is not desirous to act for himself as pursuer desires to be admitted to deliver information thereto relative—such applicant is an informant if in contemplation of an eventual suit purely nonpenal information through regard to the ends of justice or to the welfare of a party supposed to be interested is given by an individual who has not himself any special interest in such suit—this application is that of a noncommissioned proxy in english practice on both these grounds applications have place every day in certain criminal cases the cases are mostly those in which the punishment attributed to the offence rises to the height of what is so unintelligibly called felony but if in a judicial case of this sort the receipt of information is capable of being of any use so is it in every other yet in no other case is there a judge who will receive it the sort of judge by whom in this case the information is received is not the judge under whom the suit will receive its termination but the sort of judge by whom a sort of preliminary incomplete and neverconclusive inquiry is carried on to wit the justice of the peace purpose—consultative by the consultative purpose understand the purpose which is in view when being in doubt concerning the interpretation that may eventually be put by the judge on a certain portion of the body of the law the application has for its object the calling into exercise the judges preinterpretative function the applicant in this case is a consultant the motive for the consultation is—either for his own sake or that of some person in whose welfare he takes an interest where a certain course in which the law has as he supposes a bearing—an anxiety to know in what manner it would by the judge be eventually regarded as bearing of the cases in which a demand for an application for this purpose may have place examples are as follows—  conveyance the applicant desirous of making on certain conditions conveyance of a certain right of or relating to a certain mass of property but not sufficiently assured of the validity or the impunibility of such conveyance   contract so in regard to a contract to a certain effect   prohibited acts so in regard to a certain act at large which he is desirous of performing but is not sufficiently assured of its not being regarded as prohibited and thence punishable purpose—damagepreventive according to the source of the damage this purpose may be—  calamity—damagepreventive   delinquency—damagepreventive   absenteeship—damagepreventive for examples of the modification of which calamity is susceptible see constitutional code chapter xi §   preventive service minister so likewise for damages through delinquency under calamity include casualty the difference being only as between greater and less determinate separative line there is none for the prevention of calamity—prevention of the commencement or the continuance as the case may be—application may also be made to a preventiveservice functionary as per const code or to the local headman if for the rendering of the service needed powers such as belong to the judge and not to those two other functionaries respectively are necessary then is it to the judge alone that application will be to be made and if made to either of those other functionaries the applicant will by them be referred to the judge by the absenteeshipdamage understand  0 that which is liable to have place for want of proprietary care the proprietor known or unknown distant from the spot and no other person at hand with sufficient authority and inclination to prevent the damage examples are—   agricultural produce perishing for want of being gathered in   agricultural livestock perishing for want of sustenance   perishable stock in trade perishing for want of appropriate care or sale for this purpose application may also be made to the local headman purpose—prospectiveevidence securing the purpose here is the saving a right or a means of repressing a wrong from being lost for want of appropriate and judicially receivable evidence personal evidence is liable to be lost by death physical inability or local transfer of the person from whom it should have come written and other real evidence by destruction mislaying or local transfer if after commencement of a suit grounded on it evidence should be made forthcoming so should it before reason in both cases the same by securing it before the suit a suit may in many cases be prevented in nonpenal cases the need is more apt than in penal cases to have place but as to the supply if in any case conducive to the ends of justice so it is in every other the person from whom the evidence is needed may be the applicant or any other person in the first case all that is demanded is that the evidence which the applicant is ready to deliver either be received and recorded added or substituted in the other case is the demand that as in an already existing suit an appropriate order be delivered ordering by whom when where and how it is to be delivered the applicant in the first case is a prospective evidence offerer in the other a prospective evidence demandant in both cases precautionary arrangements are needed for the prevention of abuse under the english system application for this purpose is not altogether without example but by the example such as it is so far from being removed the imputation of improvidence and inaptitude is but established and exposed coextensive with the whole field of legislation and judicature is as above the need under the english system no more than a corner of that same field is supplied as to the means of obtainment so far from being obtainable without a suit it is not obtainable without a suit of the most expensive kind—a suit in equity instituted for that sole purpose unless already instituted for some other field of supply a portion of the field of equity jurisdiction what the whole is belongs to the category of things unknown and unknowable so likewise what this portion is on each occasion the whole and the part are whatever the judge pleases within that part does your case entitle you to the service ere you can form the slightest guess you have an ocean of distinctions to wade through—distinctions without reason and without end ask the chancellor and when you have distributed a few hundreds or a few thousands of pounds among him and his partners creatures and dependants—at the end of a course of years he will either tell you or not tell you and if he tells you he will either grant you the supply or refuse it making proclamation all the while of the profundity of his reflection the acuteness of his discernment and the anxiety of his fostering care when thus granted in words you will take proceedings for obtaining it in effect and before they are concluded be not surprised if the evidence has perished §   mode oral—why no otherwise than orally delivered and in the justicechamber is any judiciary application receivable but by any applicant attending as such any letter to whomsoever addressed whether to himself or to the judge or to any other person—may be read or presented for reading the letter being open and containing matter relevant to his application and the applicant being responsible in respect of the contents and the purposes for which it is exhibited a person by whom an application is made and by whom accordingly an appropriate discourse is addressed to the judge may for occasional assistance and support bring with him any person not specially inhibited but for special reason assigned by the judge any such assistant or supporter may be ordered and made to withdraw concerning any matter in relation to which judicial application may be made to a judge no application can lawfully be made to him elsewhere than in open judicatory to make any application elsewhere is in the party making it—in attempt or preparation—an act of corruptingness and as such punishable to receive it without disclosure is in a like manner on the part of the judge an act of corruptedness as to this see constitutional code chapter xii §    secret intercourse obviated and also for the cases in which it may be requisite that the discourse should be secret and for the mode in which such secresy shall be kept §  0 oaths none—why question as a security for testimonial veracity why is not the ceremony called taking an oath here employed—answer    because it is needless and inefficacious to every good purpose to evil purposes in prodigious extent effective it is needless the responsibility here proposed—responsibility satisfactional punitional and upon occasion dislocational—responsibility to the legal sanction responsibility to the popular or moral sanction to the judicial and publicopinion tribunals—is abundantly sufficient it is inefficacious utterly devoid of efficacy it is proved to be by universal and continually repeated experience under the english system its invalidity in respect of moral obligation is abundantly recognised by the practice of the constituted authorities   in the situation of jurymen in general in no instance when any difference of opinion has place can any verdict be given without a breach of the promise thus pretended to be sanctioned the verdict being delivered as unanimous jurors in any number from one to eleven must have done that which they have all of them sworn not to do—uttered a declared opinion contrary to the real one instances are happening and always have been happening in which they unanimously concur in declaring as true that which all know to be untrue and when out of the box scruple not to declare their believing to be untrue declaring a quantity of money stolen to be under a certain sum when in fact what was stolen if indeed it was stolen could not have been less than several times that sum declaring a defendant not guilty when according to ample uncontradicted and unquestioned evidence he was guilty in both cases for the known and undissembled purpose of saving the defendant from the punishment appointed by law under the eyes of the highest judges is always done what is thus done judges never disapproving oftentimes approving commending or even recommending not a judge is there of those now in office to whom it is not perfectly known that all this is correctly true when praise is bestowed by them humanity is the word by which it is bestowed humanity displayed by which laws are openly violated and perjury openly committed   in the case of coroners and coroners juries—as often as suicide is declared the result of insanity when in fact it is the result of calculation—a calculation by which it is determined that in what remains of life if preserved the quantity of pain will outweigh that of pleasure the cases in which the operation is declared not to be the result of insanity are extremely rare and then what are they those generally in which a man has left neither property nor friends by whom his property if any at his decease could be shared when the confidant of the holy alliance so truly called holy for what wickedness is equal to that called holiness put an end to his life what he did was as everybody knows deliberate if suicide is an act of insanity so is voluntarily entering into a military service—so is choosing what appears the least of any two evils   in the case of deodands imposed by coroners inquests when by a loaded coach or waggon running over him a man is killed declaration must be made by them upon oath what the instrument was by which the casualty was produced by the whole vehicle or no part of it says common sense no says jury and directing judge—not by the whole vehicle but by one wheel and no more by no other part was any contribution made towards the production of the effect here then is perjury—and to what use to save the owner of the carriage from the loss of it for when by the unruliness of his cattle the husbandman has lost a servant or a son—to enrich him for his loss allwise judges have in their wisdom concurred in giving it with its contents to the king wisdom with one hand enforces the law the same wisdom with the other hand defeats it now as to belief how stands the matter with these men is it that they do not believe that any such person as god is in existence is it that believing such a person to exist they do not believe that the power they thus take upon them to exercise over him will have its intended effect—they the judges to decree at pleasure he the sheriff to execute they who into the mouths of the elect are so constantly occupied in forcing perjury are they not suborners of it but the thing to be proved was that whatever be the restraint in any case put upon the motives by which perjury is prompted—in the production of this restraint no part is ever taken by the ceremony of the oath and the proof is—what where it has not for its accompaniment exposure to punishment in a visible shape it is set at naught by everybody but by none more universally than by those to whom in profession it is the object of such prostrate reverence the allembracing jurytrial perjury could no otherwise be got rid of than by giving to the majority as in other cases the power of the whole a measure the effects of which could not without considerable reflection be anticipated but the madnessimputing perjury and the valuation perjury might be got rid of at no higher price than the mortification of suffering the property to go or remain with the right owner and among the whole race of heroes whom in the character of ennobled chancellors and judges the country has for so many ages been adorned with not one has ever been found hero enough to take upon himself    this same mortifying task—by whom the benefit of clearing the country of this perjury has been thought worth the trouble when by the whole elect of the country the utter inefficacy of the ceremony has been recognised it may seem little better than a superfluity to speak of the indirect recognition expressed by every house of commons that ever sat if it were thought of any importance that it should be employed in inquiries in the result of which nothing more than the welfare of a and b is at stake—could it ever have been left unemployed in inquiries on the result of which so many millions are continually at stake could the commons have quietly left the lords in the exclusive possession of it could the lords temporal and spiritual with common decency have kept to themselves the exclusive possession of it if for any such purpose it had in the opinion of either been worth a straw so much for the uselessness and inefficaciousness of it now as to the mischievousness of it the prime article in the list of the evils produced by it is the mendacitylicence of which it has been and continues to be the instrument to make men believe that it is by the imaginary eternal and not by the real and temporal punishment that the mendacityrestraining effect is produced the house of commons case excepted on no occasion for the repression of mendacity is any real punishment employed but when this ideal source of punishment is tacked on to it where no oath on pretence of securing veracity is employed falsehood though the evil consequences be exactly the same receives the fullest and most effectual licence in the field of common law with the fullest allowance from their partners in depredation the judges—the hireling lawyers of all classes on both sides riot and disport themselves while fattening upon lies beyond a certain extent the quantity of these lies is optional but up to that extent it has by those who profit by it been made compulsory and unavoidable §    before applicants statement—responsibility how secured antecedently to the reception of the applicants statement the judge takes the requisite measures for securing the means of communicating with him after his departure from the judicatory for whatsover purpose such communication may be requisite needful on two accounts is this precautionary measure—   on the account of the applicant himself for the purpose of giving effect to his application in the event of its proving well grounded   on the account of the defendant in the event of its proving ungrounded with a view to compensation   on the account of the public in the event of its having been made wantonly having for its object or effect the exclusion of other applicants from the benefit of justice by wasteful employment of the judges time first then let it be not a piece of information that the applicant comes to give but a complaint or a demand that he comes to make in case of a complaint he will set himself to inquire what the wrong is which is the subject of it and who the person is or the persons are who have been concerned and in what ways in the doing it whether known to the applicant or unknown if known where the persons abode is or what other more effectual means there may be of communicating with him for the purposes of the suit for the purpose of ascertaining what the wrong is the judge will have before him the table of offences it will be given in all its ramifications in the penal code to which the proposed code here delineated has reference this table with divers others is constantly within reach of the judge and within view of all the other actors in the judicial theatre if the applicant can read a look at it may enable him to save the time employed by the judge in the abovementioned address frequently while waiting in the suitors gallery for his turn a communication with his neighbours in the gallery if carried on in whispers at the intervals when the discourse carried on for the purpose of the suit are at a pause may afford him such instruction as may more or less abridge the labours of the judge if the application be a complaint the definition of the wrong will have informed the judge of the criminative circumstances the concurrence of which is necessary to the existence of it as need may occur he will either mention these to the applicant or wait to collect them from the applicants statement as it comes forth and before he determines to call for the appearance of the defendant he will in like manner satisfy himself that according to the applicants showing no circumstances of justification or of exemption relative to the species of offence in question have had place if the application be as above a demand the judge will of course have in his mind the respective natures of the several services capable of being demanded without imputation of wrong on the part of those at whose charge they are demanded together with a list of all the several efficient causes of title with respect to service in all those several shapes this being confined to another such    table as above will at the same time afford to the applicant such information as the state of his mind enables him to imbibe in the same table in which are exhibited the several incidents which with reference to the sort of service in question have a collative effect will also be exhibited in conjunction with them the several circumstances which with reference to that same object may have an ablative effect the same care which has been employed in the ascertaining so far as depends upon the applicants showing the existence of some one article in the list of collative circumstances will be employed in ascertaining the nonexistence of all the several ablative circumstances in the course of the inquiry he will ascertain whether there be any other persons who not being present in the character of coapplicants are united in interest with the applicant so also in regard to witnesses so likewise as to defendants and persons regarded as capable of being witnesses or liable to be called as witnesses on the defendants side it will then be for the determination of the judge to which description of persons application should first be made—whether to the applicants partners in interest to the applicants expected witnesses or to the defendant or defendants and in such his determination he will of course be governed by the joint consideration of delay vexation and expense regard being had to the importance of the case on the one hand and the probable quantity of unavoidable vexation and expense on the other hand his next consideration will be in which of the three possible modes application shall be made to the several descriptions of persons above mentioned—whether in the way of accersition prehension or epistolary mandate and interrogation §    selfnotificative information elicited how when the purpose of the application has been established or if he sees reason earlier the judge proceeds to establish the means of eventual communication with the applicant according to the nature of the purpose judge to applicant—produce your applicants address paper ready filled up or make answer to such questions as i shall have to put to you for the purpose of filling up this which i have in my hand if by the applicant a paper ready filled up is produced accordingly the judge either by the word allowed with the addition of his signature signifies his satisfaction with it as it stands or proceeds and continues to put appropriate questions until it receives his allowance as above if no such readyfilled up paper be produced the judge by appropriate questions proceeds to elicit answers until under the several heads such information as to him appears satisfactory has been obtained—the registrar under the direction of the judge setting down the answers in words or substance but not any of the questions—such alone excepted if any as he shall have been required to set down either by the applicant or by the judge at this stage the judge may content himself with the information expressed in such answers as the applicant is content to give by the purpose of the application and the nature of the matter stated in pursuance of it he will be determined whether to elicit information under the several other heads in respect of name all that at this stage need be elicited is that which the applicant is at the time known by and answers to so in regard to condition in life and abode under no one of these heads will he be required to declare the real in contradistinction to the apparent state of the case unless specially required nor will he be thereto specially required without special cause if the applicants purpose be either consultative or evidencesecuring seldom can it happen that on his part any desire of concealing either name occupation or habitation should have place nor yet if his purpose be calamitydamagepreventive or delinquencydamagepreventive can it naturally have place not so if the purpose be either contentious or informative for in the case of a person by whom on this or that point and in particular in the point of name or condition in life the law has been transgressed need of the protection of the law for himself together with adequate motives for furnishing information of acts of transgression committed by others may not be the less likely to have place §    applicants accessibility secured how in regard to habitation if so it is that the applicant has not any such settled habitation as determined in and by the constitutional code in the chapter containing the election code viz ch vi no entry without instruction from the judge will he perhaps be able to dictate in this case either he has a habitation in the territory of some other judicatory or he has not any in the territory of the state if he has not any in the territory of the state either he has not any at all anywhere or he has a habitation in the territory of some foreign state whether in the territory of a foreign state he has or has not any such    habitation—in the territory of the judicatory in which he is making his application either he has a temporary residence or he is merely passing through it in the course of a journey in the condition of a traveller in which of all these several predicaments the applicant stands the judge will by appropriate inquiry learn and accordingly cause entry to be made for the purpose of maintaining appropriate intercourse with the applicant it will not be necessary that his habitation if in the territory of the judicatory or elsewhere he has any should be known it may be maintained by missives deposited at the habitation of any other person or at any other place at which by his own hands or those of any other persons he declares himself sure of receiving it in general only in the case where consequential proceedings are in contemplation to be carried on will there be any need of establishing any means of intercourse no such need will have place if the application be simply dismissed unless on the ground of delinquency in some determinate shape or for security to other persons against damage liable to be produced by the application it should be deemed necessary to place him in a state of forthcomingness the case where the purpose of the application is contentious and in consequence a suit will naturally have place being that in which the importance of accessibility is at the maximum as also the difficulty of securing it—what belongs to this head will be found in its proper place §    causes for dismissal causes or grounds for dismissal may be any one of the following—   to warrant the judge in rendering the judicial service necessary to the performance of the service demanded no adequate portion of law indicated by the pursuer or existing to the knowledge of the judge say for shortness—law not proved   no fact alleged by which supposing the existence of it proved the title or right of the demandant to receive the service demanded would be established say for shortness—fact not proved   the evil if any that has place or would have place supposing the effectual service not rendered not sufficiently great to outweigh the evil which in the shape of vexation and expense would be produced by rendering it   the applicant not able of himself to furnish adequate satisfaction in any shape or shapes to the proposed defendant   the evil if any not sufficiently great to warrant the exacting at the hands of the demandant the selfincarcerative security   no person indicated by the demandant as consenting eventually to subject himself to the burthen of satisfaction to an amount sufficient to outweigh the evil of vexation and expense as above §    proceedings when secret if in the apprehension of the applicant the case be of the number of those in which for some specific purpose secresy in reference to the other actors on the judicial theatre should for the time be preserved he hands over to the judge a folded ticket in which the demand for secresy together with the ground of it is expressed whereupon the judge will as he sees best either continue the hearing in the public chamber or transfer it immediately to the private chamber taking with him the applicant and the officiating registrar grounds for such secresy are as follows—   on the part of the proposed defendant danger of nonforthcomingness if the application be known to him   so on the part of a desired witness   so on the part of a proposed defendant—abstraction of things moveable to avoid eventual prehension whether for means of probation or for means of execution   necessity or probability of disclosures productive of damage to reputation in respect of sexual intercourse   necessity or probability of discourse offensive to modesty   necessity or probability of the revelation of facts the disclosure of which might be prejudicial to the community in respect of its foreign relations so if in the course of the conversation he sees reason the judge will transfer the hearing from the public to the private chamber having care to retransfer it to the public chamber so soon as the need of secresy has no longer place and so toties quoties if by a party on either side demand be made for a recapitulatory inquiry secresy or publicity may again be demanded by that same or any other party on either side thereupon the judge will do as he sees best taking care lest intentionally or unintentionally secresy be broken in the course of the demand if in the case of secresy on the ground of damage to reputation the injunction of the judge be broken the offender will be responsible—satisfactorily and punitionally responsible—as for malice or temerity as the case may be and the truth of the imputation will not be received either in justification or extenuation §    deceptive fallaciousness—its modes falsity essential falsity in circumstances falsity in degree falsity irrelevant the distinctions expressed by these appellations will be noted by the judge    by falsity essential understand the case in which supposing the assertion false the claim of the applicant falls to the ground examples—   where the subject of demand is money on the ground of common debt   subject of demand—delivery of an individual thing moveable or immoveable simple or aggregate   subject of demand—money in satisfaction for a wrong by the offence of simple corporeal vexation   subject of demand or of application—informative publicoprivate wrong by theft for modes of fallaciousness other than falsity see the book of fallacies included in such fallaciousness is irrelevancy—irrelevancy of evidence delivered in relation to the fact properly in question falsity when not irrelevant is either completely contradictory to the truth or incompletely contradictory to the truth falsehood which is incompletely contradictory to the truth is so either in degree or in circumstance by falsity in circumstance understand the case in which in respect of some circumstances the statement appears to be false but deducting the falsity enough remains to warrant the judicial call upon the parties example where from the terms of the charge it appears whether from self contradiction on the part of the applicant or from some generally notorious fact either not known to him or not heeded by him that the material act stated by him if indeed it happened did not happen at the time stated or at the place stated or that a person stated as present was not present by falsity in degree understand the case in which though in the degree stated by the applicant the result of the act stated by the applicant did not take place or could not have taken place it might nevertheless for aught appears have had place in a degree sufficient to warrant the proposed call upon the pursuer in this case the falsity takes the name of exaggeration example   in case of debt for goods sold value as stated so much real value not more than half as much   amount of the money constituting an equivalent or satisfaction for damage sustained by goods from illwill or negligence so much real amount not more than half as much from the amount of the exaggeration with or without other circumstances a judgment may be formed whether it was the result of blameless error of rash judgment and assertion of insincerity or mendacity by falsity irrelevant understand the case where though the assertion be tainted with falsity the falsity is such that supposing the other parts of the statement true the ground of the application will not be the less valid in this case it may be either blameless temeracious insincere or mendacious however completely soever irrelevant it may still be not the less fit to be noted as well for the purpose of the principal suit as affecting the trustworthiness of the application as opposed to any statements by a defendant as for the purpose of constituting a ground for punishment the effect is of a particular kind where the subjectmatter of the deception or the attempt being a thing or a person the erroneous opinion caused or endeavoured to be caused is identity with reference to a certain thing or person wherein diversity is what really has place as where a thing being the subjectmatter an appearance is put upon it by the deceiver with the intent that in relation to it an opinion should be formed that the cause of its wearing that appearance was and is the agency not of him the deceiver or wouldbe deceiver but either of some other person or of unassisted nature when the subjectmatter is an assemblage of the visible signs of discourse the attempt thus to deceive—the preparation made for deception—by a person whose writing the discourse does contain with the intent that it shall pass as the work of some person other than him the deceiver whose work it really is—is styled forgery—to wit of written evidence when the signs are of any other nature the forbidden act may by analogy be still termed forgery but in this case forgery of real evidence in the greek language without difficulty and in the english if a word imported from the greek language could be endured it might be termed prometamorphosis by analogy to metamorphosis false in degree this may be converted into truth by simple addition or subtraction false in circumstance circumstances are with relation to the principal part of the matter of fact either essential or unessential essential in place and time—essential in some place and some time—because no matter of fact can have existed without existing in some place and in some time—but it may be that neither the individual place nor the individual time alleged may have been essential and necessary to the material effect of the principal fact in question histories of trials if well analyzed in this view will be of great use in furnishing the mind with ideas of cases applicable on each individual occasion but general rules exercising an absolute dominion over decision should not be made out of them susannahs elders were deemed false witnesses because according to what one of    them said the act was committed under a tree of one sort—according to the other it was committed under a tree of another sort but what if the trees were so placed that it was committed under both of them—or if the animated act being so much more interesting than the inanimate vegetable one or both of them had for want of the necessary appropriate attention been mistaken as to the tree §    justiceobstructing application obviated on every occasion on which it appears to the judge that the application is groundless and frivolous he will make declaration to that effect if in his opinion the cause of it be want of due consideration for the value of the time of the judge and the judicatory to the public service but without consciousness of its groundlessness he will declare it culpable and for the purpose of determent in future he will impose a small mulct if in his opinion the cause of it be a desire to preoccupy and employ in waste the time of the judicatory for the express purpose of producing delay in reference to other suits in general or a certain suit or set of suits in particular in which case it cannot but be accompanied with evil consciousness he will make declaration to that effect and declare the application groundless and criminal and impose upon the applicant a much heavier mulct the produce of the mulct will in both cases be allotted to the helpless litigants fund in ordinary practice no person is admitted to apply for justice without payment of money under the name of fee the consequence is a denial of justice to all those who are unable to pay the fee and in the case of those who can and do pay it but can ill afford it adding hardship to injury—injury by the hand of government to injury by the hand of the individual wrongdoer by this means the government offers encouragement to wrong in the way here proposed a pecuniary exaction will act as a discouragement to wrong if in consequence of divers instances of groundless application one with another it shall have appeared to the judge that among the applicants or any of them concert for the production of delay as above—vexation to the judge and judicatory—have place he will declare as much and give to the aggregate of such applications the appellation of a conspiracy—a conspiracy for the obstruction of justice and in proportion to their respective pecuniary circumstances give increase to the amount of the mulct respectively imposed upon them thus there will be so many distinguishable offences against justice—modifications of the offence denominated obstruction of justice—  obstruction culpable through rashness   obstruction criminal accompanied with evil consciousness and   obstruction criminal accompanied with evil consciousness and conspiracy to the government advocate it will belong to be upon the watch for every such instance of obstruction to justice and to make demand accordingly for the infliction of the mulct so likewise to the eleemosynary advocate in default of or at the request or with the consent of the government advocate and with the consent of the judge were it not for this means of repression nothing would be easier than for a knot of men—to whose particular and sinister interest the system of natural procedure on this or that application expected to be made were detrimental—to stop the course of justice altogether and throw everything into confusion in consequence of which the only system of procedure conducive to justice would wear the appearance of being destructive of it at the expense of a reward exceeding though it were by no more than a small amount the daily wages of the lowest paid labourer thousands might be procured in such sort as to occupy for years with groundless applications the whole quantity of judicial aptitude that could be brought into operation §    application by a party to a quarrel or say quarrels how terminated an occurrence naturally not unfrequent is this between an applicant and a party complained of a series of supposed wrongs on both sides have had place in a case of this sort if on the occasion of the application made on one side the judicial service due be rendered to the applicant no notice being at the same time taken of any wrong done by him to the proposed defendant justice would be rendered in appearance in reality not as to the multitude of the individual instances of wrong in its several shapes capable of being done by one individual to another there is no determinable limit still less can there be to that of the instances of wrong on both sides of no one alleged wrong can the judge refuse to take cognizance any more than of any other whatever in any particular instance may be the number if on the day of the first application made by the party cognizance be taken of the whole series judgment may be pronounced on every one of them on that same day whereas if separate days be appointed for each no limit can be assigned to the quantity of delay which may have place—delay to the suitor with correspondent needless expenditure of the time of the several actors on the judicial theatre this considered when in consequence of application made—the applicant is received    as pursuer and the party complained of as proposed defendant such proposed defendant appearing—if editor illegible word be that by such defendant wrong in any determinate shape is by him alleged to have been done to him by the pursuer—the judge far from inhibiting such countercomplaint will rather give encouragement to the exhibition of complaints on both sides to the end that in so far as practicable termination may be put to all feeling of illwill on both sides to all resentment for wrong sustained to all apprehension of wrong about to be sustained on either side—in a word that perfect reconciliation be effected in this case the damage in whatever shape from every wrong on each side will operate as a setoff to every other an account as complete as may be will be taken of what is due on each side and a balance struck and payment in whatsoever may be the appropriate shape or shapes made accordingly in the case of an ordinary account of a commercial nature this is matter of universal practice in the case here supposed it may with equal facility have place a sum of money due on the score of satisfaction for corporeal vexation may with as much propriety and facility be set down in account as money due on the score of ordinary debt and for wrongs on either side or on both sides satisfaction in a shape other than pecuniary may be remitted on one side in consideration of satisfaction remitted on the other but though it should happen that for mutual wrongs in any number nothing in the name of satisfaction in any shape be found due on either side to either individual—wrong to no inconsiderable amount may in this way have been done by one or both parties to the public—wrong that is to say by the consumption made of the judicial time as above upon the whole then two distinguishable courses may on any such occasion require to be taken—two distinguishable functions require to be exercised by the judge that is to say— st the conciliative  d the punitive to the conciliative he will to the best of his endeavour give exercise in every case to the punitive at the charge of either or both if and in so far as the circumstances of the individual case appear to him to require the increased faculty of extinguishing illwill and at the same time rendering complete justice as between any two or any greater number of persons regarding themselves as wronged is among the advantages possessed by the system of natural procedure in comparison of the system of technical procedure—by the proposed system in comparison of the existing system under the existing system the impossibility of any such comprehensive and desirable arrangement is entire two causes not to speak of others concur in the production of it a judicial meeting of the parties themselves there is none and the expense of a single suit to the comparatively few who possess the possibility of defraying it is so enormous as to destroy either the will or the power—or the will and power necessary to the engaging in so much as a single additional one by so simple an arrangement as that of the judicial meeting of the parties in denmark under the judicatories called reconciliation courts from twothirds to threefourths were struck out of the number of the suits carried before the judicatories acting under the technical system this too under a host of disadvantages of one of which the bare mention may seem to render unnecessary all mention of the rest—no power had this judicatory to give execution and effect to its own decisions if under such disadvantages success was thus extensive what may it not be expected to be under a judiciary and procedure system possessing in a degree so high above everything as yet exemplified the power as well as the inducement to discover and ascertain what on each occasion ought to be done and when ascertained the power of causing it to be done to receive in no case a counterdemand as a setoff to a demand would on the part of the commonlaw courts have been an injustice not to be endurable what remained was to render the field of the application as limited as possible—as limited and thence as indeterminate for thereupon came the point whether in case of the demand in question a counterdemand to the effect in question should be allowed but unless it was on account of the delay with which the elicitation of the evidence in support of the counter demand would be attended—if in any one case a counterdemand is allowed why not in every other §    parties forthcomingness the judge will have the faculty of exacting at the charge of a person adequate sureties against whom it is in contemplation to prefer a demand and who it is apprehended is on the eve of departure from the country in question to some spot not accessible immediately or unimmediately to the powers of the judicatory to the purpose of effectual justiciability in relation to such demand in english law example of a suit having for its object the securing the forthcomingness of a person for the purpose of justiciability—the writ ne exeat regno here the applicability of the remedy falls extremely short of the demand in respect of its extent over the field of law and judicature neither is it afforded to any person    who is not at once able and willing to buy it of the judge and his partners in trade at the expense of the most expensive sort of suit—a suit in equity §  0 english practice against that system of depredation and oppression of which law substantive and adjective—more immediately substantive—is the instrument and judge and co the selfpaid and richlypaid authors the security that will be seen to be given by those two so intimately conjoined arrangements viz the appearance of the parties and their responsibility in case of mendacity will upon a detached view be seen to be such as no person who had not applied himself to the subject with close attention for this particular purpose could in the nature of the case imagine to himself of this same most flagitious system the arrangements correspondent and apposite to the tutelary one form the two main points by keeping the door of the justicechamber inexorably shut against parties on both sides and particularly against those on the pursuers side the partnership forced under this one head every person who on either side of the suit felt himself compelled to take this melancholy chance for that essentially adequate relief which was to be sold under the name of justice for shortness call this principle the deafadder principle or the judicialdeafness principle by confining to extraneous witnesses such security as they find it necessary to afford against judicial falsehood the giving full swing to it to persons in the character of suitors they thereby let into their net the whole tribe of insincere litigants on both sides of the case all those who for the purpose of depredation or oppression in any other shape could by the facility thus afforded be content to purchase their official and most efficient instrumentality and support to give effect to demands known to be groundless and by delay for an indefinite length of time obtain a proportionable chance for ultimately defeating demands known to be wellgrounded here then was an immense addition to the greatest number of customers they could have hoped for under any system which had for its object the ends of justice for addition say rather multiplication—multiplication and by a high power at one sweep it gathered into the net amongst others the whole tribe of dishonest debtors that is to say of such debtors as by this encouragement they could succeed in rendering dishonest call this principle the mendacitylicence principle or for shortness the mendacitylicence further on it will be seen improved into a perjurylicence that encouragement to vice in this allcomprehensivelymischievous form might not be wanting to any class of human beings calling it simply a licence is not doing justice to it—is not yet painting it in its genuine colours for when depredation is the object of licence licence contains in itself the essence of reward this was not yet enough it was almost enough for those who acted in the name of law it was not enough for those who as if to give a zest to profligacy acted in and prostituted the name of equity it was almost enough for law it was not enough for equity not content with encouraging falsehood they forced men into it as to the matter of falsehood common lawyers just contented themselves with vague quantities false assertions on both sides—falsehood in the initiatory demand—falsehood in the initiatory defence—false declaration—and false plea all this however is in a comparatively small number of words with comparative moderateness of depredators profit in the race of profligacy not inconsiderable is the advance thus made by common law but in this part of the case as in so many others she was left behind by equity if a man owe you money the lord chancellor eldon will do what the lord chiefjustice abbott will not do he will let you ask the man whether he does not owe you the money and whether of the facts by which the debt was produced the statement you make is not true think not however that an indulgence so extraordinary is to be obtained without cost before you can be admitted to set foot and that only by proxy in the temple of equity your honour at any rate whatever part of it consists in abstinence from lying—deliberate and elaborate lying—must be left at the threshold if the statement of a matter of fact concerning which you are in ignorance be necessary to the establishment of your right being permissioned by equity to call for information at your debtors side—how would you go about it would you ask him at once how the matter stands no such thing will you do if on this occasion your lawyers know their business for in this way you might ask long enough before anybody would give you an answer no you must come out with a string of lies first and no otherwise than on that condition will your debtor receive orders to furnish the information and acknowledgment which you have need of at his hands the very thing which you do not know and which to the master of equity it is known that you do not know by his instrument the master in chancery he forces you to declare solemnly that you do know stating the particulars of it in detail your lawyer the attorney    called a solicitor and the barrister draughtsman consulting their imagination and weaving a tissue of falsehood for the purpose this falsehood has its equity name and is called the charge and the maxim is—every interrogatory must have for its support a correspondent charge here then are so many more words to be paid for—paid for at so much a dozen—paid for over and over again to so many different persons—judges solicitor draughtsman master in chancery master in chancerys creatures—all of them having in one way or other a finger in the pie in a more refined but not the less substantial shape another mass of profit is yet behind of the profit thus reaped from falsehood the continuance could not but be in a more or less considerable degree dependent on the degree of acquiescence on the part of those upon whom and at whose expense it is practised but no sooner were it seen in its true colours than those at whose expense it was practised would of course as far as the law millstone about their neck would admit of their doing rise up and protest with one voice against the vice thus crammed into their mouths while their pockets were being thus drained at the bottom of the system has accordingly always been so to order matters as that right and wrong morality and immorality should be regarded as depending not upon the effects produced by them respectively on human happiness but on the oracles from time to time delivered as occasion called—delivered by these arbiters of their destiny by these masters of their fate accordingly in particular that falsehood when forbidden by them or without being so much as forbidden punished by them was wrong but that the same or any other falsehood as often as it was left by them unpunished became a matter of indifference and as often as commanded by them—not only right but obligatory with how deplorable a degree of success this has been crowned the whole community feels but too much unquestionably in how complete a state of confusion has the most intelligent of nations for so many centuries remained—insensible to the most marked boundary line that distinguishes vice from virtue swallowing lies upon lies and bowing down with unabatable reverence before the men who force them into their mouths—absurdity and nonsense both in the superlative degree worshipped under the name of learning—vice in its most sordid form under the name of virtue all this while of the object of this worship what there has been in reality is—opulence in league with power nor yet has learning been altogether wanting to it—learning but of what sort of that which consists in an acquaintance more or less familiar with an enormous and everswelling mass of absurdity and nonsense could but the head be emptied at once of the whole mass it would be but so much nearer to the being furnished with real and useful knowledge—with that sort of matter in the denomination of which the word learning can without profanation be applied by the opening of the door to all applicants whose wish it is to obtain on their own account the benefit of judicial service two opposite but correspondent and concurring effects are produced according to the character of the applicant on the one hand to all sincere applicants an advantage—an advantage in respect of its extent altogether unprecedented is secured on the other hand to persons at large against the machinations of insincere litigants a security alike unprecedented is afforded on no occasion can any person expose another in the situation of defendant to the vexation and danger incident to this situation without affording to his adversary that security against injustice which is afforded by the applicants thus placing himself in a situation of effectual responsibility satisfactional and punitional in the event of the application being regarded as not sufficiently grounded chapter ix proxies §   proxies when and who exceptions excepted no suit can be commenced but by application of the individual who demands to be received as pursuer the reasons are given in another place where it is shown what the services are which are rendered to justice by the attendance paid and examination taken of the proposed pursuer and that without such his attendance cannot be rendered with anything near to equal benefit exceptions are the following—   temporary infirmity of body where the health of the party will not admit of his quitting his own residence and the commencement of the suit cannot without danger or nonexecution on the part of the law await his recovery   partys infirmity by temporary or permanent mental derangement   partys infirmity by caducity   partys infirmity by nonage   the party being temporarily absent and the efficient cause of the demand has taken place since his departure nor is his residence in the territory of any judicatory in which the suit could be commenced with equal advantage to justice in cases       or   although in any  0 one of the above cases the judge may receive a proxy instead of a party and upon the evidence exhibited by the proxy order the reception of the principal in the capacity of the pursuer the judge may at the first hearing as above or at any time thereafter require by appropriate mandate the attendance of the party either with or without the coattendance of the proxy—to wit by an attendancerequiring mandate directed to the proxy and the party jointly in case   he will if he sees reason direct an appropriate suittransmitting mandate and have the option following—   to dismiss the suit simply   to retain it advising at the same time the pursuer to carry his demand before another judicatory that to wit within the territory of which the residence of the proposed defendant happens to be at the time   constitute the applicant the partys proxy and from the evidence adduced by him in conjunction with the demand paper commence the examination of copursuers or defendants evidenceholders in the epistolary mode §   litigational proxies a litigational proxy is a person who on the occasion of a suit acts in the service of a party litigant on either side of the suit the party in whose service he acts not being present such proxy is either a professional proxy or a nonprofessional proxy professional serving for pay as a professional proxy no person can be admitted to serve who has not been duly located in the situation of professional lawyer or for shortness say lawyer as per constitutional code so likewise in cases inculpative or not but not criminative so likewise in a suit criminative and purely public to the purpose of subjecting the principal to a punishment no other than pecuniary so likewise in a suit criminative and publicoprivate to the purpose of subjecting the principal to the burthen of compensation with or without pecuniary punishment but not to punishment other than pecuniary so likewise as to consent given by the proxy on behalf of the principal to any operation on the part of the judge by him proposed so likewise in a simply requisitive case so likewise in a suit criminative and publicoprivate but in this case the government advocate or public pursuer will have care lest by this means of the suffering proper to be inflicted on the score of punishment undue diminution have place and may propose to the judge to make addition in a pecuniary shape to the punishment in lieu of any pecuniary compensation the remission of which may have been produced by such admission or consent on the part of the proxy a party defendant may apply for relief against an admission alleged by him to have been unwarrantably made to his prejudice by his proxy to wit for the purpose of being put in so far as without preponderant inconvenience may be in the same state as that in which he would have been if no such admission had been made but then except in case of valid excuse for nonattendance he cannot do so otherwise than by repairing himself to the judicatory and submitting himself to confrontation with the proxy at the justicechamber for the purpose of their being interrogated by each other and by the judge it will be among the cares of the judge that from such disavowal on the part of the principal damage in any shape shall not be made to fall upon a party on the opposite side of the suit and that whatever expense may have been produced by it shall fall upon the principal the proxy or both rather than upon any party on the other side and in this view he will be on his guard against collusion between them for the purpose of addition intended to be made to delay expense or vexation at the charge of the other side in a simply requisitive case and suit the principal is provisionally bound by the admission of a professional proxy so by the admission of a nonprofessional proxy in either case the judge in case of apprehension on his part lest by an admission made by the proxy the interest of justice as well as that of the principal has been disserved will state such apprehension with liberty to the proxy to retract or modify such admissions if he can consistently do so without prejudice to truth so if he sees necessary the judge for reason assigned may suspend any such operation as on the supposition of the propriety of the admission he would have performed until information of the objection made to the admission has been transmitted to the principal and response has been received from him in consequence or time sufficient for the reception of such response has elapsed to hired lawyers in the character of litigational proxies shall admittance be given or denied given of necessity and beyond doubt preferable on several accounts under certain conditions are gratuitous proxies—but among wouldbe pursuers many there will always be to whom the finding any person at the same time able and willing to give commencement and conclusion to a species of service capable of becoming so toilsome would be utterly impossible if then    proxies in adequate numbers could not be found who for such remuneration as they found obtainable were willing to furnish for the purpose in question the sort of service in question—the whole class of persons above mentioned would be exposed to wrong in all shapes at the hands of every evil doer by whom according to his calculation the profit extracted from the wrong would afford him a sufficient remuneration for his trouble thereupon comes another question a man by whom the service in question has on this or that occasion been rendered upon a gratuitous footing to this or that individual—shall it be allowed to him to receive payment for it in the case of this or that other here the proper answer presents itself on the negative side in the constitutional code the case of the professional class of lawyers is brought to view and provision made for securing on their part by a course of observation and practice what seemed requisite of appropriate aptitude if without distinction others by whom no such security had been afforded are permitted to enter into competition with them the adequate inducement for engaging in a course of labours of such duration would not be afforded and the burthen of affording this security would not find any person disposed to take it upon his shoulders it may indeed be said that merit could find its way in the case of this as well as other arts the degree of proficiency on the part of each man would be evidenced by his conduct true to some it would but to others it would not those to whom it would be evidenced would with little addition be the better educated inhabitants of the town of that town alone in which the judicatory had its seat the rest of the inhabitants would on each occasion be at a loss to whom to intrust their respective interests and would be liable to be taken possession of as it were by the boldest and most artful intruder the function of law practitioner or say litigants proxy is but one of two functions—nor that the most important one for which the services capable of being rendered by the class of men in question are needed besides the case in which it is only to individuals that the service is rendered there are two official situations in which the need applies   that of judiciary visitors for the three first of the five probative years   that same situation alternating with that of advocate of the helpless true it is that in the first of these characters they will not serve any otherwise than on occasions when waiting in company with their respective clients to be heard equally true it is that but for the preference expected to be obtained after this long term of study and probation scarce any one of them would be found to subject himself to it by what means shall security be given to the exclusive faculty thus proposed to be established to an extent sufficient for every beneficial purpose in this there will be no great difficulty to exclude altogether from the advantage of receiving in this or that individual shape a benefit in return for the benefit conferred by this laborious and important service will neither be possible nor desirable whatsoever had been the value of the contribution received by the contraband trader in judicial service let him be subjected to the obligation of refunding it with a certain proportionable addition to it in the way of penalty individually and collectively the body of professionals would find inducement adequate to the purpose of securing in the case of each individual a pursuer able and willing to carry the suit on to its termination as to evidence that part which regarded the proof of the services rendered by the interloper would be matter of notoriety remains the contraventional fact—the act of receiving retribution in some shape or other for the service performed but under a rational system in regard to evidence on this score never would there be any difficulty without the least reserve under the universallyapplying security against mendacity questions would be put to all persons cognizant under the check afforded by this security small does the probability seem of infringements of this prohibitive arrangement in any such degree of frequency as to frustrate the intended exclusive privilege only in case of a regular and permanent contraband practice carried on by interlopers in numbers could the damage done to the licentiates taken in the aggregate be considerable and under the influence of the hereproposed remedy any such permanent contraband trade carried on by any individual for any considerable length of time presents itself as impossible §   of damagepreventive application by uncommissioned proxies an application may be made either with or without authority from the person or persons on whose behalf it is made if it be without authority a selfconstituted proxy is the appellation by which in this case the applicant is denominated a selfconstituted benevolent proxy is the appellation by which he will be designated if in the opinion of the judge the desire of serving the interest of the party on whose behalf the application is made constituted the whole or the main part of the inducement by which the application was produced §   unauthorized proxies receivable how a selfconstituted benevolent representative    of an unrepresented absentee by an unrepresented absentee on this occasion understand a person by whom an article or mass of his property has been left or is supposed to have been left unoccupied no assignable person being known or supposed to have been left in charge of it in relation to this case provision in considerable detail is made in bonapartes civil code in the english system no notice whatever is anywhere taken of it whatsoever judicial service a person has a right to demand and obtain for himself or on commission from another for that other he has a right to demand and obtain for another without commission from that other on his finding adequate security for appropriate responsibility for compensation in case of damage the parties to whom damage from such benevolent intervention is liable to accrue are—  the principal on whose behalf the application is made   any person in the character of defendant at whose charge the powers the exercise of which is demanded at the hands of the judge will have to be exercised in the account of this eventual damage will be included any costs with which any proceeding had in consequence may happen to be attended in so far as ascertained the amount of every such cost may require to be advanced by the applicant instead of its being imposed on any other person to whom in consequence of the application communication may require to be made especially if judiciary attendance or transmission of documents to the judicatory may be requisite whatsoever may have been the inducement it will be among the cares of the judge so to order matters that to no person other than the applicant damages in any shape may ensue accordingly exceptions excepted the judge will not subject any person other than such selfconstituted proxy to any expense of which the application may be productive exception is when from the result of the application benefit in any shape ensues to the party in whose behalf the application is made while at the same time either no benefit at all would have accrued to him or no benefit so great as that which has accrued to him by this means in this case reward in consideration of and in proportion to the net value of the benefit so reaped from his service may in case of a suit instituted for that purpose be decreed to the applicant by the judge chapter x judicial communication §   subjectmatters of communication communication—by this name is designated an operation which bears reference and is a necessary concomitant to all those others and of which on that account no mention could have been made till those others had been brought to view they being so many distinguishable ends of procedure it is with reference to every one of them a necessary means communication for the purpose of application and judication communication for the purpose of probation not to secure it from the very outset of the suit to the very last act in it on every occasion and as between whatsoever persons and things where the existence of it is necessary to the attainment of the ends of justice is a flagrant oversight but should it be found that for this omission gold in torrents has at all times flowed into the coffers of those in whose hands the power was of preventing the deficiency is is it to any such cause as oversight that consistently with the most ordinary degree of discernment it can be ascribed in bonapartes code no such flagrant omission has place not that the means provided are in so perfect a degree as they might have been adequate to the end but towards the attainment of it no inconsiderable advance has there been made among the earliest and most anxious cares of the system to which expression is given in this code and those connected with it is to secure from first to last the existence and efficacy of an instrument so indispensable in the work of justice upon the degree of civilization and improvement in various other respects but more particularly in the state of the physical channels of communication the roads by land and water must communication for judicial purposes in respect of promptitude celerity and cheapness of course be in a great measure dependent persons and things—on this occasion as on most others that present themselves on the field of government—in these two appellations may be seen the results of a division of which the nature of the case renders it necessary to make use of this division both members require a further division into common and peculiar as for other purposes in all imaginable variety—domestic and other social and sympathetic intercourse—trade wholesale and retail and the business of the several departments and subdepartments in the official    establishment so for this in particular—the common one great aggregate instrument of communication is the letterpost establishment and the aggregate of the several stocks provided for the conveyance of large and heavy burthens—including the roads solid and fluid over and through which the several masses of matter are conveyed and the beasts or other instruments of conveyance by which the requisite motion and direction are produced by peculiar understand those instruments of communication the use of which is appropriated exclusively to the service of the department here in question §   modes of communication communication is from persons only from persons it may be either with persons or with things or with both from persons to persons it may be either unilateral or reciprocal reciprocal it is when in consequence of a communication made to a person another communication is made from that person to him from whom the first communication came from a person to a person communication is made in two different modes the oral the only original mode and the written when it is the oral that is employed the intercommunicants are necessarily in that respect at least present to each other when it is the written it happens sometimes that they are present and that notwithstanding such presence there may be some special reason for their communicating with each other in that mode but in the ordinary state of things they are at a distance in this case if it is in the written mode that the communication is effected it is termed the epistolary mode if the mode be not epistolary the intervention of a third person is necessary and in this case two communications instead of one have place—namely one from the primary communicator to the third person who in this case becomes an instrument of communication between them—another from the instrument of communication to the person to whom the communication is made of all modes of communication the simplest is that which is made in the oral mode without the intervention of any such third person as above in that most simple form communication is cotemporaneous and coincident at the same time with the abovementioned mutually and necessarily cotemporaneous and coincident operations that is to say application judication and probation in this case the occasions for communication lie as hath been seen within a narrow compass not so when the applicant or the person who at his instance has been constituted the proposed defendant or any nonparty or say nonlitigant evidenceholder is called in now then comes the necessity for some instrument of communication an instrument which unless in some rare case will be of the personal kind—in a word some person to whom in the character of a messenger it belongs to convey the subjectmatter of communication most commonly of that real class of which written discourse is composed from the judge to the person to whom the communication is made this person being by the supposition at a distance from the official place of residence of the judge now comes the demand for diversification and corresponding complication in a country in any tolerable degree civilized there will be two modes of communication between persons at a distance the one which may be styled generally ordinary to wit the letterpost or other public and universally employable receptacle employed as an instrument of conveyance the other special or say particular to wit some messenger specially employed for the purpose making or not making use of some real instrument or instruments of conveyance this distinction though in itself purely theoretical is pregnant with practical applications not less obvious than important expensive to a degree more or less known by everybody is even the least expensive submode of the special mode of communication comparatively unexpensive and economical is the general or say ordinary modes of conveyance especially as applied to instruments of communication in the epistolary form by appropriate arrangements the general mode of conveyance but more particularly the letterpost might be made to perform and with not less certainty and with superior dispatch the service by which in present practice some special mode of conveyance is commonly if not universally employed—but these details belong to a more particular head communication as we have seen may be from person to person or to things or to persons and things at the same time when it is from person to person and back again from the second to the first the two persons may be styled intercommunicants §   means of communication the first point to be determined is at what place the thing in question shall be done whether in the judicatory or elsewhere and in particular at the abode of the addressee whether partylitigant or extraneous evidence holder in general these two cases constitute the only alternative the reason is that in general upon the circumstances it will depend whether the communication shall    be oral or epistolary oral if in the justicechamber epistolary if at the abode permanent or temporary of the addressee but in a particular case on a particular occasion need may be that though made in the presence of the judge the response will not be to be made in the justicechamber the first source of division is the consideration of the place at which the operation is required to be performed the next is the purpose for which in that same place it is to be performed in the third case an extraordinary place concurs with an extraordinary purpose place not the justicechamber but some other in which for the special purpose of that individual suit and the individual operation it requires to be performed the material circumstance is the species of the instrument of discourse—whether oral or otherwise evanescent—or scriptitive or in any other shape permanent this not by reason of the permanence of the instrument—for for giving expression to the discourse an instrument of the same degree of permanence might be employed in the judicatory—but by reason of the distance hence it is by distance and nothing else that the necessity of giving employment to this instrument of discourse to the exclusion of the other is created on the part of a justiciable whether party pursuer party defendant or evidenceholder in answer to the mandate issued by the judge the mode of compliance would be either by attendance or responsion if by attendance either at the indoor fixed judicatory or at the outdoor occasional and migratory judicatory as to the character or say capacity in which the modes of compliance are thus exemplified it might be either that of party pursuer party defendant or evidenceholder or some individual at large incidentally and casually addressed for the purpose of contributing by means of some incidental services which it fell in his way to be able to render to the giving execution and effect to the law on which the suit was grounded here then comes the need for so many corresponding mandates—   accersitive or say hithercalling mandate this when the place at which the service is performed is the judicatory the service itself is the ordinary indoor service   missive or say thithersending mandate this when the place at which the service is performed is an incidental and migratory judicatory the service itself is outdoor service only by personal attendance at or in the judicatory can commencement as above be given to a suit in which case the need of missive mandate on the part of the judge may be apt to appear superseded but the individual who at the first application is constituted a pursuer might be either the applicant himself or any one of two other descriptions of persons to wit where the applicant is an assistant professional or gratuitous such proxy or say deputy being for one or other of the best of reasons admitted instead of the principal or a wardconstituted pursuer in consequence of the application made by his guardian or in a word who is himself a pursuer so it be at any period of the suit after the first the ward being constituted pursuer in his own right and for his own benefit—the guardian in the right and for the benefit of the ward or other trust on the part of the addressee in whatever capacity addressed—party pursuer party defendant or supposed evidence holder or individual at large—rendering response in some shape will be an operation indispensable in every case by the response if pertinent to the matter in hand either compliance with the obligation imposed by the mandate will be completely manifested or though for some reason assigned not at the time performed promised for some other time or declaredly declined if declined then the object of the response will be to exonerate the individual from the burthen of eventual suffering either by satisfaction afforded or by punishment suffered or both §   accessibilitysecuring with regard to the means of intercourse thus much is good and true in general—that on each individual occasion they must be settled with and adjusted to the circumstances of the individual with whom the intercourse is to be secured as to those individual means the general nature and character of them will be liable to vary according to the condition in respect of civilization of the country in question they will depend partly upon the situation of the individuals to be communicated with partly upon the nature of the means of communication which the state of the country affords as to the condition of the individual in proportion as opulence is abundant the means of communication are at once capable of being rendered more prompt and more secure the greater the number of inmates in a house and the more constant the habit of residence on the part of each the greater the certainty of conveying to the knowledge of the head or any other member of the family the information requisite in a certain state of society—that for instance which to so large an extent has place in america—many are they who have no fixed place of habitation many again they who having each a fixed habitation leave it habitually unoccupied for any length of time even in switzerland this    latter case is to no inconsiderable extent exemplified as to the british isles in no part of them is this case exemplified to any considerable extent under the name of vagrancy voluntary or involuntary such is the benevolence and wisdom of english parliaments it is ever punished as a crime in ireland the meanest hovel—and such hovels are but too numerous—is either entirely open or has a door to it in the general state of things a door has place but this being by appropriate force moveable and as such distrainable and being in but too many instances the only thing worth distraining is sometimes say all the accounts distrained for rent where the door does not exist any missive sent by authority may find its way in with so much the less difficulty where there is a door the having in it a slit adequate to the purpose of epistolary communication might without sensible hardship be rendered a condition indispensable to the use of this instrument of security antecedently to the letterpost scarcely by the most opulent condition in life could any absolutely secure means of epistolary intercourse be established by letterpost no condition in life so abject but that for any purpose such as that in question it might in the case of every individual be established in every instance in every the smallest division of territory the existence of a local headman being supposed here would be a spot by repairing to which an individual who had no settled habitation might be sure at any time of finding anything sent thither to his address for nowhere in the territory of a state could an individual find himself without finding himself in the territory of a local headman in the official residence of this functionary the individual who had no fixed habitation might at all times be sure of finding whatever it had been made his duty to see and if unable himself to read there he would moreover be sure of finding those in whose instance no such inability could have place for him who had no fixed habitation of his own judicial missives—he being prepared and preengaged to receive them—might be addressed to him at the local headmans office and for diminution of vexation to him who has a fixed habitation another exemplar might be delivered at that same habitation and so in the case of his having habitations more than one and in this way may the most convenient provision be made for every occupation and situation in life remains for consideration the system of intercourse which the country affords the territory of the state in general and that portion of it in particular from to and through which on the individual occasion in question the communication requires to be made in england compared with all other countries on the globe for this purpose as for every other the adequacy of the means of communication is at its maximum and by the spread of railroads with selfmoving receptacles moving on them the maximum is in the act of undergoing prodigious increase for general purposes at large and for commercial purposes in particular in a country in which the population is at such a degree of density the government postoffice performs this function in a manner the advantages of which are so strongly and universally felt justice alas presents a very different state of things on this occasion comes the observation that unfortunately for england the purposes of justice have never been the purposes of judicature or the purposes of government had they been long ago the missionaries of the postoffice would have been the missionaries of judicature modes of delivery and receipt together with appropriate documentary evidence of the facts having for this purpose been established but by the hierarchy of the postoffice probably by the hierarchy of the judicial establishment obstacles and those as insuperable as they could contrive to render them would of course be opposed to the most effectual and least vexatious arrangement that for this purpose could be proposed the answer would of course be attached—useless mischievous and impracticable an official answer rendered familiar to him who writes this by the habit of seeing it returned to proposed arrangements which afterwards when carried into effect were found beneficial and unexceptionable §   difficulties obviated for what purpose soever and in what character soever on the occasion of a suit or other application an individual makes his appearance for the first time the judge will not suffer him to depart unless he has given indication of some habitation or habitations at which during the continuance of the suit any mandate issuing from or sanctioned by the judge whether of that territory or any other will be sure to reach him if transmitted by the letterpost or any special messenger of two habitations indication may be given in the first instance as thus till july the first inclusive a mandate will reach me parish a of this territory habitation no     from july the  st to july  th in territory naming it parish c habitation    of places of habitation one after another indication may thus be afforded at any time and so toties quoties the indication given of the intended place of habitation may be changed    of every such indication so given it will be presumed that down to the last day in each instance any missive delivered at the habitation so indicated has been received by the individual in question with a view to the purpose for which it was sent that is to say in the case of a judicial mandate with a view to compliance therewith in such sort that for noncompliance prehension of the body may be effected by any one in the list of appropriate excuses the individual noncomplying may be originally exempted or as the case may be subsequently liberated from the necessary afflictive consequences such excuse may be either ordinarily emanating or vicarious ordinarily emanating when from the individual himself vicarious when from any other person of these there are three lists— list   containing those excuses which in the nature of the case cannot or are not allowed to emanate from any individual other than him to whom the missive is addressed list   containing those which cannot in the nature of the case or are not allowed to emanate from the individual himself and if delivered must have been delivered by or on behalf of some other person list   containing those which may indifferently have emanated either from the individual himself or from some other person this business of securing judicial intercourse cannot but be attended with much diversification and considerable difficulties which difficulties are in considerable proportion the result of the natural as contrasted with the technical system of procedure under the technical system of procedure they have no place why because under the techical system of procedure no suit ever finds its way into the judicatory but through the medium of a technical assistant   difficulty the first the individual an individual by whom an offence in some shape or other has been committed and who in the event of his attendance in the judicatory would expose himself to prehension on the ground of this offence resource or say arrangement for removal of the difficulty if the punishment or other burthen attached to his offence is more afflictive than privation of the benefit sought for by his attendance he will abstain from such attendance and the burthen resulting from nonattendance will be a part though by supposition no more than a part of the suffering which is his due in the other case he will attend the suffering in question he will undergo but he will receive a benefit amounting to the difference between that suffering and the suffering to which he would be subjected by nonattendance in the case of him by whom a professional assistant is employed all difficulties may be made to disappear by his consent that every missive addressed to him at the habitation of such his assistant shall be presumed to have been received by him within the appropriate time the case in this respect is very different according as it is in the character of proposed pursuer that the individual attends or in any other character if in the character of a proposed pursuer the benefit expected by him to be gained by the suit is a benefit which by any want of adequacy on the part of the indication afforded he will be liable to forfeit and which will accordingly operate as a security for such adequateness so if it is in the character of a trustee regularly constituted or selfconstituted that he attends in this case likewise the correspondent security will have place and by the amount of the benefit sought will supersede the demand for an inducement of the coercive kind in any other shape but in every other case than this such coercive inducement will manifestly be necessary in particular if the individual in attendance be a defendant or an extraneous witness   difficulty the second the individual in attendance say an applicant a person whose character is without reproach but who in respect of his means of livelihood is in a state of uncertainty each day at what habitation his occupation may require him to be on the next in this case he being by the supposition an applicant he may be depended upon for doing whatsoever is in his power to save himself from being debarred from the benefit he seeks as for instance giving indication of the employer or employers habitation for whom he expects to be occupied if his situation is so unfixed as to deprive him of this resource the case is of the number of those unfortunate ones for which the nature of things allows not any remedy at any rate this inconvenience cannot be chargeable on the natural system for under the technical system an individual so circumstanced would not be able to obtain any such assistance   difficulty the third the individual in attendance is one whose attendance is the result of compulsion he being either a defendant or an unwilling extraneous witness in this case the judge will have to choose between the evils and act accordingly—   the depriving the party who is in the right of the benefit of the attendance in question   the subjecting the individual so in attendance to confinement so long as is deemed necessary to the purposes of the suit   difficulty the fourth neither the individual    in question nor any person in the habitation occupied by him able to read expedient for removal—recourse to some constituted authority resident in the parish in which the habitation actual or expected of the individual in question is situated §   futurecommunicationsecuring memento the person to whom this memento signed by the judge or under his general direction by the registrar is to be delivered is every person upon his first appearance in the justicechamber before the judge the object purpose and use of this instrument is the securing to the judge the means of communicating with the proposed communicant for the purpose of the suit until the termination thereof or until the end of the time during which it may happen to the judge to have need of such communication for the purposes of the suit as soon as the need of communication with the intended communicant has ceased information thereof will be afforded him by the registrar denomination of the instrument employed for this purpose—an ulteriorcommunication release the following should be the form of the futurecommunicationsecuring memento—   mention the individuals name and description at length to wit surname christian name or names or the equivalent office if a functionary other occupation if a nonfunctionary and abode or abodes permanent if any such is the description you have just given of yourself   take notice you have declared that until by an ulteriorcommunicationrelease delivered as above you have been released from the obligation of communicating with this judicatory for the purpose of this suit or application every judicial paper if delivered at that house will be received by you or by some agent of yours authorized on your behalf   in consequence except in case of legitimate excuse of the number of those to which the serving in that character has been given by law you will in the event of noncompliance with any judicial mandate delivered or left at such your chosen place of communication be punishable or otherwise dealt with as for contumacious noncompliance at the first bilateral attendance it belongs to the judge to collect and complete at the hands of the defendant information correspondent to that which on the occasion of the first unilateral attendance was required to be furnished to the judicatory and entered upon the register chapter xi evidence §   indicative and appropriate by appropriate evidence or ultimately employable understand all such evidence as is fit to enter into the composition of the grounds of the judges opinative decree so far as depends upon the question of fact by simply indicative evidence understand such as is not of itself fit to enter into the composition of those same grounds but affords an indication of some source from whence supposing the matter issuing from it true evidence which is appropriate may probably be collected—as where a person who was not present at the place and time at which the fact in question took place states himself as having heard of some other person as having been so present widely different in investigational procedure is the character of romanbred and englishbred procedure teeming with imperfections both of them as to romanbred procedure throughout the penal branch of the field of law solicitous and extensive has been the application given to such provision as it has made in the nonpenal branch on the other hand the provision has been comparatively scanty the solicitude remiss at the same time for want of a clear and correct conception of the difference between appropriate and simplyindicative evidence it has given to evidence which has been simply indicative the effect of appropriate evidence in the affair of oates for example to such a length did this confusion proceed that between simple indicative evidence presented to the judge and the apprepriate evidence supposing any to exist there were four or five portions of simply indicative evidence interposed it has notwithstanding been received and made to operate as if it had been appropriate evidence standing before the judge i said a heard from b that he had heard from c that c had heard from d that he had heard from e that e saw done by the accused the deed with which the accused is charged englishbred procedure on the other hand limits to the penal branch of procedure—and of that branch to no more than a part—the application of the investigational process to the nonpenal branch it has made no application of it how great soever may be the importance of the matter in dispute on the other hand in the cases in which it employs the process it keeps clear of the mischievous absurdity with which as above romanbred procedure has distinguished itself    meantime nothing can be more manifest than that if necessary to the discovery of truth in the case of any one species of suit it cannot be less so in any other of the whole list of vulgar errors few indeed are so mischievous few so gross as that which supposes that in the minds of that class of men who are styled ministers of justice minimization of injustice has been the end to which their labours have been directed to minimization substitute maximization you will be near the truth that injustice might be maximized it has been their interest that of the use of falsity the general instrument of injustice the frequency should be maximized—the falsity itself maximized—and moreover so also the credence given to it to this end it is that to so many various descriptions of persons on this special occasion for this special purpose the licence to commit judicial falsehood with impunity—in one word the mendacitylicence—has been granted to an extent so allcomprehensive and to this licence in place of punishment reward upon the most allcomprehensive scale has been awarded descriptions of persons to whom the mendacitylicence has thus been granted are these—   parties on the pursuers side   parties on the defendants side   professional assistants of the order of attorneys   professional assistants of the order of advocates   the judges themselves of the error just mentioned the mischievousness consists in the support given to a system thus deleterious by the respect with which the authors and supporters of it have down to this time been and are at this time now regarded correspondent to the mischievousness of this error is its grossness the mischievousness of the system so manifest to the eyes of all so severely felt by all yet still in the teeth of universal experience with very small abatement the error continues more than ten years have elapsed since by the hand by which these lines are penning the opposite truth has been announced in print and not only announced but by the most abundant and particular and irrefragable proofs demonstrated imputations more reproachful can scarcely be cast by man on man than in that work† have been cast upon all implicated yet still all is silence and if in any case silence under accusation were confession of guilt surely so has it been and so continues it to be in this a more flagitious act of calumny could not have been committed than would by this account have been committed had the matter of it been other than true in no part of the civilized world are the name or the works of the author unknown on no author that ever applied his labour to this field have any such marks of approbation and applause been ever bestowed as on him ignorance therefore of the fact of the accusation or of the prosecuting of the accusation cannot with any shadow of truth be pleaded yet still from all these quarters reigns the most imperturbable silence in the eyes of the people at large has this demonstration of all this guilt—this confession of guilt—been all this while manifest the approbation and applause thus bestowed upon the author is such as to him would be sufficient reward had he but the satisfaction of observing that the people for whom all this labour has been bestowed and such a load of odium from the highest quarters voluntarily taken upon him would but derive their profit from what has thus been done for them but no such reward or satisfaction so long as he lives does he seem destined to receive he pipes but they do not dance—he makes the advances but they do not follow through the paths it has been his endeavour to lead them none are at once willing and able to follow §   exclusion of partys testimony its ill effects fertile source of injustice and oppression the exclusionary rule which shuts the door against the testimony of the party observe the consequences of the rule on the occasion of those dealings which have place where the party on the one side is in a state of opulence the other in a state of comparative indigence—say landlord and tenant—opulent customer and dealer—borrower and lender the comparatively opulent man never acts or treats of himself everything he does is by the hand or the help of an agent—in a word an attorney the comparatively indigent man not being able conveniently to afford the purchase of any such expensive assistance does everything by himself and without the assistance of an attorney deals with the attorney on the other side now observe the consequence to the patricians attorney the law secures a complete mendacitylicence everything that he says on behalf of his noble client is evidence—good evidence how stands it with the plebeian nothing that he can say on his own behalf will be so much as heard on the part of the attorney suppose the most palpable the most fiagrant perjury what has he to fear for absolutely nothing by no indictment for perjury can the man who is injured    by the perjury have any the smallest chance for satisfaction in any shape in the wretched shape of vengeance not he indeed give his testimony he may but no effect can it ever have here is oath against oath on no such evidence will conviction be ever suffered to have place what is observable is that in this source of injustice and oppression the aristocracy as such have an obviously strong and sinister interest whether it be in the nature of the case that they should fail of being fully sensible to the value of this sinister interest let every one judge §   evidence receivable received in every case from the applicant may be as well simplyindicative as appropriate or say ultimatelyemployable evidence rationale—reasons for the admission—   the individual whose interest the evidence serves or stands to serve may be unknown to the informant   to the informant more delay vexation and expense if any may be produced by intercourse or perhaps previous fruitless endeavours to obtain intercourse with persons interested than by repairing at once to the judicatory open as it is to him and to everybody at all times and provided with evidenceextractive powers of which he is destitute   a case that frequently has place is that by fear of others on whom he is more or less dependent—hope in like manner from others or sinister counsel—a person whose lawful interest would be served by giving the information which is in his power is prevented from so doing whereas if in consequence of simplyindicative evidence furnished by another person he had on receiving an appropriate mandate from a judge attended and delivered his evidence being thus seen acting under a manifest legal necessity no such displeasure on the part of the apprehended oppressor would probably have been entertained at any rate it would have prevented it from producing any such evil effect as that of a denial of justice   it may happen that though the question of particular interest is between individual and individual there has been in the act indicated a degree of turpitude such that on the account of the public it would be of use that the evil disposition of the agent should become generally known particularly important is the need of simplyindicative evidence in the case where by the regulation for the extraction of selfnotificative evidence a person of bad repute would as such be naturally disinclined to pay spontaneous attendance on the ground of the simplyindicative evidence any such person might nevertheless be made compellable simplyindicative evidence however although with reference to the particular fact in question unappropriate will not however be to be omitted out of the record rationale—  it may serve either to impugn or to confirm the trustworthiness of the person from whom in pursuance of the indication given appropriate evidence shall have been elicited   in case of criminal or culpable falsehood on the part of an indicative witness it may be necessary for his conviction of and punishment for that offence frequently from the same source—for example from the statement of the same person evidence of both descriptions will come at the same time in this case the distinction will with particular care be to be adverted to and held up to view by the judge §   modes of interrogation to be abstained from   factassuming interrogation—in this mode of the fact the existence or nonexistence of which is the subjectmatter of inquiry and proof the existence is assumed and taken for granted example—at what distance were you from your friends when you fired at them—the subjectmatter of pursuit being the alleged offence of firing a gun at those same friends for a question of this sort put by a judge or without reprimand suffered by him to be put the judge will be reprimanded and a memorandum of such reprimand entered on the judicialdelinquency register kept respectively by the appellate judges and the justiceminister for a question so put for the purpose of entrapping a defendant into a confession he may be dislocated §   choice as between species and species of evidence avoid as far as may be all recourse to character evidence—employ it not but where the event of the suit depends altogether upon the degree of credit given to the individual witness to whose character objection is made to this purpose consider that in english practice the punishment of death has every now and then been inflicted on the ground of no better or other evidence than the testimony of some one individual to whom as disreputable a character as can be imagined has at the same time been seen to belong he at the same time being apprized that the preservation of his life depends upon his giving his testimony in a certain direction to the judges notice the observation will not escape that to the thread of characterevidence when once begun to be spun there is no certain termination  0 generally speaking where as under this code the power of interrogation is given to every description of person in whose instance it affords a promise of being of use and the exercise of it is unfettered by needless and useless rules few mendacious witnesses will pass undetected and any additional light that by possibility might be afforded by examination into general reputation will be of little worth the mode of communication at all future times with every witness being secured and the faculty of reexamining at any time during or subsequently to the continuance of the suit in question being reserved under english practice it is to the inaptitude of the whole system that characterevidence and alibievidence are principally indebted for the importance ascribed to them and the use made of them alibi evidence—against deception and from evidence of this description the judge will be in a great degree guarded by the indispensable arrangement the communicationsecuring arrangement carried into practice as it will be in the instance of every individual who makes his appearance before a judge either in the character of applicant pursuer defendant or extraneous witness this is of the number of the cases in which an adequate demand for characterevidence is most apt and likely to have place §   causes of mendacity—practice of english judges of hudibras it is recorded thus—          he scarce could ope   his mouth but out there flew a trope of an english lawyer and more especially of an english judge the same thing may be recorded with much more truth and reason though without rhyme if for the word trope the word lie be substituted the judges more especially as being the causes that lies are in other men may be termed with distinction ϰατ εξοχην the fathers of lies for it is by them that from first to last lies have not only been tolerated and uttered but actually compelled—compelled on pain of outlawry if veracity be part of morality if in mendacity there be criminality—one of two things to any one be he who he may is inevitable—either morality itself must be an object of his contempt or the whole tribe of english judges they by whom if at their instigation a man refused to defile himself by a lie he would be punished by them as for a contempt—for that is the appropriate phrase—for contempt manifested to their authority evidence immediate and intermediate or say interventional by immediate understand a statement made by a selfalleged percipient witness in relation to the matter of fact reported by him by intermediate or say interventional evidence understand a statement made by a person who is not with relation to the matter of fact a selfalleged percipient witness but in relation to the matter in question has received his conception from some person represented to him in the character of a percipient witness to wit either immediately or through the medium of any number of intermediate witnesses making a statement to the same effect the one to the other in a chain of any length uses of intermediate evidence—  serving for the procurement of immediate evidence   eventually serving in lieu of or in addition to immediate evidence exceptions excepted intermediate evidence will not be ultimately employable to wit in the character of a ground or constituted part of a ground for a judicial decree or mandate exception is where the alleged percipient witness is not examinable but at the expense of preponderate evil in the conjunct and aggregate shapes of delay vexation and pecuniary expense §   probation probation is an operation which in all cases must be performed on the pursuers side and in many instances comes to be performed on the defendants side on the pursuers side under this system of procedure it being the natural one a course of probation is complete or incomplete and partial as it may happen being involved in the operation of application by and with which the suit commences it includes in it constantly two assertions the matter of one of them being the matter of law declaring the existence of a portion of the code to this or that effect the other having for its subjectmatter fact to wit an individual fact in relation to which an arrangement to the effect stated as above has been made by the portion in question of the text of the law of the application the substance and effect has been to demand at the hands of the judge a certain judicial service this service consists in giving on the occasion in question execution and effect to a certain portion of the text of the code viz the portion just spoken of and the warrant for the operation which the judge is so called upon to perform is the existence of the abovementioned matter of fact bearing such relation as above mentioned to the abovementioned portion of the matter of law example—suppose the service demanded compensation at the charge of a defendant for a wrong alleged to have been done by him to the pursuer by a blow given to him on a certain part of the body by the wrong thus done an offence belonging to a certain genus of offences has been committed—a genus of    which the denomination is wrongful corporal vexation in this case the matter of fact has for its alleged percipient witness the applicant himself who if he is to be believed has been the immediate sufferer by the wrong but suppose according to the case stated by him the person on whose body the wrong was inflicted—the offence committed—was not the applicant himself but a child of his too young to be capable of stating the matter of fact in this case we see two distinguishable matters or alleged matters of fact—   the act by which if the allegation be true the blow was given call this the principal fact   the act performed by the applicant in making the allegation to this effect call this the evidentiary fact by the allegation thus made the existence of the principal fact has been provisionally or say eventually proved if in the opinion of the judge the assertion so made is true insomuch that the principal fact asserted by it to have happened did really happen at the time and place asserted i e supposing him inclined to believe it—failing proof to the contrary he will declare accordingly but it may be for so the experience of the judge will have demonstrated to him that the allegation the applicant has thus been making is in the whole or some essential circumstance untrue by the applicant or his child no such blow was received—or if received received from accident such as an unintended push by another person or the fall of some utensil from a shelf c any of which matters of fact the defendant might and would with truth assert if the opportunity were given him of being heard relation had to the evidence so delivered as above such evidence if delivered by the defendant would be counterevidence it may be delivered either by the defendant himself who in virtue of being himself the deliverer of it would be a party witness or say a litigant witness or by a third person who not having been placed by the pursuer either on his side in confirmation of the demand as a copursuer or on the defendants side as a codefendant may be styled an extraneous witness but what may also be is that all the pursuer has said is exactly true and yet the fact thus averred and we will suppose and say proved by him will not be sufficient to warrant the judge in rendering to him the service so demanded as above it may be that though the defendant gave him the blow it was not till after he himself had given the defendant a blow and that a more violent one and that the blow so given to the pursuer had no other object than to prevent him from giving the defendant other blows which he saw the pursuer prepared to give making an assertion to this effect he will be delivering another species of counterevidence evidence probative of a fact not consisting of the negative of the fact asserted by the pursuer but of a totally distinct fact of the positive kind the effect of which in respect of the destroying the ground of the demand would be the same as that of the justmentioned negative one §   evidence as to character by evidence as to character or say characterevidence understand evidence having for its subjectmatter the aptitude of the individual—aptitude moral intellectual and active with relation to the part acted or proposed to be acted by him in the suit whether it be that of—  partypursuer   partydefendant or   extraneous witness case the  st that of a party on the pursuers side on the subject of the aptitude of the individual to be received in the character of pursuer no evidence will be received reason no person should be excluded from the capacity of demanding remedy in every shape from wrong in any shape case the  d that of a party on the defendants side on the subject of the aptitude of an individual to be received in the capacity of defendant no evidence will be received reason no person should be excluded from the capacity of preserving himself from undue burthen on the score of remedy for wrong alleged to have been done by him if he were he might be wrongfully subjected to whatsoever suffering is ordained by law to be inflicted whether for the purpose of satisfaction or the purpose of punishment case the  d that of an extraneous witness in the first instance exception excepted no evidence will be received in relation to the character of an extraneous witness exception is where the proposed witness has been convicted of judicial falsehood criminal or culpable or say with evil consciousness or through culpable inattention in such cases use may be made of the record in which such conviction is recorded and this without other reference than the inspection of that record on the spot or the procurement of it through the letterpost in the case when of two witnesses the evidence being irreconcilably contradictory and the decree as to the question of fact depending on the credence given to the one or the other—if in relation to one of the witnesses by a party on either side declaration is made that he is generally regarded as a person in whom mendacity is habitual power to the judge to elicit evidence in proof of the untrustworthiness so alleged    but in the exercise of this power he will be guided by the consideration of the importance of the subjectmatter in dispute compared with the expense delay and vexation likely to result from the elicitation of the mass of evidence the elicitation of which is likely to be on sufficient grounds demanded why in ordinary cases put an exclusion upon character evidence answer for the reason that the effect of any evidence in affirmance even of habitual mendacity will not be to produce the exclusion of the individual in the capacity of a witness sole effect that of producing an opinion in affirmance of a corresponding degree of comparative untrustworthiness on the part of his personal evidence for this opinion the utmost ground that can be afforded cannot amount to anything more than as a weakly operating article of circumstantial evidence it follows not that because a man has uttered wilful falsehood in cases where in case of mendacity no punishment awaited him he would in anything like to an equal degree he likely so to do in a case in which by such mendacity he exposed himself to the punishment appointed by the law for that crime boundless is the delay expense and vexation which it would be in the power of a mala fide litigant to necessitate if an unlimited right of calling in evidence for this purpose were established boundless the number of witnesses whose evidence might be called in in the first instance for the need would be variable according to the importance of the matter in dispute and the difficulty attendant on the question of fact with or without other circumstances incompatible with any wellgrounded decision on the question regarding evidence would be every attempt to fix the allowable number of characterwitnesses by any general rule but if in the first instance no wellgrounded limits could be put to the number of mendacityimputing witnesses as above so neither could there be to the number of mendacityimputing witnesses whose evidence was demanded for the purpose of imputing mendacity to any or all of the first set of mendacityimputing witnesses here then might be a second set—thence a third set—and so on the number increasing in a geometrical ratio to an assertion imputing habitual mendacity to a man—to an assertion to this effect how decidedly soever mendacious no punishment as for mendacity could be attached unless asseveration of individual acts of mendacity as having been committed on so many individual occasions were received but to give acceptance to such asseverations would be to include in the bosom of this suit the procedure in relation to as many distinguishable suits as those acts of mendacity so imputed for as in other cases so in this if criminative or inculpative evidence were received how consistently with justice could excriminative or exculpative evidence be excluded by the vexation which on the part of the witnesses themselves would be attached on the elicitation of their evidence a proportionable objection to the elicitation of it would be afforded as to compensation—out of no other pocket than that of the inviting party could it come and in this case the benefit of it would be allotted exclusively to the relatively opulent to the exclusion of the relatively unopulent existing system—it admits of characterevidence not only in relation to extraneous witnesses but in relation to parties defendant not only of the dyslogistic including the mendacityimputing cast but of the eulogistic cast and altogether boundless is it as to number and without exception as to quality is it as to the persons whom it renders consultable chapter xii initiatory hearing §   commencement of a suit every suit must have its commencement in this circumstance all suits agree but different sorts of suits or suits of the same sort may be commenced in any one of a considerable variety of modes under the present proposed code every suit takes its commencement in the same manner personal application made by some individual to the judge for to the judge and to him alone belongs the power to give execution and effect to it this accordingly may be styled the natural system of procedure sooner or later at some time or other an application by somebody to the judge unless he himself will give commencement to the suit cannot but be made but if made at all at what other period can it with so much propriety be made—be made with so little danger of substantial injustice with so little of evil in the shape of expense vexation and delay the expense is minimized for the sole expense is that of the applicants time vexation is minimized for to no individual is vexation in any other shape produced and in the case of that individual the vexation is more than compensated for or he would not inflict it on himself delay is also minimized or rather at this point it is excluded in no other mode can commencement be given to a suit without a mass of evil in the    united shapes of expense vexation and delay to which there are no bounds to commencement in this mode if this be the mode throughout the territories of the state a multitude of judicatories stationed with reference to facility of approach to applicants are evidently indispensable but whatever be their number it follows not that in the mode of procedure military judicature being out of the question any the smallest difference should have place under the english judgemade law not only different sorts of suits but in different judicatories suits of the same sorts take their commencement in a variety of different manners in all these judicatories the mode of commencement agrees however in this to wit that the suit does not commence by personal application made by any individual to the judge should any such application be made it would be instantly and not without indignation refused—a refusal with indignation which were the application made in secret would beyond dispute be justifiable and indispensable two different modes of commencement are here distinguishable—  nonpenal styled civil and   penal in the civil moreover may be distinguished two submodes—the commonlaw mode and the equity mode the commonlaw mode is that pursued in the commonlaw judicatories to wit the kings bench the common pleas and the commonlaw side of the exchequer in all cases the object being to put money into the pockets of the judges to that object and that alone except the like benefit to the other members of the firm of judge and co the mode of procedure is made subservient in westminster hall and its purlieus judge and co keep open shop for the profit upon the expense they sell to every individual that will pay the price of it the power of imposing expense and vexation to an amount more or less considerable—to any person and any number of persons or purchasers as may choose—at whatever distance it be from the shop so it is within the limits of the english part of the kingdom to this shop the plaintiff who has suffered wrong is forced to make application and thus add suffering to suffering ere he can begin to take his chance for relief the plaintiff whose object is to do wrong employs the hand of the judge as an instrument and having paid the price of it is then enabled to commence the career of wrong heaping suffering upon suffering until the measure of intended wrong is filled and the proposed quantity of suffering produced at these same shops are sold in this shape with the exception of certain privileged classes the personal liberty of every man to whoever would pay the price down to a certain time within the memory of men now living without other condition than that of paying the price since that time subject to a condition which while it diminishes the evil in extent gives increase to it in magnitude the seizure of the person cannot take place without a previous written instrument consisting of a declaration made by the plaintiff and sanctioned by an oath affirming the existence of a pecuniary demand on his part to a certain amount on the score of debt of the founders and supporters of this system of law the morality may be seen in the length of time during which this unlimited sale of this unlimited power of oppression continued to be carried on and also in the inadequacy of the remedy to its professed purpose instead of being creditor to his intended victim the plaintiff may be his debtor to an unlimited amount and still without incurring the professedly threatened penalty he may work the intended wrong by a word or two the form of working it with impunity could have been refused to every plaintiff who could not prove himself creditor upon the balance to mischief working by judge and co matters are so ordered that by no hand can remedy be applied other than that of judge and co it is accordingly on every occasion sure to be as secure and as fertile in ulterior mischief as the craft can make it in parliament by no hand but by that of a lawyer can relief to any oppression of which law is the instrument be applied if no one appears the bill is of course rejected scorn and contempt being at the same time the reward of the benevolent hand by which it was presented i am not prepared says the chief of the kings longrobed creatures in the house of lords—i am not prepared and in this situation the nonpreparation has the effect of the kings negative §   initiatory application litiscontestational the applicant being established in the character of a litiscontestational applicant or say pursuer and a correspondent memorandum entered on the register the judge willhave to consider the next operation or assemblage of operations which the nature of the case requires at his hands these operations may be either operations affecting persons alone operations affecting things alone or operations applying to persons and things exceptions excepted the next operation will be performed by the issuing of—  a proposed defendants attendancerequiring mandate in case of defendants more than one an attendancerequiring mandate for each one   a proposed defendants examinationmandate or say examinationpaper and so where there are proposed defendants more than one defendants examinationpaper addressed to    each the proposed defendant being in this case the only person addressed in the first place exceptions are when in consideration of the state of the case as resulting from the examination of the applicant as entered in the record it appears to the judge that the purposes of justice are more effectually accomplished by the simultaneous or previous issuing of an attendancerequiring or examination mandate as the case may appear to require addressed to a proposed copursuer or to a supposed evidence holder and proposed furnisher of evidence personal real or written or of all three sorts or of any two thereof as the case may be in case of need in lieu of an attendancerequiring mandate the judge may in the case of any one or more of such persons issue a prehension mandate of the need of a prehension mandate in lieu of an attendancerequiring mandate at the charge of the proposed copursuer an example may be found where in relation to the service required at the hands of the judge the proposed copursuer has an interest conjoint with that of the applicant but an apprehension exists lest through indolence or fear of resentment at the hands of a proposed defendant the proposed copursuer might be induced rather to give up the pursuit of such his interest than join in the pursuit of it note that if the apprehended nonpursuit would have for its cause fear of resentment as above it may be for the advantage of the proposed copursuer that his junction with the applicant pursuer should appear to be the result rather of inevitable necessity than of consent of this need of a course taken for causing the attendance or even response on the part of a proposed copursuer antecedently to attendance or response on the part of a proposed defendant or even to the issuing of a mandate for the procurement thereof respectively the same example may serve of the need of an attendancerequiring or a prehension mandate at the charge of a supposed evidence holder and proposed evidence furnisher examples are the same as in the case of a proposed copursuer and the reluctance on both accounts will be more apt to have place in regard to attendancerequiring or prehension at the charge of a proposed evidence furnisher the question for the consideration of the judge will be by which course the greatest detriment would accrue to the interest of both parties and the public to wit by the vexation attached to the furnishing of the evidence or by the danger of a decision adverse to the interest of the applicantpursuer for want of the evidence so desired of the vexation attached to the furnishing of the desired evidence the quantum will be considered on each of two suppositions to wit absence of compensation pecuniary or quasipecuniary and receipt of compensation in such quantity and quality as the judge may think reasonable and the applicant pursuer able and willing to allow on the occasion of such allowance it will also be for consideration what if any ground there is for the expectation that in the event of the pursuers succeeding in his demand it will be right the pecuniary and other circumstances of the proposed defendant considered and practicable at the same time consistent with justice that the burthen should be transferred from the shoulders of the pursuer to those of the defendant to this purpose a circumstance preeminently material will be the importance of the proposed evidencefurnishers evidence with relation to the event of the suit the case in which this importance will be in the highest degree is that where for the proof of the supposed fact the nature of the case does not at the time in question afford any evidence other than his next comes that in which in interest or supposed affection the supposed evidence holder and proposed evidence furnisher is apprehended to be adverse to the pursuers person or to this his demand the greater the number of the persons capable of furnishing the evidence required and the more material the evidence in the instance of each the less will be the need for taking the more vexatious course for the procurement of their evidence respectively for the more effectual avoidance of needless delay or vexation and expense—out of the whole number of supposed evidence holders proposed to him the judge may take for examination in the first instance any lesser number reserving to himself the power of doing the like in the case of any additional number and this not only at a time anterior to that of the defendants answer or personal attendance as the case may be but even at a time posterior not only to that of the defendants response or attendance but to the time of his having furnished evidence from extraneous and nonlitigant witnesses §   reiteration of suits—none previously to the giving admittance to the applicant in the character of pursuer the judge will examine him as to the having made the same demand by application to any other judicatory exceptions excepted—in respect of no suit which has been terminated or is pending in any judicatory shall application be made by any party on either side to any other than the appropriate appellate judicatory for in this case such fresh suit would if    suffered to be entertained have the effect of an appeal exceptions may be when after the termination of a suit in an immediate judicatory whether without appeal or with an appeal evidence the existence of which the applicant had no knowledge or suspicion of has been made known to him at the same time that for the elicitation of the aggregate mass of appropriate evidence including that which had been elicited in the course of the former suit in the judicatory thus applied to in the second instance the suit may be carried on and terminated in a manner more conformable to the ends of justice direct and collateral together taken in the aggregate than in the judicatory in which in and by the first suit it received its termination on an occasion of this sort by the examination of the applicant the judge will obtain satisfaction in relation to the facts from which it will appear on the side of which judicatory the balance is in respect of preponderate convenience if of the evidence thus adduced the effect be that of counterevidence in relation to a principal decided upon on the occasion of the former suit the judge will use his discretion as to the taking for the ground of his decision in addition to the fresh body of evidence the evidence elicited on the occasion of the former suit as exhibited in the record or reeliciting the evidence elicited on that former occasion or after eliciting the fresh evidence referring the applicant to the judicatory in which the suit received its termination in the former instance in case of his determining to employ the evidence elicited in the former suit an exemplar of it will of course unless mislaid or lost or wilfully destroyed be already in the possession or power of the applicant in contemplation of this contingency if the stock of such exemplars eight in number which are as many as are capable of being in equal perfection taken at once be not exhausted by other more certainly needful demands there may be a use in furnishing the party or parties on both sides with additional exemplars respectively it may be that by a party in whose disfavour though as far as the mass of evidence actually produced is considered on sufficient grounds the suit received its termination expectation of being able at some future time to exhibit a piece of evidence not at that time in his possession power or even knowledge may be entertained in this case it will rest with him to request of the judge for this purpose a spare exemplar and with the judge to grant or refuse it according to circumstances as above if the fresh evidence as announced do not contain in it any evidence of a nature to operate as counterevidence in relation to a principal fact evidenced to—a principal fact of the number of those to the probation of which evidence was employed in the former suit but only evidence in support of a counterfact that is to say a fact constituting or helping to constitute a decision opposite to that come to in the former suit—in such case the judge will not entertain any objection to the decision come to as to the matter of fact in the former case by the other judicatory but in relation to the evidence adduced as proof of the counterfact he will pronounce such opinion as appears to him well grounded and therefore and thereupon such imperative decree as the case requires in affirmance or disaffirmance of the decree pronounced on the occasion of such anterior suit on this occasion as on every other in which a fresh suit is endeavoured to be commenced on the ground of evidence alleged to have been discovered not till after the elicitation of the evidence in the course of the former suit the judge will with particular attention scrutinize into the truth of the allegation lest by needless reiteration of suits danger of misdecision or delay vexation and expense should by evil consciousness negligence or temerity be increased it may be that after the decease or incapacitation of him who was pursuer or defendant in the former suit discovery of fresh material evidence may have been made or may be alleged to have been made by the postobituary or other representative of the party in that former case in this case it may naturally happen that the knowledge of what passed on the occasion of the former suit is not so perfect and adequate on the part of the representative as it would have been on the part of the principal and in particular what may happen is that though the spare exemplar had been obtained by the principal neither of the one nor of the other is the existence known to the representative for the ascertaining the fact of the existence of such anterior suit the judge will in case of doubt address himself by an appropriate instrument—an informationrequesting address to any such judicatory or judicatories as the occasion shall have suggested to him as likely to possess the information needed §   demandpaper in the demand paper will be inserted the denomination of the offence to which it appears that the act is referable as in numerous instances the offences run into one another in such sort that the same individual act may without impropriety be susceptible of several denominations—or it may as yet be matter of uncertainty to which of several the evidence may on judicial examination    be found to apply—divers offences may to this purpose be named in the disjunctive when the demand paper is brought ready filled up under the proper heads time will so far be saved and trouble saved to the judge it will in this case have been the work of the pursuer or his legal advisers in the case where an uninformed and unassisted individual comes to tell his story to the judge it will belong to the judge upon taking his examination to fill up the demandpaper as the supposed facts come out in the course of the examination the denomination of the offence may from time to time be amended toties quoties offence or offences struck out—offence or offences added by the same person to the same person wrong in an indefinitely numerous variety of shapes each of them characterized by the denomination of an offence may have happened to have been committed by one and the same lot or mass of evidence it may happen to it to have been substantiated by decision pronounced on all the demands at the same time delay vexation and expense will be minimized thus by the multitude of the instances of wrong no room is afforded for the giving impunity in any of them in this case whatsoever has been the number of the wrongs committed each productive of its separate mischief so many separate demand papers may there be it may be that in regard to several wrongs committed on the same day by the wronger on the wronged in the instance of one or more of them the wronger has had one or more accomplices in another others in another none out of this circumstance arises a farther demand for separate demand papers demandpaper a demand and suit simply requisitive—not inculpative heads under which the matter of a pursuers demand is to be stated for the purpose of

be requisite and sufficient to put the pursuer in possession of his said equal fourth part of the said land this case is the one first brought to view as being in appearance at least the simplest but

descriptions as far as known or believed together with the several means of intercourse with them respectively for the purpose of the suit under the several heads in no i and ii mentioned viii evidence looked to in proof of the collative fact as per no vi under this head will not be to be entered on this paper anything besides the sources of the evidence known or supposed to be obtainable to wit such persons together with such writings and such other things if any as the pursuer looks to in that character for support to his demand the evidence itself will remain to be elicited at the hearing from those its several sources notes to demandpaper a sources of evidence on the evidence which will have to be adduced will depend the belief of the judge in affirmance of the existence of the collative fact or facts of which the applicants title on the ground of fact to the services demanded by him is composed in relation to this same evidence among the questions which in that view the pursuer will have had to put to himself and whereby in so far as he has failed so to put them to himself the judge will have to put them are the following—   questions as to personal evidence what person or persons are looked to as able and willing or capable of being lawfully made willing in quality of testifier to prove the existence of the collative fact or facts in particular—  the applicant or applicants   the proposed defendant or defendants   any other person or persons or any mixed assemblage composed out of the three sorts of testifiers whereof the two first will in such case be litigant the others extraneous testifiers or narrating witnesses   questions as to real evidence—to wit as to any state of things unmoveable or moveable to which it may happen to be capable of operating in the character of evidence or proof or explanation of a collative fact the things what and where present possessors or keepers who in particular the applicant or applicants—defendant or defendants—or third persons as above note that in respect of any appearance his body exhibits a person may as well as a thing constitute a source of real evidence a person for example on whose body the mark of a wound or bruise is visible   questions as to written evidence written evidence is a sort of compound evidence composed of personal and real to the questions who the persons are of whose discourse the writing is composed will accordingly be to be added the question who the persons are in whose possession or keeping the portions of discourse in question are of this note on the subject of evidence the matter will be seen to apply not less to the demand paper a than to all the several others ablative facts by some one article in the list of the facts constituted collative facts with relation to the right or title of a pursuer standing in the individual situation of the pursuer in question to receive the services hereby demanded must such his right or title have been conferred by any one article in the correspondent list of ablative facts it may have been taken away therefore of all such ablative facts the existence must of necessity be negatived by him case   suit simply requisitive of the proprietor of a mass of property the death operates as a collative fact in favour of each of his postobit successors as a collative fact to wit with relation to the right to the service rendered by the judge by making a division of the mass among such successor and his cointeressees and thereupon giving to him his share examples of an ablative fact are—  a release by any one such cointeressee in favour of the rest or any one of them   on the supposition of the deceaseds having a correspondent right exercise given by him to any ablative power divesting this or that one of them of his right to any such share notes to demandpaper b inculpative but not criminative in this case will require to be included the case which in romebred law in general and in bonapartes civil code in particular is styled that of a quasidelictum—quasidélit cod civ l iii tit iv ch ii art      to      p     this is the case where without any default of his own a person is rendered responsible for damage—having for its efficient instrument some person for whom or some thing for which it is in such case thought fit to render him responsible the person regarded as being in some sort in his power and the thing completely so in this case though it may be that by no    care on his part could the damage have been prevented yet after the damage had taken place he might have made or tendered compensation for it and in this way it is that though not criminal his conduct may perhaps not unreasonably have been deemed culpable under english law the demand in a case of this sort is what is called an action on the case effective service warning against excess in the quantity or value of the effective service demanded   whatsoever in a case of this sort be the subjectmatter of the demand it will be for the joint care of the pursuer and the judge so to adjust the description given of it that in case of noncompliance nonattendance and nonreparation on the part of the defendant an executionordering mandate issued by the judge may without other description than what is so agreed upon suffice to put the pursuer in possession of it if for want of sufficient information respecting the facts belonging to the case the pursuer cannot take upon him to fix the amount let him write in the appropriate space the words not yet ascertainable remains to be ascertained from the evidence   if although the demand be in respect of the collative fact well grounded the amount of the subjectmatter demanded is in respect of quantity or assigned value manifestly excessive the pursuer will be compensationally and punitionally responsible in consideration of and according to the amount of the excess the demand being to this amount ungrounded and the exaction of the service having the effect of oppression and extortion   by appropriate interrogatories it will be the care of the judge to bring the statement respecting quantity and value to such a degree of correctness as may warrant his giving possession to the demandant in the event of noncompliance on the part of the defendant after an appropriate mandate received by him   from the defendants counterstatement should any ensue it will appear what is the object of his contestation whether it is the applicability of the alleged collative fact or only the quantity or value assigned to the subjectmatter of the demand counterevidence if any the pursuer—does he know of any—can he think of any evidence the tendency of which may either in his own opinion or as he believes in that of a defendant be to weaken the opinion supported by the evidence adduced by himself as above if any such counterevidence exists the earlier the mention of it is exacted the better—the better for the parties on both sides by the requisition thus made of it the eyes of the pursuer are thus of necessity turned to the state of the case as it must have presented itself to the other side and by the comprehensive view thus taken the ulterior vexation and expense of the suit may be saved to himself as well as the whole of it to the defendant after being thus interrogated if knowing of any such counterevidence he omits to furnish indication of it the omission will be circumstantial evidence of evil consciousness and in addition to other evidence will of itself constitute sufficient ground for a dismissal of his demand and it may moreover be punishable in the character of a separate and substantive offence to wit falsehood mendacious or temeracious as the case may be to counterevidence apply of course the same distinctions as those which as above have place in the case of evidence the facts to which the counterevidence applies may as well be those which with relation to the pursuers title bear the relation of ablative facts as those which bear to it the relation of collative facts if they are collative facts the tendency of it will be either to disprove in a direct way the existence of them or to cause to be regarded as unreasonable the inference deduced in affirmance of them from the evidence on that side if ablative facts the tendency of it will be to prove the existence of those same ablative facts counterdemand if any reasons for inquiry under this head are the same as in case of counterevidence subheads for inquiry the same as in the case of the demand as above judicial service under this head will be comprised whatsoever chain of operations may be necessary to be performed by the judge ere the effective service or some succedaneum to it can have been rendered to the pursuer these operations or elementary judicial services as they may be called will be the result of the exercise given to the several distinguishable functions brought to view in the constitutional code chapter xii judiciary section   elementary functions—the last link in the chain being constituted by the exercise given to the imperative function by means of the mandate or mandates by which execution and effect is given to that portion of the law which the pursuers demand has in this case for its ground to bring to view these operations in all the varieties of which they are susceptible will be the occupation of the remainder of this same procedure code ablative facts in the case of a wrong—an inculpative fact on the part of the proposed defendant thence a collative fact with relation to the pursuers right or title to satisfaction at his charge is an act of the sort    of these which by the law in question are constituted offences unless accompanied by some one of the circumstances included in a correspondent list of justificative or exemptive circumstances if any such ablative fact has place his title to the service in question has no place if of any such ablative fact the existence be known to him he is in a state of evil consciousness with relation to his demand—consciousness of the invalidity of it and of the groundlessness of the vexation he is seeking to impose on the defendant and this state of evil consciousness as to the application he is making involves in it an act of insincerity for which he may as reasonably and beneficially be punished as for mendacious evidence in relation to any external and physical fact as to this matter see what is said in relation to counterevidence proposed defendant to wit the person at whose charge the services effective and judicial are demanded—who would be the sufferer by their being rendered—and who accordingly by a corresponding interest is urged to oppose their being rendered to the pursuer this person may be either known or unknown if unknown the application cannot as yet be anything but informative contentious it cannot be termed unless and until by means of appropriate arrangements taken by the judge for the discovery of the person a contestation with him is commended the case in which he is thus as yet unknown will most commonly be a penal one that being the sort of case in which with a degree of force correspondent to the magnitude of the suffering produced by the obligation of rendering satisfaction—or by the punishment liable to be undergone or by both as the case may be—his interest will be urging him to keep himself from being known by accident however this latentcy may have place in a case where the suit is simply requisitive as to which see demand paper a as also in any case whether inculpative or not in which by the contemplation of the inconvenience attached to the fulfilment of the obligation endeavoured to be imposed upon him he is prompted to evade it note to demandpaper d evidence in a penal case whether the offence and the species of suit are as here purely public or whether they are publicoprivate as in the case of the demand paper e the evidence will commonly have three distinguishable subjectmatters to wit—  the matter of fact or state of things regarded as productive or tending to be productive of mischief and supposed to have been the result of the act of some human agent   the nature of that same act   the personality of that same agent of these three distinguishable subjectmatters of knowledge and evidence the first may be known while the second and third are as yet unknown of damage produced by conflagration the existence may for example be known when as yet it is not known whether human agency bore any part in the production of it so again the damage being known what may also be known is that human agency the act of some person had part in the production of it while as yet it is not known who that person is in romebred law the state of things regarded as fraught with mischief with the circumstance of its having had human agency for its cause constitute together what is called the corpus delicit—in french corps du délit the body of the offence and are frequently spoken of as composing a subject of evidence and investigation distinct from the consideration of the personality of the supposed criminal or culpable agent this distinction may also have place in several modifications of the case in which as in demand paper b the suit whether inculpative or not is not criminative §   pursuers demand how amendable as in this stage so in any subsequent one the ground of the demand as stated by the pursuer to the defendant may at any time be changed and so toties quoties at this stage it is producible in the case where at the time of his application the pursuer adduces and has obtained the examination of an extraneous witness if the case be such that the pursuer in his situation might have foreseen the superiority of aptitude on the part of the second or say amended ground in comparison of the original ground he will be compensationally responsible to the defendant for any disadvantage by the change produced to him in respect of any of the ends of justice if not the burthen must rest upon the defendant uncompensated of amendments of this sort the need has its principal source in the variations which with or without evil consciousness or even temerity may have place and are continually having place between any account that may have been given by a witness to a pursuer extrajudically and the account given by the same witness judicially while under examination various are the causes by which such variance is capable of having been produced such as—   difference in respect of the sense of responsibility between the one occasion and the other on the extrajudicial occasion responsibility in respect of verity none and on the other occasion the responsibility maximized    this cause is the most powerfully operative and accordingly the most obvious   difference between the state of the memory on the one occasion as compared with the other here comes in the operation of two antagonizing causes on the first occasion the recollection being in its freshest state is naturally more clear correct and vivid but on the second occasion the demand for the operation of recollection having intervened the attention bestowed will naturally have been more intense and by this means any deficiency which for want of attention may have had place in the statement made on the first occasion may have received supply here by the bye may be seen how vast the importance of the avoidance of delay may be and commonly will be in reference to the direct as well as to the collateral ends of justice by every day of unnecessary delay addition is made to the probability of illsuccess to him who is on the right side to the probability of good success to him who is on the wrong side the points in relation to which the need of such amendment may have place are the following—   ground of the demand in point of law as per table of rights and table of wrongs and the chapter and section of the code to which the case belongs   place at which the fact in question happened   time at which the fact in question happened—at which the state of things in question had place—at which the act in question positive or negative was performed §   commencement of suits—english practice the establishment of eventual forthcomingness and responsibility on the part of applicants will be seen to be a business of no small intricacy and difficulty when provided for as it must be on an allcomprehensive scale it is a business for which under the current systems there is no demand and which to those whose whole experience and attention have been confined to those systems will be apt to appear superfluous and no less trifling than troublesome the defects of those systems under this head have two causes varying according to the nature of the case— if the suit be a nonpenal one no person is received to state his case in his own person unless it be with a professional assistant at his elbow in england in particular matters are so ordered that while by the instrumentality of a professional assistant any person may institute a suit of this kind against any person for anything or for nothing at all—no person even if by miracle he could without that instrumentality contrive to institute any such suit could even by any such miracle institute it in the presence of the judge in england in particular the judge keeps open a shop at which on payment of a fixed sum without so much as supposing himself to be in the right any man may purchase the assistance of the judge towards ruining any other man the judge by purposed ignorance escaping from all responsibility for the misery to which he gives birth and from which he profits as the party cannot thus buy his chance for justice otherwise than by the hand of a professional assistant the lawyer will not lend his assistance unless in his view of the matter he has sufficient security for the costs his own pay included and thus all such trouble as that of inquiring into the circumstances of customers is saved to the judge to lawyers of all sorts and sizes thus is convenience maximized to nonlawyers the consequence is that he who has not wherewithal to pay for a ticket in the justice lottery in the character of plaintiff goes to a certainty without justice and in this situation are at least ninetenths of the whole population while in the character of defendant he who cannot pay the costs of defence is in every instance between plaintiff and lawyers consigned to complete and certain ruin without possibility of escape the judge having taken care to know nothing about the matter being thus as completely guiltless of the misery he has produced as a murderer would be of murder by shutting his eyes while the bullet was doing its office in a penal case the matter stands on a different footing judges themselves could not save themselves from having their houses broken open if the applicants were not received as indiscriminately as here proposed to give information respecting the most highly punishable class of criminal offences but here too the judge of the highest rank make his escape from responsibility and trouble in every shape the troublesome part of the business is committed to an underling who may be occupied about it for days while a small part of the day is all that is occupied by the great judge matters having been brought into preparation for that purpose meantime not small is the degree of convenience provided for the underlings if the individual accused by the information given is one whom nobody knows—the information being upon oath the oath is sufficient warrant for immediate incarceration without any such trouble as that of an inquiry into the trustworthiness of the informant but now suppose the individual accused to be one whom everybody knows in this case there is no degree of solicitude but what will naturally be employed in the inquiry into the trustworthiness of the informant    §   judication without audition anglicé—its absurdity if without knowing or hearing a word about the disorder of the patient the physician were to pour down his throat a dose of physic or the surgeon lay hold of him and bleed him they would do exactly what in cases called civil ones the legislature and the judge do in the first instance by the defendant at the commencement of a suit under english law what they have never cared about is how much the party will suffer from what is done what they have always cared about and what is all which at any time they have cared about is the money and the power the money they thus receive and the power they thus exercise under the english system in those judicatories which are called commonlaw courts in contradistinction to equity courts—if the defendant fails as to the contesting the demand in proper form the plaintiff obtains in his favour what is called a judgment but a judgment on which without a further proceeding under which the evidence belonging to the case is elicited nothing can be done this proceeding is performed in virtue of what is called a writ of inquiry the judge being not the judge of the judicatory in which the suit was begun but a subordinate functionary called the sheriff by whom had the inquiry been made in the presence and under the direction of the judge simple execution would have been given to the judgment then pronounced this lot of factitious delay vexation and expense has for its cause what may be called the judicialignorancemaximizing principle or thoughtsaving principle—that principle which has for its object the giving to the judge his profit out of the suit with the least expense possible on his part in the articles of time labour and thought of the number of the suits of which in a twelvemonth the judge by his signature pretends to have taken cognizance only in the case of some small proportion has he from first to last known anything at all about the matter and thus in the great majority of cases the money exacted by the judges for five is the number of those employed in doing nothing or worse than nothing is so much obtained on false pretences an offence punished in the case of mean evil doers and punished by those same judges with what is called transportation for seven years—that is to say banishment and confinement to hard labour for that time go to a commonlaw judicatory you thus get decision without thought and without effect go to an equity judicatory you get thought or at least prate without decision prate in plenty with years of delay between prate and prate thus has it been now for more than twenty years past ever since the country has been afflicted by lord eldon chapter xiii defence how elicited §   modes or shapes complication will be here presenting itself in appalling abundance the best remedy imperfect as it cannot but be—carelessness would join with unscrupulous hostility in denouncing as the cause of the disease parties each at the same time pursuer and defendant one or more in every judicial territory to each party a swarm of witnesses such is not only the conceivable but possible nature of the disease happily it is not a frequently exemplified one as to the here proposed system so far from creating additional evil in the shape of misdecision delay expense or vexation it provides new and manifestly efficacious securities against evil in all these several shapes these are—to wit   the universallyextending responsibility in case of falsehood   the universal exposure to subsidiary oral after epistolary examination to english practice neither do these any more than any other class of cases ever present the smallest difficulty be the gordian knots ever so complicated and ever so numerous in the hand of chicane is a sword by which difficulty in every shape is cut through without difficulty whatsoever statements demandative or defensive—whatsoever evidence the nature of each case calls for—all are elicited in one or other of the two most deceptious most untrustworthy modes that human ingenuity could have divined—affidavit evidence and secretlyelicited responsion to a system of interrogatories framed in the dark and epistolary responsion incapable of being followed and purified by oral interrogation—modes having for their object the sinister emolument of their contrivers and for their instrument a galaxy of perjuries when the division of the sweets commences in the place of creditors come in the two classes of selfcreated harpies the judge in all his forms and his instrument and dependant the professional lawyer in all his forms the filth of the harpy finds in the mixture of mendacity and absurdity poured forth from their lips and from their pens its not unworthy representative the money they fly off with—the defiled paper and parchment they leave in lieu of it as to parties witnesses and their sufferings the same sort and degree of regard do they find in the breast of the authors as do those of the negro in that of the planter—those of the hindoo in that of his english proprietor—those of the irish catholic in    that of the orangeman—those of the nonreligionist and rival religionist in the imagination of the religionist sufferings which a man neither feels nor sees cannot be too great as to those which are seen by him by some they are seen with pain by others with indifference by others again with delight where having nothing to gain by deviation from any of the ends of justice—nothing to gain by misdecision delay vexation and expense and at the same time everything to suffer from it at the hands of the legal and publicopinion tribunals with the light of publicity shining in full splendour upon his every word and action—it were strange indeed if more were not done by the judge towards lessening the evils opposite to the ends of justice than if motives for the endeavour to lessen them were altogether wanting—still stranger if more were not done by him than can reasonably be expected to be done by judges whose interest it being for such their predecessors have made it to maximize the mass of those same evils it has of course been a constant object of their endeavour—the end in view of all their operations thus circumstanced under the english system have been the whole hierarchy of the judges of the higher order subject only to here and there a slight and narrow amendment at the hands of the acknowledged legislature of which they were all along themselves the oracles the system of procedure has always been under their direction in the double capacity of effective legislators and judges judges applying the law—that very law which on pretence of declaring it for this is the cant word their predecessors and they themselves have all along used—declaring that to have existence which even in and by this very declaration is declared not to have been made by anybody not by the legislature true and thus much must be allowed though it is they who say it but according to them neither is it by themselves that it is or has been made though if not by themselves by whom else can it have been made in the whole system may be distinguished for this purpose three chief modes of procedure the commonlaw civil the commonlaw penal or criminal and the equity mode in no one of them except for the purpose of lucrative contribution is any real regard actually paid to the direct ends of justice in no one of them in the regulations established is any regard so much as professed or pretended to be paid to the collateral ends of justice bribetaking which is out of the question—bribetaking is never practised it not being safely practicable not being imputed to them how is it it may be asked that they are gainers by misdecision the answer is—in one vast class of cases one gain they can make and at all times have made—by favouring a party which it was their interest to favour—and that is in causes in which government takes an interest in the side on which government is—that government of which they themselves are such actively efficient and highly interested members but as to the practice of misdecision another interest they have which though not so manifest is much more extensive in its application and operation than that just mentioned this is the effect of misdecision in the production of uncertainty it is on the uncertainty that they depend in a great measure for the whole assemblage of their insincere their malâ fide customers so far as regards the question of law were the state of the law known to all no one unless on the ground of knowingly false evidence would venture to institute an illegal claim or defend himself against a legal one but having so arranged matters that he who is rich enough to pay the price is sure of success against all those whose pecuniary means are to a certain degree inferior to his own the greater the number of chances of success which by the adjective law of their own creation they have given to those against whom the substantive branch of the law has expressed itself or has been thought to express itself the greater the encouragement for them to engage in a groundless and unjust pursuit or in a groundless and unjust defence as the case may be this policy of theirs has as it were betrayed itself by an expression which could not be prevented from growing into use this is that in which the ground of decision has been distinguished into two modes decision according to the merits and decision not according to the merits now as to these two the expression in cases decided otherwise than upon the merits may serve for indication of all the cases in which either for an individual benefit in the shape of corruption to the individual judge then deciding or for the aggregate benefit of the profession—misdecision has been exemplified—injustice knowingly and wilfully committed decision otherwise than on the grounds of the merits is in other words decision on technical grounds the decision on technical grounds will so long as it remains remain a permanent and inexhaustible spring of safely commissable and committed injustice for the technical rule being palpably repugnant to justice the judge at all times has for choice the choice between adhering to the unjust rule and so favouring the one side or departing from the rule and so favouring the other in the commonlaw mode to wit in the case of jury trial all the witnesses on both    sides are brought together at once at the same hours on the same day and thus the maximum of dispatch it may be alleged is secured but supposing this to be the case in general no advantage would be given by it over and in comparison with the here proposed mode why because in every instance in which the end is really the end conducive to justice it may and naturally will be employed in the here proposed mode whereas whenever that at present established mode is not conducive to but opposite to the ends of justice be the opposition ever so strong it cannot but be employed in the established mode the interval of time between the commencement of the suit and the delivery of the evidence must be that which is necessary to let in that piece of evidence the elicitation of which will require the largest portion of time and during the whole of this largest portion all those pieces of evidence which might have been elicited in smaller portions of time must remain unelicited one consequence is that the greater the portion of time and the greater the number of witnesses whose testimony is requisite the greater is the probability of the deperition of evidence of a result by which injustice may be inevitably and irremediably substituted to justice effects and fruits the causes of this regulation many for judge and co money obtained on some occasions some of it on grounds which may be true or false as it happens on others by pretences which are constantly and certainly false on some occasions on application made order for enlargement follows of course in these cases what is done for relief of the party is done by judge and co for money obtained by them on false pretences the act pretended is an application made to the judge of no such application individually taken does the judge ever hear parties to the fraud the attorney who instructs the barrister to make a motion—i e an application to the judge—and the barrister who pretends to have made it by this fraud  0s  d is gained by the barrister somewhat less by the attorney the barrister writing his name for the money the attorney having previously written a few words more by this fraud which the suitor is made to pay for he is saved from the burthen whether of compensation or punishment which otherwise would be imposed upon him by the judge the judge by the fear of that burthen which otherwise would to a certainty be imposed extorting from the suitor the money thus thrown by him into the hands of these his partners in the judicatories which act under the name of equity this union of fraud and extortion is at the same stage of the suit repeated once or twice as a matter of course in one particular all these modes agree for every operation by whomsoever performed an allowance of time is fixed by general regulation by this generality a negative is thus put upon the very idea of having any regard to the convenience of any one individual on either side in each individual suit the chances are as an unlimited number to one in favour of injustice to the damage of one side or both if it is too short the party who is in the right has not time enough to do that which is necessary to the manifestation of his right and here comes the injustice which is opposite to the direct ends of justice if too long i e longer than is necessary for the manifestation of his right here by the amount of the excess comes delay—delay to the prejudice of the collateral ends of justice and from delay comes vexation with more or less probability of expense when on any special ground true or false more delay is desired money in much greater abundance is extorted an application to the judge is really made evidence to support the allegation—a mass of written evidence is tendered to his cognizance the evidence is penned not by the individual—him whose statement it contains—but by an attorney by whom it is licked into a form deemed suitable to the occasion and the purpose along with this evidence goes an account of it—a sort of comment on it drawn up likewise by the attorney this comment is called a brief and is delivered to the advocate the application thus made may be opposed by a counterapplication from the other side drawn up in the same manner and thus out of the belly of the principal suit is bred an incidental one even within the bounds of the kingdom of england not to speak of united kingdoms and distant dependencies the distance of the abode of the suitor from the judgmentseat varying from a few feet to little less than three hundred miles—from this circumstance may be formed a judgment what sort of regard in the establishment of these timefixation rules was paid to the convenience of the people in quality of suitors and of what sort was the motive which in the establishment of them constituted the final and thence the efficient cause the demands for postponement being throughout the process multiplied partly by nature partly by ingenious industry and under the name of vacation vast intervals of relative inaction having been most impudently established—suits in unlimited abundance are thence to be crowded by regulation into spaces of time incapable of holding them suits are thus put off from year to year every interval being a gulf in which the fortunes    of the least opulent of the contending parties is swallowed up iniquity being triumphant in the person of the most opulent for the sowing of these regulations the seed of which all the money was the fruit—the originallylookedfor and continuallygathered fruit—it was necessary to prepare the ground the grand operation by which this preparation was effected was the regulation by which the parties on both sides are in every possible case kept as far as possible excluded from the presence of the judge suppose the applicant in his presence—to the extent of his knowledge and belief any matter which presents a demand for consideration for the purpose of the suit may be extracted from him at that one hearing and thus a plan of operations for the conclusion of the suit with the greatest probability of rectitude of decision and with the least delay expense and vexation may to the best advantage be formed at this early stage which by this means will in many instances be made the last stage and in many more the last but one here would have been the maximum of appropriate knowledge—of the knowledge of those things the knowledge of which is necessary to justice shutting the door against this salutary knowledge the contrivers of the system by this one operation flagitious and daring as it was endowed themselves with that ignorance—that happy because thenceforward necessitybegotten and thence irreproachable ignorance—which presented an excuse and served them as a veil for all the depredation and oppression which was the fruit of it for the exigencies of individuals no provision was thenceforward made why not made because the knowledge of them was not possible and why not possible because by these judges themselves care so effectual had been taken so to order matters as to prevent it and that so long as the system founded on in it lasted from being possible §   defence how procurable generally the place of defendants accersition and examination will be the originating judicatory this exceptions excepted will be at applicant pursuers choice but restrictions are necessary to prevent overloading reason   certainty of it being the most convenient to   applicant   not certain its being less so to any one else but only in one can the suit be terminated thence special preponderant inconvenience excepted the best is the originative sole reason for transfer incidental or definitive to a post originative judicatory—diminution of delay expense and vexation attendant on the accersitees editor  journey and demurrage from this the danger of misdecision would not be diminished but increased causes of increase of delay expense and vexation in this case—   no day for defendants next attendance could be appointed by the judge originative for the first could not know when the second would have relative leisure   no day till in consequence of a correspondence between him and the judge postoriginative   no determinate information could be given to the pursuer as to the time of defendants statement and testimony in this case nevertheless power to judge originative to make transference incidental or definitive to a judge postoriginative for special reason referring to delay vexation and expense when the party addressed is not adducted or accersed to the original judicatory if oral statement or evidence is required domiciliary or topographical excepted it must be at another say a postoriginative judicatory pro tanto here then will be transference hence unavoidable addition to delay vexation and expense—especially in case of retromission cause and measure of the increase distance between the judicatories cause of multiplication multiplicity of persons accersible whether defendants copursuers or witnesses judge of the originative judicatory cannot make known the earliest time of relative leisure in another as in his own judicatory and not at all without previous correspondence for obtaining statement and evidence where the parties are many the most eligible mode epistolary backed by subsidiary oral the subsidiary may be either—  on the original inquiry or   reserved for the recapitulary ditto the defendant not being at the time in question present in the judicatory the epistolary is the only mode which in the first instance the nature of the case admits of to wit by missives sent to the defendant from the judge remains for consideration in which mode the defendant shall in the first instance on receipt of such missive address the judge if in the oral mode it will be by attendance at the judicatory where the originating judicatory is the judicatory of all parties on both sides the mode of subsequent judicial intercourse will be the oral mode the epistolary mode is the most conducive to the collateral ends of justice in the following cases—   expatriation   subsequent judicatory too distant for accersition to the originative    when a day is fixed for the defendants attendance at the judicatory—required by the mandate in the meantime if the time admit will be—   a defendants response paper promising attendance on the day prescribed or making excuse as to the day and offering attendance on another day therein mentioned   a defence paper in a form correspondent to that of the demand paper evidence selfserving or selfdisserving or both together to be delivered in the epistolary mode will at the same time be called for or not as to the judge may seem most conducive to the ends of justice of the matter thereupon received from the defendant communication will be made by the judge if time admit to the pursuer or pursuers that on the mutual hearing he or they may be better prepared examples of the matter of the appropriate response at the maximum of simplicity are—   defendants acknowledgment or denial of a document purporting to be his whether in his handwriting or not   ditto of a statement supposed to be orally uttered by him   ditto of the receipt of a missive   ditto of a death with circumstances as per demand paper   ditto of a birth with circumstances as per ditto §   defendants attendance—its uses of a defendants personal attendance at the judgmentseat among the purposes or uses are the following— i uses to the pursuers side   furnishing appropriate confessorial evidence   furnishing indicative evidence of ditto   furnishing information of means of effective responsibility at his charge satisfactional or punitional or both as the nature of the case requires and affords   furnishing means of coenduring accessibility on his part for the purpose of the suit ii uses to his the defendants side   furnishing his own appropriate selfserving evidence if he has any   furnishing indicative evidence as to expected extraneous appropriate evidence expected to be in his favour and obtaining mandates for the elicitation of it to wit either contesting the pursuers collative facts or establishing facts which with reference to his title are ablative   furnishing the opportunity of applying counterinterrogation to the pursuer in respect of his selfserving evidence   furnishing an opportunity of eliciting the pursuers response to his the defendants counterdemands if any such he has and his own selfserving evidence in support of them   furnishing to the defendant an opportunity of eliciting the evidence of the extraneous witnesses attending on his side if any such there be   so of counterinterrogating the pursuers extraneous witnesses if any such there be iii uses to both sides   furnishing to both the faculty of settling for ulterior proceeding the course most convenient to both   faculty of receiving and profiting by any such advice as for their mutual benefit and that of the public the judge may see occasion to give   in particular receiving from him any such information and advice as may guard them against the propensity and endeavours of professional assistance to add to the unavoidable expense vexation and delay factitious ditto for the sake of the profit upon the expense   obtaining relevant testimony without being dependent for it on the good will of the percipient witnesses or other persons capable of yielding it note here how favourable this means of mutual explanation is to the interests and desires of the sincere—how adverse to those of the insincere suitor on both sides thence how adverse to the sinister interest of professional advisers and assistants by proportionally depriving them of the custom of the persons who would otherwise be insincere litigants hence the cause why in all systems of procedure more or less endeavours so anxious and successful have been employed in keeping the parties from coming into the presence of each other together with that of the judge §   consideranda to be considered at this stage as to communication for the judicial purpose are—ends to be aimed at and the nature of the suit   persons to be communicated with   purposes for which they may be respectively to be communicated with   communicaters or addressers—persons by whom for those purposes respectively communication may require to be made   addressees—persons to whom the several communications may respectively require to be made   operations which on the occasion of the several communications may require to be performed for those several purposes   instruments or say written forms which for the performance of those several operations may respectively require to be issued   correspondent considerations in regard to things moveable and immoveable persons who for judicial purposes at this stage may need to be communicated with—      pursuers cointeressee or cointeressees on his side as proposed copursuers   proposed witness or witnesses on pursuers side   proposed defendant or defendants purposes as to proposed copursuers—   delivery of their demand paper   settling with each other the proposed purport and tenor of those their demands   settling with one another and the judge what next course shall be taken as to communication with proposed pursuers witnesses and defendants   settling who to apply to as proposed witnesses   settling the most convenient mode of communicating with them for that purpose   settling whether as to the defendant any and what means of preliminary security are necessary note that of any such cointeressee and proposed copursuer the existence is matter of accident and in most instances will not have place proposed witness viz such only whose capacity of testifying is supposed known to original pursuer or copursuers purposes—   sending to him a witnesss attendance mandate or else   a witnessexamination mandate   receiving from him in either case a witnesss compliance announcing response   or a witnesss excuse paper or   a witnesss testificative response or in case of attendance   receiving him and examining him on his attendance   in case of necessity causing him to be prehended and adduced for the purpose of examination to wit by a witnesss adduction mandate delivered or sent to an appropriate functionary—a prehender by proposed witness understand also holder of written or other real evidence required to be adduced or transmitted proposed defendant—say one purposes—   sending to him a proposed defendants compliance or defence and attendancerequiring mandate   receiving from him a complianceannouncing response or   a defence paper with an attendanceannouncing response or   a defendants excuse paper   receiving and examining him on his attendance   in case of his being examined in the epistolary mode—in addition to his defence paper his defendants testification paper   in case of necessity causing him to be prehended and adducted for the purpose of examination by a defendants adduction mandate delivered or sent to a prehender as above whether it be the effect to be produced and the operation to be performed ultimate execution to be given to the laws and service demanded thereby rendered—preliminary security to be afforded—countersecurity to be afforded—testimony to be elicited—and for all these several purposes intercourse with justiciables and judicial functionaries commenced and carried on—the endeavour of the judge will be to combine with the maximum of efficiency and the maximum of promptitude or say the minimum of delay the minimum of vexation or afflictiveness including the minimum of vexatious expense cæteris paribus that mode of operation which is most prompt will be least afflictive to the pursuers side it will manifestly be most beneficial so likewise to the defendants side except in so far as by delay in respect of the rendering the service due he is served at the expense of the pursuer and of the interest of the public in respect of justice middle agency the judge will take care not to employ without necessity by every middle agent unnecessarily employed chance of ultimate failure is increased—delay certainly increased—and either vexation to the agent or expense in satisfaction for it increased in particular where to the loss of any person—a defendant for example—property is to be transferred he will make graphical transfer of it with his own hand without compelling the defendant to be instrumental in the transference or conveyance compulsion may be necessary to produce disclosure it cannot be to effect graphical transfer of the options which the judge will thus have continually to make he will all along give the reasons in particular where of divers courses for efficiency he holds himself obliged to employ the most afflictive having obtained from the applicant the appropriate grounds—before the termination of the first hearing the judge will have determined as far as may be and communicated to the applicant the particulars of the ulterior course in case of retention he will in the first case determine whether any and what preliminary measures of security are requisite to be taken according to the nature of the suit for securing execution and effect to the law at the same time whether then to commence intercourse with the defendant or antecedently whether with any and which of the persons following—   if the applicant be a proxy the principal or principals  0   whether a proxy or the principal any and what copursuer or copursuers   any extraneous witness or witnesses for the purpose of eliciting their respective evidences with the defendant and defendants without waiting for responsion from any other persons or service from them in any other shape as above he will bating special reason to the contrary commence holding intercourse no such intercourse will be commenced unless from the applicants statement made under responsibility the judge is satisfied that taking it for correct he will be justified in the exaction of the service demanded if neither compliance with the demand nor response contesting the justice of it be received after adequate evidence of the receipt of the mandate to that effect on this ground with or without preliminary measures of security as above he will address himself to the defendant or defendants commanding either immediate reddition of the service demanded or responsion at the judicatory or elsewhere by means of an appropriate defence paper contesting the justice of the demand chapter xiv

defendants in any number by every suit two services are requested principal and instrumentary principal by the defendant instrumentary by the judge in causing the principal to be rendered active or passive may be the principal the defendants service—active where for the rendering it motion on the part of the defendant is necessary as in paying money performing manual labour passive as in suffering money or goods to be taken out of his possession or his body to be imprisoned active is always the instrumentary the judges service in it are comprised of course as elementary services all those necessary to the removal of obstructions to the rendering of the principal service—all such services as well on the part of the judge as of all persons who for purposes of this kind are by law

wrong being done to one individual more than another none has need of the service rendered by satisfaction for special wrong publicoprivate where wrong having been done to an individual or to a class less than the whole community service by satisfaction is needed and demanded accordingly of the service rendered by suffering punishment no individual having more need than another the pursuer if any

termination of the original suit exemplification of the use of these rules as applied to testimonial falsehood uttered in the course of the suit—in one and the same suit by the same or any other person or persons testimonial falsehoods may in any number have been uttered when the grounds for withholding credence have been sufficient for conviction of falsehood and no further ground or grounds for defence could be obtainable by any separate suit in the english system for want of such rules falsehoods by thousands remain unpunished and in a vast proportion give to the criminal the profit sought by his crime in case of a separate prosecution the expense delay and vexation being vast and certain adequate motives wanting and conviction judgment and execution eminently uncertain practical

attendance take cognizance of all subjects of disagreement and decide accordingly doing what can be done towards reestablishing amity of affection and producing on both sides a sentiment of

suit plurilateral viz bilateral necessary to constitute a suit—situations two whereof the judges one the other either defendants or pursuers suit in both cases unilateral case where defendants side only has place pursuers being wanting judge occupies it examples—      suit penal procedure styled romanicè inquisitorial in contradistinction to accusatorial the more ordinary mode initiator here the judge to the judicial he adds the pursuers function information he needs none on suspicion seat and perhaps source confined within his own breast he convenes or causes to be prehended the object and by interrogation extracts evidence direct or circumstantial or both—direct from responsion circumstantial from responsion or silence and deportment if judge acts from information the more apt course would be to consign the pursuers function to the government advocate   suit nonpenal—audit of accounts judge styled auditor case in which it is most in use that where an individual having received money from or for government has to prove the aptitude of the use made of it case where pursuers side only has place defendants wanting judge occupies it example—court of claims anglicè benefit claimed privilege of acting a part in a state ceremony—the coronation preferable course consigning the defendants function to the government advocate thus anglicè on a claim of peerage so here on claim of a place in the merit register as per constitutional code in both cases a suit has place for so have contestation and judicial decrees thereupon else the decision would be avowedly arbitrary which it is not in either case in both the judge how unaptly soever adds to his own function those of the party or parties on one side thus are both sides occupied difference between number of sides and number of conflicting interests if for every one of a number of antagonizing interests supported in the course of a suit there were a side the number of sides would be indefinite examples are—all cases where a mass of property is to be divided among coclaimants where the subjectmatter is complex example of causes of opposition of interests here are—   question who shall be admitted who not   of those admitted what shall be the respective shares here if the supposition be that there is but one suit if there be as many sides as interests there are as many sides as claimants or the suit may be resolved into as many elementary suits in each of which there may be one pursuer and the rest all defendants illustration on the supposition of four coclaimants suits and claimants suppose four a b c and d— suit   claimant and pursuer a the joint contestants and defendants b c d suit   claimant b joint contestants a c and d suit   claimant c joint contestants a b d suit   claimant d joint contestants a b c cause of the habit of considering a suit as having but two sides whatever be the number of antagonizing interests the design of the suit originating in some one party interested his endeavours have naturally been to engage all those to join with him whose claims he regarded as uncontestable were it only that they might share with him in the expense all who did not join with him were of course made defendants that by the judge they might be compelled to submit to him the making the division or say distribution thus come to view identity and diversity as to suits every separate demand may be considered as constituting a suit this admitted in every course of action ordinarily considered as constituting the suit may be distinguished as many elementary suits as there have been made demands in the course of it examples—   all excretitious suits that have grown out of the original   all counterdemands made on the defendants side   the demand in consequence of which a quasijury inquiry is instituted   the demand in compliance with which appeal is allowed   any demand by which after being instituted in one judicatory a suit is for any purpose brought before another for example for effecting forthcomingness of evidence or execution   each such suit may be considered as resolved into as many suits as there are pursuers in it   so as to defendants   the identity of a suit may be considered as destroyed either by the accession or the secession of a party on either side use of the divisions of suits into plurilateral and unilateral that the apparently unilateral being seen to be suits proper for the eognizance of a judge the judge in these cases may be subjected to the same checks as in other cases use of the exposition in regard to identity and diversity—that upon no assumption in regard to identity or diversity any pretence be built for an arrangement not conducive to the ends of justice in particular for causing operations or instruments to be repeated under the notion of the extinction of the suit—for example by death of a party examples are various    to english procedure occasions and pretences various—ends and motives the same particular use in regard to succeeding stages of inquiry recapitulatory and appellate—   in the recapitulatory inquiry all the excretitious suits that can have influenced the decision in the original suit should be brought to view—none that have not   so on the appellate inquiry but as by the manifoldwriting system the record containing the whole proceedings will be brought to view in both stages without fresh expense the distinction will apply not to exhibition but to observation—to the notice that may come to be taken in the course of argumentation question—inquisitorial procedure why not here admitted answer—reasons—   with a view to appropriate intellectual and active aptitude it is of use that as the undivided attention of one person is employed on the one side so should that of another person on the other side the judges attention being equally applied to each for the purpose of decreeing in favour of that side which has presented the strongest arguments   with a view to appropriate moral aptitude that in these extraordinary cases the judge may be acting under the same checks as in all ordinary ones §   services graduable or nongraduable the service demanded by the demandpaper may be either graduable or ungraduable understand by a graduable service a service which admits of degrees as for instance a service which consists in the demand of a sum of money in compensation for a wrong suffered in a shape other than pecuniary whatsoever be the number of sums of money of the lowest denomination capable of being taken for the subjectmatter of payment on the score of compensation that same is the number of degrees of which the amount of the compensation is susceptible understand by a nongraduable service a service in respect of which no alternative has place but that of complete performance and complete nonperformance as for instance the restitution or transference of a thing not susceptible of division without destruction or deterioration of value as a horse or a house the service consisting in the payment of a sum certain in pursuance of a contract for instance a bill of exchange drawn on the defendant and by him accepted when the service demanded by the demandpapers at the charge of a defendant is graduable the pursuer will individualize the degree which is the subjectmatter of his demand that is to say in case of compensationmoney for a wrong the precise sum which he consents to accept after examining him as to the grounds or reasons on which the fixation thus made of the sum is grounded the judge will either attach his provisional assent to that fixation or make such other fixation as to him shall seem meet which done the sum so provisionally fixed upon will be the sum stated in his compliance or defencerequiring mandate as the sum which will be exacted of the defendant in case of noncompliance coupled with nonresponse generally speaking if the judge sees reason for substituting a fixation of his own to the fixation made by the pursuer the sum fixed upon by the judge will be less than the sum fixed upon by the pursuer and in the ordinary state of things such lesser sum will by reason of the selfpreference inherent in human nature be the sum fixed upon by the judge but what may happen is that in addition to the grounds for increase which have presented themselves to the views of the party others may have presented themselves to the more experienced eye of the judge in so far as this is the case he will present them to the view of the pursuer giving him at the same time the liberty of substituting the increased sum thence resulting to the sum originally fixed upon as the sum demanded §   suits expeditable and continuous continuous essentially continuous and accidentally continuous by expeditable understand capable of being terminated so far as depends upon the issuing of the ultimate decree and consequent imperative executionordering mandate terminated on the day next to that of the admission of an applicant in the character of pursuer or say demandant all factitious delay being injustice while it lasts all suits are under the greatest happinessprinciple presumed to be expeditable in the above sense that is to say that in every instance for the justification of the correspondent delay—of the delay occasioned by their being not expedited some special reason will require to be given by a continuous suit understand every suit which is not as above expeditable and expedited or say nonexpeditable suit a suit to which it happens to have been a nonexpedited suit has been rendered so either by its own nature or by accidental circumstances with which a suit of any sort naturally expeditable is not so liable to be attended    every suit which is complex is according to the degree of its complexity capable of being continuous in its own nature for the modes of complexity see scotch reform delay and complication tables vol v when for the purpose of the suit money or moneys worth requires to be either colected or distributed or both collected and distributed—collected from various persons—distributed among various persons—such suit cannot fail to be in a greater or less degree continuous every such collection and distribution suit supposes a trust created for the purpose a person constituted a trustee for the purpose of transferring the subjectmatter of the suit to an intended benefitee or aggregate of intended benefitees the original trustee will in this as in all cases be the legislature but for the purpose of the fulfilment of the trust giving effect to the benefit intended by the creation of the trust the legislature may either locate or endeavour to locate the trustee by its own immediate and single authority or by the intervention of some person or persons appointed by it for the purpose this person or persons are either a person or persons at large or the judge when it is the judge application must of necessity be made to him for that purpose call it a trustdemanding or trusteeshipdemanding application of trusts created and accordingly trustees located or say constituted examples are the following—   in contemplation of insolvency a person in whose apprehension the amount of his assets including money in hand and credits or any debts due to him fails of being equal to the amount of his debts—that is to say the money due from him—locates the aggregate of his assets in the hands of a trustee or trustees to the intent that after or during the reduction of the whole to the shape of an aggregate sum of money distribution of such aggregate sum of money may be made among his creditors each receiving the same proportion of the debt due to him here may be seen in this case—  trustor the apprehended insolvent   trustee or trustees the person into whose possession the money in hand and the power of collecting the money not in hand is transferred   intended benefitees the creditors use of this disposition putting it out of the power of the apprehended insolvent to transfer to any creditor more or less than that which is regarded as his proportionate and due share as above   of the proprietor of a mixed stock of property the decease takes place to some person or persons one or more the greatest happinessprinciple manifestly requires that transfer shall be made of it if in virtue of an appropriate disposition of the law by the deceased himself appointment of this or these postobituary successor or successors has been made in a will he or they are in that case in the language of english law termed executor or executors in default of such appointment of an executor the law has by enactments of its own appointed the trustee or trustees for this purpose say in that same language an administrator or administrators but should the law be so worded or the parties in question so circumstanced that persons more than one to the exclusion of others demand to be received as administrator or administrators or no person is willing to act in that capacity and for that purpose to take upon himself the burthen of the trust—in that case it will rest with the judge to make the appointment and the question who shall be the trustee or trustees so appointed will be the subjectmatter of the suit note that in case no person should be desirous and thence no person applying the nature of the case requires that on some person or persons the obligation of taking upon himself and giving execution to the power in question must be imposed for what is continually happening is that among the persons by whom the vacant mass of property may come to be shared are those who are neither fit nor able to give execution to such powers of themselves §   distributiveseeking suits suits at large and distributivedemanding or say distributiveseeking suits into these two sections may the aggregate composed of noninculpative suits be divided by a distributiveseeking suit understand a suit in and by which the benefit sought to be obtained is an aliquot part of a mass of property of whatsoever kind that is to say whether it be a portion of the subjectmatter or subjectmatters themselves or say the effects as in common usage or a portion of the value of them as determined by sale in every such case for the giving effect to the suit two decrees will be requisite one by which commencement is given to the aggregate operation of distribution the other by which termination is given to the aggregate operation demanded that is to say the distribution of the effects exceptions excepted of the aggregate which is the subjectmatter of the distribution the composition may be infinitely diversified for the different modifications of which the subjectmatter of property that is to say of proprietary rights and powers is susceptible see nonpenal code proprietary rights their modifications occurrences by which on the part of the    proprietor the need of demand for distribution is or is capable of being produced are the following—   death of the proprietor   insanity—relative insanity—on the part of the proprietor   latentcy of the proprietor   insolvency at large on the part of the proprietor   insolvency on the part of the proprietor in the case in which it is termed bankruptcy in the case of the death of the proprietor the title of the demand for the distribution may have either of two efficient causes—   testamentary disposition made by the deceased with the concurrence of the legislature   disposition made by the legislature in so far as such disposition has failed of having been made by the deceased in each of these several cases two distinguishable services the one succeeding the other are demanded at the hands of the judge the one the initiative the other the consummative of the initiative service performance is made by conferring on some person or persons in so far as is requisite for the purpose right and powers the same as were possessed by the proprietor in question at the moment of the happening of the occurrence the purpose of this transfer being the conferring of the benefit in question on some person or persons other than him or them into whose possession the subjectmatter in question is to be made to pass—the consequence is that such person or persons are in respect of the obligation conferred on him or them a trustee or trustees a trust is created in respect of which the legislature is trustor or trust founder such new possessor or possessors trustee or trustees all persons by whom it is intended that aliquot parts of the aggregate subjectmatter of distribution shall be received are intended benefitees this case is of the number of those in which the interessees other than parties are capable of having place and on either side or on both sides of the suit this species of suit is of the number of those which may be styled complex sources of complexity essential to the case are the following—   the subjectmatter of the property in question and thence of the suit   interessees   parties admitted on the pursuers side   parties admitted on the defendants side §  0 several suits against the same person how combinable whatsoever be the number of demands which a pursuer has against a defendant if there be but one pursuer and one defendant they may be carried on together and so they ought to be if either in respect of the direct or in respect of the collateral ends of justice any preponderate advantage be by such conjunction gained in the hitherto current practice such conjunction has everywhere had place in sundry cases to wit in every instance in which demands in any number are customarily included under one and the same name such complexity may have place on one side only or on both sides on the part of the pursuer only or on the part of the pursuer and that of the defendant likewise advantages from this conjunction when it takes place on the pursuers side alone are as follows i advantage to the pursuer— he may obtain at once the security sufficient for the eventual obtainment of satisfaction in respect of all of them whereas if admitted to adduce them no otherwise than successively the result might be that after obtaining adequate security in respect of the first security in respect of all the rest might vanish and be lost ii advantage to the defendant—   by his learning and viewing at once the whole extent of his responsibility his mind might in so far to wit as against all demands from that individual be comparatively at ease he would see in its whole extent the burthen capable of being imposed on him—the burthen for his exoneration from which he would have to provide   in case of cross demands the defendant would have no more to do than to pay or perform the difference instead of paying or performing the whole in the first instance with respect to which he might perhaps be unable and if able subject to the accident of not being able to obtain the effect of his demand against the pursuer iii advantage mutual to both parties— the same attendance thence the same journey from home to the judicatory might serve and would serve for any number of demands and cross demands iv advantage to third persons— in the same manner as in the attendance of the parties a single attendance on the part of witnesses might serve instead of two or more attendances so in the situation of missionary judicial functionary a single act of accersition or prehension personal or real instead of two or more but be the number of distinguishable demands thus conjoinable with advantage ever so small or ever so great they should not the less be kept distinct and characterized each by its generic and specific name with indication added of the evidences from which they respectively receive their support    advantages from the distinctness of description are as follows—   on the part of all persons concerned—to wit parties assistants judge and registrar—clearness in the conception entertained of the several demands with their grounds in respect of law and fact would thus be maximized   in regard to probation whatsoever order turned out upon inquiry to be best adapted to the ends of justice direct and collateral might and naturally would be given to the several masses of evidence and in case of need to the several masses of argumentation   in divers cases the grounds of demand in point of law capable of applying to the same fact are so nearly contiguous as to be difficulty distinguishable especially by a pursuer antecedently to judical examination for these cases provision has been made in ch xii §   pursuers initiatory application demand how amendable according to the evidence for placing the demand and consequent execution upon a different footing from that originally alleged by the here proposed unlimited conjunction of demands facility may on various occasions be given to such lawallegationamendments §    commonlaw and equity suits—imaginary their distinction to every one who will suffer himself to think and who in thinking will consider the system of procedure as a means to an end and that end the giving execution and effect to the substantive branch of the law to which it is an appendage it will be sufficiently evident that the distinction between common law and equity is purely arbitrary and imaginary commonlaw procedure in so far as it is anything better than a system of depredation and oppression has for its several ends the giving execution and effect to the substantive branch of the law of equity if it be anything better than a system of depredation and oppression the same may be said commonlaw procedure has for its subordinate object the elicitation of the facts which if proved the pursuer relies on as constituting his right or title to the service demanded by him at the hands of the judge as promised to him by the article of law which the demand takes for its ground equally true is this when predicated of equity instead of common law this distinction then has nothing in it that is natural nothing that belongs in common to man at large or so much as to civilized men anywhere what it is the result of is altogether peculiar to british soil and british practice originally it was a conflict latterly a compromise between two contending powers—the one called spiritual in contradistinction to the other called temporal—the former having for its sanction that which bears the name of the religious so much for the origin as to the effect the broad line of distinction is that between what is transient and what is continuous a distinction in the political nosology analogous to that between acute and chronical in the natural nosology in a case of which the commonlaw judicatories take cognizance there is but one demand either altogether simple or in but a comparatively slight degree complex in a case where the judicatories called equity courts take cognizance the subjectmatter of demand is to an indefinite degree complex the commonlaw mode of procedure did not in its origin comprise and does not at this time comprise power adequate to the affording satisfaction to the demand a case of account may serve for example §    account suits by an account suit understand any suit on the occasion and in the course of which cognizance is taken of demands more than one on both sides or on either side originating respectively from efficient causes of right or titles more than one whatever be the cause or causes of it it is desirable that to all suffering on both sides or on either side from whatsoever cause originating a termination should be put as soon as possible interest reipublicæ says the roman maxim ut sit finis litum still more strongly and manifestly is it the interest of the individuals concerned accordingly on what occasion soever a party on each side is come into the presence of the judge before their departure he will take the requisite course for ascertaining whether between them any and if any what causes of disagreement have place any cause or causes of complaint on either side at the charge of the other complaint of any such wrong for which it is in the power of the judicial authority to apply a remedy §    suits summary and chronical by a summary suit understand a suit dispatched at the end of the smallest length of time by a chronical suit a suit dispatched at the end of any greater length of time considered as descriptive of the sort of suit the only difference between a summary and a chronical suit is—that whereas a summary suit may be dispatched at the end of the smallest length a chronical suit cannot be dispatched till at the end of a greater length of time a suit of any sort may last for any the greatest length of time the absence of a necessary witness or piece of real or written evidence suffices to produce this effect    generally speaking a suit will be likely to be the more lengthy the more complex it is but some modes of complexity may be apt to produce greater lengthiness than others the case in which the length of the suit is at its minimum is when on the initiatory application it is dismissed of a suit which is not terminated by dismissal at the end of the initiatory application the least duration is that which commences with the commencement of the initiatory application and terminates with the termination of the first mutual meeting where the pursuer is permitted and the defendant required to attend in person by far the greatest number of suits are actually thus summary such then ought to be considered as the standard duration in such sort that for any greater duration some special cause should be looked for and required to be assigned when the parties are both or either of them in the judges chamber in presence of each other of the judge and of the auditors every such case is provisionally presumed to be a summary case if adjournment be made of it to another ordinary sitting or an appointed sitting it must be because at such first sitting the evidence is not in such a state that upon the ground of it an apt decision can be pronounced §    quasi suits or say incompletely organized suits of the actors capable of being employed with advantage in the judicial drama a list has been given in the constitutional code without the idea of those characters at the least the idea of a judicial drama in any of its ordinary forms cannot be so much as conceived these are—   a person by whom the demand is made call him a pursuer   a person at whose charge the demand is made call him a proposed defendant   the person to whom the demand is addressed and at whose hands the service necessary for the accomplishment of it is demanded call him the judge the idea of a completely composed or constituted suit being thus established a description is now capable of being given of two species of incompletely constituted suits— i incompletely constituted suit the first— parties—judge and proposed defendant wanting or as grammarians say caret a distinct pursuer in the person of the judge the functions of judge and pursuer are united exemplifications of this sort of things are—   in english practice—on the adjustment of accounts in nonpenal cases—an audit court defendant the accountant here no demand is made but the accountant being confessedly a debtor he is called upon to exhibit evidence the effect of which if credited will be in each instance to exonerate him from the obligation of paying the money in question in the character of a debtor   in german practice in a certain class of penal cases there is an entire branch of procedure distinguished by the appellation of inquisitional or inquisitorial defendant or proposed defendant in this case the inquisitor such is the appellation by which he is distinguished in the opposite case accusatorial is the name given to the mode of procedure   in spain this species of judicatory if at all employed has been seldom heard of but as applied to that branch of penal suits which applies to offences affecting religion ii incompletely constituted suit the second parties   a pursuer   the judge caret the defendant by the judge in conjunction with his own this part is also acted exemplification is— in english practice the species of judicature called a court of claims chapter xv suits continuance of the original applicant having been admitted and this same applicant or in the case where he is but an informant another individual or in conjunction with him or in his stead the government advocate being admitted pursuer and the pursuers if more than one and the defendants if more than one ascertained and noted down as such the portion of law of which the legal part of the assumed cause of right is constituted being also ascertained to wit by the demandpaper in which the pursuers if more than one will have joined all the remaining operations the incidental excepted which are capable of having place during the continuance of the suit or say all the operations that are capable of having place between those performed at the commencement as above and the issuing of the decree by which execution or dismissal has place—are composed of probation with or without counterprobation exhibition of appropriate evidence on the pursuers side with or without exhibition of appropriate evidence on the defendants side of the diversification which the matter of which the proof is capable of being composed—or    say of the matter of proof or probative matter—is susceptible exhibition has been made under the head of evidence susceptible of the same diversification is the genus of persons distinguished by the appellation of evidenceholders one sort of evidenceholder being of the sort at whose command is evidence of the sort in question the evidenceholder of another sort he at whose command is evidence of another of those same sorts things being in this state what shall be the order of proceedings answer that which is prescribed by the delayminimizing principle and the corresponding rules elicit every article of evidence as soon as may be exceptions excepted inability within the time in question to obtain one piece of evidence affords no reason for omitting for any length of time to obtain any other piece of evidence much less for omitting the second piece of evidence till the expiration of the whole length of time which must elapse before the first piece of evidence can have been obtained exceptions will be the following on the supposition that the matter of fact has in each case respectively been rendered preponderately probable—   results of the acceleration misdecision   results of the acceleration to a preponderant amount addition to the expense neither of these cases presents itself as of a nature to be frequently if at all exemplified a case in which the production of misdecision might be probabilized is that where if an antecedently exhibited piece of evidence were made known to the person at whose hands a subsequent piece of evidence is required it might have produced the effect of sinister that is to say mendacityassisting information or say instruction but from the observation of this danger the practical conclusion and correspondent rule is—when the evidence in question has been elicited keep it during the requisite length of time undivulged not abstain from eliciting it but for whatever reason in regard to evidence exceptions excepted as above it is right that in no instance of any piece of evidence should the elicitation be purposely delayed so is it and for the same reason that no factitious delay should be interposed between the ascertainment of the person or persons if any who are concerned in point of interest to be admitted as copursuers or the person or persons who on the account of the pursuer or pursuers or on their own account respectively are concerned in point of interest in being constituted codefendants before an applicant whether proposed pursuer or informant is dismissed from the justicechamber—in relation to every person if any of whom by such applicant indication has been given of his being likely to be able to afford evidence likely to be relevant and material to the subjectmatter of the application in such sort as to be fit to enter into the grounds of the judges decrees opinative and imperative in consequence of and correspondent to such application—it will be for the care of the judge by means of an appropriate mandate to elicit from such applicant indication in so far as he is able to afford it respecting the trustworthiness of such evidence as may be obtainable from that source and the means of obtainment in relation to such evidence name of the mandate issued for this purpose a supposed and proposed evidenceholders descriptionrequiring mandate heads under every one of which matter of the indication or say information

able to furnish   condition in respect of sex   condition in respect of age in relation to these several topics by himself or with the assistance of the registrar the judge will elicit the appropriate information by vivâ voce interrogation the registrar making minutation and recordation accordingly until the matter of the mandate has been completed and in relation to such matter the applicant will be required by his signature in relation to such heads separately or in relation to the whole collectively to make known his assent or dissent in case of his dissent to the matter of the entry made in relation to such head the process of elicitation will be continued till some proposition be elicited from him to which his signature in token of assent has been attached in so far as ascertained according to the relation they respectively bear to the suit and their respective local situation issue to them or for them the mandates following— i to an expected pursuer or copursuer— pursuership or copursuership acceptance or refusalrequiring mandate in this case in conjunction with the mandate the registrar will transmit an exemplar of the original pursuers demandpaper with directions or say

suits—termination when the suit is other than a distributiondemanding one the times for the termination of every suit are two—   when all the evidence which on both sides the nature of the individual case in question appears to have furnished has been elicited understand in a form fitted for ultimate use   when of this or that piece of relevant evidence the existence of which is more or less probable the obtainment is in the opinion of the judge physically or prudentially impracticable in the first case the definitive decree will be absolute it will be so in the case of every one of the four species of suits following—   noninculpative   inculpative but not criminative   criminative and purely public   criminative and publicoprivate correspondent to the nature of the remedies to be granted—and thence to the nature of the remedy the application of which is the subjectmatter of the ultimate service demanded by the suit—will be the operations the performance of which will be the subjectmatter of the mandate by which the decree is expressed as to these see penal code part ii remedies collectively in the other case it may as in the opinion of the judge may seem most meet be either absolute or conditional if absolute and in favour of the pursuers side it will by the imperative part of it order execution and effect to be given to the correspondent portion of the substantive law if absolute and in favour of the defendants side it will by the imperative branch of it pronounce dismissal dismissal to wit of the pursuer and his suit inhibiting him from making any ulterior application to that same judicatory in respect of it in this case provision is made for securing judicatories and suitors in the character of proposed defendants from vexation by unduly reiterated pursuit the decree being conditional it may be so in either of two modes—   in favour of the pursuers side but reversible simply or modifiable in the event of the exhibition of this or that piece of evidence by which the pursuers right would be established or the nonexhibition of this or that piece of evidence by which the existence of the alleged right of the pursuer would be disproved   in favour of the defendants side but simply reversible or modifiable in the event of the exhibition of this or that piece of evidence    by which the pursuers title would be established or the nonexhibition of this or that piece of evidence by which the existence of the alleged right of the pursuer would be disproved in both cases it will rest with the judge to determine which of any collateral security shall be afforded by the party in favour of whom the conditional and defeasible decree is pronounced in the event of the condition not being fulfilled or being disfulfilled as the case may be on this occasion he will elicit in the way of evidence and hear in the way of argumentation what the party demanding such collateral security has to allege in support of such his demand and what if anything the party opposing this demand has to allege in opposition to it if the suit be a distributiondemanding one two decrees to wit an initiative and a consummative have place by the initiative decree the cause of inquiry or say of examination preparatory to the distribution is determined to be entered upon by the consummative decree the inquiry is declared to be terminated and by the appropriative mandate the distribution determined upon as the result of the inquiry stands expressed whenever a suit receives its termination it is by a pair of decrees the opinative and the recordative with or without a third the compensative with reference to the two principal decrees it is adjectitious or supplementary the opinative decree is either simple or mixed simple when in favour either solely of the pursuers or solely of the defendants side there being but one party on each side mixed if partly in favour of one side partly in favour of the other so likewise if there be any distinction made as between party and party on either or both sides when either on the ground of law or on the ground of fact the pursuer fails to prove the justice of his demand to the effective service which at the charge of the defendant he demands at the hands of the judge through the means of his judicial service the tenor of the opinative decree is—failure in the question of fact failure in the question of law or failure in the question of fact and failure in the question of law of the correspondent decree—the tenor in this case is pursuer your pursuit is dismissed—let it cease tenor of the compensative decree pay to the defendant compensationmoney so much if there be expense or vexation to any person in the character of defendant for delay of justice by useless occupation of judges time pay to the helpless litigants fund so much although by the present supposition the suit may and does receive and is accordingly supposed to have received its termination in the course of the same hearing as that in which it was commenced—in which case what is done on the defendants side will have to be entered on the record as well as what is done on the pursuers side—yet on this occasion for greater distinctness it may be advisable not to exhibit anything of what will have been required to be done on the defendants side reserving that for the case which will manifestly be by much the more ordinary case namely that in which nothing is done on the defendants side until in consequence of an appropriate mandate issued by the judge he has paid his attendance at the judicatory before the judge the pursuer exceptions excepted being present at the time here then will follow the demandpaper containing the entries that will require to be made on the part of the pursuer he being the person and only person whose discourse it is considered as containing any portion of discourse which in consequence of it may have to be made on the defendants side as and for the discourse of a defendant or a number of codefendants will be exhibited at the same time at which in consequence of an appropriate mandate from the judge the defendant or defendants in the more accustomed manner at a subsequent stage of the suit make their appearance on the scene tenor of the terminative decree in this case— i opinative decree the pursuers demand is well grounded—  on the question of law   so on the question of fact ii mandative decree of this the tenor will vary according to the species of the case and thence of the suit   no wrong or quasiwrong imputed to any defendant suit purely requisitive not inculpative partition requisition appropriate mandate—partition shall be begun and under my direction made pursuers one or more defendants one or more extraneous witnesses none parties

the public at large say a securative service in every one of the four sorts of suit and in every individual of each sort will be the option of employing either a mandate addressed to the individual at whose hands compliance is expected and called for or a prehension mandate addressed to a prehensor and requiring prehension to be performed either on a person or a thing or on both as the case may be whether the need of prehension has place cannot be determined with propriety by the mere consideration of the species of suit that is to say as to whether it belongs to one or another of the abovementioned four species   in the case of an individual suit belonging to the noninculpative species it may happen that the employment of this instrument strong and drastic as it is may be needful   in the case of an individual suit belonging to the criminative species whether it be the purelypublic or the publicoprivate species it may happen that the employment of this instrument of security may be needless indeed to by far the greatest part of the extent it will be so chapter xvii suits their stages stages of inquiry three— i original inquiry ii reiterated recapitulatory or quasijury inquiry iii appellate inquiry these are the same in all cases on each inquiry sittings and hearings in any number i original inquiry its business judge after hearings pronounces his definitive decrees opinative and imperative and gives execution and effect if there be no reiterated inquiry ii reiterated inquiry its efficient causes   judges spontaneous order   on demand by pursuer   on demand by defendant spontaneously he may order it on demand he must iii appellate inquiry its efficient cause demand from either side   ordinary time after definitive judication and before execution   extraordinary time after interlocutory decree and before execution thereof where but for appeal interlocutory might have the effect of definitive examples—  undue delay   precipitation   exclusion of evidence i original inquiry initiatory application if contentious as on the occasion of a suit commences by a public application to the judge by some person as pursuer or pursuers substitute exceptions excepted by pursuer if upon applicants own showing no probable just cause of demand appearing the suit is dismissed vexation thus to none but applicant causes for partys nonattendance—   his attendance is impracticable   preponderantly inconvenient   plainly useless or needless in case of falsehood coupled with insincerity or temerity applicant is responsible as effectually as an extraneous witness so every other actor on the judicial theatre also for purposed insincerity or temerity in respect of vexation to party witness judge or any other actor application if causeless wanton or malicious a fine to helpless litigants or say equaljustice fund applicant may bring all or any witnesses who may all be counterinterrogated applicant if with or without other witnesses he is unable to speak to a certain fact but indicates one who could probably speak to it but whom he could not bring—judge before dismission or retention may convene the alleged probable witness upon like indication of him another and so on till through one or more such indicant witnesses a percipient witness is found whose evidence as such is employable in so far as the procedure takes this course it is investigatorial penal the case in which such investigation is most in demand but it may be in any case in which the importance will outweigh the vexation the first mutual attendance will be the defendants first attendance now may all parties bring all their evidences better so than not for thus may matters be settled in this case will be the vast majority of suits examples—      small debts   trifling assaults   vituperative oral discourses with or without others than the parties for witnesses   small detected thefts be the case ever so complicated here may generally be settled—   the law and facts in issue   in relation to such evidences as have not been adduced the persons and things to be sought and their respective places by consent of all parties on the other side on any attendance after the first the presence of any party or parties may be dispensed with ii inquiry recapitulatory or quasijury inquiry the case in which an apt judge will desire it is where evidences which have been received separately as they could be obtained require to be confronted a case in which a party will desire it is—where to the above use is added that of affording to any error of the judge the corrective applicable by the quasijury with ulterior argumentation on the whole evidence for the check applied by the quasijury see ch xxvi quasijury on this reiterated inquiry it being recapitulatory no evidence will be received that could have been produced during the original inquiry to save time by consent of parties the reexhibition of any lot of evidence may be omitted iii inquiry appellate its efficient cause on either side—dissatisfaction with judges decrees sense of exposure to it will be among his checks evidence received here none but what was received below necessary costs comparatively inconsiderable—   sole constant cost the mere paper of the record   incidental cost fees for argumentation by law practitioners matter of the record—statement of the whole proceedings evidence included of this exemplars from   to    will have been written at the same time by the same hand by an invention in use saved thus will be   time and expense of skilled labour in revising for correction   possibility of variances thence of error record transmitted by post expense imposed afterwards on the party in the wrong if solvent argumentative fees case requiring it and respondent unable—power to judge below to defray the expense to wit   exacting from appellant in addition to fees for his own side the equivalent for those on the other side or   ordering money out of the helplesslitigants fund as above power to judge appellate to fine for undue appeal coupled with insincerity temerity or malice fine for helplesslitigants fund on any inquiry sittings and hearings may be in any number as above sittings refer to time—hearings to suit divers sittings may each be engrossed by one suit divers sults may be dispatched in one sitting each after one hearing under this code in each judicatory in every day of the year are two sittings one a day the other a night sitting justice is as needful one day as another in the dark part as in the light part a judge can as easily officiate at night as does a military officer a watchman or a man in any other night occupation a watchman must keep awake a judge need but be liable to be awakened so outdoor sittings as well as indoor jurymen on view are outdoor more trouble is now produced by the excursion of one judge than by that of twelve jurymen not but that here the judge carries a public with him without a public a judge is a tyrant under the name of a judge always a tyrant naturally a corruptionist a sitting is either of course or appointed or say by appointment—   in course the judge receives initiative application   by appointment in consequence of an order for attendance at a particular day and hour to any person or persons after an initiatory application night sittings are never by appointment outdoorsittings mode of course exceptions excepted under this code in all sittings and all hearings publicity is maximized for exceptions see const code the stages of judicature might be thought here more numerous than expressed an additional one is to wit as often as any part of a suit passes from one judge to another particularly from a depute to the principal judge this however is frequently matter of necessity in all systems place does not change here as there nor thence is the vexation of transition imposed on parties and witnesses in general where change has place the original inquiry will be by a depute—the recapitulatory i e the quasijury do by the principal desirable it is in proportion to complexity intricacy and importance that by the judge who ultimately decides all the evidence should have been heard that the whole may have presented itself to him in the same shape and that the best by the judge who extracted the viva voce evidence should the immediate decree in as far as possible be pronounced under existing system for avoidance of    responsibility judges several on the same bench one of them elicits the evidence whilst the others only pronounce the decree in this arrangement profit the sole object attended to chapter xviii means of execution §   execution what by execution understand that series of operations by which on each individual occasion execution and effect is given or endeavoured to be given to that portion of substantive law on which the demand made by the pursuer grounds itself it is the series of operations by the last of which that judicial service is rendered the performance of which is the object of the demand so made what is done by this same operation is the application of one or more of the remedies which in case of wrong the law has provided and ordained to be applied the portion of law execution and effect to which is the object of the demand is either a portion of law ordaining in what case and manner an impetrable right shall on an application made by the possessor be converted into a consummate right or a portion of law by which one or more of the remedies in consideration of some wrong of the number of those of which its list of remedial wrongs is composed is or are ordained to be administered by respite understand respite of execution in so far as when on a certain day and hour execution ought according to general rules to be performed the performance thereof on account of this or that particular circumstance is deferred unto some other period or length of time §   modes of agency applicable to the purpose of execution dependent of course on the mode of operation employed on the occasion and for the purpose in question will be in every case the execution and effect given or not given to the decree in question this will of course depend partly upon the nature and condition of the agents but in a more particular manner upon the nature and condition of the subjectmatters operated upon as to the agents operating they will in every case be either persons or things or both in so far as they are things of course they will be things in the hands of persons as to the subjectmatters of operation in so far as they come under the denomination of persons the faculties operated upon—the faculties to which the operation applies itself—will require to be considered and distinguished these will be either the physical faculties in which case the mode of operation will not be different from what it is in the case of things or the mental or say the psychological faculties in this latter case they will be either the intellectual or the active faculties and in so far as they are the active faculties no otherwise can they be operated upon but through the medium of the sensitive execution and effect may be given to the decree of a judge either by positive agency or negative agency if by positive agency either on persons or on things if on persons either the person ultimately intended to be operated upon or some intermediate person by agency on the physical faculties or by agency on the sensitive faculties—on the sensitive faculties either for the purpose of inflicting punishment or for the purpose of producing compliance if on things either on things appertaining to the person in question the party in the suit or on things belonging to any other persons taken at large in english practice under the name of outlawry this mode of operation is in ordinary use but in this case it is indiscriminate applying to all judicial service and thereby divesting the delinquent of all rights without exception or at any rate without any purposed and deliberate exception it is moreover conjoined with positive agency—the property of the outlaw being judicially prehensible and judicially vendible moreover the evidence on which it is grounded is that sort of evidence which in its nature cannot but tend to false results and on which if justice were the object no judgment would ever be grounded in this case it takes noncompliance as conclusive evidence of delinquency in the shape of contempt for the authority of the judicatory whereas it may as easily be and perhaps as frequently is the result of inability to exhibit such compliance under the hereproposed code this negative mode of agency might be employed with any degree of discrimination imaginable for by vivâ voce examination of the person in question the whole state of his affairs might for this purpose be brought under view he might be divested of a mass of property in the hands of this or that person or of property in the hands of this or that other he might be divested of an as yet unallowed claim upon property in other hands he might even be divested of his domestic power in relation to this or that child or supposing the occasion to warrant it even of conjugal powers or rights or the faculty of contracting marriage with this or that individual person    of the opposite sex or on part of the female sex with this or that individual male to give effect to any such negative agency it would be necessary that in giving execution and effect to a decree of this sort pronounced by one judicatory all other judicatories should by preestablished law stand engaged to concur and that actual information of it effectual and universal information accordingly be given in the current systems this universality of effect actually has place but as to the receipt of information necessary to prevent injustice in this as in most other cases it is treated by them as a matter of entire indifference to the decrees of a judge in relation to any person execution and effect may be given either with or without the introduction of a person other than the functionaries of justice when without such intervention it will be by mere physical agency in persons or things as in case of prehension when with such intervention it is by compliance on the part of some person or persons that the effect is produced the person in question may in this case be either the defendant or any other person at large on the part of the defendant or any other given person compliance may be produced by operation on his will either immediately or mediately through any number of wills one after another in a chain as in the case of investigatory evidence call the chain of communication in this case a volitional chain in the case of evidence an intellectual chain in the way of hostility or tyrannical oppression or avowed hostility compliance has not unfrequently been known to be produced or understood to be produced by influence exercised in this unimmediate mode in the way of judicature it cannot be exercised on intermediate agents taken at large without operating in the character of mislocated punishment nor therefore without injustice but in the case of delinquents dealt with as such no reason appears why it should not be employed in so far as in the eventual punishment which it involves no excess has place in so far as execution and effect depend upon power exercised by the judge over things inexecution may be produced by delay whether the things in question are or are not in the custody or power of the defendant for in either case deterioration destruction asportation or concealment beyond recovery may have place suppose appropriate and adequate security found provisional prehension and sequestration may on no ground have place in relation to property in the hands of the person intended to be operated upon whether in the character of a defendant a pursuer or an extraneous witness as in the one case the object of the judge will be to exclude irreparable damage so will it equally be so in the other on the occasion of the security exacted as a ground for the employment of the means of eventual execution in question this will accordingly be borne by him in mind in the case of things the mode of operation is mechanical plain and easy so likewise in the case of persons in so far as the faculties necessary to be operated upon are no others than those physical ones in respect of which the case is not distinguishable from the case of things when the nature of the case requires that the faculties operated upon should be the active and to that effect the sensitive then starts up the great mass of difficulty—then it is that on the part of the person in question whatever be the result requisite to be produced compliance appropriate compliance is necessary compliance with regard to mandates and injunctions or to use the word more agreeable to the ear of power obedience though in truth obedience is but one mode of compliance and the case requires that be there ever so many modes they should every one of them be brought to view so far as the active faculty and the compliance which belongs to it are out of the question forthcomingness on the part of the subjectmatter operated upon forthcomingness in the physical sense conjoint presence on the part of some operator and the subjectmatter of the operation are necessary in this case forthcomingness is employed in the literal sense but when in so far as mind is the subjectmatter operated upon forthcomingness is not in the literal corporeal sense necessary by an operator stationed in london operation and that to the purpose of producing compliance effectual may be performed upon a mind stationed in van diemans land in so far as by mind in one place mind in another place though it be ever so widely distant a place is capable of being operated upon especially if with effect—with the effect of producing compliance—forthcomingness in a particular shape may be considered as having place forthcomingness in this shape call virtual forthcomingness in the other and more ordinary shape physical forthcomingness here then and for the several abovementioned purposes of probation communication and ultimate and effective execution come to be considered the several possible modes of effecting it always with the ever concomitant and corresponding view of effecting it    with the greatest certainty and to the purpose of the abovementioned ultimate end with the greatest efficiency and with the least delay vexation and expense to persons associated and interested whether in the character of parties witnesses functionaries or persons taken at large thereupon call for solution various problems having regard to forthcomingness according to both modes in relation to which as above there was occasion to make the distinction in the immediately ensuing section they will find their place §   of forthcomingness—to wit for the purpose of execution by forthcomingness understand throughout appropriate forthcomingness by appropriate forthcomingness forthcomingness for the purpose of execution and effect whether in an immediate way or in either of the preparatory and instrumental ways above mentioned thus have we forthcomingness to any one of the three purposes above mentioned probation communication and immediate and ultimate execution in so far as concurrence on the part of the will of him on whom the operation requires to be performed is not necessary forthcomingness in the physical and literal sense—in so far as such concurrence is necessary forthcomingness in the abovementioned virtual sense—and in this sense in so far as the operation by which the virtual forthcomingness is produced is effective compliance is produced and has place to be appropriate and effective forthcomingness whatsoever be the purpose of it—whatsoever be the subjectmatter of it must be so not only in respect of place but moreover in respect of time hence in the case of forthcomingness for the purpose of eventual execution comes the danger of irreparable damage and with it a great difficulty especially as in this case what is liable to happen is that the damage may have been produced in a case in which it was not needed for that when the time for immediate execution came the necessary and requisite forthcomingness would not have been wanting such is by the supposition the case as often as a solvent man who would all along have continued so is subjected to arrest on the score of debt only in this case where eventual execution comes to be provided for does the danger of irreparable damage present itself under any particularly formidable aspect in the case where actual execution comes to have place no danger need be produced beyond that which was intended on the subject of forthcomingness the following are the topics which present a demand for consideration—   to what particular and specific purposes on the part of what objects or persons in the character of subjectmatters and in what modes may forthcomingness physical and virtual to the general purpose of eventual execution be necessary   in what shapes or modes nonforthcomingness is on those several occasions capable of having place of inquiry under this head the use is that which follows under the next head   in which of those several modes forthcomingness for the general purposes of execution is by provision of law capable of being made to have place and fit to be made to have place   in what manner damage liable to be produced by the operation of the arrangements having for their object the securing of forthcomingness and in certain cases through forthcomingness of compliance may on the several occasions on the part of the several classes of persons concerned be minimized this leads to the consideration of the species of damage which in the nature of the case is liable to be irreparable the shapes in which damage for want of service or by reason of wrong must be irreparable this will depend upon the nature of the subjectmatters as to descriptions of persons—  first come persons at large in the character of eventual victims of bodily injury in its several possible shapes of these shapes a general idea has already been given purpose preserving or rescuing from injury the person in whose instance the provision for forthcomingness is made to have place mode of forthcomingness—locatedness in some situation in which the thus protected person may be in a state of security against the evil apprehended   next come persons appearing in the character of applicants purposes preserving from unjust vexation and expense persons at whose charge in the character of defendants or otherwise the application is made persons at whose charge the service called for by the application will if rendered be granted and performed mode of forthcomingness—of all modes by which sufficient security may be afforded to eventual defendants and witnesses against vexation unnecessary and thence unjust either in toto or in degree—of all those several modes whichsoever shall upon inquiry be regarded as promising to be to the applicant in question least vexatious   next come cointeressees of the applicant who though conjoined with him in respect of interest have not accompanied him in his application to the seat of judicature purposes—  joining with him in affording as above security to defendants and forced witnesses against injustice   affording to him security for their bearing along with him    their parts in the vexation and expense that may eventually attend the operation of claiming those services in the benefit of which in so far as the claim succeeds they will receive a share mode obtaining their personal attendance at the seat of judicature for the purpose of their joint responsibility as above their attendance or if without preponderant evil it cannot have place in some other shape such security as shall be deemed sufficient   next come witnesses—extraneous witnesses purposes as follow—  in the case of such as come voluntarily either in the first instance at the desire of the applicant or afterwards at his desire or that of any of his cointeressees security against those for whom they attend in respect of needless and uncompensated vexation and expense in the exercise of that function of which security they may in case of need be informed or reminded by the judge   against falsehood on their part as well to him at whose request they come as in favour of the party or parties on the other side to whose detriment in the minds of those by whom they are called in they are expected to testify   as to all the several other actors on the judicial theatre after what has been said the purposes and uses of this forthcomingness as well to each as to all will not require separate mention   so as to functionaries at large meaning all such other persons as not being at the time of the application present at the place at which it is made may come to their posts to act in the judicial drama in all ordinary cases for forthcomingness on their part the official situations respectively occupied by them will afford sufficient security in regard to this matter whatsoever requires to be recommended as most apt may be comprised in two rules— rule   of all modes of securing forthcomingness immediate or eventual—of all modes that promise to be alike effectual choose that which with reference to the individual in question at the time in question promises to be the least vexatious rule   in each case where the most efficacious is at the same time the most vexatious weigh against the evil of vexation from execution the evil from the diminished probability of ultimate execution and embrace that mode which promises to be the least vexatious for this purpose the circumstances of the individual will in each case require to be taken into account from the nature of the suit alone no wellgrounded judgment can be formed at the commencement of a suit actual forthcomingness is necessary for one purpose eventual forthcomingness and actual security for it at another time in so far as on the part of the individual in question testification in the presence of the judge is necessary or for any other purpose the forthcomingness necessary is actual forthcomingness in so far as such testification is not necessary actual forthcomingness may not be necessary eventual forthcomingness and thence present security for eventual forthcomingness may be sufficient for thus obtaining and securing compliance respecting forthcomingness the means employable are either such as operate on the body or such as operate only on the mind in the first case they may be styled prehensive in the other case accersitive to employ the prehensive means is to cause the person in question to be secured wherever he is and as a thing moveable might be brought to the place at which the operation whatever it be which it is decreed to perform on him may be performed in the case here in question that of causing him to speak in relation to the subject in question the prehensive is always the most vexatious it ought therefore never to be employed but under the expectation that the accersitive will not suffice to things the prehensive is the only one of the two means which the nature of the case admits of but the prehensive may be performed either by the person in whose custody they are or by the functionary by whom if performed upon him the prehensive would be performed when things alone are the intended object of prehension the appropriate instrument is therefore unless effective reluctance be apprehended an instrument of accersition addressed to the person coupled with an instrument of mandation requiring him to prehend and adduce the thing on what occasions—in what shapes may forthcomingness with most advantage be made to have place to wit to the several purposes of eventual execution probation and communication and in each instance with least damage in so far as the sole purpose in view is the production of forthcomingness the sole purpose in view is the production of compliance on the part of him in relation to whom the desire is that he be forthcoming the question therefore respecting forthcomingness may be changed into a question respecting compliance the individual being supposed to be as to the purpose of compliance forthcoming which is the most efficacious course and at the same time the aptest in other respects that can be taken for the securing of compliance the problem then here is at the commencement of a suit in case of apprehended reluctance and noncompliance at the end of the suit how to obtain adequate probability    and assurance of compliance at the end of the suit compliance in so far as at the time in question may be found necessary to the giving execution and effect to the decrees which the judge may eventually see it right to issue in other words what are the obtainable—and of those obtainable what the most apt and thence desirable pledges for the defendants compliance with such decree as it is in the contemplation of the judge to issue forthcomingness in relation to the fictitious entities termed rights—forthcomingness in the physical and proper sense—actual forthcomingness cannot have place not so in the improper but not the less necessary sense—not so that which may be termed virtual forthcomingness as to the mode in which forthcomingness with relation to these fictitious but not the less valuable objects or subjectmatters is capable of being employed and thence the purposes to which it is capable of being employed to effect in the most beneficial manner these are as follows—   in the case of such as are transferable—eventually employing the right in the character of matter of satisfaction   in the case of those which are untransferable as well as those which are transferable—employing them as instruments of punishment for in so far as abstracted in that character may the matter of good in this as in any other shape be employed   so the employing them in the character of instruments of constraint or restraint the shapes in which nonforthcomingness may have place—the causes by which at the time in question it may be produced are— i nonforthcomingness of persons   take in the first place those which have place on the part of a person and not on the part of a thing of these take the following for example—   incarceration   relative confinement territorial   relative infirmity of body not incurable   relative infirmity of body incurable   relative infirmity of mind not incurable   relative infirmity of mind incurable   relative infancy by relative understand in such sort and degree as to the purpose in question in the individual case in question to operate superably or insuperably as an obstacle to forthcomingness ii nonforthcomingness of persons and things take in the next place those cases in which this obstacle is capable of applying not only to a person but also to a thing at any rate to a thing of the moveable class   expatriation precedential or antecedential to wit to the time of the application made   expatriation consequential or subsequential apprehended   exprovenention precedential as above   exprovenention subsequential or consequential apprehended   latentcy—the place kept purposely unknown with relation to the time of the application this may be antecedential or apprehended consequential or subsequential as above in the case of persons forthcomingness may be necessary and nonforthcomingness a source of irreparable damage in any one of these capacities—   as subjectmatters of wrong or injury   as sources of remedy for injury   as sources of evidence   as instruments of communication to wit with reference to such subjectmatters between which communication is capable of being made to have place in the case where by forthcomingness a person is capable of being a source of redress or remedy the means by which he may be so are as follow—   by being compelled to administer satisfaction   by being compelled to suffer punishment for the general benefit of justice   by being induced by whatever means to afford evidence   in particular situations as to time and place by being employed as an instrument of communication to wit between any of the several subjectmatters above brought to view of the want of forthcomingness on the part of a person in any one of the abovementioned several capacities irreparable damage is capable of being the result of forthcomingness on the part of things the purposes may be—  securing from damage and in particular from irreparable damage the thing in question and all who have an interest in it in the case of a suit of which a thing is the object or subjectmatter these will naturally be the applicant and if he has any his cointeresees   preserving it from being converted into an instrument of mischief regard being had to the proprietor or any other person in whose custody or power it may happen to be lodged   employing it as an instrument of compulsion or restriction for the extraction of forthcomingness or of compliance in any other shape at the hands of any person by whom any interest in it is possessed   employing it as a means of affording satisfaction whether identical or compensational as the case may be or in default of other means even as a means of punishment the eventual forthcomingness produced for the purpose of execution whether it be the forthcomingness of a person or a thing may    be either the ultimate or the instrumental object of what is done thus where it is instrumental the forthcomingness produced on the part of a person may have no other object than the producing eventual forthcomingness on the part of a thing or the forthcomingness produced on the part of a thing may have no other object than the producing eventual forthcomingness on the part of a person the owner of a horse may be taken into custody for the purpose of causing him to give up the horse or the horse may be taken into custody for no other purpose than to cause the owner to pay attendance at the judicatory nonforthcomingness or noncompliance may have been produced by any one of the several causes following—   want of notice i e knowledge of the obligation and demand   want of power   want of will supposing notice given and received either want of power or want of will has been the cause of it supposing power not wanting only can want of will have been the cause of it of want of power the cause may be with relation to the person in question either intrinsic or extrinsic intrinsic as in case of infirmity whether of body or mind permanent or temporary if extrinsic it may be natural or factitious natural—for instance the state of the weather or the road whether in the state of unaptness or distance factitious as in the case of an insuperable impediment imposed by any human hand when will is wanting the deficiency will have its cause in the contemplation either of the immediate or of the ultimate object in the endeavouring to produce the forthcomingness as the case may be in either case in the contemplation of the suffering which may be the result of it when for the purpose of punibility or satisfaction forthcomingness of the person does not exist it may still exist for the purpose of testification letters from europe reach van diemans land and a letter from a judge to an individual there need not find more difficulty in doing so than a letter from a father to a son the answer might come either without the intervention of any functionary there as does in england the answer to a bill in equity or in case of need supposing a judicatory upon the plan of this code established there the ministry of the judge might be employed there in securing correctness completeness and clearness by vivâ voce interrogation in the same manner as in england iii nonforthcomingness of rights in this case no other cause can nonforthcomingness have than the nonpossession of that authority by which rights are maintained or annihilated at pleasure in the case of rights forthcomingness then is a state of things which can never fail to have place—nonforthcomingness a state of things which never can have place §   of procedure inter distantes when parties on both or all sides with sources of personal written and real evidence are all stationary and within the local field of the same immediate judicatory it is well and happily in this case are most suits and most occasions of demand for suits and in this case unavoidable delay vexation and expense are minimized but what is unhappily not impossible is that these several objects individually taken may if fixed be each of them under a different judicatory each of them in a state of migration all of them in the field of one and the same foreign judicatory of one and the same foreign state or each of them in a different judicatory of the same foreign state or each of them in some judicatory of a different foreign state and of each of these objects the number may be indefinitely great thus complex consequently thus embarrassing may be the state of things for which provision may require to be made in so far as the field of operation extends not beyond the local field of dominion of the political state in question distant dependencies at the same time with their necessarily halfindependent official establishments out of the question the difficulty is not insuperable nor yet would it be insuperable if nations so contiguous that of the dominions of each some part were nearer to some part of the other than to some part of its own had each of them to this purpose the same system of procedure but how distant the prospect is of any such extensive good in this or any other shape is but too manifest on this occasion when difficulty is spoken of it is on the supposition that the maximization of the happiness of the greatest number being the allcomprehensive end in view the adjective branch has for its end in view maximization of rectitude of decision and minimization of delay vexation and expense but under the current systems of procedure no such difficulty has place nautically speaking all is plain sailing knots how numerous soever are all dealt with in the same manner all dealt with in the manner of the gordian knot for all of them one sword serves—sinister interest in the hands of the appropriate constituted authorities but more particularly those of the lawyer tribe to maximize the number of suits and defences that will afford lawyers profit maximizing at the same time the quantity of such profit extractible and extracted from each—to minimize  00 at the same time the number of suits that will not afford lawyers profit such are the conjunct ends to which in so far as depends upon that tribe all arrangements and proceedings under them are directed as to the maximization of rectitude of decision taking the law for the standard it is matter of indifference as to the minimization of delay vexation and expense it is matter of abhorrence seeing that minimization of lawyers profit would be among the results of minimization of expense suppose this case—pursuer one defender one condition of both stationary but domicile of pursuer in the field of one immediate judicatory—domicile of the defender in that of another in this case the simplest course and in general perhaps the least inconvenient will be for the plaintiff to repair in person to the defendants judicatory to the plaintiff this arrangement will be the most convenient in respect of the faculty of judicial compensation—a faculty which if the right be on the pursuers side will be in most cases of prime use to him and cannot in any case except in respect of the vexation and expense of migration be in any way disadvantageous to him note—that by the rules of procedure preference in respect of priority in hearings should on this account be given to parties coming from a distance for the like reaon so also to extraneous witnesses but what may also happen is that not without preponderant inconvenience or perhaps not on any terms is it in the power of him who would be pursuer to make this migration in this state of things either examination through the medium of writing must be admitted or execution and effect cannot be given to the portion of law on which the right of the pursuer to the services of the judge for the purpose of his demand is grounded examination of a person party or extraneous witness through the medium of writing is in the nature of the case performable in either of two ways immediately without the intervention of any judge or unimmediately with the intervention of the judge sitting in the justicechamber of the judicatory under which the defendant has his abode—mode in the first case the epistolary mode in the other the distantexamination mode in the case where through the intervention of writing the judge is occupied in the business of examination as above the writing must have been addressed to the judge for suppose no such writing addressed to the judge and yet the judge employed the case must be that though the pursuer is not present some substitute of his is and if so the case is the same as if the pursuer himself were present except that the defendant has not in this case the benefit of extracting information and admissions from him as if he were on the spot it being supposed that it is by the medium of writing addressed and communicated to the judge that the examination is performed what is possible is that the instrument of examination consists of nothing more than a string of interrogatories to which it is the business of the judge to extract answers in this case the examination is performed in the same manner as when in the english equity courts the examination of an extraneous witness or of a party considered in the character of a witness is performed in that case be the importance of the cause ever so great this vital function is abandoned to some obscure underling whose name is never known and who acts in secret no third person being present and who in relation to the matter in dispute has no other information than what the interrogatories give him—a sort of information which in the case of the epistolary examination of a defendant by the initiatory discourse of a pursuer termed the bill is not admitted as sufficient to authorize the exaction of an answer a correspondent assertion on the part of the pursuer is made indispensable though that assertion is without check or pretence of check allowed to be false and is so perhaps as often as not as to these two modes there seems no reason why the option of them should not be given by law to the pursuer in some circumstances the one will be the more advantageous to him supposing him in the right in others the other if performed in the purely epistolary mode without the intervention of the judge the examination of the defendant will in so far be performed in the same manner as under the authority of an english equity court it is performed on a defendant in and by the initiatory instrument called a bill except that in such bill to the string of interrogatories is prefixed a vast mass of irrelevant matter composed of lies and absurdities such as in any system of procedure which had justice for its object never could have had place in this case unless by accident the pursuers judicatory has at command some means of justiciability sufficient in the case in question to ensure compliance property for example susceptible of prehension the pursuer will not have any means of securing ultimate compliance with his demand nor in the meantime responsion to the purpose of giving effect to it without the intervention of the defendants judicatory under these circumstances it seems scarce possible to secure prompt and effectual responsion without full communication on the subject with the judge—a communication not less full than what would require to be  0  made by the pursuer to an agent of his own on the part of the defendant suppose what will always be the most common case complete reluctance the following are the courses which it will take—   in the first place nonresponsion viz down to the last moment and for the procurement of toleration excuse upon excuse if any are admitted true it is that for securing the correctness of such excuses and thence the absence of them where no proper excuses have place punishment for mendacity insincerity or rash assertion will in course be impending but of such restraining powers the efficiency cannot in every case be complete for with a little ingenuity under circumstances tolerably favourable excuses which if they came of themselves would be just andyadequate may be brought into existence   the stores of nonresponsion being exhausted next comes insufficient responsion on the defendants part the insufficient responsion on the pursuers part indications of the sufficiency with directions for the supply to the length of this series—to the number and respective magnitude of the terms of which it may be composed it seems not easy if it even be possible by any general view that can be taken of the subject to set limits for producing the effect that would be aimed at by any such limits a course that presents itself is this—on the pursuers part facts which if true would be sufficient notwithstanding anything that could be said on the other side to substantiate the pursuers claim are hypothetically asserted accompanied with a statement that to that special purpose true or untrue unless sufficiently contradicted they shall be regarded as admitted hence on a general view may be seen the difficulties with which in every case in which there is no judicial confrontation of parties a pursuer may have to contend without his presence an agent however ample his instructions though acting in the presence of the defendant as well as the judge in the distant judicatory may be but an inadequate substitute if an agent chosen by the party as the most likely more so than any other person he has access to to espouse his interest with the greatest warmth and thence to apply his faculties such as they are to the subject with the strongest force of attention is liable to be thus inadequate—still more so generally speaking will be the judge skill derived from appropriate practice and experience say still greater but for the natural deficiency in the article of zeal it were too much to expect that by any extra magnitude of skill compensation will in an adequate degree be made what may be said in general is that the less complicated the case the greater the probability is that without the judicial confrontation examination in the epistolary mode can be made sufficient for a wellentitled pursuers purpose to make his option between the two modes will therefore rest on the pursuer in each individual case a case in which the services of the distant judge might be employed in this good work with particular advantage is this a pursuer by reason of his occupation or state of health is incapacitated from migrating to the distant judicatory and staying there for the requisite time and moreover by the state of his pecuniary circumstances incapacitated from engaging the services of a professional or other apt agent here might be a case of compassion calling for the conjunct operation of the judge of the pursuers judicatory and the judge of the distant judicatory namely the defendants judicatory the pursuergeneral in his quality of advocate of the poor extracts from the mouth of the pursuer in the presence of the judge facts which in his view and in the view of the judge are if true the contrary of which he sees no ground to suspect sufficient to constitute an adequate ground for the pursuers demand at any rate if supported by such evidence as the pursuer subject to punishment as for insincerity has stated as being about to be proved by such persons as he has given indication of the minute in which this evidence is contained being authenticated by the signatures of the pursuergeneral and the judge accompanied with such explanatory observations if any as shall by them have been deemed requisite is transmitted by this same judge to the judge of the defendants distant judicatory with a request to him to convene the defendant and proceed thereupon as the justice of the case may require what has been above observed in relation to the case where at the instance of a pursuer a defendant is at the commencement of a suit to be examined will to an extent more or less considerable be found to be applicable to the case where on that same side or on either side a person is to be examined in the character of an extraneous witness considered merely in the character of a witness one part of that which would commonly compose the subjectmatter of examination in the case of a defendant has no place in the case of an extraneous witness this part is what is composed of the subjectmatter of admissions the facts proposed to be admitted may in any number be facts of which the defendant has no personal cognizance he not having been in relation to them himself a percipient witness but being satisfied of their existence either from report made to him by percipient witnesses or by inference drawn from circumstantial  0  evidence from an extraneous witness nothing in the way of admission as above will be relevant the only facts the statement of which can with propriety be received from him to the purpose of their operating in the character of appropriate evidence will be those in relation to which he has been a percipient witness as to any other facts if his testimony be in any way relevant—if it be capable of throwing light on the matter in dispute in any way it will be in the character of purely indicative evidence giving information of a source from whence appropriate evidence may it is supposed be extracted as to indifference although it may have place and of course not unfrequently will have place it is however no more to be depended upon consistently with common sagacity in the case of an extraneous witness than in the case of a party—on the occasion here supposed a party on the defendants side by interest in every imaginable shape selfregarding sympathetic and antipathetic—by a tie of interest of any degree of strength from that of a cobweb to that of a cable—from the slightest imaginable up to an interest equal in strength to that of the party himself or even greater may the affections and correspondent conduct that is to say on the present occasion the discourse of the extraneous witness be determined by correspondent variations in respect of frame of mind as between a party defendant and an extraneous witness on his side the bias towards that side in the mind of the extraneous witness may be made even stronger than that in the mind of the defendant himself many there can be no doubt have been the occasions on which for the purpose of giving support to the side of a defendant in a suit in which for the advancement of his own interest the defendant would not have transgressed the line of truth an extraneous witness has without solicitation on the defendants part or intercourse held with him immediately or unimmediately transgressed that same line in such sort as to have fallen into the guilt of perjury of these observations what is the practical bearing on the case here in hand it is this viz that as to reluctance in the mind of an extraneous witness a degree of it may not unfrequently have place not inferior but even much superior to any that has place in the mind of the defendant himself in a way perfectly simple and intelligible a difference not greater than that which is continually exemplified between two persons standing in these two relations one to the other will suffice to realize this at first sight apparent paradox without recourse to any such untangible state of things as that of a difference between two minds the supposition is realized as often as an extraneous witness in indigent circumstances has in expectancy a benefit the value of which to him in his circumstances is greater than to the defendant in his affluent circumstances is the value of the whole subjectmatter of the dispute generally speaking in the situation of extraneous witness the quantity of matter required to be extracted from a man will be to an indefinite amount less abundant and more simple than what will require to be extracted from a man in the situation of a party defendant most commonly the fact in relation to which he will be called upon to testify will be some one fact in relation to which he has been a percipient witness while the facts which for the purpose of one and the same suit a pursuer may have need to establish as against a defendant may be indefinitely and highly numerous the practical conclusion is that generally speaking examination in the epistolary mode with or without the intervention of the judge of the distant judicatory will be more frequently found eligible as applied to the situation of an extraneous witness than in its application to the situation of a party defendant as it can seldom fail to happen that in the situation of pursuer a party may have need to extract admissions or testimony or both from the lips or hands of a defendant so what will be continually happening is that on his part the defendant may have like need to extract admissions or testimony or both from the lips or the hands of the pursuer under the authority of the english equity courts where this sort of reaction has place the lawyer tribe have given themselves the benefit of making for themselves an additional suit out of it this suit is called by them a crossed suit or a cross cause and forasmuch as on the part of the plaintiff and his professional advisers and assistants of all classes reluctance in respect of admissions and testimony may be not inferior to what it is on the defendants side hence it is that by a state of things thus frequently occurring the delay vexation and expense with the profit extractible and extracted out of the expense is doubled and this in the perhaps comparatively rare case relation had to the sort of causes carried into those courts of a suit so simple as to have no more than one party on each side so much for testimonial evidence received or extracted for the purpose of the suit remain readywritten and real evidence in this case comparison had with those which precede but little difficulty has place on the part of the written document no reluctance to the being produced as little in the case of real evidence unless a possible exception he considered as having place in the case of an  0  animal to which while perception is ascribed reason is denied but in this case whether it be a canary bird or an ostrich a guinea pig or a royal tiger no obstacle imposed by reluctance is apt to be found insuperable but all readywritten evidence and all sources of real evidence have this in common with one another and with every source of oral evidence viz that they are in the custody of some keeper and on the part of this keeper whether it be in the character of party defendant or extraneous witness reluctance in any degree may have place the case is not much varied where instead of appearing in the character of a source of evidence the written instrument or the other thing in question of whatever sort it be has need to be made forthcoming in the character of a subjectmatter of the dispute of the demand on one side of the suit of the defence on the other the same horse which constitutes the subject of the pursuers demand and which in case of success on his side will be to be delivered into his possession may in the mean time be to be inspected for the purpose of ascertaining the condition the animal is in and thence its value in the cases last mentioned the difficulty of obtaining at the hands of a relatively distant judicatory the assistance requisite to justice may be considered as being at its minimum readywritten evidence affords modifications in relation to which appropriate arrangements will require to be made in detail documents of the contents of which the temporary concealment is necessitated by some exigency of the public interest must not during the time of such concealment be rendered accessible at the command of private exigency or private artifice to maximize for all these several purposes the facility of intercourse between judicatory and judicatory will be among the cares of the system of procedure for this purpose alone were it applicable to no other the sort of establishment so extensively known under the name of the post might be worth instituting and keeping on foot where it is not instituted and kept on foot by the transmission of the record itself from the immediate to the appellate judicatory instead of a transcript—delay vexation and expense may to no small amount be saved a transcript would indeed require no more time than the original for its conveyance but for the transcription time in no small quantity will be requisite this time cannot easily be other than official and of official time thus employed the quantity cannot be otherwise than limited documents liable to be of such importance cannot safely be located though for ever so short a time in any other than well known hands in english procedure the transmission of a record in the original from an immediate to an appellate judicatory is familiar practice it is the result of the sort of imperative decree known to lawyers by the so unexpressive appellation of a writ of certiorari or for shortness a certiorari in this case the document continues at the seat of the judicatory by the authority of which the transmission of it was exacted by retransmission the purposes of justice may be better served but among the purposes of the system here in question the purposes of justice never have had nor ever could have had place §   friendly bondsmanship a friendly or say accommodating auxiliary judicial bondsman is as we have seen a person who on the occasion and in the course of a suit lends his aid to one of the parties by taking upon himself an eventual and future contingent burthen for the sake and purpose of conferring on that same party a present benefit reputed more than equivalent to a party on either side of the suit is this good office capable of being rendered it may be rendered in every part of the course of the suit on any occasion for any purpose of the case in which it may be rendered to a party on the pursuers side an example is as follows— according to the evidence delivered by a pursuer circumstances on the part of the defendant are such that unless for the giving ultimate execution and effect to a decree establishing the pursuers demand arrangements of security are taken onerous to any degree not exceeding the burthen of such ultimate execution—the probability is that the necessary means of giving effect to such ultimate decree would not be obtainable in any number any persons may be coauxiliary bondsmen for any person but it will be for the care of the judge that this accommodation be employed in such sort as not to produce without his intention a commutation of corporal for pecuniary punishment in respect of judgment attentiveness and even probity the reputation of the judge stands pledged for his not suffering this faculty to be employed as an instrument for the evasion of justice as by acceptance given to bondsmen whom the event shall have shown to be insufficient of the demand for security in this or some other shape the urgency will be directly as the magnitude of the evil to which the proposed defendant will by being constituted such be exposed and inversely as the responsibility of the applicant in respect of his condition in life  0  on this occasion the party primarily benefited is the proposed pursuer for but for this benefit the benefit which by the legislator is intended for him might by the judge be denied the security thus afforded to a proposed defendant against vexation at the hands of a proposed pursuer is but one of divers securities of which on every occasion on which by the judge a security is regarded as necessary the least burthensome will be preferred where the cosponsors or say coaccommodationists are more than one the loss will be divided according to pecuniary circumstances as in cases of compensation for wrong on the accommodationengagement instrument the matter of the accommodationists code will have been printed a separate register will in every judicatory be kept under the name of the accommodationregister in the accommodationregister on the occasion of each individualaccommodationengagement from this elementary matter general matter under correspondent heads will be deduced at the end of each year for the whole of the year—   name of the suit and the occasion on which the accommodation bond is entered into   inconvenience saved by the accommodationengagement   party to whom the inconvenience was saved   person on whose application to the judge the engagement was entered into   time during which the engagement is to continue   result of the engagement—the inconvenience incurred or prevented subjectmatters which for the purpose of securing compliance to a judicial mandate are in general capable of being acted upon are property and person by possibility reputation and condition in life but so rare and extraordinary are the cases in which to this purpose they are capable of being acted upon and so precarious is the success of any endeavours for that purpose that they may be put aside as not worth insisting upon in comparison with either of the two others to wit person and property in regard to property a circumstance that presents itself at first view is that in the case of a great part of mankind persons under age included or in the case of a considerable proportion indeed considerably the greater part cosubpossession has place to execution whether provisional or say instrumentary or definitive cooperation on the part of him at whose charge it is to be performed may be necessary or not if and when necessary compliance on his part requires to be produced universal accommodation having been the end in view of this institution in so far as it has any end in view such accordingly is the use and application hereinabove made of it occasions as many without exception as those in which this effect could be given to it sides of the cause both on the one with the same facility as on the other number of persons admitted to the exercise of this beneficent function in whatsoever number disposition is found to have place and the exigency of the case is found to require number no more than one where the means and situation in life of that one are sufficient number to any amount greater than one where for the eventual sum necessary to constitute the security a smaller number will not suffice how in these several respects stands english practice on the plaintiffs side to afford a warrant to the burthen imposed on the defendant this security originally with parade established has little by little as it were by stealth and for the evident predatory purpose above intimated been withdrawn number in every case two however superfluous one of the two might be number never greater than two consequence where two could not be found to make up the quantum of security thought fit to be exacted the security not given and for want of it the inconvenience how great soever imposed no facility is allowed of acting upon property on the other hand—on person such is the facility afforded for operating that within the memory of man any person might on pretence of giving commencement to a suit for a longer or a shorter time as it might happen deprive any man whatsoever of his liberty without having or so much as fancying or pretending to fancy that he had any right to do so against wrong by abuse made of this unbounded power no security afforded beforehand no remedy by compensation afterwards at one time indeed something in the way of security was provided witness the clause si fecerit te securum with which the order of the sheriff authorising and commanding him to exercise this afflictive power at one time commenced by this clause of which originally some sense of shame had produced the insertion a certain limit was applied to abuse but by limit thus applied to abuse limit was applied to profit and no such limit could judicial rapacity endure thus was the liberty of every man sold to every man who would pay the price for it without any other pretence than an intention to pursue a claim of debt for any amount how small soever and without charge of crime in any shape but when crime was imputed and intended to be prosecuted—crime to any amount howsoever  0  large then came tender mercy and caution by which a vast and complicated system of machinery was set to work and proportionable uncertainty and chance of escape for criminality produced now was set to work the grand jury with the number of its members necessary for concurrence from twelve to three and twenty to take cognizance of the sufficiency of the grounds on which this power was applied for and oath of secresy taken by all its members lest by disclosure the person whom on hearing evidence they had pronounced guilty should find means of escape which escape might on every occasion be produced without the smallest difficulty or danger on pretence of tenderheartedness by any one of a set of men by whom in the capacity of petty juryman after difference of opinion no verdict could ever be given without commission of perjury—contrast this tenderness for and security afforded to all criminals with the utter denial of all security to those to whom no criminality in any shape was so much as imputed by an oppressing adversary the first occasion on which the alleviation of this hardship was conceded was that on which it was granted to a suitor who in the character of a defendant had been punished as above without so much as pretence of criminality on his part in any shape if two persons could be found each of whom in case of his escape was content to bind himself to double the amount of the sum claimed on the score of debt he was then in the event of their being approved of and so binding themselves released from imprisonment after having suffered it till they could be found these bondsmen were by a joint appellation termed bail no bail no release chapter xix countersecurity §   countersecurity what countersecurity is security for the defendant against oppression designed or undesigned producible at the instance or on the behalf of the pursuer by the exaction of preliminary security for the reddition of the service demanded by the pursuer it is constituted by and is in proportion to the responsibility satisfactional and punitional eventually imposed on the pursuer to wit in case of oppression as above particularly if falsehood be employed in the production of it considered as to the person on whom imposed it is either direct—directly seated or collateral—collaterally seated directly in so far as imposed on the pursuer alone collaterally in so far as imposed on a pursuers bondsman whose consent to editor illegible word subjected to the burden has been procured by some tie of selfregarding or sympathetic interest considered as to time it is either actual in so far as the burden of it is actually imposed or eventual in so far as the burden is only made eventually imposable of the employable species of countersecurity—of the shapes in which of the judicial operation by which it may be afforded examples are the following—   impignoration pecuniary—exaction of the deposit of a sum of money under the charge of the registrar   impignoration applied to things moveable of condensed value say for instance precious stones or gold bullion or costly paintings   impignoration applied to things moveable of ordinary value for instance household furniture or stock in trade in any shape by consignment to some special trustee located by the judge   impignoration applied to a thing immoveable by consignment as above in these last three cases the impignoration may be termed quasipecuniary   impignoration of miscellaneous and detached rights by suspension and eventual ablation of them   impignoration applied to the person—by incarceration for safe custody   impignoration by quasiincarceration confinement within boundaries not physical but ideal prescribed by mandate in choosing the species of countersecurity the judge will have regard to the following rules— rule   prefer a shape or species by means of which compensation may eventually be afforded to the defendant so far as it goes to any by which no such satisfaction can be made to be afforded hence rule   give to the security the pecuniary or quasipecuniary shape according to the amount of it in preference to every other reasons by the burthen of compensation the effect of punishment according to the amount of it is produced whereas by barren punishment no such effect as that of compensation is produced as to satisfaction in a vindictive shape this would equally be produced by compensation to the same amount rule   in so far as sufficient prefer the least afflictive shape accordingly announcement of eventually imposable to actually imposed rule   in so far as consented to employ countersecurity with less reserve than the preliminary security reason the individual is the most competent judge of the degree of the afflictiveness in his own instance  0  if the burden be too afflictive he will not subject himself to it rule   with a view to degrees of afflictiveness never lose sight of the difference between the situation of the two parties in respect of pecuniary and other circumstances §   countersecurity need of the need of countersecurity is produced by and proportioned to the magnitude and probability of the evils which by prehension and adduction of the individual are liable to be produced for want of it these evils will have their rise partly in the situation of the proposed defendant partly in the disposition and situation of the pursuer of the evils liable to be produced by the situation of the proposed defendant examples are as follows—   the proposed defendant labouring under a disease for which a distant climate is by medical advisers regarded as affording a probable and the only means of escape from impending death effect of the execution of the prehension and adduction mandate—the same as that of a sentence of death pronounced and executed   the proposed defendant is on the point of embarking with a cargo for sale in which the whole of his capital is invested before he could have been set free to embark the vessel has sailed and within the time no person able and willing to undertake charge of the cargo could be found by him the consequence is a part more or less considerable spoilt purloined or sold to a loss to the amount of the loss no assignable limit effect of the mandate fine with execution to that amount   in the vessel went a female to the proposed defendant an object of matrimonial pursuit with prospect of success the female faithless consequence her marriage with another loss indescribable and incalculable   destination as before the female a newmarried wife in the vessel or on arrival she finds a seducer consequence seduction loss again incalculable in each instance—cause of the evil accident—or sinister design if sinister design for proposed defendant say victim or intended victim   in case of the disease victim say a rich proprietor machinator a next of kin or expected legatee   in the case of the emigration with a cargo machinator say a rival trader   victim the disappointed lover machinator the successful rival   victim the newmarried husband machinator the seducer in no one of these cases unless specially provided against as below does the machinator stand necessarily exposed to legal responsibility in any shape to the accomplishment of the design no mendacity punishable or so much as unpunishable is necessary many are the ways in which for any such purpose the machinator may in relation to the intended victim contrive to place himself in the situation of creditor in the shape of a bill of exchange in which the proposed victim stands as drawer or indorser in this shape or no matter in what other he obtains the efficient cause and probative evidence of a debt which without injustice or imprudence the debtor may have left outstanding having before his departure left in proper hands funds adequate to the purpose nor is it necessary that the hand by which the evil is produced should be that of the principal and prime author it may be by that of an instrument of his rendered such by deceit when the maiden has lost her lover or the wife her newmarried husband the seducer full of sympathy and assumed wrath flies to her relief and wins her affections of disposition on the part of the pursuer examples have been seen as above his situation unless appropriately modified by countersecurity—his situation in the case of sinister design whether principal or instrumental and accessary as to effective responsibility in every shape is completely irresponsible happily in the general run of cases there will be little difficulty on the one hand the nature of the service demanded coupled with the situation of the defendant will not require for the securing compliance on his part or at any rate the effect sought for from his compliance the imposition of any such vexation on his part as would present a serious danger of ultimate injustice and the less the danger from the direct security at the charge of the defendant the less would be the evil produced by the vexation of countersecurity at the charge of the pursuer to prevent him from contributing through sinister design or negligence to impose the firstmentioned vexation on the defendant but no evil which it is or may be possible to exclude without preponderant evil should be suffered to pass unheeded or unprovided against by the legislator or that of his servant the judge in their respective accounts with the public every such individual instance of evil that presents itself will be to be set down under the head of loss as the cases of most frequent occurrence will be provided for with most care neither will those of the least frequent occurrence remain neglected especially since in whatever part of the field the provident eye of the legislator may have left a pitfall unclosed evildoers whose eyes will  0  by stronger sinister interest naturally be rendered stronger than his will be at work to widen it on this occasion the antagonizing objects which in the quality of elements belonging to the calculation in the character of elementary quantities present a demand for consideration may be thus stated—   the importance of the service—of the effective service demanded by the pursuer at the charge of the defendant this will vary from that of the smallest sum of money which can be the object of demand to that of the severest suffering to which the law has exposed men in the hope of keeping excluded the severest evil which man is exposed to suffer from human delinquency in this element may accordingly be seen included two others—namely the magnitude of the punishment and the magnitude of the crime   the magnitude of the vexation to which for the purpose of preventing the defendant from withdrawing himself from under the burthen should he be so inclined it may be necessary to subject him to while the proof of his being bound to render the service remains as yet incomplete   the magnitude of the inducement by which a person in the circumstances of the pursuer may be led to bear his part in subjecting the defendant to such precautionary vexation in the case in which it is undue whether it be that the service demanded of him is not due or that for preventing him from eluding it a precaution so burthensome as that which is proposed is needless in the case of countersecurity against judicial oppression in favour of a defendant the following are the circumstances by which the magnitude of the provisional or eventual burthen to be imposed on the pursuer for this purpose will require to be governed—   the magnitude of the burthen imposed on the defendant by the direct security—the security for execution   the effective responsibility satisfactional and punitional of the pursuer as far as can be collected from his or her condition in life and pecuniary circumstances or so far as already notorious or known or by examination or inquiry directed to the purpose or the occasion in question ascertainable and ascertained consequently when on the pursuers side there are parties more than one as many different means of countersecurity if circumstances require may be employed as there are parties on that side in a punishment requiring purely public care the government advocate being sole pursuer no means of countersecurity can be requisite in the case of a punishment requiring publicoprivate care as well as in the case where the service demanded is satisfaction merely without punishment means of countersecurity at the charge of the private pursuer may be requisite this quantity is again a compound one its elements on the one side of the account the profit expectable from the offence on the other side the loss by the suffering to which by the commission of it it will appear to him that he will expose himself here then comes in the consideration of the countersecurity exigible in this countersecurity may again be distinguished two branches one composed of the evil which the law may have attached to the general demand of the ultimate service in question in the event of its proving groundless the other of the evil attached by it to any special demand made of the incidental service consisting in the exaction of the security for the defendants compliance or what is equivalent to it the person to whom the responsibility attached to the general demand on the supposition of its proving ungrounded will apply is of course the pursuer but a person to whom the responsibility attached to the special demand of the extrasecurity applies may either be a pursuer or an extraneous witness for the question as to whether the ultimate service demanded is due and the question whether the precautionary security antecedent to full proof is necessary are two perfectly distinct questions between the sets of facts to which they respectively relate there may be no connexion whatsoever as to the quantity of vexation necessarily attached to the situation in which the defendant must be placed in order to secure on his part the compliance necessary to the adduction of evidence on both sides the maximum will in general be comparatively inconsiderable restraint on his liberty of locomotion during the time necessary for the adduction of the evidence on his side or the time at the end of which the pursuer will have adduced the whole of his evidence or in failure of it suffered the dismissal of his demand of these two periods the longest whichsoever it may be but from this restraint temporary and shortlived as it may be made to be evil consequences serious in duration as well as magnitude to an indefinite degree may in some cases be included of these lest the general conception formed of them should be inadequate it may be necessary to bring to view a few examples in the view of exhibiting in its greatest possible dimensions the evil liable to be produced by a shortlived restraint on the liberty of locomotion as above a course that would be apt to present itself is—the placing at the highest point that could reasonably be assumed the mass of the matter of opulence  0  capable of being thus wasted or injuriously transferred this course would however be a delusive one the greater the quantity thus brought to view as capable of being wasted or ill bestowed the more rare would be the examples of its being in fact thus dealt with on the other hand the magnitude of the evil in its first stage at least—the magnitude of the suffering is not by any means proportioned to the magnitude of the sum which is the instrument of it of the suffering produced by a loss the magnitude is not as the absolute amount of the sum lost but as its relative amount relation being had to the aggregate mass of the property of the loser to a person the value of whose whole property does not exceed eleven pounds the loss of ten pounds may produce at least as severe a suffering as to one who has eleven thousand pounds a loss of ten thousand while the number of those who are susceptible of a loss of ten pounds is perhaps a hundred times as great as the number of those who are susceptible of a loss of ten thousand pounds leaving a remainder of not less than one thousand pounds perhaps by no one of those by whom the functions of legislation have as yet been exercised has this only true measure of good and evil as dependent upon the matter of wealth received due if any attention in his eyes the sum which with relation to his own circumstances is of no importance is absolutely destitute of importance what is trifling to himself is in his view of the matter trifling in itself of this error what is the cause answer want of sympathy but of sympathy in this case there are two modifications—sympathy of affection and sympathy of conception and distinguishable as they are intimately connected with one another are these two modifications each is to the other cause and effect of that for which a man cares little his conception is proportionably faint and concerning that of which his conception is faint his care is proportionably inconsiderable thus much as to security now as to countersecurity proportioned to the danger impending over the condition of the defendant in respect of the loss and vexation he is liable to be subjected to by the security exacted of him at his charge as above is the efficiency requisite to be given to the countersecurity the object of which is to protect him against that danger in this case the eventual suffering if it be adequate that is to say certain of outweighing the profit from the wrong must be indefinite in duration coextensive with the whole of life for supposing it limited though for example to imprisonment for so great a length as twentyone years a person who by rivalry for example in trade or marriage had been rendered an adversary to the defendant—if it were simple imprisonment might render it worth the while of another who had nothing to inflict the calamity on the defendant by a mendacious statement of facts which if true would create an adequate demand for the security and this too even under a full assurance that upon hearing the evidence on both sides the falsity of the statement would be brought to light and infliction of the appropriate punishment on the false witness a certain consequence by incarceration continued down to the time at which the truth of the statement has been either proved or disproved the testifier in question would be eventually subjected to this indispensable punishment thus seen to be indispensable on the other hand suppose the statement true the actual suffering might and naturally would be confined within narrow limits and supposing it voluntarily submitted to as in a state of things frequently exemplified it might be the evil would thus by the very supposition be reduced to nothing of all the several modes of affording the requisite countersecurity this is manifestly the most afflictive and if this be not too afflictive to be employed still less could any others be thus then would stand the case on the hereproposed plan no person for the obtaining of the security when needless and adverse to justice would be able to purchase a false testimony many a person for the obtaining of the security where needful and conducive to justice would be able to purchase true and honest testimony by imprisonment the security may be considered as being in all cases adequate for the person of the applicant being thus completely at the disposal of the law and the judge the punishment is physically speaking capable of being screwed up in magnitude to the utmost capacity of human sufferance and thus the evil to which on the score or eventual punishment the evildoer is subjectible is rendered preponderant over the good of the profit which in any shape it would be possible for him to reap from the evil deed—the sinister design—to whatever degree successful §   possessiongiving security or pledgegiving security placing goods in pawn for the purpose of raising money on them as a security to individuals for the money borrowed on them is a practice universally notorious and as universally unobjectionable in so far as practicable with advantage not more objectionable should it be when applied to the purposes of justice on the one hand to secure defendant against irreparable vexation on the other hand to secure to a pursuer a chance which he could not otherwise have for the obtainment of  0  service due to him in some shape in which it would not otherwise be obtainable to be made capable of answering the purpose the property thus placed at the disposal of the judicatory must be of the moveable sort and actually forthcoming and placed within the physical power of the judge supposing it an unmoveable subject the nature and character of the security would be quite different in the character of a security the only effect it could have would be that of attaching invalidity to all succeeding instruments by which it was endeavoured to be transferred to other owners against the acceptance of security in this shape in case of need no preponderant objection can it should seem be opposed with regard to the sensible evil the great probability is that it will not come into existence for unless on the part of the bondsman certainly and on the part of the securitygiver probably a persuasion to that effect had place the security would not be afforded moreover supposing it to come into existence still it is not so much net suffering produced for that which is taken from the friend of the wrongdoing pursuer being given to the defendant who has been wronged by him the only net loss experienced by the national stock of happiness is the amount of the difference between the pain of loss and the pleasure of gain produced by the transfer of one and the same instrument of enjoyment in the case of bondsmanship it has already been observed no confinement of the person is in an immediate way made to have place but in an unimmediate way if and in so far as imprisonment for debt has place it may have place for in the event of a suit against the bondsman for the obtainment of the matter of compensation if either by inability or unwillingness payment on his part is prevented whatever be the imprisonment which he could suffer for a debt of his own the same may he be made to suffer for the debt of him to whom in this way he proved himself a friend the course of the judge is thus to be steered between two opposite dangers like that of the mariner between two rocks—   danger of leaving in the situation of the applicant an injured man without redress for want of taking the measures necessary to secure forthcomingness in respect of person and property for the purpose of giving execution and effect to the law   danger of oppression to the defendant by vexation in the shape of imprisonment loss of property or evil in any such other shape as by the nature of the case it may happen to him to stand exposed to the first observation that presents itself is—that in the case of the applicants offering himself to be imprisoned the probability of ulterior evil is in case of acceptance extremely small the probable case is that in his opinion the justice of his claim is indubitable and if so the instant that by the examination of the defendant this appears to be the case the imprisonment is at an end true it is that as before observed the claim put in by him may be an unquestionably wellgrounded one yet still if this be the course pursued for the purpose of giving effect to it evil to the defendant evil to an enormous amount and thence undue may be the result here then comes the case where the appropriate warning will be given to him by the judge— speak the truth tell us whether the act of power you call upon us to exercise would not to the defendant be productive of vexation in such or such a shape mentioning it for take notice that if it would your demand will not be granted and moreover you may be made effectually responsible to him to the amount of an equivalent for the vexation thus imposed on him at your instance three rules however may perhaps serve him for his guidance— rule   parties on both sides equally sincere of two evils reparable and irreparable choose the reparable rule   party on side—say the pursuers side—sincere on the defendants insincere throw the evil on the insincere defendant although it should be irreparable rather than upon the pursuer though upon his side as far as appears it may be reparable reason by compliance with the demand of the justice of which the defendant is by the supposition conscious it is in his power to preserve himself from this evil thus in fact it is by himself that the evil is inflicted on himself rule   of the magnitude of the evil either absolute in the case of a party on the one side or comparative in the case of the parties on both sides no true conception can in any case be formed unless the pecuniary circumstances of all parties be taken into the account such as have been seen are the difficulties and embarrassments which encompass the mind of the legislator whose operations are governed by a real regard for the ends of justice english practice knows of no such embarrassment by english judges who in relation to this part of the field as in most others of the field of procedure have saved the superior authority the labour of legislation no such embarrassment has been felt acting with uncontrouled power in the pursuit of its own ends here as elsewhere the fraternity have been sitting upon velvet   0 so long as to those ends no countersecurity seemed necessary no countersecurity would they give till less than a century ago by any person almost any other might on paying of the price fixed to judge and co—the price at which liberty was sold—be cast into prison when at last by the oppression and depredation thus committed an uneasiness was felt to such an amount as to find its way to the ears of a lawyerled selfstyled and selfseated representation of the people a countersecurity such as it was was established and that security consisted in an oath—an oath the sole panacea for so large a portion of the maladies introduced into the body politic by the hands of lawyers—the ceremony called an oath no matter by whom any more than under what circumstances nor to what ends performed of this nostrum the insufficiency to all good purposes in whatever form it has ever been administered is shown elsewhere what belongs to the present occasion is the observation that in this quack medicine consists the whole of the countersecurity afforded on an occasion for which the need of an effectual countersecurity is so urgent as it has been seen to be should a man say should my friend fail to do what is required at his hands take me commit me to prison and keep me there till he does for the acceptance of no such offer would he find a door left open anywhere by judicial practice that is to say in an immediate way for in an unimmediate way it has been left open with but too much effect in this case then the only sort of security that is given is that which is given by selfsubjection to collateral responsibility in a compensational shape this however does not amount to that mode of security which has just been designated by the appellation of the pledgegiving mode of an eventual debt the existence is indeed recognized but of the money due by this debt the eventual obtainment is left to the same decision as it would be in the case of the applicant if no such security as that which is here in question were afforded by him blackstone in hand—by the law of this country exclaims the panegyrist no man can be deprived of his liberty though it be but for a moment without a charge on oath for his security a charge a charge for which he it ever so utterly and knowingly false he by whom it is made has not in one instance out of many a hundred not to say thousand anything to fear—nothing at all if either he be too poor or too loosely connected with the territory to be worth prosecuting or the victim be too poor to prosecute or not vindictive enough and at the same time rich enough to tax himself to an indefinite amount for the chance of sending off his injurer to a settlement which perhaps it is his wish to repair to an oath—a ceremony which all merchants competted to it by all parliaments and which all good men and true instigated by the example of all selfattested receivers of the holy ghost and the frequently repeated instigation or approbation of all judges are in the face of those same judges continually treading under foot with conscience in their mouths—a ceremony which enables every petty tyrant on pretence of preserving the peace with full assurance of impunity to do with the helpless that is to say with ninetenths of the community what he pleases chapter xx remedies—compensation §   degrees in the scale of affluence how measured for the purposes of compensation and punishment of a persons place in the scale of affluence the altitude will be as the amount of his money and his moneys worth directly or the amount of his pecuniary burthen and quasipecuniary burthens inversely accordingly no assessment ought to be grounded on the consideration of his means exclusively none without taking into the account the amount of burthens as above in the account of means or say assets due regard will be paid to the difference between income derived otherwise than from capital and income derived from capital in the account of burthens will be comprised the expense of maintenance afforded by the party to such dependents as belong to him deduction made of such earnings if any as they are in the habit of making of such dependents examples are the following—   in the case of a married man his wife   his children such of them as are under age and unemancipated   any helpless grandparent or other progenitor or progenitors male or female with whose maintenance he is obligatorily or habitually charged in and for the purpose of assessment made of a mulct imposed the judge will proceed on conjecture—or say vexationsaving estimate in so doing after putting such questions as to him shall appear appropriate concerning the station occupied by the party in the scale of affluence stating his means of subsistence as derived from ordinary daylabour handicraftship art profitseeking profession or property—stating it at so much per year or so much per week—he will chereupon     state the amount of the mulct declaring at the same time its ratio to the amount of his annual income tables constructed for this purpose to save time and labour in calculation will be kept hung up in the judicatory and form part and parcel of the furniture thereof the judge will declare that from such data as have come to his observation this is the nearest estimate which he is capable of making antecedently to this declaration he will have elicited from the examination the amount of the pecuniary burthen in the ordinary case of a person unmarried this amount being equal to 0 a word or two will be sufficient for the probation of it in the case of a female small is the number of words which in general will suffice if upon hearing the amount of the mulcts regarding the estimate as excessive the mulctee chooses rather to undergo examination for the proof of the correct amount of his means of payment than pay it or stand bound to pay it he will declare as much and the judge will proceed to take his examination accordingly divers circumstances will be apt to concur in preventing an estimate thus taken from being so correct as could be wished but they are inherent in the nature of the case and the inability to reach the highest point in the scale of exactness is no reason for omitting to make the nearest approach to it which is consistent with the avoidance of preponderant evil from the same cause   in regard to means a person who being attached to this or that profession derives not from it as yet any quantity of emolument which does not to any degree fall short of that which is ascribed to him by the vexationsaving estimate submits to a mulct which is in truth excessive to save that humiliation and prejudice to his professional reputation which would be the natural result of the disclosure   in regard to burthens what may happen is that a burthen bearing any proportion to his means may be produced by the obligation legal or moral of affording maintenance to the offspring of an unlawful intercourse or to a person with whom such intercourse is or has been maintained §   costs the grand instrument of mischief in english practice when through the instrumentality of an english judicatory depredation and oppression are committed costs are in such cases the capital instrument no complaint so frivolous but that with the help of this instrument the ruin of any one of the vast majority of the actual population may to a certainty be accomplished and to every one who will make this use of it a perpetual and that an ample reward is continually held out by some trifling imputation cast on his reputation by nokes a correspondently trifling injury is sustained by stiles under natural procedure at the first and only interview of the parties before the judge the matter would be settled between them nokes receiving under the hand of stiles an acknowledgment of the misrepresentation with expressions of regret for the having given utterance to it and an ample compensation for the two days of nokess time consumed in the application for redress one by the application made to the judicatory for the mandate requiring the attendance of stiles the other by attendance paid by nokes in consequence fees to judge or judges subordinates none fees to advocate or attorney none no such assistance being of the least use so much for natural procedure how stands the matter with technical procedure the suit carried on in the usual manner at the usual expense and the misrepresentation being proved the frivolousness of it at the same time made manifest the judge informs the jury that they are bound to find for the defendant but that the damages are at their option and that the sum appointed to be paid on that score may be as small as they please the damages they accordingly assess at a farthing defendant triumphs but the triumph is a dearbought one behind this farthing lies a sum of from £ 0 to £ 00 in the name of costs sadly contrary to the expectation of the unhappy pyrrhus by whom this triumph has been enjoyed if he has no more than a moderate share of business whatever his employment may be another such triumph is not necessary to the accomplishment of his ruin the single one is sufficient when to his own costs those of his adversarys are also added who set the plaintiff to work the attorney for out of these two or three hundred pounds the attorney pockets no inconsiderable share thereupon comes the usual outcry against attorneys—o what sad wicked men are these attorneys but who set the attorneys to work the judges and the houseofcommons lawyers by whom else was the system of depredation created and preserved by the judges was it not created—by the lawyers in both houses their descendants and others linked together by the ties of the same sinister interest preserved preserved in a negative way by care taken never to introduce any measure that can operate as a remedy completely obvious as is the remedy positively preserved by standing up and being known to be in constant readiness to stand up to oppose with all the zeal that interest and interestbegotten     prejudice can inspire whatsoever proposed remedy shall bear on the face of it any promise of being productive of that effect is not a reward—a real reward thus perpetually held out by them to everybody who will be instrumental in the production of the evil abovementioned where is the villany in the profit of which they do not look to be sharers—where is the villany—so long as instead of punishment it is reward that they reap from it—they are not at all times ready to do their utmost to render triumphant yet while these men reap the greater part of the profit and by their tongues contribute might and main to the success of it the attorneys who are but the machines for conveying the mischievous matter to their lair—the attorneys whose share in the production of the mischief is in comparison as nothing—on the attorneys do the people the silly and unreflecting people cast all the blame thus comes an exchancellor lord redesdale by whose incapacity the unhappy people of ireland were so long afflicted and as if his own practice had not taught him so completely the contrary observes the popular delusion takes advantage of it and by his false certificates assists in casting on that comparatively innocent branch of the profession all the blame by whom was this system of depredation and oppression invented and organized was it by the attorney any part of it no but by the judges—the whole of it—the judges with their partners and accomplices in both houses for their protection and support §   burthen of costs minimized fundamental rule—antecedently to the decision as to the question whether any party is in the wrong and if yes who and in what way and to what extent in the wrong—to the government at the charge of the people for the benefit of the people in their eventual capacity of suitors it belongs to take upon itself the burthen of costs even though from its so doing the aggregate amount should in some degree receive increase but this will not be found to be the case after minimizing the burthen in so far as it cannot but rest on the parties one or more of them the endeavour of the legislator will be to fix it upon each party in amount bearing a proportion to the degree in which he is in the wrong or say to blame or blameworthy regard being had to the distinction between blamelessness rashness and evil consciousness by the burthen is here meant the painful sensation not the pecuniary amount of the loss by which that sensation was produced for in so far as the location of the burthen has for its object effect and tendency the prevention of future similar wrongs it is by this sensation and not by the quantum of the matter of wealth that the effect produced will be proportioned when as between a party on one side and a party on the other side pecuniary circumstances are to a considerable degree unequal it follows that to render the pressure of the burthen equal it is necessary that the pecuniary burthen should be assessed in a larger proportion on the richer than on the less rich that proportion being directly in the ratio of the quantum of the matter of wealth possessed by them respectively here then is a case in which on an account different from that of blame the pecuniary burthen of costs may be and ought to be assessed upon a party namely the magnitude absolute and relative of the net quantity of wealth in his possession or at his command in this mode of assessment there is nothing anomalous with relation to the other part of the system of government the object—the declared object at least of those who have the management of the public expenditure is to maximize the equality to minimize the inequality of the pressure produced by the correspondent taxes no reason can be assigned why the repartition of the sensible burthen should in this case be determined by principles different from those by which it is determined in those other cases efficient and justificative causes of subjection to indemnificational obligation in respect of costs of litigation are the following—   on the part of the obligee criminality by evil consciousness   on the part of the obligee culpability by rashness or heedlessness   on the part of the obligee superiority in the scale of opulence relation had to the position of the adverse party in that same scale parties with relation to one another are—  adversaries   associated allies considered with a view to eventual reimbursement at the charge of an adverse party costs say litigational costs require to be distinguished into—  antecontestational or say procontestational and   contestational by antecontestational understand such as have been incurred by a party whether on the pursuers side or on the defendants side on the pursuers side before he has been constituted such on the defendants side before he has been constituted such exceptions excepted for reimbursement of contestational costs indemnificational obligation will not be imposed in any case without antecedent allowance and authorization of the expenditure by a mandate of the judge to a mandate to this effect give the denomination of a litigationaldisbursementauthorization mandate     as a ground for the issuing of a litigational disbursementauthorization mandate the judge confronts with one another the two quantities to wit—   the quantity of suffering in the shape of pecuniary loss and other shapes likely to cause to the party in question for want of the disbursement on the supposition of its not receiving authorization and thus resting on the shoulders of the disbursing party   the quantity of suffering likely to be produced in the breast of the party on the opposite side in the event of the burthen being removed to his shoulders from those of the party or parties on the other side in respect of contestational costs indemnificational obligation will not be imposed unless preauthorization for the disbursement has been given by the judge for if it were the power of taxation at the charge of one party would thereby be given to the other that to any party whether in the right or not in the right no power should be given exercisable at the charge of a party not in the wrong is manifest nor yet without modification should it be given at the charge of a party who is in the wrong for in this case excess to an unlimited amount might thus be given to the burthen so imposed and beyond what is proper on the joint consideration of satisfaction and subsequent punishment whatsoever quantity of money is thus exacted will be wrongfully exacted the act is an act of oppression in proportion to a mans altitude in the scale of opulence will be the danger of his falling into transgression in this shape for in that same proportion is his ability to make the sacrifice necessary of all these transferences remains the most important which is the transference of so large a portion of the at present customary mass of judicial operations from professional hands paid by the party to the official hands paid by the public all danger of abuse from quantum and increase of private profit being obviated as above immediately or unimmediately—without or with the intervention of other minds one or more—in the judges mind must have been presented all the objects by the contemplation of which his decrees have been determined behold now the effects in so far as an intervention of this sort has place good in no shape evil in a variety of shapes evil even when the assistant employed is of the gratuitous class evil incomparably greater when he is of the mercenary class in the first place take the case where the evidence on which the fate of the suit depends is all of it of the nature of personal and orallydelivered evidence after that the case in which readywritten or real evidence is substituted or added first suppose the substitute a gratuitous assistant note then on this occasion the principal is that one of the two to whom the facts of the case are exclusively or mostly known this being the ordinary case in so far as it is to the substitute that they are best known these evils will have no place— evil   augmentation doubling at least the quantity of time consumed instead of the party stating the case at once to the judge the party has to state it to his substitute and then the substitute to the judge be its amount what it may this evil is a certain one being inseparable from the nature of the case evil   misrepresentation applicable to every part of the whole quantity of matter of fact which the claim on the pursuers side has for its ground misrepresentation by the substitute with correspondent danger of deception and misdecision on the part of the judge how infinite the diversity is which this evil admits of is sufficiently obvious endless would be the task of an endeavour to delineate it evil   on the part of the substitute incapacity of securing attendance and narration of such evidence as the supposed percipient witness has it in his power to afford under no obligation is this witness to afford information to any person other than the judge evil   probable incompleteness and undue partiality of the mass of evidence in this state of things evidence not being obtainable from any witness who is not willing to furnish it—to furnish it in the first place to the applicant and thence eventually and probably in the judicatory to the judge at the price of the vexation inseparable from the operation—an exclusion is thus put upon the evidence of all witnesses who are not more or less partial witnesses true it is that the party himself has no more power than his gratuitous substitute to discover or secure the delivery of reluctant evidence but for the obtaining it from the authority of the judge such evidence as the nature of the case happens to afford he has a much better chance when stating the case to the judge immediately than he can have when the judge receives it no otherwise than at secondhand subject to the danger of omission or misrepresentation however unintentional on the part of the substitute as above now suppose the substitute a mercenary assistant infinite is the augmentation which the evil receives in this case engaged by sympathy the gratuitous substitute has no interest different from that of the principal for whom he is content to subject himself to the mass of vexation inseparable from such business opposite to that of his client for such in     this case is the name given to the principal opposite in every point is the interest of the mercenary assistant opposite in respect of the collateral ends of justice for out of and proportioned to the delay vexation and expense to which the suit gives birth are his profits opposite even in respect of the main end of justice rectitude of decision—avoidance of misdecision with execution and effect accordant for out of misdecision in the suit in question may arise an appeal or a new and independent suit obvious indeed is the check opposed to this sinister interest by regard to reputation upon which another obvious supposition is that quantity of business will depend but the more closely the nature of the case is looked into the more feeble and inadequate will this check be seen to be of this inadequacy the view will be the clearer when the force of the sinister interest is taken into consideration §   parties wronged preserved from ridicule an effectual security for appropriate aptitude on the part of the judge as well as all other public functionaries is the light of publicity kept directed upon all judicial operations in all cases except the comparatively small number in which by reason of this or that special cause an adequate demand for temporary privacy or say secresy has place of this publicity one effectual mean is liberty to all persons without exception to take notes of everything that passes in the justicechamber and to the report founded thereon to give whatsoever mode and degree of publicity the person in question is able and willing to give to it of the instruction thus derived the utility will depend upon and be in proportion to the clearness correctness and comprehensiveness as also the exact relevancy of the matter to which publicity is so given the end and purpose of it will be counteracted by every lot of surplusage that is to say of irrelevant matter however in other respects innoxious but it will be counteracted in a universal degree and evil opposite to the ends of justice produced if in the account so published mention be made of any matter the effect or tendency of which is to bring down ridicule upon an injured individual by whom at the hands of the judge relief from the burthen of the wrong is sought insomuch that the injured suitor obtains in the chamber of justice along with relief from wrong an addition to and aggravation of it for the prevention of evil in this shape every judge will in his judicatory keep an attentive eye on whatever reports happen to be given of the proceedings in his judicatory by the public prints at the instance of the party wronged or even of his own motion he will place to the account of defamation and consider as a species of the offence so designated any published discourse any part of which has for its object the producing mirth at the expense of a person wronged on the occasion of the application made by him for redress at the hands of the judge calling forth mirth at his expense and thereby inflicting on him the species of mental vexation the production of which is among the results of ridicule §   female delicacy how preserved from injury in a certain class of cases by the course of the discussion unless the arrangements necessary for prevention be established the sensibilities peculiar to the female sex will be liable to be wounded and the suffering produced by wrong will thereby instead of remedy be liable to receive aggravation to put exclusion upon evil in this shape will be among the objects of the judges care to give on any occasion in comparison with the great majority of the people any preference to those classes which are nursed in the lap of prosperity would be inconsistent with the greatest happiness principle and thereby with the spirit and endeavour of the present code more congenial to that principle—more conducive to equality—would be the opposite course but by the culture given by superior education to the human mind sensibility is on various occasions increased insomuch that although from exhibitions and discourses by which in the mind of a person in a situation in life occupying a low degree in the scale of education no suffering would be produced yet suffering in a considerable degree acute might be produced in the mind of a person occupying a high elevation in that same scale §   vexation by cheapness of appeal obviated of appeal correspondent delay is an indispensable concomitant delay has the effect of injustice while it lasts to all persons whose condition is in any way deteriorated by delay it has vexation for its concomitant evil in this as in all other shapes it will be the business of the law to minimize to throw needless difficulties in the way of appeal and in particular to load this remedy with factitious expense or to omit any means of disburthening it of this obstacle without preponderant evil would in this stage operate as a denial of justice as in the immediate stage on the other hand as by cheapness in the initiative stage of juridical proceedings evils would be produced if not accompanied with measures of repression for the restriction of groundless or injurious ones so will it of     necessity be in the terminative stage to the prevention of evil in this shape the following arrangements are directed— in a penal suit if in the opinion of the judge appellate the appeal was groundless and to such a degree groundless that in the mind of the appellant it cannot reasonably be supposed to have been otherwise power to the judge appellate to add to any punishment susceptible of gradation which constitutes the whole or a part of the allotted punishment burthen of compensation included any portion not exceeding one tenth or one fifth of the punishment appointed by the judge immediate on the appellant if the original decree be not reversed or modified will fall of course the burthen of compensation as to all costs imposed by the appeal upon the party or parties on the other side as well as those imposed upon such party or parties on the same side if any as did not join in it power to the judge in consideration of the pecuniary circumstances of the parties on both or all sides to reduce this same burthen of compensation in such manner as to him shall seem meet stating at the same time the consideration on which such reduction has been grounded to this head belong the arrangements by which in the sort of case above mentioned the appealwarranting function is given to the quasijury power to the government advocate in case of a groundless demand by either party for a recapitulatory trial before a quasijury to demand the imposition of a mulct on the ground of the damage to the public by the useless consumption of the time of the judicatory chapter xxi judicial transfer §   mode of transfer when for the purpose of causing the defensive statement of a defendant to be received or his testimony to be elicited the judge of the originative judicatory proposes to transfer this operation to the judge of another judicatory the mode of proceeding is as follows—   by the appropriate mode of conveyance the judge of the originative judicatory transmits to the judge of the proposed transferreceiving judicatory a missive having for its principal purpose the causing him to fix a day on which the defendant in question shall by accersition or prehension and adduction as the case may require be called upon or made to attend at such proposed transferreceiving judicatory name of such missive—cooperativehearingproposing missive   for the information of the proposed transferreceiving judge with this missive will be inclosed an exemplar of the record on when has been entered the minutes of the proceedings in the originative

be elicited at the proposed transferreceiving judicatory another exemplar will also be delivered or transmitted or in case of extranumerousness a certain number of exemplars will be sent for the purpose of their serving each of them for the use of a certain number of the parties on that side their names being accordingly mentioned the form of the missive is as follows— to the judge of the immediate judicatory r the judge of the immediate judicatory s with brotherly regard brown against white it being understood that the defendant white has a habitation on your territory this is to

proceedings down to this day when his defensive statement with his examination relative thereto if necessary is made be pleased to remit to me  exemplars of the record of the judicial operations

the suit may be more conveniently continued and terminated or continued until a purpose therein named has been accomplished or found unaccomplishable in this case he will say be pleased to take cognizance of the suit and continue it until c or until by compliance or execution it is concluded §   testifying witness how procurable if for the purpose of examination to be performed on an extraneous witness or on a party on either side the originating judge refers the matter to a cojudicatory he will transmit to the cojudicatory for the information of the judge and all parties interested an exemplar of the record of all proceedings in the suit down to that time so likewise he will at the same time transmit to the judge a letter informing him of the address of all who have appeared in person     or by proxy as parties at his judicatory for the purpose of their being accersed to the cojudicatory as occasion may require at the same time he will give his opinion as to the question at which of the two judicatories the suit may in the manner most conducive to the ends of justice be further proceeded upon and finally determined in case of disagreement the judge of the original judicatory may upon his responsibility persevere in retaining cognizance of the suit until the termination thereof in this case a party whose desire it is that the examination be taken in the postoriginative judicatory may upon his responsibility as to costs appeal as to the point to the appellate judicatory—to wit to that appellate judicatory within the territory of which the territory of the originating judicatory is situated but notwithstanding such appeal the judge of the originating judicatory may persevere in proceeding if on a determinate account mentioned by him such

horse a cart a bed a painting or other product of the fine arts   a stock of things moveable such as the whole or any part of a mans agricultural stock or trading stock in each of these cases it may be to be prehended with or without things which in relation to it are termed appurtenances as being in use with it in each case the prehensionmandate will contain the instruction requisite for distinguishing the prehendendum and prescribe the disposition to be made of it §   purposes it may be that either the existence of the subjectmatter of the proposed prehension or the place in which it is lodged is to the judge a matter of doubt in so far as this is the case search for it is necessary to be made of the purposes for which search may be made examples are the following— i as to persons   a person whose forthcomingness is desired in the character of a defendant   a person whose forthcomingness is desired in the character of a witness   a person in relation to whom a suspicion is entertained that he or she is illegally detained against his or her will or though it be not against his will if within age of lawful consent by reason of infirmity of mind or body unable to give valid consent   a person in relation to whom a suspicion has place that although not illegally detained he or she is kept in a state of undue seclusion ii as to things moveable   a thing in relation to which a suspicion has place that it has been the subjectmatter of delinquency for example in the shape of theft or embezzlement or wrongous deterioration   or that in relation to delinquency in any shape or right in any shape it would serve as a source of written or real evidence   a navigable vessel or vehicle in relation to which a suspicion has place that on search it would be found to be a receptacle containing any such subjectmatter of delinquency or source of evidence as above iii as to things immoveable   a piece of ground or building for example in relation to which a suspicion has place that on search it would in some part of it serve as a source of real evidence   a piece of ground or building for example in relation to which a suspicion has place that on search therein would be found some moveable thing which has been the subjectmatter of delinquency as above or a thing which would as above serve as a source of written or real evidence §   prehension applied to persons antecedently to the definitive decree by necessity alone is arrestation of the person justifiable or permitted the cases in which arrestation is ordained or permitted are those in which but for the security thus afforded a preponderant probability has place that the giving execution and effect to the ordinances of the substantive law which are in question would not be practicable arrestation may have place for any of the purposes following—   punishment in the case in which in virtue of a judicial decree a person having been sentenced to be subjected to corporal punishment in any shape he not being in the     power of the judicatory at the time to subject him to the obligation imposed upon him by his sentence the performance of this operation is necessary   stoppage of mischief or say mischiefstopping   securing forthcomingness for justiciability i e the being in an effectual manner subjected to such obligation as in the case in question the law may require the person of the party to be subjected to   securing forthcomingness on his part for the purpose of evidence or say of testification for the purpose of his being subjected to interrogation in the character of a relating witness   recaption after escape §   conditions necessary to justify the issuing of a warrant of arrestation on the part of him who for the purpose of securing payment for debt or the performance of any other service beneficial to himself at the hands of the individual proposed to be arrested requires arrestation to be made of any person by a warrant from the judge a judicial declaration in writing to the following effect is necessary— i a p do solemnly and judicially declare as follows—   ad in virtue of stands bound to render to me a certain service the value of which over and above that of any service claimed by him at my hands is not less than    it is my sincere apprehension and belief that unless without delay his person be arrested and placed at the disposition of this or some other judicatory he will by withdrawing his person or property or both out of the reach of this or any other judicatory belonging to this state effectually in the whole or in part evade the performance of the aforesaid service   i acknowledge myself informed that in the event of my being convicted of wilful falsehood or culpable rashness in respect of this my declaration i shall by the sentence of the law be compelled to make full compensation to the individual thus injured by me as also to undergo such ulterior punishment under the name of punishment as the law ordains and in the event of my not being able to render such compensation to undergo any such punishment as in lieu thereof the law has provided   moreover that whatever may be the value of any service really due to me at the hands of the aforesaid ad still if for the belief that the arrestation hereby prayed for is necessary to prevent such evasion as above there be not seen sufficient ground i stand exposed to the burthen of compensasation or punishment or both as the case may be in case of mere rashness the burthen will not go beyond the full amount of compensation in case of wilful falsehood punishment added to the above burthen will be severe §   of seizure viz of property moveable or immoveable seizure of things moveable or immoveable may have place for any one of the purposes following viz—   punishment viz of the individual whose property is seized   stoppage of mischief the property in question being either a subjectmatter or an instrument of the mischief   securing forthcomingness for justiciability   securing forthcomingness for testification that is to say for the exhibition of circumstantial evidence chapter xxiii jurytrial §   jury in general english law being the only source from whence in any other country any conception relative to the institution thus denominated is commonly deduced—from this same body of law it is that any explanation given in relation to it must be deduced this then is the standard of reference which whether any express reference be made to it or no must hereinafter be continually borne in mind taken in its most extensive sense a jury     may be defined an occasional body of nonprofessional and nonofficial judges employed to constitute and apply a check to the power of a professional or official judge or body of judges juries may be distinguished in the first place into juries employed for general purposes and juries employed for particular purposes the cases in which juries are employed for particular and comparatively limited purposes are scattered over the field of english procedure in too great variety to admit of enumeration here juries employed for general purposes may be distinguished into petit juries and grand juries petit juries again into common juries and special juries jurymen are the set of men by whom in conjunction with the judge to the end that execution and effect may be given to the laws application is made of those same laws to the several individual cases which come before them by what sort of men ought this application to be made—by what but by those on whose will it depends by what hands those same laws shall be made in any and in what cases ought a jury to be employed of the sort of body thus denominated the main use is to apply a check to the power of the permanent judge or body of judges that power which bating appeal would but for such a check be arbitrary for whatsoever advantages are derived or derivable from this appendage not inconsiderable is the price paid in the shape of disadvantage only therefore in case of necessity—only in proportion to the necessity should employment be given to it   evil effect the first complication   diminution made of responsibility at the bar of public opinion on the part of the judge   at the charge of the individuals employed in this character vexation by reason of attendance or at the charge of the public or individuals benefit in the shape of money or some other shape to compensate for it   at the charge of the suitors increase given to delay vexation and expense of procedure in another work where punishment was the subject the five cases in which the application of it was unapt were brought to view where it is groundless—where it is useless—where it is needless—where it is inefficacious—where it is too expensive where the subject is this appendage to the judgment seat those same cases may help to serve for guidance appeal out of the question by how much soever too expensive scarcely in any case could this appendage be justly said to be useless needless or inefficacious but let the public be a good one—as good as by the help of such arrangements as the above it might be made everywhere and the road to appeal as easy as it might be made appeal will in the great majority of cases suffice to render it needless especially if into the judicatory of appeal this appendage be introduced where neither party sees any such ground of complaint as affords hope of redress appeal will not be made thus for the reasons given elsewhere it will be in the great majority of cases—suppose in nineteen out of twenty place no jurybox in the judicatory below place one in the judicatory above here by one appeal you save nineteen juries thus much as to nonpenal causes with little variation the same observations will be found to apply with equal propriety to such penal causes as receive that shape and denomination for no other reason than the want of an individual party to whom compensation can be made cases where it is needless— in a case between individual and individual if both parties are as well or better satisfied without it as with it it is needless—it is worse than useless the evil effects attached to it stand all uncompensated of the whole amount of the addition made by this appendage to the expense of judicature the effect is that of a tax upon justice of this tax at the charge of those who are unable to pay it the effect is that of a prohibition of this prohibition the effect is in the cases in question a denial of justice in the great majority of nonpenal suits instituted there exists not any dispute the need of judicature is on the part of the plaintiff his demand is well grounded on the part of the defendant inability or backwardness has been the sole cause of noncompliance by the extra expense attached to procedure by the jury inability is not removed or lessened but increased to the surmounting of whatsoever backwardness may have place this instrument of complication affords not assistance but obstruction even where the cause of dispute and dispute accordingly has existence the great majority of the number of individual cases are of the most simple nature if the parties were present from ten to thirty minutes would serve as effectually for discussion as the same number of years would to the greater number of cases individually taken rather than to the lesser should the     system of procedure be in the first instance adapted causes made penal by reason of aggravation stand upon a footing widely different in a nonpenal case between individual and individual generally speaking it is only by accident and that a rare one that the judge will stand exposed to the temptations offered by particular and sinister interest from the magnitude of this danger defalcation may be made by arrangements having for their object the excluding functionaries of this class from serving in districts in which they have connexions not so in criminal causes in the most important portion of these causes viz that in which the alleged crime belongs to the field of constitutional law—where in a word the rulers as such in addition to their share in the universal interest possess a particular interest—the judge who as such would never fail to possess to an amount more or less considerable interest adds to the ostensible situation of a judge the real character of a party viz on the plaintiffs side of the cause in these cases nothing therefore that can contribute to the establishment of a counterforce capable of applying an effectual check to the force of this temptation can be either needless or superfluous the power of a jury presents the only counterforce applicable to this purpose in another class of cases though the demand for a jury is not quite so strong it is too strong to be resisted the offences belonging to it may for this purpose be denominated offences through indigence or the offences of the indigent theft fraudulent obtainment robbery i e forcible depredation may serve for examples in the suppression of offences of this class men of all ranks have it is true one common interest but in proportion as the sympathy a man feels for individuals belonging to the class in which offenders of this description are most apt to be found is faint the check applied by this social to the selfregarding spring of action is weak and the anxiety to reach the guilty predominates over the inclination to avoid striking the innocent the indifference with which a judge habituated to the trial of causes of this description views the conviction and death of a defendant guilty or innocent might be represented by the indifference with which a butcher contemplates the slaughter of a lamb for the earcase of which he is paid—were it not for the delight which the judge hating and hated by the class by which his victims are afforded extracts from the contemplation of their misery a citizen of london will not be at a loss for an example by the same causes by which a judge will be led to regard on this occasion with less than due sympathy the interests of those classes which he sees lying under his feet—by these same causes will he be led to regard with more than due sympathy those interests upon the same level with his own or above it in england seeing a judge guilty as such of a crime of any degree from the lowest to the highest you are determined he shall be punished—you must murder him for there are no other means possible if your wish is to see yourself punished accuse him of it you will not miss your mark of the cases treated on the footing of criminal cases another division which may be mentioned on this occasion is that of the offences against the revenue for an offence of this description neither himself nor any particular connexion of his will the judge be in much danger of becoming the subject of prosecution of the class to which he belongs and by the sympathy with which he is engrossed it is the interest that the mass of wealth extracted from the labour of the labouring classes be as great as possible the greater it is the more there is of it to enrich them and encourage others rather than see one guilty individual escape what number of innocent ones he would see suffer it is not so easy to say a legislator ordaining a judge decreeing that whatsoever a man sells that is fit to eat if the individual be one whom the king delighteth to honour with his punishments he shall be punished and ruined for it would you wish to see such a government go not to rome under tiberius—go not to rome under nero—come to england under george iv—look to the treasury under lord liverpool and mr vansittart for a competent ground of punishment there can be no want coffee is among the subjects of taxation coffee is among the eatables and drinkables taken for breakfast and the thing sold be it what it may is capable of being eaten or drunk instead of it to that division of penal cases which are such for want of an individual specially injured and which from some cause or other have escaped the being raised to the rank of criminal ones the abovementioned observations will be found to apply without any variation that will not readily enough present itself §   use of jurys unamimity causing weakness in government after all the great and principal use of jury trial has been keeping up an allpervading weakness in the whole frame of government   the state of the english people has been in comparison with that of other nations to such a degree felicitous as to have been with   0 justice styled in the language of its rulers the envy and admiration of the world   the prosperity thus possessed has had for its cause the state and condition of the government taken in all its parts   it has had for its cause the state of the governors with reference to their effective power over the governed   but under that head it has had for its cause not the efficiency and plenitude of that same power but its inefficiency not the strength of the governors as towards the governed but their weakness   it has had for its cause not the degree in which the designs of the governors in relation to the governed have taken effect but the degree in which they have failed of taking effect in england government has had for its end in view the greatest happiness not of the greatest number of the community but of the comparatively few by whom have been shared among themselves the powers and thence the sweets of government this state of ends in view is the result of that general habit of selfregard and selfpreference which has place in the whole species and is not merely subservient to its wellbeing but necessary to its very existence to this rule as applied to governors to those by whom the powers of government are exercised not even does the case of the angloamerican united states afford an exception over the few by whom the powers of government in detail are seen to be exercised—over those in whose hands the operative branch of government is lodged stand the many in whom is lodged the constitutive branch with relation to these same possessors of the operative branch of government the possessors of the constitutive power placing either by an immediate or unimmediate exercise of that power the possessors of the operative power and the possessors of the constitutive power either of themselves constitute the greater number or are so linked to them by community of interest as that the interest of the greater number cannot be sacrificed by them without the sacrifice of their own in this state of things whatever in a different state of things would have been their wishes designs and endeavours by the possessors of the supreme operative power never are any endeavours employed to give effect to that universallynatural and universallyprevalent selfpreference for where success is manifestly impracticable neither endeavour nor design is likely to have place of those by whom in this country which is the envy and admiration of surrounding nations the powers of government have been exercised the wishes designs and endeavours never have been nor can have been any other than the wishes designs and endeavours of those by whom the powers of government have been exercised in these same surrounding nations but in england several causes have concurred in preventing these wishes designs and endeavours from having to so large an extent been carried into effect as in these same surrounding nations of these causes the power that has been exercised by juries has been a principal if not the principal one the causes appear to have been as follows   the insular state of the country whereby it has in an almost exclusive degree ever since the norman conquest been preserved from hostile inroads with the waste attending them under which at the hands of one another and the english those other nations have so frequently and extensively been suffering the division into south and north britain while it continued formed to a certain degree an exception say in a word insularity   the other causes may be comprised underone general denomination—general weakness in the frame of government the following are the particular causes of which this general cause may be said to be composed—   jurytrial more particularly in its application to such penal causes in which it has been the interest real or supposed of the monarch and those in authority under him that conviction should ensue   a beneficial effect and that the principal one of the power of juries has been the comparative inexecution and inefficiency of the design and endeavour of the other constituted authorities against the liberty of the press and public discussion   the weakness infused into the general frame of government by the lawyer class by means of the course of practice pursued by them and rules laid down by them in prosecution of their own particular and sinister interest had the measures of government had for their end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number—had the laws and operations of government been in a uniform manner constantly directed to that end—far from operating as a remedy to evil all such weakness would have been itself in the whole extent of it an evil—an evil proportioned in its magnitude to the importance of the parts of the law thus weakened and rendered ineffectual to those ends as it is it has to a great to a vast extent operated as an evil nor in its character of a remedy to the greater evil has its efficacy been more than partial in particular as to the preserving from utter destruction the liberty of the press     but partial as the effects of this remedy have been—partial as the effects of this together with the other causes of debility in the form of government have been in their character of a remedy against misgovernment—to such a degree has the whole form of government taken together been repugnant to the only legitimate end of government the greatest happiness of the greatest number that notwithstanding the partial evils produced by and proportioned to the general weakness in the form of government such is its nature that by every fresh degree of weakness introduced into it the interest of the greatest number is served in a greater degree than it is disserved and supposing the weakness to end in utter dissolution the utmost quantity of evil attendant on such dissolution would not be nearly equivalent to the quantity of good which its certain consequence a real constitution having for its end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number would produce among the laws by which the greatest happiness of the greatest number has been sacrificed to the happiness real or supposed of the ruling one and the subruling few are the following—   all the laws which give to the persons property and other rights of the monarch and his subordinate rulers as such any greater security than is afforded to individuals at large as individuals they ought to have whatever protection is necessary as rulers they ought not to have any more in the angloamerican united states no such extra protection is afforded them and in the angloamerican united states instead of being the less secure they are the more perfectly secure no king of england—no other man whose seat is called a throne is so secure against hostile attacks by individuals as the president of the angloamerican united states is   all laws having for their object any obstruction either direct or indirect to the free communication of opinion in relation to matters of government on the part of individuals whether in writing or by word of mouth in the condition of that people may be seen and is seen by all that can endure to see it the fullest proof that no restraints upon any such freedom are necessary to the maintenance of the most profound tranquillity under a government in which the greatest happiness of the greatest number is the object really pursued in that same example may also be seen another proof that of all such restraints the effect is not to cause tranquillity union goodwill or any other such moral instrument of felicity but to disturb it under this description come all laws against treason and sedition—all laws against the application of the press to the purpose of indicating grievances in the government and proposing remedies to those grievnaces or to the purpose of holding up to view misconduct in any shape on the part of any persons concerned in the exercise of the powers of government—any public functionaries considered as such and under the name of laws must be included all sham or spurious laws as well as genuine ones meaning by sham or spurious laws the laws as they are called made under the name of rules of law by judges on pretence of declaring what is law for the genuine and the spurious are so mutually interwoven that to separate them is impossible of the laws and rules of law made against the liberty of the press the object and endeavour has been to secure not only impunity but nondivulgation to all misdeeds committed on the part of any of the persons concerned in the exercise of the powers of government—of the public trustees of every class—to the prejudice of those for whom for forms sake they every now and then acknowledge themselves to be in trust laying down such a rule was doing much farther towards the establishment of a complete despotism than was done by those who in hampdens case sought to invest the king alone with the unlimited power of taxation and had much less excuse for it in precedent it was in effect an open avowal of misrule in all its branches—a declaration of war on the part of all those who bear a part in the exercise of the powers of government against all those on whom and at whose expense those powers are exercised—a declaration of war by all rulers against all subjects had it been carried into effect by no imaginable particular act of oppression or depredation on the part of rulers could resistance rebellion deposition on the part of subjects have been more completely justified for by it the design and determination to persevere and for ever in every such tyrannical course was openly professed had it been with any consistency carried into effect such would have been the result and it would or course have been carried into effect had it not been for the power still remaining in the hands of juries in england any such notion as that of suffering a judge to treat as guilty an individual who in the opinion of a jury had been declared not guilty would be intolerable—scarcely would the highest paid and most determined confederate or instrument of despotism venture to accede to it indeed supposing it to apply to libel law or in a word to any offences in regard to which the influential members of the government took any interest juries might as well be discarded altogether but countries are not wanting in which an arrangement of this sort might be attended with preponderant advantage for     countries are not wanting in which the admission of juries with powers equal to those possessed howsoever exercised or left unexercised by english juries would be incompatible with the existence to any good effect of penal not to say of nonpenal laws suppose the exercise of this power on the part of the judge limited to the cases in which in the event of ungrounded punishment the injury done by it will not be irreparable the injury done by it would be as nothing in comparison of the mischief that would be done either by an unchecked jury or an unchecked judge to any misuse of this power on the part of the judge checks of no inefficient nature would be applied by an adequate recordation of the evidence and regular reports of all such cases made to the central authority in the seat of supreme judicature still more if the importance of the case warranted any such expense as that of printing and publishing the evidence in the district in which the cause has been thus decided §   in what causes shall a jury be employed in no civil cause in the first instance in every civil cause in the way of appeal in all penal causes in which reputation is affected viz that class which in french law used to go by the name of grand penal in general not in the first instance in penal causes by which reputation is not affected viz in that class which used to go by the name of petit pénal but in all these in the way of appeal in english law with the exception of those causes of which the sort of judicatory styled a court of equity takes cognizance and those of which by local statutes cognizance is given to the smalldebt courts and a few of a miscellaneous nature of which cognizance is given to justices of the peace acting singly or in petit sessions or in general sessions every cause goes in the first instance to a judicatory with a jury in it also in the second instance if the great fourseated judicatory out of which the cause was sent to the compound judicatory composed of one of the twelve judges with a jury have thought fit to give leave of the causes which are thus brought before a jury in the first instance—in the far greater number justice is outrageously violated by the course thus taken—outrageously violated and of course for the benefit of the class by which the violation has been established in by far the greater number of causes there is nothing for the jury to do in fact there is no dispute the litigation has for its cause no other than on the part of the defendant either inability or unwillingness to do what he is by law bound to do and thus required to do viz in most cases pay a sum of money wherever inability is the cause whatever is the degree of insufficiency antecedently to the commencement of the cause that degree is deplorably heightened by the progress of it by the defendant delay is purchased—purchased at a usurious interest and the hands by which the interestmoney is received and pocketed are—instead of those of the injured plaintiff those of the lawyer and those of the man of finance enormous taxes having been imposed on such chance as an injured man was obliged to purchase in the lottery of what is called justice if the price so paid for delay were paid in the shape of interest on the money due the quantum of it would run in proportion to the amount of the money due it would be proportioned to the advantage gained to the defendant by the nonpayment and to the disadvantage suffered by the plaintiff from that same cause as it is it bears no proportion to either standard it is the same whether the principal money due be  0s or £ 0000 of another class of cases that are brought before a jury cognizance by a jury is not possible the impossibility has for its cause the time necessary for the statement and discussion of the case in the most ordinary species of cause the statement and discussion by advocates on both sides the charge given by the judge and the consideration bestowed by the jury occupy a considerably less quantity of time than that during which twelve men can continue sitting together without inconvenience but there are some causes the hearing of which in this mode could not be completed in many times that portion of time various are the sorts of causes thus circumstanced the most commonly occurring sort and those which are most readily conceived to be in this predicament are causes of account the attorney and the advocate or counsel as he is called by whose advice a case of this sort is brought before a jury knows full well that by the jury when it comes before them nothing will or can be done in it when the jury is sitting with the judge on the bench above them for their direction a discovery is pretended to be made that in that way it cannot receive a decision the advocates on both sides having laid their heads together the discovery is announced to the judge—to the judge whom long experience has prepared for the receipt of such discoveries then comes the necessary resource—sending the cause off to arbitration arbitrators are then appointed who are almost always some of the advocates themselves or their connexions an advocate on each side or one chosen on both sides now takes cognizance of the cause the payment he receives being proportioned to the number of his sittings he takes care that the time of each sitting     shall not be too great nor the number of the sittings too small the cause may be simple—at the utmost point of simplicity and in this case happily are by far the greatest number of causes it may be complex to the utmost pitch of complexity and in this case are unhappily not a few in the former case the delay created and expense bestowed on jurytrial is the whole of it a waste simple or complex under the english system one jury is allotted to every cause and to no cause more than one were the parties heard in presence of each other at the outset ninetenths would be disposed of in as many halfhours and of the remainder there would be some in which would appear at the first hearing from one to halfadozen or more points capable of constituting each of them matter for a separate jurytrial and capable upon occasion of being distributed for dispatch sake amongst as many juries §   effects advantageous and disadvantageous direct and indirect—of the effects of jurytrial this may serve for the first division by the direct effects i mean those which flow in an immediate way from the causing the decision to be given by a jury—instead of its being pronounced by a judge or set of judges—and that are produced independently of any influence exercised by this circumstance on the conduct and character of the judge consider in the first place the effects of the first order viz the influence exercised by this circumstance on the rectitude of the decision pronounced in each individual cause considered without reference to other causes and without reference to the feelings of any persons other than those of the parties to the cause and their particular connexions supposing that on the part of the judge adequate moral aptitude be to be depended upon no advantage—no superior probability of rectitude of decision could reasonably be expected from the substitution of this everchanging judicatory to a permanent one neither in respect of intellectual appropriate aptitude and more particularly appropriate information nor in respect of appropriate active talent could a company of men taken promiscuously from the body of the people and charged perhaps for the first time with the function for the apt discharge of which such close attention coupled with so much discernment is incidentally necessary—be reasonably regarded as equal much less as superior to a man in whose instance the business of judicature has been the subject of the study and for a time more or less considerable of the practice of his life but in every as yet known system of judicature into which jurytrial has not been admitted appropriate moral aptitude has been upon sa bad a footing that the comparatively greater moral aptitude which has in practice been given to juries has more than compensated for whatever deficiency has had place in their instance in the article of intellectual aptitude and that of active talent as no cause is ever submitted to a jury but in connexion with a judge to whose instruction they are by the force of known usage and public opinion predisposed to have regard the appropriate information of the judge whatever it be is customarily at their command and it is only by some particular and not customary direction given by them with or without reason to their will that this supplement to their own inbred intellectual aptitude can fail to be turned to use and where moral aptitude fails insomuch as the judge is disposed by any cause to decide in a manner contrary to that which in his eyes is justice the probability of rectitude of decision is instead of being increased by superiority in appropriate intellectual aptitude or active talent proportionably decreased note at the same time that means exist whereby moral aptitude on the part of the judge may be placed on a much firmer footing than it has ever been as yet and at the same time be made to receive increase one point there is in respect of which on the part of the judge if jurytrial be not employed appropriate moral aptitude never can with any sufficient ground of assurance be depended upon this is freedom of bias whether on the score of pecuniary or other interest or on that of sympathy or antipathy produced by party affections or propinquity or remoteness in respect of rank now as to the effects of the second order by these i understand the effects produced by the decision in the cause in question on the minds of the several persons within whose cognizance the case in question in the state in which it presented itself to the judicatory may happen to come in this class of effects will be seen to lie the chief and most incontestable of the advantages attendant on the compound judicatory thus constituted in the case of misdecision this class of bad effects consists of danger and alarm—danger of misdecision in future suits from the influence of the same cause whatever it be by which misdecision in the past cause was produced—alarm produced by the contemplation of this danger in the whole of the judicial establishment suppose but a single judicatory for simplicity of conception call it that of a single judge habitually exposed to misdecision—for example by the most natural and common of the causes by which such disposition is liable     to be produced viz by love of money in such case the place of general security is occupied by general alarm no man who either by poverty or probity or consciousness of want of skill to perform with success the process of corruption regards himself as able to defend himself against a competitor who to the disposition adds the ability to practise corruption nor can he avoid regarding his property as being in a state of perpetual insecurity even he who to the ability adds the disposition to give a bribe cannot but regard himself as placed in a correspondent state of insecurity with respect to such part of his property as would be eventually necessary to compose the bribe even suppose corruption in a pecuniary state effectually guarded against still there remain favourable partiality on the score of sympathy unfavourable partiality on the score of antipathy as towards individuals individually taken or as towards all the individuals in general of whom is composed a party in the state see now how the matter stands in regard to the effects of the second order in the cause in question misdecision suppose has had place a wrong verdict a verdict generally regarded as wrong has been pronounced on the feelings of the public at large—of that part of it by whom cognizance has been taken of the cause—what are the evil consequences answer none danger none alarm none that jury has judged wrong but that jury is no more true it is that by the same causes by which misdecision has been produced in the instance of that jury the like effect may for aught anybody can say be produced in the instance of any other juries true this and what nobody can deny still however neither the alarm nor even the danger is in this case anything considerable in comparison of misdecision on the part of a judge when produced by any permanent extensively operating and wellknown mental cause in nine cases out of ten perhaps nineteen cases out of twenty on the part of the jury misdecision will not have place for in some such proportion are the causes which being defended through inability to do what should be done or through perverseness do not admit of doubt and in causes in any proportion evil disposition as above might produce misdecision in the case of an unchecked judge but be the danger ever so small the alarm will be still smaller to this difference contribute several causes—  the general prepossession in favour of this mode of trial and   the confidence which setting aside the causes of mistrust men naturally have in their own good fortune english law may furnish a familiar example prosecutions for alleged libels and other offences against government frequent verdicts some for the prosecutor the government some against it for the defendant now suppose these causes all of them tried by any judicatory of four of the twelve judges or by any one judge of any such judicatory and in both cases without a jury—who is there of any party by whom antecedently to trial any the least doubt could be entertained but that a decision affirmative of the guilt of the defendant would be the result another division in which the effects of this institution may be considered is the following— i applying itself to the situation of the judge it has a strong and incontestable tendency to give increase to his appropriate official aptitude considered in all its branches   to his moral aptitude it gives increase by the obligation it imposes upon him of giving with reference to justice the best appearance possible to everything which on the occasion in question he does or says in so far as upon the effect of what he does or says depends the decision given by the jury—only in so far as what he does and says has in their eyes the appearance of justice can he hope to exercise any influence upon the decision they are about to pronounce take away the jury the judge does exactly what he pleases if he pleases he says whatever he pleases and as little of it as he pleases if so be that in the individual cause in question he is bent upon injustice—if in support of the decision which he is determined to pronounce he can find anything to say which in his eyes is plausible he will if he thinks it worth while say as much accordingly if he be unable to find anything that is thus plausible or the trouble of doing so is in his eyes too great he will say nothing at all and his will will not the less be done   appropriate intellectual aptitude including appropriate professional information in this particular the salutary influence of the necessary presence of the jury and the demand it may be continually creating for appropriate discourse delivered by him to them in the presence of a company of spectators contributes in a powerful and incontestable manner to secure the interests of justice—at any rate against inaptitude in any manifest or flagrant degree in respect of this branch of appropriate aptitude   appropriate active talent without any considerable difference the above observations apply to this branch likewise of appropriate aptitude set aside the institution of a jury the most complete corruption may be united with more than ordinary intellectual weakness and ignorance and more than ordinary deficiency in respect of faculty of expression and still the man be not incapable of giving effect to his will in the situation of a judge for his decision be it what it may expression must     be found but when that is done all is done that is necessary for him to do the least said says the proverb is soonest mended ii general effect on the minds of men in the character of jurymen the effects of the institution on the minds of the men to whom it happens to find themselves in a state of exercise in the situation in question are not less salutary nor less incontestable every judicatory of which a jury forms a part is a school of justice without the name it is so in effect in it the part of master is performed by the judge the part of the scholars by the jurymen and what takes place takes place in a company more or less numerous of spectators the representation there given is given by a variety of actors appearing in so many different parts there are at any rate or at least there ought to be where no bar is set by special and preponderate inconvenience the parties on both sides on one or both sides there are commonly witnesses there are but too commonly professional lawyers in the character of advocates and there are still more too commonly others in the character of attorneys by the various parts in which these actors in the judicial drama appear and by the various casts of character exhibited by different individuals in each part affections of all sorts in the breasts of jurymen are excited and the attention fixed and the reasoning faculty with matter infinite in variety for it to operate upon is continually called forth into exercise the inconvenience which in the shape of labour and corresponding expense to the individual jurymen if uncompensated or to the public purse if they are compensated constistutes a drawback which there will be occasion to speak of in another place against that loss on this score will be to be set the profit on the above score—and that it may be seen is no inconsiderable one these benefits it may be seen may be attained if not in a perfectly equal degree not very sensibly less than equal so as a verdict be but given by the jury whether that verdict be or be not binding upon the judge of the good effects actually produced by jurytrial in particular causes over and above its general and more extensive influences as above explained much will depend upon the state of the law in proportion as the law is clear the power given to the jury in form will be exercised by it with effect the verdict given by the jury will be the expression of their will acting under the guidance of their understanding in proportion as the law is otherwise than clear the verdict given in form by the jury will in effect be the decision of the judge it will be the expression of his will in the giving effect to which his understanding such as it is and his active talent such as it is assisted by such appropriate professional information as it has happened to him to lay in a stock of will have been employed thus it is that under an allcomprehensive code especially if accompanied with an apt rationale a jury will be quite a different sort of instrument from what it is under the generally prevalent mixture composed in indeterminate and evervarying proportions of statutelaw and commonlaw—that is of really existing law and that counterfeit species of law which has been imagined and framed on each individual occasion by the judge in question and his predecessors the branch of law with relation to which the usefulness of jurytrial to the greatest happiness of the greatest number is most conspicuous and most unquestionable is the penal branch the feature by means of which it is productive of this beneficial effect is the universal concurrence so erroneously termed unanimity the effect by means of which it is productive of this benefit is by infusing a general weakness into the powers of government into the powers of government taken in the aggregate but more especially when considered in relation to the people in england the sacrifice made of the greatest happiness of the greatest number to the happiness real or supposed of the monarch has been less in proportion than in any of the monarchies of the continent of europe of this difference whatever it may be the cause will upon examination be found to be in the weakness of the government as towards the people in england several causes have concurred in the keeping up of this weakness as to those other causes they are beside the present purpose the only one that belongs to it is the weakness in so far as produced by jurytrial with its unanimity in penal causes had it not been for this weakness the condition of austria would at this moment have been the condition of england george the fourth would have been in england what he is in hanover in the one country as in the other the people equally poor and equally miserable from what he is in one country may be seen what he would be in the other the benefit produced by jurytrial with its unanimity is produced by striking the laws every now and then with impotence the law is the work of the king and in the production of the work he has two instruments—the houses of parliament taken together and the supreme judges the houses of parliament make law in one way the judges make what they call law and what has the effect of law in another way the law by whomsoever made—being made not for the benefit of the greatest happiness of the greatest number but for the     benefit of those by whom it is so made—is made of course principally for the benefit of the king in which way soever made by whatsoever laws by the good or supposed good done to the king evil to a greater amount is done to the greatest number—it is for the good of the greatest number that those laws should remain in the greatest possible degree unexecuted and inefficient of the laws which have this effect so great is the extent that rather than the effect of those laws should not be weakened it is for the benefit of the greatest number that the effect of the whole body of law taken together should be weakened in england the superior judges—more particularly those of the kings bench are in possession and exercise of a power the exercise of which is of itself sufficient to the establishment of the most tyrannical despotism they take a word or a phrase and in the use they make of that phrase they find a pretence and that an unquestionable one for inflicting punishment without stint on any person they please for any act they please the phrase contra bonos mores latin as it is serves them for inflicting punishment without stint on all persons by whom any act is done which does not accord with the notions they entertain or profess to entertain concerning morality the phrase christianity is part and parcel of the law of the land serves thus for inflicting punishment without stint on all persons by whom any act is done which does not accord with the notions they entertain or profess to entertain concerning christianity the word conspiracy serves them for inflicting punishment without stint on all persons by whom any act is done which does not accord with the notions they entertain or profess to entertain concerning the act in question it is not true it may be said that any such despotism is in their power for above them sits parliament above them also in parliament a king who can do no wrong nor would suffer wrong in any such shape to be done for not to mention the wrong which in this case would be done to subjects a despotism thus established would be established in contempt of the authority of parliament yes thus much is sure enough namely that without the consent at least not to speak of anything more than consent of the man who can do no wrong no wrong in this shape can be done but in this shape and by such instruments by the man who can do no wrong wrong to any amount can be done in a manner at once more effectual and in a variety of ways more commodious than by any such an unwieldy instrument as that called parliament he can do no wrong because wrong becomes right by his doing it as the god which is in heaven can commit no sin so the god which is upon earth—the god of blackstones creation and of all mens worship can do no wrong the beneficial effects of jurytrial are produced in a different shape in the civil branch and in the penal in the civil branch it is by applying a bridle to arbitrary power in the hand of the judge in the penal branch as we have seen contributing to infuse weakness into the body of the law under governments in which the institution of a jury has no place the judges not being in those countries removable either immediately or unimmediately by the power of the people a man who upon any account sees an adversary in the person of the judge may behold in that functionary a tyrant from whose power which may be sufficient to effect his ruin he sees no possibility of escape from a situation thus distressing the institution of a jury affords relief suppose a man to have suffered on one occasion—suppose a man to have suffered from enmity in the breast of one or more of the jurymen no such sensation as that of inevitable oppression presses upon him what he has an assurance of is that a jury composed of exactly the same individuals will not have to try him on any other occasion what he may at the least have the hope of is that on a jury sitting on another occasion the same adversary or adversaries will not have place in the penal branch the like good effect is produced in the same way but in the penal branch to that good effect another and still more important is added in the penal branch the institution of a jury contributes in conjunction with other causes to the production of that weakness in the law to which this country—which in this case is looked to as a pattern and from which all conceptions on the subject of jury and jurytrial are taken—is mostly indebted for those liberties by which it is distinguished from other countries it is from the circumstance of unanimity that the effect is produced by a single individual out of twelve the hand of the law is capable of being paralysed in consequence of this unanimity i e in consequence of its necessity to conviction it is in the power of any one man by surmounting the patience of the rest to command the verdict and thereby be the law and the fact ever so clear in the condemnation of the defendant to produce his acquittal in this false declaration of unanimity may be seen the cause of almost the whole of the afflictive confinement which at present has place in the case of juries the unanimity out of the question the verdict would be decided by votes and in the ordinary state of things     the voting would take place immediately upon the delivery of the charge by the judge in two cases alone would any delay in the delivery of the verdict have place—  if in the instance of this or that juryman a desire were expressed of receiving instruction from any other   if by this or that juryman a desire were expressed of communicating instruction to this or that other or to the rest §   proposed unimpowered jury its uses and regulations the only circumstance in which the species of jury here proposed differs from the jury in use is this—viz that whereas the decision pronounced by the actual jury is—bating some special and assigned cause of nullity—binding upon the judge the decision of the proposed unimpowered jury is as the denomination here given to it imports not binding upon the judge in general terms the use of the unimpowered jury consists in this—viz in its capacity of being introduced into any country in which the state of society is regarded as not being sufficiently advanced to render it conducive upon the whole to the purposes of justice to vest any such power in the great body of the people a country may be supposed in which though the great body of the people are not in so advanced a state as to render it eligible to repose this power in their hands yet this may not be the case with a certain distinguished portion of the people who on this occasion may be distinguished by the appellation of the higher orders admitting the existence of such a distinction it may be a question whether it might not be more conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number to attach to the judicatory an unimpowered jury composed altogether of the lower orders than an ordinarily impowered jury composed exclusively of the higher orders or conjunctly of the higher and lower orders but to take the more simple case in which without distinction of orders the supposition is that the state of society is not such as to admit of an impowered jury of whatsoever materials composed in this case without any the least prejudice to justice the advantages belonging to an impowered jury may to a considerable degree be given to or rather would of course have place in the case of this sort of unimpowered jury   in the first place there would in this case as in the other be the same sort of aid to and security for the appropriate aptitude intellectual as well as moral on the part of the judge   in this case as in the other the people would in every judicatory to which this appendage were attached behold a school of justice regulations in the case of an unimpowered jury—   the question will be to be reduced to a single alternative an option to be made between two mutually contradictory propositions examples guilty or not guilty for the plaintiff or for the defendant   the number of persons in the jury odd viz that in every instance a majority may have place   mode of voting secret otherwise termed by ballot   on hearing the decision the judge does in regard to it as he thinks proper he either reverses or confirms it with the exception of such alterations as he thinks fit   in the books of the judicatory entry is in each instance made of the verdict pronounced and of the course taken by the judge in relation to it as above by comparison of different periods the advance made in the state of the public mind may be ascertained the smaller the proportion of the cases in which the verdict is reversed or altered to those of the cases in which it stands unchanged the greater the progress made by jurymen in the character of scholars in this school of justice not in the lowest stage of society actual or possible can any conceivable mischief be produced by the intervention of a popular judicatory thus destitute of all power of doing mischief and sooner or later by this institution alone would the state of society be raised from the lowest level to the highest by way of encouragement that the men thus placed in a sort of judicial situation may be impressed with a sense of their own dignity and their functions be an object of desire and source of satisfaction rather than aversion a station somewhat elevated and ornamented should be assigned to them with something of a decoration to be worn about their persons §   jurymen who what persons should be capable of serving as jurymen answer generally speaking under a system of universal or virtually universal suffrage as under the most popular of the american united states take for the general rule all persons of the male sex who are of full age and are able to read for the mode of ascertaining the reading qualification in the most commodious manner see benthams radical reform bill in that case no exceptions were needful why because the aggregate number of all the persons of different descriptions against whose admission any valid objection could be raised was in that case not considerable enough to produce any wellgrounded apprehension of their exercising an unfavourable     influence on the result and because each person delivering his vote separately no person would be exposed to experience annoyance in any shape from any other delivering a vote in an election requires nothing but a will an understanding yes this likewise but an understanding which always can and without impropriety may have taken another understanding for its guidance not so in the case of a jury each mans understanding is by the incident of the moment and in a state not prepared for the occasion called into exercise it may it is true take another understanding for its guidance but ere it can have made choice of any such directing understanding it must itself have been put in exercise in the case of the election the influence of any one vote on the result cannot be otherwise than extremely small in the case of the jurytrial where as in scotland unanimity is not necessary a single vote may suffice to determine the result in the case of the election each voter appearing upon the spot and delivering his vote separately no one individual is exposed to annoyance at the hands of any other in the case of the jury it being necessary that they should sit all of them in company of each other it may happen that by a single individual in whom the capacity of producing annoyance in this or that shape with or without the inclination has place annoyance may be produced in such shape and degree as may suffice to give disturbance to the whole operation in such sort that misdecision or more naturally nondecision is produced not to speak of the discomfort produced at the same time to the individuals with what degree of frequency is it desirable that within a given length of time the function of a juryman should by the same individual be exercised there are considerations which operate in extension of the time others which operate in limitation of it as to the direct and particular use of the institution the more frequently this function comes to be performed the more experience the individual gains and the more fitted he is thereby rendered for it under the head of uncompensated labour which is as much as to say expense—the greater is the hardship the heavier is the tax which is in this case imposed another inconvenience is that in proportion to this frequency the condition of the juryman is made to approach that of the permanent and official judge and thereby the inconveniences attached to such permanence are brought into existence when considered in the capacity of scholars in the school of justice the more frequently those who have been entered into this school are exercised the greater will their proficiency be then on the other hand the more frequent the exercise given to those who are thus entered the smaller is the number of the members of the community to whom in this character the instruction is imparted the two evils the exclusion of which is on this occasion to be avoided are—the punishment of nonoffenders and the nonpunishment of offenders i against the punishment of nonoffenders the following are the modifications that present themselves—   necessity of unanimity to warrant conviction and punishment   in case of dissentience necessity of a majority this majority is in its extent absosolute and relative susceptible of degrees of which the highest is that in which the minority consists of no more than one and the lowest that in which the majority exceeds the minority by no more than one to contribute to the effect desired it is not necessary that the want of unanimity or of that extramajority which is thought fit to be required should have for its effect acquittal and the consequent exemption of the accused from all punishment its effect is capable of being limited to the giving him exemption from the highest degree of punishment or from the highest and the next to the highest and so downwards in the scale of punishment of this modification the usefulness is more particularly conspicuous and undeniable as applied to irremediable punishment and in particular to that mode of punishment which alone is completely and absolutely irremediable viz mortal punishment note that the greater the absolute number i e the total number of those of whom the jury is composed the greater is the greatest relative number of which the ultramajority is capable of being composed ii nonpunishment of offenders from the giving to a single acquitting voice or any other such small number of acquitting voices the effect of producing total or partial exemption from the appointed punishment follows inconvenience that is to say danger of nonpunishment of offenders the case of corruption is the one most easily provided against at any rate that corruption to the application of which no antecedent intercourse or particular connexion is necessary the following are the arrangements by which in correspondent proportion the difficulty that attaches upon the application of the corruptive influence may be increased   increasing the number of the minority necessary to overrule the opinion and will of the majority   subjecting the choice of the jurymen on     each occasion to the power of chance and at the same time giving to the interval between the election thus made and the delivery of the verdict the shortest duration possible not slight is the grievance produced by so large a number as twelve so inexorably required in all cases for the correction of it we need no other instruction than that which is afforded by the instances in which superior power is lodged in less trustworthy hands true it is that there have been twelve apostles before them there were twelve months in the year twelve divinities of the highest class and twelve divinities of the next highest class since then there have been twelve knights of the round table of king arthur in the case of jurymen as of all other functionaries the problem is how to secure on their part with reference to their function the maximum of the aggregate appropriate aptitude in this instance as in others elements of appropriate aptitude three—viz appropriate moral aptitude appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent branches of appropriate intellectual aptitude two—viz appropriate knowledge and appropriate judgment of these elements the first in the order of consideration and as it should seem of importance is appropriate moral aptitude but for no one of these three elements can any proper provision be made without consideration had at the same time of the other two as to appropriate moral aptitude for securing this quality reference must be made to the causes of relative inaptitude for securing aptitude the course to be taken will be to counteract the influence of these sinister causes for applying the proper remedy against delinquency the first thing to be done is to bring to view the source of the correspondent temptation this will be on questions between individual and individual partiality in favour of either side to the prejudice of the other on a question between individual and government partiality in favour of either side to the prejudice of the other as to this matter partiality in favour of the individual to the prejudice of the constituted authorities as such is of course in any individual instance possible but what is beyond comparison more probable is partiality in favour of government to the prejudice of the individual so much more ample and securely efficient are the means of rewarding and thus procuring partiality in the hands of government in comparison with the most efficient means that can be generally employed by individuals widely different in respect of the amplitude of the source and probable degree of efficiency is the temptation in favour of any individual compared with the temptation in favour of government which is in respect of quantity practically speaking infinite and in respect of constancy applying itself in every case in which avowedly or unavowedly government has any concern in favour of an individual it is only in a comparatively small number of cases that partiality can find means to operate with any chance of success on this side partiality will require to be distinguished into natural and factitious for examples of natural partiality take the following—   the jurymen having a natural though more or less remote and undefined and thence an unseen interest in a pecuniary or other shape in the event of the cause   jurymen in this or that proportion of the whole number having connexion in the way of interest or sympathy with a party on either side of the cause   so a feeling of hostility in the way of antipathy now as to temptations in a factitious shape those of a pecuniary nature are at once the most obvious and the most extensively applicable the act by which temptation of this nature is applied and applied with success is if it be in a pecuniary and tangible shape termed bribery or if in a less tangible shape corruption though even in any case in which the word bribery is employed with propriety so may the word corruption corruption being the genus bribery one species of it much more difficult to contend with is the case where the source of the temptation is natural than where it is factitious where it is factitious you may by means of dispatch prevent the application of the instrument of temptation where it is natural the instrument of temptation is already applying itself in all its force §   jury appointment by whom should the members of a jury be appointed answer by no man but by fortune man has sinister interests fortune has no sinister interests under mans appointment justice would have no even chance under fortunes appointment she will have an even chance and that is the best chance that can be given to her whatever benefit has resulted from this appendage to the judgment seat has been produced by its applying as a bridle to arbitrary power in the hands of the judge and those in whose particular and sinister interests he is a sharer from a bridle his endeavour has of course from first to last been to convert   0 it into a cloak and thereby into an instrument the individuals who on the occasion of each cause serve in this character are or at any rate are supposed to be a minor assemblage a comparatively minute body taken out of a comparatively large class in each instance therefore the composition of the jury depends upon two distinguishable circumstances   upon the situation in life of the individuals composing the class out of which the selection is made   on the situation of the hand or hands by which the selection is made in so far as the appointment by which in the individual cause in question the members of the jury are determined is regarded as having for its cause avowed or concealed the will of this or that person whose will could not consistently with the acknowledged design of the institution be thus employed—the operation by which effect is given to such will is called packing the class out of which the selection is made suppose it in the whole or in the greatest part composed of individuals whose place is among the ruling few—or whose eyes with a view to the advancement of their interests are habitually fixed upon the ruling few packing is thus far established and established by law suppose the form of government an aristocracy here we have a system of packing for the purpose of aristocratical sinister interest suppose the form of government a monarchy with an aristocracy under it with or without a colour or shade of democracy here we have a system of packing established for the purpose of a combination of monarchical and aristocratical influence suppose the composition of the class out of which the selection is made in a certain degree mixed—some of the individuals sharers in the particular and sinister interests others not in this case it is and in this alone that it may be matter of importance what the bands are by which the selection is made if these be the hands of an individual or individuals belonging to the tainted class just mentioned as well might the jury be composed exclusively of such hands without any mixture from the above considerations result two practical conclusions— the body out of which juries are respectively selected should be either—   of the individuals possessing the right of suffrage in the election of members of the representative assembly under the system of virtual universality of suffrage—all such whose residence is within the judicial district in question with the exception of a few classes such as insane persons criminal convicts c whose interference though without effect in that case would not be without effect in this—or   a select body thence not so numerous as that allcomprehensive body but still amply numerous in comparison of the number of the jurymen who for the purpose of one or more causes are appointed for one and the same days service the body of electors by which this election is performed the same as that just described in either case fortunes will be the most proper hands by which for the purpose of each individual cause the selection can be made fortune is not exposed to the action of sinister interests of interestbegotten prejudices or authoritybegotten prejudices every human being is if the design had really been to prevent the selection of the jury from being rendered partial and conducive to misdecision by the influence of those causes it is to fortune and not to any human being that the selection would have been committed throughout the whole of the system of which jurytrial is a part two objects—two intimately connected objects have been aimed at in so far as circumstances have admitted by the workmen employed in the fabrication of the system viz the lawyers—and the kings whose dependent creatures and instruments they always were—viz to secure the real existence and efficiency of partiality in their favour and to secure the appearance of impartiality when a man is to make this selection scarcely in one instance out of twenty will partiality be really without a place in this selectors mind scarcely in one instance out of twenty be the partiality ever so strenuous will there be any outward and visible sign of it look over the table of springs of human action† that table now lies before me sixteen is the number of different ones you may see no one of them less capable of determining and misleading conduct than another sixteen different sorts of interests every one of them capable of acting with effect in the character of a sinister interest sixteen of which the love of money is but one in all times and with the exception of the metropolis in all places the sheriffs have been the absolutely depending creatures of the king placed by the king engaged in pecuniary accounts with the king and for the difference between profit and utter ruin depending on the uncontroulable will and pleasure of another set of dependent creatures and instruments of the king—the barons of his exchequer judges of the great judicatory of accounts between him and his defenceless subjects the judges were placed and displaceable by the king the sheriffs were placed by the     king and at the end of each year each one of them of course gave place to another placed in like manner by the king the jurymen were placed by this creature of the king and at the end of each short length of time—call it term call it assize call it sessions—gave place to another set selected by the same or another hand in that same place in this state of things wherever the king or any individual dependent on him possessed in any shape an interest in the cause think what would have been the real efficiency of any measures having for their professed object the securing of impartiality in the administration of justice by the combination of the two modes of appointment above mentioned the useful purpose of the institution might in a certain respect be forwarded of the jury in each cause the greater number might be taken by lot out of the allcomprehensive body of electors one or some other such small number out of the select body what is here assumed is that it is with a view to superiority in intellectual aptitude and active talent that the selection is to be made here then by the major portion in whom in respect of appropriate moral aptitude the reliance is—obsequiousness or resistance to the guidance of the select few will be manifested according to what in their eyes are the dictates of justice the right of expunction shall it be allowed to the parties the room for the exercise of it will depend on the number selected in the first instance to any approach towards a satisfactory solution of this question much more detail would be necessary than the present design could afford serious objection however is not altogether wanting to the party in the wrong supposing him conscious of his being so an advantage having place to an extent to which no limits can be assigned is thus given proportioned to the reputation for appropriate aptitude in all its several elements possessed by the eventual juror will be the eagerness of this selfcondemned party to put an exclusion upon so assured an adversary in election committees of the english house of commons this effect of the right of expunction has been matter of experience and remark knocking out the brains of the committee is the phrase by which the expunction has in this case been designated of the three elements of appropriate aptitude intellectual aptitude and active talent have been the two only ones in view for reference to appropriate moral aptitude cutting out the heart of the committee or something to this effect would be necessary if in a body so composed any such organ as a heart could have place §   securities for appropriate aptitude in the determination of the individuals serving as members of this obligatorily attending committee of the publicopinion tribunal the appropriate aptitude of the parties must be kept in view deficiency in appropriate moral aptitude will be corruption or have corruption for its cause corruption is in this case either precedental or subsequential namely with relation to the time at which it is believed or more or less likely to be believed by the juryman that on the occasion of the suit or cause in question he will have to serve of precedental moral inaptitude the most extensive causes in a republican state are antipathy and sympathy on the ground of party to evil from this source the nature of the case excludes the possibility of any completely effectual remedy all that can be done towards it is by power of dislocation given to the parties on each side in this case in so far as the proposed bias of the jurymen in attendance is known or conjectured those on both sides against whom the persuasion or suspicion applies with greatest force will on each side if the faculty be given be dislocated in the language of english law dislocation thus applied is challenging in a monarchical state supposing any such institution as that of a jury admitted into the judicial system the system of corruption inseparable from the government will have infused and kept up throughout the whole population an allpervading spirit of party sympathy and antipathy altogether incompatible with right decision in any sort of suit or cause to which it applies partiality from a public cause may be more or less open and exposed to general knowledge or suspicion partiality from a private cause much less so in the case of a jury after the exhaustion of the whole stock of possible remedies which the nature of the case admits of—selfregardinginterestbegotten sympathybegotten antipathybegotten and prejudicebegotten partiality to a vast extent will have place and that in such force that misdecision will continually be the result of it such will be the case whether the part taken by each juryman be known or unknown—unknown in so far as the nature of the case admits of its being so which cannot be the case but to an extent in a considerable degree limited if as is throughout the case in english practice the decision is represented as unanimous—here that which to no person can be unknown is that by every member of the jury concurrence in the obnoxious decision was given for who the members of     the jury are is seen by all present in the judicatory here then are all twelve—that being in every case the number—exposed to the enmity of all those to whose wishes the decision is adverse a case that may very well happen and that cannot but happen is that without its being either known or suspected jurymen one or more may have a pecuniary interest in the event of the cause—an interest equal or in any degree superior to that which any party has on either side here then is inducement sufficient to cause a single man to produce by the characteristic torture on the part of all the others accession to his side for submitting to it his compensation may be ample to any amount while in the instance of no one of the whole number with whom he has to contend has compensation place in any shape suppose a majority to be admitted to determine the decision and in the first place suppose the side taken by each known in every case no expedients being taken in the way of concealing it in this case the moral corruption the solemn insincerity and mendacity is excluded but the exposure to illwill with the attendant inducement to partiality and misdecision through fear is rendered still more certain and extensive not one of the jury but makes to himself and stands for ever exposed to a host of adversaries—all those without doors whose affections are on the opposite side on the other hand on this supposition the part taken in the decision by each juryman is exposed to the tutelary action of the publicopinion tribunal here then is the breast of the juryman acted upon and agitated by conflicting interests as between right decision and misdecision the uncertainty is entire the suffering certain and to an unlimited degree capable of being intense the option may be between having the good opinion and goodwill of all persons but one with whom he has any particular connexion in the way of interest or sympathy and the forfeiture of the goodwill of some one on whose good offices the whole prospect of his life depends suppose now the decision of the majority sufficient but secresy by expedients more or less efficient endeavoured to be preserved—preserved in a word by the most effectual of all expedients suffrages given as in the case of a wellconducted ballot with all the secresy which the nature of the case admits of to all persons without doors the result in respect of numbers on both sides known and declared this and nothing else still as between juryman and juryman—between each one and one or more or all of his fellows—the secresy will be in a high degree uncertain for the sake of securing in every instance a majority on one side or the other the number will of course in that case be an odd one in the case of the smallest odd number the nonsecresy will be complete numbers in this case two to one each one knowing on which side he himself has voted will know if he be the only one on his side to a certainty on which side the two others have voted if indeed he be one of the majority of two what is possible is that as between the two others he will not know to a certainty which has been on his side—which on the opposite side but on this supposition there must either have been an absence of all discussion a dead silence or on the part of the two fellowjurymen on one side at least if not on both a display of the vice of insincerity and that in such perfection as to have been successful true it is that as you increase the number you increase the probability of uncertainty but the number may rise to five seven nine eleven thirteen fifteen and still unless discussion be excluded the probability of uncertainty be very inconsiderable and after all but partial applying to this or that one or other small proportion of the whole number §   jurymen number of—proportion requisite to command the verdict   number the smallest capable of fulfilling the purpose increasing with the number is either vexation or expense vexation to the jurymen if time and labour of attendance and operation are not compensated for expense if they are jurymen though but ephemeral judges are not the less judges call them by that name the conception in respect of vexation and expense will be the more adequate   proportion requisite to command the verdict in cases nonpenal there is little difficulty misdecision may happen in any case but from the nature of the class of cases thus denominated no danger is indicated as attaching to misdecision on one side of the cause greater than from misdecision on the other if any such difference in point of danger is discoverable it must be by a particular examination of the cases referable to this head in one point of view number and proportion are united the prime object is to secure decision on the one side or the other in contradistinction to nondecision for nondecision in so far as it has place is denial of justice in effect however it is decision against the plaintiffs side but it is without sufficient grounds for supposing the ground sufficient—sufficient in the eyes of those to whom it belongs to judge a decision would be pronounced in positive terms against     that side make the number of jurymen odd a positive decision on the one side or on the other is by this means secured and on whichever side it is given should the decision be erroneous no greater mischief is as above likely to ensue than if the misdecision were on the other side very different is the result in a case of a penal nature by punishment of an individual who is not guilty greater is the evil produced than by nonpunishment of an individual who is guilty of this evil the elements are as follows—   mischief of the second order alarm selfregarding alarm produced in the minds of the people at large by the apprehension of undue suffering from the like source   sympathy with the sufferer and his connexions pain of social sympathy in both its branches this evil will increase with the magnitude of the punishment—where the punishment is mortal this evil is at its maximum in this case the mischievousness is created not so much by the magnitude of the punishment as by its irremediability—by its not being capable of being made to cease and by the exclusion it puts upon all compensation or satisfaction—upon good in every shape given to a party injured in compensation for the injury to set against the superiority of evil that has place in the case of undue conviction and consequent execution as compared with that of undue acquittal an expedient naturally and not unfrequently resorted to has been the requiring for the producing a conviction votes more in number and proportion than for producing an acquittal hereupon come two opposite dangers—  allow conviction to have place where in the opinion of one or more of these judges the offence charged was not committed in a proportionable degree the evils above stated as flowing from undue punishment have place   give to one or any other small number of votes the effect of preventing conviction you let in the danger of undue acquittal through corruptive influence or illapplied sympathy of these two opposite evils neither is capable of being completely excluded but by apposite arrangements they are each of them capable of being diminished—diminished and that in such a degree as to supersede the demand for that multitude which in the case of these sphemeral judges has commonly been excessive so far as regards criminal cases the grand argument is this—would you endure to see that man treated as guilty who in the eyes of though it were but a single individual of such a company who by office are all good men and true is innocent in the instance of this class of cases those which are not only criminal but capital—such has been their prominence—have in a manner eclipsed all those whose place is inferior in the important scale the eclipse is altogether a natural one in the original pharmacopeia of english jurisprudence mortal punishment constituted the general remedy mortal punishment constituting the general rule punishment short of mortal the exception under a jurisprudence thus composed or organized think what in a mind not altogether destitute of human sympathy must have been the impression naturally made by the conception thus started as in the eyes of the dissentient juryman so in all other eyes to which the case presented the same aspect all who concurred in the verdict of which the death of the accused was the consequence would wear the aspect of murderers the mischief consists in giving to the punishment such a form that in case of misapplication the evil of it is irreparable but to an eye the research of which is confined to the surface destruction of the offender presents in the case of punishment in this shape a degree of security such as is not capable of being given by punishment in any other shape experience proves that from causes foreign to the present purpose by the giving of this shape to punishment security instead of being increased is lessened but in the rank of life in question so sensitive is selfishness that neither the will nor the understanding necessary to a research below the surface are to be found on the occasion of the decision pronounced by the jury shall unanimity be made necessary otherwise thus—in giving his suffrage towards the formation of the decision shall each juryman be permitted to give his own opinion or shall he be compelled to give as his opinion that which is not were reason and morality to decide the question thus put would contain the answer but in the course given to the practice reason and morality have been treated with the most complete disregard time out of mind the practice has been determined by custom the effect of no one can say what cause in an age of which all that is known is that it was a barbarous one dissect this transaction and note well the circumstances of which it is composed—   the decision pronounced by the jury is accompanied by the ceremony called an oath in and by this oath is understood if anything is understood a promise that the opinion delivered by the person in question shall be     an opinion which at the time of his delivering it he really entertains as often as it is thought that a promise of this sort is violated that is to say that the opinion which the man has delivered accordingly as his was not the opinion which he at that time entertained he is considered in law and in public opinion and language as having committed an act repugnant at the same time to the dictates of law and morality the name by which this act is designated is perjury as often as among a jury at the time of pronouncing the decision thus given in as unanimous any difference of opinion has place insomuch that while the opinion given in as the opinion of the whole is the opinion of one or more others there are one or more whose opinion it is not perjury it is manifest has been committed either this is perjury or nothing that can be named is perjury of the persons by whom the perjury in this case has been committed the whole of the jurymen being twelve the number may have been any number from one to eleven inclusive not uncommonly the number of perjurers on this occasion is known to have been eleven   next comes the question in what way is it that this perjury is brought about in what way by what means the answer is—torture by torture taken in the literal sense is universally understood the employing pain of body or fear of the immediate application of it to compel at the hands of the individual to whom the pain or the fear is applied the performance of some act which it is or at least by the person by whom the torture is applied is thought to be in his power to perform to compel him in such sort that on the performance of the act the pain or the fear whichever it is ceases but till then continues here then we have perjury produced by torture   now as to the person or persons by whom the torture is administered and the perjury produced these persons are of two or even more descriptions for simplicity of conception suppose it the case where the number of the perjurers is eleven one and one alone not being a party to the perjury in this case it is by the intermediate agency of this one juryman that the torture by which the perjury has been effected has been inflicted on all the rest at the same time it has been inflicted on him by himself thus we see eleven out of twelve jurymen perjured and all twelve tortured for the pain of body thus inflicted on himself the juryman who is not perjured has received a compensation which in his eye is adequate he has saved himself from the guilt of perjury and he has exercised an act of power over his fellowjurymen when at the instigation of one person perjury is committed by another subornation of perjury is in lawyers language said to have place a person at whose instigation the perjury is committed is in consideration thereof termed a suborner here then we have eleven persons perjured twelve persons tortured and one person who is a suborner but subornation may have place in a chain of any length the suborners one behind another at so many different distances from the immediate act and its agent may be such in any number forming or occupying so many lengths in a chain of subornation a instigates b to commit the perjury or a instigates b to instigate c to commit the perjury and so on to any length the immediate suborner would not in the manner above explained have instigated c and the others to commit the perjury had it not been by the power given to him by another person who thereby becomes an anterior suborner—a suborner of the first remove thus forming or occupying another and higher link in the chain of subornation and perjury the person by whom this power is possessed and exercised is a judge—the presiding judge the judge before whom the trial is carried on and by whom all the operations performed on the occasion are directed in this way on condition of inflicting on himself and the other eleven a degree of uneasiness which no one of them but himself can support any man has it in his power to prescribe the opinion that shall be delivered by the rest and thus converts them into perjurers the number of the persons capable of being on each trial thus dealt with is the number of the persons employed on the trial in character of jurors the mode by which this power is exercised is to him by whom it is exercised liable to be so painful that the case of its being so exercised is not an ordinary one in the ordinary case those in the minority give up their opinions and join with the majority to this junction there will naturally be two inducements—  the general perception that in case of diversity of opinion the chances in favour of rectitude will be in the direct ratio of the number of the persons on the different sides   that in a larger number the chance is greater of its containing an individual capable of thus subduing the others than in a smaller on the other hand cæteris paribus the chance in favour of rectitude in the case of any opinion is as the number of the persons by whom it is embraced according to this rule when by one single man the decision contrary to the opinions of eleven others is thus produced the probability in favour of wrongness of decision is as eleven to one if instead of twelve the jury consisted of     no more than three the probability in favour of a wrong decision thus produced could never by the above rule be greater than as two to one it follows therefore that the more numerous the jury acting under this forced and false declaration of unanimity the greater is the probability of this kind of perjury now as to the general effect of this feature in the institution on the rectitude of judicial decisions and on the character of the government—in a word on the greatest happiness of the greatest number supposing the state of the law in general were what it ought to be and is commonly said to be—on this supposition by every wrong verdict—by every verdict not given in accordance with the state of the law and evidence mischief is produced if by any such verdict not preponderant mischief but preponderant good is produced the case is of the number of those in which the state of the law is different from what it ought to be—and not merely different but to such a degree different that by the breach of the law and that breach a notorious one less mischief is done than would have been done by the observance of it to say then that in the present state of the law taking the effects of this pretended unanimity in the aggregate the result of it is beneficial to society is as much as to say that such is the state of the law—taken in the aggregate that society reaps a quantity of clear benefit from the aggregate number of the breaches of the law thus produced in this position is moreover included another viz that in the bulk of the population at any rate in that part of it from which jurymen of the class in question are drawn there exists such a regard for the welfare of the community as on the part of the class of those by whom laws are made is not to be found for if there were then by repealing or giving the requisite modification to those laws the breach of which is wont to be thus produced the same effect would be made to have place and without being accompanied with any abuse as is at present produced—an abuse so flagrant and so plainly repugnant to the almost universally acknowledged principles of morality and religion under the unanimity system the usefulness of jurytrial is as the badness of the substantive law in general and in particular the constitutional branch this unanimity is therefore bad in the angloamerican united states but good in england admitting the effect alleged viz the force put upon the will of all but one by the one and the substitution of the will of that one to the will of the other eleven where it may be asked is the proof that by the breach of the law—by the breach as thus effected more good is commonly produced than would have been produced by the observance answer no such effect can be produced but by a more than common degree of energy but setting aside the case of bribery which could not without an uncommon concurrence of circumstances have place and which in fact is very seldom if ever supposed to have place—and the case of a sinister interest produced by other circumstances—a case which in the penal branch can very seldom have place—the degree of energy requisite for the production of this effect can scarcely be produced by any sort of cause other than that for the designation of which the name of conscience or principle is commonly employed viz sensibility to the force of social sympathy sensibility to the force of the popular or moral sanction or sensibility to the force of the religious sanction an indifferentist will pin his faith on the opinion or the supposed opinion of the judge in the case of neither of these classes is it common for any such energy to have place for marking the separation between the cases in which this unanimity may be of real use and those in which it cannot be of real use one line or at most two lines may suffice it may be of use and is of use in all those cases in which whether in respect of the prohibition or in respect of the punishment the law being detrimental to the interest of the subjectmany ought not to be in existence and that in such sort that it is better for the subjectmany that no obedience should ever be paid to it than that no disobedience to it should have place it is of use therefore in the case of all those penal provisions by which monarchical government is distinguished from democratical—in the instance of all those laws by which the penalty for offences against person property or reputation is raised to a higher degree in the case where the injured person is a member of the government than in the case where he is a private individual possessing no share in the powers of government it is of use in all those cases in which punishment is attached to the divulgation of opinions it is of use in the case of all offences against the revenue of government when the government is to such a degree corrupt and to such an extent established in the habit of sacrificing to the particular and thence sinister interest of its members the interest of the whole community that it would be for the advantage of the whole community that the government should fall to pieces and a different one be established in the room of it it may even without going to such a length as to annihilate the government be of use to a certain extent and on certain occasions viz by increasing the difficulty the government     might be under as to the finding supplies in such sort as to prevent the government from giving way on this or that occasion to that destructive propensity which in such governments has place on all occasions—the propensity to keep the country plunged in groundless and unnecessary wars if false declarations of unanimity and torture for the compelling of the falsehood are of use in this case—give the benefit of the falsehood and the torture to all other cases in which unanimity would in some eyes be desirable apply it for example to elections keep all the electors shut up together in close confinement without food and so forth till they have given their votes in favour of one of the candidates leaving the choice of the successful candidate to chance or wisdom whichever may be most convenient not that for giving extension to this supposed security for right conduct there is any necessity for straying thus far from the so much admired patters the twelve judges constitute a judicatory and to complete the analogy the number of the members is the same take then this security for rectitude of decision and apply it to the twelve judges not that in this case the need of it is in danger of being very frequent nowhere is it better known than in that preeminently learned assembly how useful the appearance of agreement is to the giving in the eyes of the deluded multitude a colouring of reason and justice to absurdity and injustice on the occasion of those smotherings of evidence by which impunity was given to the notorious crimes of hastings the twelve judges under the tutorage of the head creature of the crown were unanimous the unanimity which being capable of being declared was declared stood in the place of those reasons which not being afforded by the nature of the case were not to be found a case and this too a law case in which the demand for unanimity would naturally be more frequent is that of the house of lords on the occasion for example of the queens trial how much more acceptable a result might have been produced had this security for propriety of decision been established in that most noble and august of all tribunals a single peer whose loyalty stood in need of recompence while his constitution was hungerproof might have sufficed to have produced a result so much more desirable than that which took place when the perfection of judicature has thus been secured secured in the house of lords—one step more will secure perfection to legislation for this purpose the benefit of it must of course be extended to both houses as soon as this instrument is subservient to right conduct in all those other and higher situations so will it be in that of a jury as soon but not a moment sooner in england one point of policy pervades and gives form and spirit to the system of government and shape and effect to practice it consists in confounding and obliterating throughout the whole field of government the distinctions between right and wrong in such sort that whatsoever would to any degree be wrong and flagitious if practised by an individual not belonging to the class of rulers nor commanded nor authorized by the appointed assortment of those who do belong to that class becomes right and meritorious in the case of its being so authorized for this purpose it is that as often as any reason is undertaken to be given for this or that arrangement forming part and parcel of the system of government some manifest and flagrant falsehood the more flagrant and absurd the better is given and passed from hand to hand as a sufficient reason for it and justification of it thus in speaking of an individual so situated that it is impossible for him ever to do right—that the whole of his conduct as such is occupied in the doing of wrong—that his very existence is one vast wrong—that by the maintenance of that one individual in the state in which he is placed others the most mischievous of whom is beyond comparison less so than he are to the amount of many thousands destroyed by lingering deaths and others to an equally unlimited number kept from coming into existence—of this individual it is that a phrase in every mouth ascribes the impossibility of doing wrong and of this complexion throughout the whole of the field is the language which calls for prostration of the understanding and will under the name of government and in particular of that which with a still louder voice calls for a still more abject prostration of those same faculties under the name of justice to lies in so far as applied to the purposes thus described the name of fictions is given and by this one denomination—such is the effect of fraud when backed by power—the character of wisdom and virtue is understood to be given to a mixture in the composition of which it is difficult to say which of its two ingredients is predominant—absurdity or vice ungrounded would be the imputation if to the practice thus described any such adjunct as wanton were attached in wantonness is implied thoughtlessness but in this case whatsoever part folly and imbecility may have had in giving increase to it the deepest reflection grounded on long experience and acute observation all along keeping steadily in view the universal actual end of government—the greatest happiness of those who have borne a principal part in the exercise of it must everywhere have     borne a principal part in the original concoction of it lest anything should be wanting to the efficiency of this policy the force of the religious sanction has on this and all other favourable occasions been called in and added thus it is that for the converting into accomplices those who might otherwise have been tempted to become accusers the whole multitude of individuals invested with the character of ecclesiastical functionaries have as a condition precedent to their entrance upon that character been with exceptions too few to be worth taking into account with anxious solemnity baptized in the filth of perjury by perjury is here meant not anything that is criminal—for effectual has been the care taken by the law that it shall not be criminal viz by the forbearing to render it punishable by perjury accordingly is here meant—not any crime against the law nothing more heinous than not to speak of the offence against morals a sin against god in some countries where polished minds bear sway—british india for example—so rude so uninformed or so ill formed not to say so deformed is the general complexion of the public mind that individuals in number competent to the formation of juries fit at the same time to be endued with the power ordinarily possessed by juries would as yet in the general mass of the population be in few if in any places to be found in hands so circumstanced a function of such a nature as to apply by the force of the legal sanction a bridle to the power of the judge could not be safely trusted—trusted with preponderantly useful effect a power of such sure efficiency would in such hands be liable to be employed in the character of an instrument of depredation or oppression this being the case it would not follow but that operating with no other force than that of the popular or moral sanction the function might in every instance be innoxious and at the same time in more shapes than one serviceable what is meant is that—in cases of sufficient importance to pay for the complication the additional delay the vexation and the expense—under the respected name of a jury a body of men should be introduced appointed in some appropriate way taking in that character cognizance of the cause and delivering their verdict—delivering it but to such effect that the judge though bound to hear it and to hear it in public should not be bound to conform to it which being the case—in the event of noncompliance on the part of the judge—the effect of the verdict would be that of an appeal from his decision to the tribunal of public opinion independently of the effect of a verdict of this sort in each individual case upon the event of the cases among the results of this practice taken in the aggregate would be the giving to each judicatory thus furnished the character as was before observed of a school of justice—a school in which while the individuals thus employed as jurymen were upon the principle of mutual instruction receiving their lessons in the character of scholars receiving instruction thus in its most impressive shape the byestanders at large would though in a shape not altogether so instructive still be receiving instruction not the less impressive and beneficial from its presenting itself to their conception in the shape of simple entertainment here would be a theatre the suit at law the drama parties advocates if any judge and jury the dramatis personæ and actors the byestanders the audience from the institution so modelled another advantage—an advantage to social harmony on the part of naturally and hitherto jarring materials might be derived the body out of which for each cause the jurymen are drawn be it supposed the sort of select and elected body above described of the elected hindoos let mahometans be the electors in like manner of the elected mahometans the hindoos and as between religion and religion so in the hindoo religion as between caste and caste in british india suppose juries established composed of natives the case to a certain degree important whether it belong to the penal or only to the nonpenal branch the difficulty of preventing successful bribery would naturally be such as to put not only the ingenuity but the perseverance of the legislator to the stretch one expedient in so far as the state of the population afforded an adequate mixture—a mixture of the two religions hindoo and mahometan in the composition of the jury might afford some check always supposed the declaration of unanimity was not made requisite for in that case the absolute command of the verdict is given to any one juryman whose perseverance is sufficiently paid for so far as mahometans are concerned the composition of this kind of jury presents no difficulty not so in so far as hindoos are concerned even supposing mahometans and men of other religions out of the question among the hindoos themselves the deplorable fancies by which differences in dignity and purity are imagined as between caste and caste present a labyrinth such as no distant eye can pervade to any such purpose as that of deciding what mixtures would in such a case be unendurable what endurable declaration of unanimity being necessary suppose the individuals of whom in the cause in question the jury will be composed predetermined and foreknown by making sure though it were of no more than one of them say for example by a bribe a party might     be sure of gaining his cause a party whose all the suit being a nonpenal one depended on the event of it would seldom shrink from such a course enthusiasm physically possible but never to be reckoned upon excepted—in a cause where his life depended upon the issue of it no man ever would shrink from such a course in a certain state of society public opinion and habits not being favourable to such a course the pursuing it with success might be attended with more or less difficulty even to such a degree as that the probability of it should not be great but states of society might be found and those too extensively prevalent such as to substitute in this respect to difficulty and improbability facility and probability in british india for example suppose a capital case a jury composed of natives the individuals known to the defendant by information sufficiently early for such a practice one juryman though there were no more needy and the defendants pecuniary means ample enough to pay the jurymans price—impunity here is a matter of certainty chapter xxiv special juries a special jury is a petit jury composed of members distinguished by opulence from those of a common petit jury this institution a palpable innovation a production of the last century is of the number of those benefits for which the people of england stand indebted to the whigs of england it had for its purposes and objects—   to assist in the destruction of the liberty of the press   in revenue causes to provide for the joint instrument of the monarch and aristocracy in the situation of chief judge of the chief revenue judicatory in the room of a bridle—an instrument and a cloak   in all cases in which the interests of the ruling the influential and the opulent and consuming few stand in competition with those of the subject the laborious and producing many—to give to the few whatsoever facility could thus be given by sacrificing the greatest happiness of the greatest number to that particular and sinister interest   in all cases in which the interests and thence the will of the monarch and his instruments of all sorts are in a more particular manner concerned and in particular in parliamentary election cases to secure to the power of the monarch by whose will directly or indirectly applied they always receive their situation an instrument on which he might depend for giving execution and effect to that will on all occasions   to put an additional quantity of money into the hands of the lawyers the infusion of this poison into the frame of government was accordingly the fruit of a conspiracy between three parties—the monarch the aristocracy and the lawyers in all causes in which such is his majestys pleasure cases of felony and a few others excepted his majesty has a clear and uncontested right to a special jury for his jury the party on one side has thus an incontestable right to the nomination of the judges an engine thus convenient—how happened it that it escaped being employed in cases of felony under a form of government which has for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number—that of the angloamerican united states for example—any limitation to the application of the investigative branch of procedure to a power so necessary to good judicature in all cases will when once brought to view be seen to be beyond dispute an imperfection under a form of government which has for its main and characteristic object the sacrifice of the greatest happiness of the greatest number to the particular and sinister interests of the members of the government and their adherents it is and to a vast extent only by some imperfection less mischievous that any security how imperfect soever can be obtained from more mischievous abuse under a form of government which has for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number the laws will bating this or that casual misjudgment oversight or want of discernment have that same end not only for their object but for their effect with no other exception than the one just alluded to it will under such a government be a result conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number and thence a desirable one that the execution and effect given to the laws should throughout be entire and uniform under a government which has for its object and effect the advancement of the sinister interest above mentioned and thereby the continual sacrifice of the greatest happiness of the greatest number it is to a certain extent and that a vast and difficulty definable one conducive to the greatest happiness of the greatest number that the laws such as they are should to the greatest extent possible fail of being carried into execution and effect in a country thus labouring under the yoke of sinister interest so vast will be the extent and mischievous tendency of those laws and arrangements by which sacrifice is made of the greatest happiness of the greatest number to that sinister interest—that rather than full effect should be given to this disastrous class of laws and arrangements it is conducive     to the greatest happiness of the greatest number and thence clearly and eminently desirable that the whole frame of the laws and government should labour under a degree of general imbecility and inefficiency as effective as possible the laws and other arrangements by which the liberty of the press is sought to be suppressed having for their object and if carried into effect their sure effect the obliteration of those few imperfect and ever precarious shades of distinction by which the limited is distinguished from a pure monarchy—it were a lesser evil that crimes of all sorts should shound still more than they do and juries give false verdicts still more frequently than it is endeavoured to make them do than that the designs and endeavours against that vital security should be accomplished under a government which has for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number official frugality is an object uniformly and anxiously pursued peace were it only as an instrument of such frugality cultivated with proportionable sincerity and anxiety any want of effect given to the laws by which contributions are required for the maintenance of government universally felt and regarded as a mischief all endeavours employed in the evasion of them regarded as generally mischievous and as such punished and with full reason by general contempt under a government which has for its main object the sacrifice of the greatest happiness of the greatest number to the sinister interest of the ruling one and the subruling few corruption and delusion to the greatest extent possible are necessary to that object waste in so far as conducive to the increase of the corruption and delusion fund a subordinate or coordinate object war were it only as a means and pretence for such waste another object never out of view that object together with those others invariably pursued in so far as the contributions capable of being extracted from contributors involuntary or voluntary in the shape of taxes or in the shape of loans i e annuities paid by government by means of further taxes can be obtained—under such a government by every penny paid into the treasury the means of diminishing the happiness of the greatest number receive increase—by every penny which is prevented from taking that pernicious course the diminution of that general happiness is so far prevented as under the one government every man in proportion to the regard he feels for the greatest happiness of the greatest number will give his strength to the revenue laws and set his strength against all endeavours employed for the evasion of them—so under the other sort of government in proportion to the regard he feels for that same object will he set his strength against the laws and in support of all endeavours employed for the evasion of them thus in particular and so in general in so far as the laws have been made every mans enemy every man in defence not only of his own happiness but of the happiness of the greatest number will in desire and endeavour be an enemy to the laws chapter xxv grand juries in the name grand juries the name of juries being included the appendage thus denominated cannot be altogether passed over in silence a grand jury is a superior kind of jury a grand jury has for its characteristic and peculiar function the salvation of the innocent a jury is a good thing a grand jury is a jury ergo a grand jury is a good thing a jury is a useful thing a grand jury is not only a useful but an honourable thing for a grand jury is a grand thing such being the logic this logic not being altogether clear of fallacy—to counteract the influence of it it is necessary to show what sort of a thing a grand jury really is a grand jury is a bar to penal justice for whatsoever purposes originally set up it has been kept up and employed by the subruling few under the influence of the ruling one for the securing to them and their adherents the benefit of impunity on the occasion of any misdeeds committed by them in the course of the sacrifices made by them of the greatest happiness of the greatest number to their own particular and sinister interests the petit jury tries a man and either acquits or convicts him the grand jury either refuses to put him and thus prevents him from being put upon his trial or puts him upon it a petit jury is composed of twelve neither more nor less whether it be for acquittal or for conviction a declaration of unanimity true or false no matter is necessary for the effectuation of it a grand jury consists of twentythree of that number any lesser number so it consist of twelve is necessary and sufficient to give validity to what is done of the procedure before the petit jury a characteristic and indispensable property is publicity of the procedure before the grand jury a property still more characteristic and declaredly secured is secresy the ceremony of an oath is employed for the securing of it in the official oath exacted from grand jurors the promise of secresy constitutes a distinct article the function of the grand jury applies itself to two different classes of offences to felonies and to misdemeanours   0 viewed at a distance—viewed in a general point of view—the division into felonies and misdemeanours corresponds in the main with the above exhibited division into penal cases which are such by reason of aggravation and penal cases which are such for want of an individual specially injured of the power originally given to the grand jury the effect was that without its fiat no operation of judicature at the expense of the personal liberty of an individual suspected could lawfully be performed it had thereby a veto on such operations preservation was thereby given to the personal liberty and by means of the oath of secresy to the reputation of individuals in latter times however this security with the effects good and bad together which could not fail to be attendant on it—this security the name and power of the grand jury notwithstanding has in both those shapes been at an end on application by any individual by a warrant from a single local magistrate styled a justice of the peace appointed and removable at any moment by the monarch any man is on this occasion committed to prison there to remain or thence to be liberated according to the discretion of the magistrate unless and until his liberty be disposed of by some other authority not here to the purpose those effects which are composed of evil with little or no admixture of good remain in full force behind for example the power by which for crimes of the most extensive mischief by a knot of men themselves armed with complete impunity without danger so much as to reputation reputation being covered by the oath of secresy impunity is secured to criminals in any number at pleasure in so far as what legal security there is against offences by means of which by men of this class viz the class of the subruling few acting under the influence of the ruling one sacrifices are made of the greatest happiness of the greatest number to the particular and sinister interests of those same rulers is given by the punishment and mode of procedure applied to the misdeeds styled felonies—impunity and complete licence is thus accorded for anything or for nothing put men to death in any numbers if according to the view of this section of the aristocracy instrument and confederate of the monarchy it is for the advantage of those conjunct interests that the men should die you are safe you are secured not only against punishment—but in so far as under the same influence the same inclinations prevail in that class of the instantlyremovable agents of the monarch styled justices of the peace—from disrepute so much as to felonies those cases included which though not in denomination are in respect of punishment or investigative procedure or both dealt with as felonies now as to misdemeanours cases in which with some exceptions principally regarding offences against the persons of individuals investigative procedure has not been provided in so far as investigative procedure is suffered to take place whatsoever protection is afforded against punishment at the hands of law does not extend altogether to disrepute the grand jury when it has given to its instrument and accomplice security against punishment has not of itself—has not without the concurrence of a sufficient assortment of other accomplices in the situation of justices of the peace together with an appropriate suppression of the liberty of the press given him security against disrepute in the cases to which investigative procedure has not been extended the security afforded to misdoers by the power of the grand jury is more entire whatever it may have been at one time as matters have stood for a long time a grand jury has been is and will be an instrument much worse than useless it gives no protection to the subject many against the ruling one or the subruling opulent and the influential few it does give protection to the ruling one—to the subruling opulent and influential few against the subjectmany bill found by the grand jury information grantable by motion information filed ex officio for alleged offences against person property or reputation of all these three inlets to prosecution and trial the one and the few have their choice against the subject many in any contest they may have with the many or the few all these inlets to justice or the show of it are closed information on motion by want of opulence on their part information ex officio by want of power vain altogether is the pretence that in this power you have a protection that innocence has a protection against unjust prosecution—a protection set up at the very threshhold—a protection against preliminary imprisonment if this protection were a preponderantly useful and desirable one how much more so would it be in the case of felonies than in the case of misdemeanors—in the case in which you have taken it away than in the case in which you suffer it to stand as at present constituted a grand jury is an assembly composed exclusively of gentlemen gentlemen to the exclusion of yeomen in the vocabulary of english jurisprudence these denominations have an import which if not altogether determinate is at least meant to be so the class of gentlemen is the class of the subruling the opulent the influential few the class of yeomen is the class of the     subject many on this occasion if the greatest happiness of the greatest number were the end in view in the composition of this transitory body the majority should be of the class of yeomen for if some must be sacrificed better the few to the many than the many to the few not that any such sacrifice would have place if any regard were paid so much as to the appearance of equal justice there should be a mixture of both classes and the class of the few should at any rate not have a majority as against the class of the many chapter xxvi quasijury §   preparatory or preliminary observations the design in the use here made of a jury—that is to say of a sample taken at random of the promiscuous multitude—the design is not to invest a set of men so circumstanced with an arbitrary power over their fellowcountrymen but to add to the effective force of the other checks applied to the power of the judge on the part of such an assemblage no one element of appropriate aptitude in any degree above the lowest could reasonably be depended upon on a judge placed in a situation fenced about as here—on a judge in so far as on any person invested with such power as it is necessary to arm his situation with so long as the eye of the publicopinion tribunal is kept steadily fixed upon him dependence may be placed accordingly they are not merely authorized but invited and urged to take cognizance of every matter that comes before them and on whatever occasion or on whatever account they feel disposed whether for the purpose of assistance to the understanding or controul upon the will of the judge—to give expression collectively and individually to their sentiments but this opinion is not made obligatory on the judge—it is not made decisive of the fate of the cause by this means instead of being placed on shoulders too lowly situated to be depended upon for being duly sensible to the pressure of it the responsibility is left to press with all its weight upon those shoulders in which that tutelary sensibility is at its maximum by the registration made on each occasion of the opinion of the jury on the one hand and the opinion of the judge on the other compared with the nature of the case and this parallelism continued on throughout the stream of time a continually accumulating body of information interesting in a variety of ways will be secured the progress of intellectual aptitude as applied to matter of law and evidence will be marked by it the judge will not as he would otherwise partly by the intellectual influence attached to his situation or by fallacies and other antifices employed on purpose have it in his power to remove from his own shoulders the just odium that would otherwise be brought down upon him by an unjust decision on the other hand while in this direction on account of its dangerousness the influence of the committee of the publicopinion tribunal is here limited—in another quarter an enlargement clear of all danger is given to it from an opinion which is not obligatory evil cannot in any part of the field be in any shape produced and in the situation of judge if a check is necessary or useful in any part of the field he travels in so is it in every other of a road such as that here in question if a watchman be useful in any one part so must he be in every other accordingly under the system here proposed in no part of his career is the probity of the judge left destitute of the benefit of the safeguard which it belongs to the power of the quasijury to afford of whatever point a judge has cognizance of the same point a quasijury has concomitant cognizance of the service such as it is which is rendered to justice in systems in which the word jury is employed it may be questioned whether it be in a direct way or otherwise than in an indirect way that upon the whole the greatest part of it is rendered along with the jury a portion of the public has all along been let in the jury itself forms on each occasion a part and parcel of the great public at large and in proportion to the change made in the persons by whom that function is performed that portion receives enlargement hence it is that in jury cases publicity of judication has been to a considerable extent though nowhere in an allcomprehensive nor therefore in an adequate extent the practice being the practice in those cases the expectation of finding it so wherever it has been the practice has become general and in this indirect way it is that jurytrial is to an extent more or less considerable of use in cases in which as to the affording any binding check upon partiality on the part of the judge the jury itself might be little better than useless witness all those cases in which the choice of the jury is immediately or unimmediately in the hands either of the judge or of some other dependent creature or creatures of the monarch in all such cases it may be a question whether in the character of a check to improbity in the judge it does more good than it does evil not only has the public at large acquired the habit and thence to a practical effect the right of stealing in as it were under the cloak of the jury but by the power given to the jury the judge finds himself under the necessity of addreasing his discourse to     them explanstory of the nature of the case and of the grounds on which his advice and recommendation if any is given to them has been founded suppose then for arguments sake an advice manifestly repugnant to justice given by him to them—what is the consequence if he gives no reason he does not give himself the chance he might have of prevailing by sophistry and the injustice being without a mask instead of compassing its object will expose him to just reproach if he gives reasons their being by the supposition weak they will expose him to reproach by their weakness now as to the number of the persons whose services are to be exacted for the performance of this function on this part of the field a conflict has place between the direct ends of justice on the one part and the collateral ends on the other between the good attached to the degree of security afforded against the evils of misdecision and the evil composed of vexation to these functionaries and expense either to them or to the community at large true it is that in regard to extent proportioned to the vexation and expense is the instruction moral and intellectual thus spread over the community but in regard to the vexation the quantity is much more palpable than of the quantity of instruction reaped the existence will be certain of these several quantities any estimate approaching to adequate correctness is impossible unless the political state in question is given the pecuniary sufficiency of the individual the state of the communications being given and the length of attendance being given the quantity of the vexation will depend upon the length of the journey to and fro that is on the distance between the abode of each individual and the judicatory but the political state in question being given the average of this distance will be inversely as the number of those judicial subdistricts or portions of territory resulting from an ulterior division thereupon comes a question—shall these assessors be taken from every part of a subdistrict without distinction or from a portion no part of which is by more than a certain length remote from the judicatory if without distinction then comes inordinate vexation to those whose habitation is to a certain degree remote if with distinction in consequence of which to those beyond the line an exemption is granted then is the population of the subdistrict divided into two portions the one of which is left in a sort of barbarous state in comparison of the other on an occasion such as this a middle course might perhaps be taken not without advantage in the remote parts the times of service might be less frequent than in the near part the vexation however is in this case not done away with only lessened and the instruction is in the same proportion lessened increase the number of those subdistricts with those judicatories—this vexation is indeed lessened but the expense to the public is increased under the division into subdistricts shall there be any subordinate division—a division of those subdistricts into bissubdistricts answer for the purposes of judicature no the extraordinary case of an appeal to the justice minister will answer every good purpose of a greater number and put an exclusion upon all the bad effects in the case of assessorship service the time of demurrage it may be observed will naturally be considerably longer than the time of election service for the election service it may happen to be performed within the first minute and the time requisite for receiving the vote by dropping two recognized pieces of card into a box can never for all the votes taken together be extended beyond the bounds of a single day the expense of the assessor while in waiting—shall it be borne by the individual or by the public on the individual the burthen would be intolerable and needless by the whole public the benefit is reaped by the whole public ought the whole burthen to be borne for functionaries of this class taken separately the pay necessary will be to the lowest amount nothing is there that could render it worth regard but the number of those whose services are thus put into requisition the bulk of the population being in almost every country composed of the lowest paid daylabourers it will be composed of those to whom any casual deduction from the means of subsistence would be most irksome and be most difficult of endurance the pay should therefore be some what greater than that of the lowest paid daylabourer say for example twice as much thus much for the assessors taken from the more numerous class in the case of the assessors taken from the more erudite class the quantum it should seem should not be exceeded by no addition that could be made to it could any degree of proportionality—of equality be maintained on the plea of increase it would require to increase with the amount of income but to this mode of increase the objection seems a peremptory one publication of income would in general be irksome nor could any correctness be given to the fixation without such as inquiry as would be the equivalent of a lawsuit nor to the more numerous class would any such gradation appear consistent with justice in comparison with that of the more numerous class the condition of those members of the more erudite class would on the     face of the account he seen to be in the same proportion more prosperous—the general mass of benefit derived from the government so much the greater and proportioned to the benefit should therefore be the burthen or justice and equality are obviously contravened were the pay of an assessor ever so much greater than it is proposed to be still it could not be in the instance of every individual in every conjuncture an equivalent for the attendant vexation here then may be seen a reason for the permission of a substitute in the room of any person on whom the lot has fallen—a substitute on the condition that whatever be the qualification requisite in the case of the principal that which is requisite in the case of the substitute shall be the same namely as here proposed possession of the arts of reading and writing §   quasijury what the denominations quasijury and quasijury system are here necessitated by irresistible considerations by the word jury the nature and design of this portion of a judicatory some conception however inadequate is presented to view and a general prepossession in favour of it will naturally be produced at the same time if without some intimation given that the two objects how nearly soever related want much of being the same great would have been the confusion and perplexity introduced by the discrepancy between the denomination and the thing thus denominated the institution called a jury being the subject of such general applause—why on this occasion introduce not a jury but a quasijury not the thing itself but only an institution bearing more or less resemblance to it conceived in the most general terms the answer is—because with this resemblance how faint so ever—with this faint resemblance in addition to the other securities which have been seen for appropriate aptitude on the part of the judge all the good effects that have ever been looked for in a jury are produced free from all the evil effects—evil effects essential and unpreventable and to such a degree evil as to render the use of it altogether incompatible with a system of procedure having for its end the ends of justice inasmuch as it is in a high degree adverse to and the use of it incompatible with the attainment of every one of those ends what then have its effects been from first to last wheresover employed no other than so much pure evil answer on the contrary they have been productive as has been already shewn of inestimable good but in what manner—by this and this almost alone namely by the very opposition of the institution to the main end among the ends of justice that same main end being rectitude of decision exclusion of misdecision on looking to the several elements or features of appropriate aptitude it will be seen that in the aggregate jurors are essentially wanting for appropriate moral aptitude there being in a body of men so taken no security and in lieu of appropriate knowledge and judgment there being a constant certainty of the opposite inaptitude—of inaptitude absolutely considered and of inaptitude considered in comparison of the like quality in question on the part of the judge judication is a branch of art and science in the most unapt judge ever seen some proficiency in the art and science has been manifest on the part of those men who to be least unaptly selected must be selected at random selected by fortune not any the smallest security for any the least grain of any one of the elements of appropriate aptitude can be pointed out of the institution here proposed the object is to bring to pass with some addition whatever has been looked for at the hands of a jury if in any one state of society it be capable of answering its intended purpose so will it in every other for in the organization of it a state of society one at the lowest as well as one at the highest stages in the course of civilization has been all along kept in view taking up men from the most numerous class and placing them in a situation in which the business of life in all its forms will be brought before their eyes and a call made upon them for whatsoever exercise they are capable of giving to their intellectual powers—converting the judicial theatre into a school of justice into which men of all ranks are compelled to enter themselves—it tends with continual increase to give strength to the aggregate stock of intellectual power throughout the community and with continually augmented effect to render more and more apt those whom it finds least so at the same time giving no decisive effect to the expression of their sentiments it avoids altogether the exposing the welfare of the community to hazard from any illadvised or perverse exercise of power of which in that situation of life the will of men may be supposed susceptible they may advise anything they can give determination to nothing for anything which they are allowed to do or are at all likely to do no evil is there in any shape which the community is exposed to suffer while at their hands society is not exposed to evil in any shape—on the other hand by the part which it is given to them to act the quantity of evil which society would otherwise be exposed to suffer at the hands of the judge great as may be the influence which they are enabled to exercise—by no power given to     them can responsibility on the part of the judge experience any the slightest diminution on him in every instance of whatsoever is done the responsibility rests in all its undiminished weight the object has been to strew the way of the judge with such checks as while they afforded no impediment to him in the right and proper course would when taken all together be found to oppose an insuperable impediment to him as often as it could happen to him to make any such attempt as that of straying into any sinister course the course by which efficiency will thus be found to have been so perfectly established is as simple in its description as in its contrivance to the quasijury are given all the powers of judication—all the powers that are given to a judge with only one exception namely the effectively imperative function—the function to the exercise of which is attached the power of giving execution and effect to the will of him by whom it is possessed and this is the only one by which in any hands mischief can be done of themselves nothing can they cause to be done of themselves nothing can they so much as prevent from being done this power in the shape in which they possess it resembles in some degree what in mechanics is the power exercised by friction—it is like the drag upon the wheel §   quasijurors who and how chosen hitherto there has been unavoidably more or less of the fictitious in the idea attached to the appellation of committee or subcommittee of the public opinion tribunal the members being selfappointed not mutually present unless by accident and fluctuating but in the case of a jury everything said of such a subcommittee is or may be realized it is everywhere or may be and at any rate to fulfil the professed ends of it ought to be an exact sample of that unofficial judicatory although to the particular purpose in question officialized from this source may be deduced what ought to be the principal and characteristic features of this fragment of an official jury thus denominated—   stock from which the members are taken—for securing appropriate moral aptitude the whole of the male adults of the community unless for the better securing of appropriate intellectual aptitude it should be deemed advisable as in case of election of representatives to confine the capacity to those who have been found capable of undergoing a literary test object of this universality exclusion of aristocratical injustice   locator of these ephemeral judges—not choice but chance chance alone is sure to be impartial chance alone is incorruptible to place the choice in any human hand he be who he may is to lead him into needless and useless temptation—to infuse the poison of corruption into his veins by this means and by this alone as all danger so all suspense and apprehension of partiality stands excluded   being by supposition exempt from all corrupt interest the suffrages given by these unpermanently official judges may without inconvenience be covered with a veil of secresy having no particular and sinister profit to gain by injustice the course taken by each will be determined by his regard for that interest of his in which he has for sharers all the other members of the community—in a word for that interest which is in each case on the side of justice the eye of the public might in this case be even prejudicial to the cause of justice for in the public might be this or that individual by whose corruptive influence might be created in the breast of this or that juryman a particular and sinister interest by which would be dictated and produced a decision and correspondent suffrage opposite to the decision dictated by a regard for the rules of justice—and by reason of this opposition opposition to the universal interest §   expunction challenging—that is the partial dislocation of proposed jurors by a party—why not here employed answer—reasons   the vast aggregate body of vexation by the provision made to that effect vexation in extent and in intensity not inconsiderable   under the here proposed system no such demand for the provision has place as under the existing system in england the decision of the jury being in english practice obligatory on the judge in the here proposed practice—not   the decision not being obligatory the demand for exclusion has no place but the effect intended by exclusion is here produced to much greater extent without exclusion—namely by the questions which the parties on both sides are allowed to put to the several jurymen for the purpose of ascertaining the existence or nonexistence of a natural cause of partiality and thence the probability of the effect be the answers what they may the juryman is not inhibited from taking whatsoever part he feels disposed to take throughout the business from his answers the state of his mind in respect of partiality and impartiality is open to be collected in case of apparent cause of partiality it operates in diminution of the weight of his authority—just as in the case of evidence in diminution of the probative force of the testimony of the witness       by the omission of this institution no small mass of complication is discarded §   quasijury uses of in respect of scientific judicial and active aptitude it is here a sort of assumed postulate that a set of men taken at random from the body of the people can never be regarded as being by a great deal upon a par with an erudite and experienced official judge the use of any such assessor is therefore merely confined to the contributing to the securing of adequate appropriate moral aptitude on his part by the application of a check to the exercise of his powers in this capacity they are capable of serving and may reasonably be expected to serve independently of any degree of intellectual aptitude on their part and therefore with as low a degree of aptitude in that shape as ever can have place why the reason is because their persons being unknown to him the degree of aptitude actually possessed by them will be unknown to him they may every one of them for any assurance he can have be endowed with the very highest degree of appropriate aptitude in every shape what remains is to secure on their part as far as may be appropriate moral aptitude in the shape and degree requisite the first quality to be provided for is—original impartiality the next is uncorruption as to uncorruptibility this depends on the particular frame of mind on the part of each individual—a sort of fact in relation to which no adequate information can in the nature of the case be attainable what remains is—in presumption of corruptibility to throw such difficulties as can be thrown in the way of the sort of intercourse necessary to the production of the noxious effect without his putting himself in a considerable degree in the power of the person tempted no person can in any such case apply temptation to the probity of a quasijuryman the smaller and less certain the corruption derivable from success in the enterprise in question the less the probability of a mans exposing himself to such hazard of the body of assessors styled a quasijury the use is as has been seen to add to the mass of securities for appropriate aptitude on the part of the judge in this character its operation is mostly confined to the moral branch of that same aptitude to the degree of his appropriate intellectual and active aptitude it cannot be expected to make addition any otherwise than in so far as it contributes to call forth into action whatsoever stock of those desirable qualities it finds him in possession of to the power given to the body styled in englishbred law a jury these same uses and good effects are attributed and lest they should not be produced a certain portion of the power of this erudite functionary is taken from him and conferred on those unerudite functionaries if at their hands in comparison with him any superiority of appropriate aptitude is in any branch looked for it must be in the intellectual branch—to wit knowledge for example of the feelings of individuals whose condition is nearer to them than his together with such casual acquaintance as it may happen to them to possess of the particular circumstances of the individuals on whose cases they have to pronounce consideration had of the mass of securities provided of which the maximization of publicity and the effectual dislocability of all judges by the real representatives of the people are the chief—it will it is believed be sufficiently manifest that without either jury or even quasijury the securities for good judicature would be much more effectual than by anything that can be called a jury they ever have been made or ever can be anywhere but forasmuch as by the institution as here modified a substantial addition seemed capable of being rendered to the efficiency of these same securities this ingredient in the mass of appropriate arrangements could not consistently be withholden not to speak of the wishes and even expectations which on this head the publicopinion tribunal could not fail to entertain the comparatively slight particular above alluded to excepted only with a view to moral aptitude could any additional security be looked for at the hands of men so circumstanced the controul applied by a body of judicial functionaries to the conduct of the judge cannot be adequately effectual unless it applies to every step taken by him in the course of the suit from the commencement to the close such is that applied here in this code by the quasijury nothing approaching to it is that which is applied by the english jury in a large proportion of the whole number of suits that body has no place and among them are those which arise out of the most important cases and those which have place in by far the greatest number the most important—those to wit which give employment to the equity courts those which have place in by far the greatest number—those to wit which give employment to the smalldebt courts now as to the concomitancy of the controul of the jury with the operations of the judge out of an indefinite number of stages of operation it is confined to a single one called the trial but whatsoever would have     been the opinion and will of the jury had the suit throughout the whole course of it been open to their influence the judge may frustrate altogether visibly by operations concomitant or subsequent to the trial invisibly by operations anterior to it and upon the whole in each case by any one of a multitude of operations in cases styled penal the power of the jury is not quite so inefficient as in cases styled civil in cases styled civil the judge can in one way or other give success to the plaintiffs or to the defendants side at pleasure not exactly so in cases styled penal to the defendants side indeed he can insure success on any one of an infinite variety of devices not one of which bears any the slightest relation to the justice of the case not quite so easy is it to give success to the plaintiffs side—in other words to punish under the name of punishment the defendant for a crime which in the opinion of a jury he has not or would not have been regarded as having committed it can no otherwise be done than under accidental circumstances favourable to injustice in this shape for example by refusing the operations necessary to the obtainment of evidence by which if obtained a just acquittal would have been produced the primary use there is the forcing out of the mouth of the official judge grounds and reasons for the decision which it is his desire should have place fortunate is the state of things where the success of an operation is independent of the qualities of the individual operators in this case is this primary benefit attached to the institution of a jury for whatever reasons the conduct of the judge should be subject to inspection in any one part of the procedure—for the same reasons so ought it in every other for if by aberration from the course of justice it is in his power to produce misdecision or the collateral evils of needless delay vexation and expense in any one part so is it in any other admitting then that the use of a jury consists in its exercising and being seen to exercise the function of an inspector of the conduct of a judge the presence of this safeguard is useful not to say necessary from the very commencement of the procedure in the presence of the judge to the very end of it in the early days of jurytrial it seems not improbable that this undiscontinued inspection actually had place in the jurycourt as now in smalldebt courts commonly the same day not unfrequently the same hour which saw the commencement of a cause saw the termination of it the splitting of a cause into an indefinite number of parts with long intervals between part and part—the jury not being admitted to be present at more than one of those parts—and a contrivance by which the decision pronounced in their presence was overturned in their absence—all these improvements in the art of feegathering were so many subsequent amendments introduced by degrees had the ends of justice been the object the application made of this system of inspection would have been commensurate with the need of it but the ends of judicature were the augmentation of the emolument and the power of the judge hence the difference in the best judicatory that could be framed—to wit a singleseated judicatory—a judicatory in which a single judge presides whose situation is permanent and his functions exercised with open doors—there being no person in particular who had any claim for reasons or explanations for any of those statements by which a test of his appropriate aptitude in all its several branches is afforded—arbitrary power would find itself in a state of comparative case suppose a judge in any instance determined to pronounce a decision of the unjustness of which he is conscious what is the course that would be free for him to take after hearing what is offered to be said on both sides he will pronounce his decision no sufficient reason—the case by supposition not affording any—will be seen for it in this case will any loss of reputation be the consequence not by any means a certain consequence the prepossession which the power attached to the situation insures in favour of everything that is done in it is an assured protection and in a multitude of minds a constantly effectual one for the cognizance of a claim which must not exceed  0s the attendance of a numerous body of judges under the name of commissioners is not grudged of these commissioners the list being the same at all times still less need it be grudged for claims of forty hundred or forty thousand pounds the labour of attendance on the part of these inspecting judges being relieved by an indefinite frequency of change if by the now established number of    the extent given to this burden would be rendered too great scarcely can any reason be assigned why it should not be lessened          or even so few as   chosen upon a right principle would be preferable to    all chosen upon a wrong principle in comparison of the power possessed by a juryman whether under the english or the french system how small is the power here given to a quasijuryman is altogether obvious the quasijury all together not having any obligative power further than the enabling a party to appeal—silencing their interposition silencing the communication of their observations is the upshot of all that corruption can do in this case and unless in the cases where without such interposition the judge would go wrong while by the check     applied by it he will be restrained from going wrong and confined within the path of rectitude—in no shape would any advantage be to be gained by the production of any such corrupt silence of an institution beneficial upon the whole concomitant with the beneficial effects are always an infinite multitude of uninfluencing circumstances and though in less number obstacles or opposing causes on every occasion the great difficulty is to distinguish from each other these three classes of circumstances of the beneficial effects of the institution of a jury some apply alike to both branches of substantive law—the penal and the nonpenal others exclusively or more particularly to the penal those which apply alike to both branches may be stated to be as follows— the main and allcomprehensive beneficial effect produced by it in the several cases to which it applies is the bringing to bear upon the decision the power of the publicopinion tribunal—a power which in so far as it has place applies itself to the most despotic governments and diminishes more or less the evil which they have for their inseparable result this it does in three different ways—   one is through the medium of publicity the sort and degree of the publicity which it gives to that part of a suit to which it attaches itself and that part is the principal one the jury will form of themselves a committee of the publicopinion tribunal and from its several members the information respectively possessed by them radiates out of doors through so many circles of indefinite extent of which they are respectively the centres this being the most extensively favourite mode of judicature the habit of publicity inseparably attached to it has extended itself to the several other forms and sure it is that jurytrial has been a main security for the power of the publicopinion tribunal as applied to judicature true it is that from the earliest times of which any accounts remain to us a high degree of publicity has had place in judicature and in times anterior to those in which the institution of a limited number of assessors under the name of a jury appears to have been in use witness the county courts and the courts baron it is not therefore for its creation that the practice of publicity is indebted to jurytrial it is so however for its preservation and it forms accordingly the characteristic difference between englishbred law and romebred law this publicity with its advantages exists in a state independent of jurytrial it exists as we have seen where there is no jurytrial for example in the judicatories called equity courts and in the judicatories called ecclesiastical courts not to speak of the military courts in some instances in the account of beneficial effects this then it may be seen is distinct from that of the obligatory power possessed by the jury over the decision in all hitherto established instances and may accordingly have place without it   another way in which it brings to bear upon judicature this same tutelary power is by the obligation it imposes upon the permanentlyofficial and alldirecting judge to pay his court to these his transitory colleagues and submit to them and through them to the publicopinion tribunal at large in the form of reasons whatsoever considerations he regards as necessary to the engaging them to pronounce a decision conformable to his wishes in this way not only if the decision he wishes to give is unjust but the injustice of it is to a certain degree manifest exposure to public reproach is a consequence which it cannot be altogether in his power to exempt it from the exposure is in this case effected either by the utter absence of all attempt at exhibiting reasons or by what may be still better the weakness and absurdity of his reasons these good effects are it is manifest both of them altogether distinct from the powers exercised by the jury in respect to the nature and effect of the decision it is here accordingly meant to be preserved   another distinguishable mode in which the jury system in the form in which it is in use has been conducive to the ends of justice is the causing evidence to continue to be received in the best shape namely that in which it passes immediately from the lips of the relating witness to the ears of the judge and the surrounding auditory without being strained through the hands of professional or official instruments or both and then reduced to writing by them they being paid all of them at the rate of so much a word for extracting it neither is this feature inseparable in its nature from jury procedure neither in this instance is there anything in the nature of evidence on the one hand or of jury procedure on the other that renders it more difficult to receive evidence in this shape in any other sort of judicatory than in that of which a jury forms no part in relation to a fact open to dispute no judge no other ruling functionary that really wished to come at the truth ever thought of receiving evidence in any other shape than in the orally delivered shape whenever in this shape it was within reach witness all parliamentary inquiries witness every father of a family in his dealings with his children or his servants witness     the inquiries carried on on the occasion of those crimes by which the minds of individuals governors as well as governed are apprehensive of injury done to person or property but except in so far as the truth was regarded as conducive to the giving effect to his power or to that of him on whom he was dependent no functionary concerned in the framing of the rules of procedure does ever harbour any such wish as that of seeing the truth come to light or enabling his associates and successors to come at the truth their aim has uniformly been as it could not but be to extract out of the pockets of suitors money in the greatest quantity in which it could be so extracted the object was that in testimonial statements the quantity of falsehood should be maximized—that further proceedings and further writings for the exposure of it might be necessitated at the time when the course of procedure with jurors in it was settled and had assumed its form scribes for the purpose were wanting because the money to pay them had not yet come into existence as yet judges were unable to receive evidence in any other than the most apt shape but as the money came things were set to rights by written compounds of falsehood and nonsense which under the name of pleadings the parties were forced to utter and to pay for before the judges would suffer the matter to come before juries in the sort of judicatories in which the bench was not encumbered with any such appendage as a jury box judges found themselves in this respect at their ease if in the presence of each other and at the same time in the presence of the judge or judges by whom the fate of the suit was to be decided the parties were heard in the first instance the suit would in a great majority of cases be finished on that same sitting and in the other cases the speediest termination which the nature of the case admitted of would be brought to view by the exposition of the several facts but in such a state of things the pretence for official and professional extortion would have no place in a case where property was the subjectmatter of dispute it became therefore a fundamental maxim that in the presence of the judge or judges on whose decision the ultimate fate of the suit depended on no occasion were the parties to be suffered to meet in the presence of the judge the parties being unless by accident the individuals by whom the facts in the case were in the largest proportion known and in many cases the only individuals by whom any of those facts were known upon the whole then two things appear sufficiently plain one is that the receiving evidence in its best shape is a practice that has obtained in all cases in which a jury has been called in the other is that the receiving evidence in this shape is an operation altogether as easily performed where a jury is not employed as where it is as to the quasijury system the framer of it has nothing to get by any such mixture of absurdity and falsehood accordingly under the quasijury system the evidence is received in the shape most conducive to the ends of justice one great and peculiar value of this plan will be seen to be its flexibility—its selfflexibility with equal facility it will be seen applying itself to the most erudite and to the least erudite state of society it might be employed not only in a democracy but the most absolute despotism need not fear it whatever be the effect of its influence nothing can be more gentle and quiet nothing else so gentle as its mode of action in the quasijury box may be seen a school in which the scholars are serving an apprenticeship in the art of judicature and these scholars—in what number are they sooner or later they are the great majority of the whole number of those of whom the male population of the country is composed in england under the existing system every judge has an interest opposite to that of the people and under the here proposed system no judge has any other interest than that which coincides with that of the people by no interest can he be led to wish to inflict punishment on any man whom it could not be alike the interest and the wish of a jury to see punished under this system with what prospect of success could a judge pronounce a sentence or a conviction which in his own eyes were unjust altogether unavailing would any such act be except on the supposition of its passing without opposition through the censorship of the quasijury—and moreover finding a congeniality of guilt in the appellate judicatory for the act being in the eyes even of the agent itself flagrantly unjust is it possible that it should wear a more favourable aspect in the eyes of not only observers altogether impartial but of jurors leagued by a community of interest selfregarding and sympathetic with the supposed objects of the intended injury to these safeguards is moreover proposed to be added that of an established delay for the express purpose of giving time to all parties in any way interested to make application to the appellate judicatory suppose then a sentence or conviction decidedly unjust signed by the judgeimmediate what is the consequence before execution can be given to it the whole country rings with denunciations of the injustice     §   difference between jury and quasijury in the framing of the proposed quasijury the object has been as already stated to retain all the apt features of the jury institution to discard the unapt ones and to add such new features as seemed apt with reference to the ends of justice by apt understand with reference to the here proposed institution for one feature will be brought to view to which the beneficial effects of the jury system will it is believed be in great measure referable but from which if adopted into the here proposed institution no effects but evil ones could be produced between the jury system and the proposed quasijury system the principal difference lies in this by a jury powers are possessed and exercised such as to a great extent are decisive of the ultimate fate of the suit powers of acquittal for example in all criminal cases to a quasijury no such decisive power is allotted with the exception of an application which is not of the essence of the system a quasijury has no decisive power and in that case it is not ultimately decisive of this power the exercise consists in giving or withholding allowance to appeal from the immediate to the appellate judicatory in cases where if without this restriction the right of appeal were left to the defendant a very prominent load of certain vexation and expense would be imposed on prosecutors witnesses and jurymen—in cases where the instances of its being subservient to rectitude of decision would be rare in the extreme these cases are criminal ones in none of which appeal on application by a jury or otherwise is allowed by english law the reason of withholding from a quasijury the power possessed by a jury is this—under the proposed judicial system the prevalence of sinister interest on the minds of the judges is opposed by checks much more efficient it is believed than any which have been or can be opposed to it in the breasts of jurymen namely in the first place sinister interest—the great cause of moral inaptitude in the case of judges in the next place relative and comparative deficiency in respect of intellectual aptitude—a branch of appropropriate aptitude in which it is not in the nature of the case that these ephemeral functionaries should in general be able to compete with judges with the above exception the character possessed by the quasijury partakes more of that of a section of the public opinion tribunal than of that of a body of commissioned and official judicial functionaries that decisive and virtually negative power which is apt in a jury but which would be unapt in a quasijury being thus excepted the features to which the jury institution is indebted for its aptitude and which are here adopted and given to a quasijury will be found accidentally only not essentially belonging to it these are—  the end to which the institution of this fraction of a jury is manifestly and confessedly directed namely serving as a bridle to the power of the creature of the monarch—the judge   the publicity of the proceedings whereever this committee of the people at large makes its appearance   the task which their power imposes upon the judge—the task of giving a public and immediate explanation of the case with the reasons on which his expectation of seeing any course he would wish them to pursue pursued accordingly rests   the shape in which the evidence presented to this compound judicatory is always presented of all these four features no one can be assigned which in the nature of the case might not have place in a judicatory constituted in any other manner as well as in a judicatory of which a jury forms a part for publicity might have place in a singleseated and uncompounded judicatory as well as in that of a compound one so likewise might the evidence be given in the best shape the task of giving explanation and reasons to the auditory might be assigned to the judge so there were but an auditory no matter how composed but unless along with the task adequate motives were given for the performance of it the task might as well not be given these motives are not wanting in the case of a jury nor will they be found wanting in the case of a quasijury accidental as they are in their nature with reference to the use made of this fraction of a judicatory in englishbred procedure yet but for the establishment of this institution these vitally essential features would naturally have been as unknown in the english as they are in the judicial systems of most other countries but the point is scarcely relevant the proper question here is—not what has been nor what might have been but what ought to be §   collateral advantages or beneficial applicabilities two i its operation in the character of a school of justice ii the universality of its applicability—its fitness for being inserted into the judicial system under any form of government i as to its operation in the character of a school of justice compared with the jury system this character is not peculiar to the quasijury system   0 only in a degree but not on the whole is this character peculiar to it in this respect its advantages over the jury system are these—   the superior magnitude of the population drawn into this school under the here proposed system the subdistricts constituting the judicial districts of the immediate judicatory are more numerous than those from which under the english system juries are drawn for the avoidance of vexation and expense the number of members proposed to be given to a quasijury is indeed considerably inferior to that which has place under the jury system but the defalcation from this source is supposed not to be equal to the addition made from that other source   the greater probability of a superior degree of attention being given to the subjectmatter of the exercise in the quasijury school compared with the jury school in the jury school what is done is principally done by the scholars together in a body and though in their individual capacity there is nothing to hinder them neither is there anything to invite them to interpose in general the foreman or some other member naturally the foreman takes the lead and the giving an unreflecting assent is all that is done by the rest   the indiscriminating miscellaneousness of the composition in the case of the proposed quasijury compared with the sinister selection which in all places and at all times is capable of being made in the case of the jury   the condition of comparative freedom and unembarrassed capacity of attention in which in the case of a quasijury the minds of the members would be placed in comparison of the inward sense of responsibility and concomitant embarrassment which to a considerable extent may be apt to have place in the case of a jury where the fate of the suit and the conditions of the parties to it is dependent on the verdict in which they join particularly in the case where the eventual punishment rises to a certain pitch of severity and more especially where death enters into the composition of it   in the jury school the headmaster is a functionary whose lessons are by the nature of his situation kept in a state of perpetual opposition to the universal interest in the quasischool he is a functionary whose lessons are by the ties that have been brought to view kept in a state of continued conformity to that same only right and proper standard of rectitude ii now as to the universality of its applicability a popular government is the sort of government for the use of which it has been framed of its applicability its usefulness and capacity of being employed in such a government such proofs as have presented themselves have just been seen but governments there may be into which though altogether despotical the quasijury not only would be useful if admitted but might even stand as it should seem no mean chance of being admitted while by the absolute power which in cases of the highest importance the jury has over the result of the suit all chance of its admission may stand eventually excluded two ways there are by which disjunctively or conjunctively the reconciliation between the systems of evil and this instrument of good might be effected   the one is—the exclusion of this bridle on the powers of the judge from those suits on the occasion of which the opposition between the interests of the subject many and that of the ruling few is brought into exercise   the other is—the composition of it in such manner as to prevent it from thwarting the views of the compounders on the other hand what cannot be concealed is—that in a government the object of which is to keep or reduce the intellectual part of the mind of its subjects to the condition similar to that of the higher order of quadrupeds and at the same time the sensitive part to a worse condition no such institution as that proposed could stand any chance of being admitted the design of it would be too palpably adverse to the design of the government the government of british india may serve for an example   with the exception of the manyseated judicatories framed upon the westminsterhall model singleseated judicatories are secured by necessity a stronger power than choice   on behalf of the natives it has no aversion to security for persons to security for property nor even to increase of property so as the value of eastindia stock but more particularly so as eastindia patronage be not diminished   understanding that the increase of national wealth depends in no small degree upon the security of property as against unlicensed malefactors it has no objection to the most perfect degree of security for property against all depredation from which it derives no profit so as the maximum of all depredation out of which it sees a capacity of extracting profit for itself be secured to it   the power of authorizing appeal not being according to the here proposed plan extended beyond those offences which while they are most frequent inspire most terror to individuals would not give umbrage to government nor how beneficial soever is it an essential feature     a form of government not essentially different from that of the angloamerican united states but regarded as in a still higher degree conducive to the only proper ends of government is that for the use of which the institution in question was devised but if well adapted to the proposed form of government not less so would it be to that of the so happily established one under that government the jury with its absolute power has not the least tendency to become destructive but an effect which to a considerable extent it cannot but have is—the weakening it—the weakening it namely by the chances of escape which in the case of guiltiness it affords in the instance of the classes of crimes which while they are so pregnant with evil to the person and property of individuals are in so high a degree more frequent than all other crimes for the absolute power of a jury it has no use in that seat of popular government there are no attacks upon the liberty of the press or liberty of public discussion—no secret confederacies for producing changes in government—no conspiracies against government organized by government itself for a pretence for making oppression still more oppressive in that seat of frugality and equality there is no propensity among jurymen to favour those practices by which the revenue of government is diminished a united states jury has no government extortion or oppression to avenge proportioned to the defalcation from the public revenue by the success and increase of smuggling would be the injury to themselves the produce of the taxes is employed the whole of it in the service of all no part of it is put into the pockets of the imposers with reference therefore to any government having for its end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number its aptitude consists in its want of aptitude with reference to any government that has for its ultimate end in view the maximization of the happiness of those who share in it and for its mediate or at any rate its collateral end the minimization of the happiness of all who are subject to it §   jurisdiction question   why to the power of a quasijury give the same allcomprehensive extent over the field of law as to that of the judge in respect to the species of causes answer—reasons   because if on any part of the field of law a sufficient demand for that institution has place so has it in every other true it is that in the penal department especially those cases in which application is made of the highest punishment the demand is much more urgent than in the nonpenal department generally considered but as to the nonpenal department if in any part of it the institution be preponderately useful it rests with those by whom its title to allcomprehensiveness is disputed to say at what point its utility ceases and this will it is believed be found impossible   whoever it be to whom the institution of a jury on the footing on which it stands at present in england is an object of approbation—if the question were put to him what consideration that approbation has for its grounds his answer would probably be the operating as it does in the character of a check and bridle to the power of the judge but for this security against misdecision if any sufficient demand has place in any part of the nonpenal department of the field of law impracticable will be the endeavour to find any other part in which an equal demand has not place the incompetency of a jury under the english system in all causes of complexity has been already shown that incompetency being greatly enhanced by those features of deficiency the exclusion of the parties from the theatre of justice and the inability of a party on either side either to furnish his own relation in support of his own demand or to call upon the other party for his these deficiencies had their origin in the artifices of the judges and other lawyers in the saxon time and for a long time afterwards the cast of the system was altogether popular the locatee of the king presided but the judges were all who were not in a state of slavery in a judicial assembly in which when all nonparties were present so of course would be all parties in so far as it was in their power each would be eager to tell his own story—each would be no less eager to extract matter of the like tendency from his adversary in this way the same meeting that gave commencement to a suit would commonly give termination to it so it is at this day in those judicatories which are permitted to have existence for the recovery of small debts and in those days scarcely were any suits known that would not nowadays be regarded as smalldebt causes such a state of things was too favourable to justice to be endured by lawyers in those days the judicial districts were small and in the same proportion numerous after the norman conquest judicatories were established by the king each of them having for certain purposes jurisdiction over the whole kingdom the whole kingdom was in this way converted into one vast judicial district—the communication at the same time difficult to a degree at present not easily imagined and by the barbarity of the times insecurity was added to difficulty under these circumstances few but would find their convenience     in being permitted to attend and plead by deputy under the name of attorneys and serjeants a set of professional lawyers was thus formed who became partners in the sinister interest of the judges by whom the system of procedure was framed and it was out of the order of serjeants that men were taken to fill the judicial benches in this state of things the carrying to the highest pitch the aggregate mass of delay vexation and expense became of course the ruling object of the partnership in all its branches expense for the sake of the profit extracted out of it delay and vexation for the sake of the addition which those evils made to the expense a lawbook written in the time of henry the second is to this point very satisfactorily instructive it had for its author no less a man than the chief justiciary glanville the head man of the law in profession it covers the whole field of judicature it is occupied almost exclusively with forms of excuses for nonappearance these excuses were already reduced to a system of the different species of causes as determined by the nature of the service demanded scarcely is anything to be found as little of any stages through which the business of judicature had to pass an obvious inference—and it seems an incontrovertible one—is that when once the parties were brought together in face of each other and of the judge the matter was as good as settled it was settled as in our day a tradesmans demand of payment for a few shillings worth of goods is here and there in a small corner of the country allowed to be settled for both these deficiencies romebred law presented a readymade supply to jurymen called from all parts of the kingdom—in some cases to the metropolis in others to the evervarying residence of the monarch—called from all parts and consequently in a large proportion from parts at the remotest distance from their respective homes—the attendance of a few days sufficed to constitute an enormous burthen those by whom romebred law was imported from rome to england required not in their judicatories any such incumbrance as a jurybox provided with a quantity of readymade power they knew well how to fill up any vacuity that could be imagined sitting without intermission with hands open for fees and ready to close upon them at whatever time and season offered no causes could be too complex for them at one grasp they took possession of the whole mass of moveable property throughout the country as it became vacant by the death of the respective owners object they had no other than the application of it to pious uses but of all imaginable uses none could be more pious than their own the policy of the learned fraternity as above had kept the suitors out of the only place in which they could either deliver or extract from others vivâ voce evidence glad of course would they have been to have extracted it in the written shape for when words are once designated by visible and permanent signs they became capable of being taxed but in this form for several centuries they were not able to extract them the original structure of this judicial system had not furnished machinery adapted to this purpose small was as yet the number to whom it could be applied meantime their learned rivals and competitors were on the watch no sooner was the supply of writing found sufficient than they stept in and applied it to their use to all who had anything to ask of them those judicatories were open they received petitions furnished persons who after telling their story upon paper were ready to give expression to them with such questions as a person might wish to receive answers to from those at whose hands he demanded them and applied the whole force of their authority in exacting those answers without which the questions would have been of no use question   why in each suit seek to render the authority of the quasijury coextensive with that of the judge answer—reasons   for a reason similar to that mentioned in answer to question   if in any one stage requisite so in every other in each stage the demand is the same as in every other in each stage the temptations to which the probity of the judge stands exposed are the same   to the unobligativeness of the authority here given to the jury are the interests of justice indebted for the practicability of giving this extension to the application made of this check from the absolute power of frustrating the exercise of the power of the judge and this in every one of the numerous stages which a cause in a certain degree complex must of necessity go through a mass of confusion and thence of injustice beyond all power of calculation might be the results but forasmuch as with the exception of the power of allowing or disallowing appeal in certain criminal cases no obligatory power is here given to this section of the publicopinion tribunal—in a word no functions other than the auditive interrogative and censorial functions—hence it is that from the magnitude of the extent given to its authority over the whole course of the suit in the way to its conclusion no such nor any other evil can arise in the english system whatever be the number of sittings in the course of which on some occasion or other a suit comes upon the carpet—some of those sittings being in public others in the closet of the judge or of     this or that one of his subordinates—only in one of those sittings is a jury introduced question   why is not the authority of the quasijury here extended to summary sittings nor thence to any summary suits answer—reason   apprehension of the extent of the demand for individuals to act as quasijurymen were such extension given and thence of the mass of attendant vexation and expense in the case of appointed suits heard at the appointed sittings measures can all along be taken namely in the preparatory summary sittings and hearings of the quantity of quasijury time necessary to be applied and of the appointed days the place in the calendar may be fixed and in so far as the judgeprincipals have power insufficient judgedeputies provided accordingly not so in the case of the summary suits the power of the judge is not by this omission left without check in the first place remains the check imposed by the body of visitors for the maximization of which arrangements have been made elsewhere in the next place comes the power of appeal here provided this appeal is not from the judicatory of a subordinate to a superordinate judicatory but from one judge to another or even the same judge at another time at which other time the quasijury will form a part of the judicatory and thus the delay and expense attached to local distances will not be incurred whether on the second and more deliberate hearing the judge shall be the same or a different one must it should seem of necessity be left to the discretion of the judge if at the summary sitting the judge was a judgedepute permanent the natural course would be that at the appointed sitting it should be the judgeprincipal the opposite course would be a sort of anticlimax but it is only by necessity that the judgeprincipal stands excused from serving on the summary as well as on the appointed sittings and so far as he does thus serve the appeal thus made must be either to his virtually subordinate substitute or to himself in the appeal ab eodem ad eundem there is not in this case either absurdity danger to justice or even innovation in english equity procedure what is called a rehearing is no uncommon incident true it is that in one case of a rehearing the appeal is in effect and fact from the first judge to a different one this case is that where a change in the situation of chancellor having taken place the appeal is from the former chancellor to his successor but another case of a rehearing is where at the instance of a party the same chancellor hears a second time arguments on the same subjectmatter as on the first in this case there is no fraud all is what it seems to be the fraud is where the appeal is from the chancellor himself to a judicatory of which he is not only a member but the only thinking one—a judicatory in which on ordinary occasions none attend except two cyphers who vote as they see him vote without the pretence of thinking on other occasions none attend but the few sent thither by some latent interest which if made apparent would show them to be each of them judge in his own cause but says somebody you in whose eyes these same individuals are not unapt to bear a prominent part in the business of legislation on even an unbounded scale—can you with any consistency regard them as unapt with regard to a function so limited in its extent so subordinate in its importance as that of pronouncing a yes or no in a case where nothing more is at stake than the fate of this or that individual answer   in regard to the power i give to them—it is under the pressure of necessity that i give it to them because in no other hands could it be reposed without the absolute certainty of its being abused   in the case of the power given to them as to the choice of legislators in no instance whatever is any power of legislation given to them i leave them—as according to all experience i may without danger leave them—to be assisted and in as far as they please guided by general reputation no opinion no judgment of their own are they in that case called upon to pronounce but in this case no judgment can any one of them pronounce which is not his own no less direct and complete is the cognizance taken of the matter in their situation than in his situation is that of the judge in the forming of it no assistance have they that so much as professes to be impartial other than that of the judge—of that very functionary to whose power the one and sole use of them is to apply a check—and under whose guidance in so far as without forming in relation to the matter in question an opinion of their own they commit themselves their function is inefficient and useless §   interrogative function persons to whom with a view to the ends of judicature any member of the quasijury is authorized to address questions are in general all other actors on the judicial theatre in particular they are as follows—   any party to the suit on either side to wit whether in his quality of party interested or in his quality of party testifying—or in other words litigant witness   any extraneous witness   any assistant nonprofessional or professional of any party on either side   the pursuergeneral or any depute of his if present whether by office engaged in the particular suit in question or not       the defendergeneral or any depute of his whether by office engaged in the particular suit in question or not   the registrar or his deputy   any fellowmember of the same quasijury   the officiating judge whether principal or depute correspondent to the interrogative function on the one part is the responsive function or service on the other of an exercise of the interrogative function on the one part the object is to produce an exercise of the responsive function on the other to render obligatory the exercise of the correspondent responsive function the following are the qualities which must have place on the part of the discourse uttered in the exercise of the interrogative function—   it must be relevant it must bear some assignable relation to the matter in question   it must be apt it must be such that an answer given to it may be eventually in some way or other conducive to the ends of judicature it must not be frivolous if being neither irrelevant nor otherwise unapt the interrogation addressed is followed by relevant and apt responsion it is well if being addressed to a person other than the officiating judge and being in his eyes relevant and apt such responsion as in his judgment is relevant and apt fails of being given to it—the judge will apply his power to the exaction of such answer according to the situation of the noncomplying individual if it be a party he will give him to understand that of noncompliance the effect may be the loss of the suit that is to say if it be on the pursuers side the nonperformance in the whole or any part of the service demanded by the suit if on the defenders side the rendering of such service in the whole or in part in so far as the rendering it will be at the expense of the noncomplier and such accordingly in the case of necessity is the arrangement that may be made if it be an assistant professional or unprofessional of a party and in the declared opinion of the judge such noncompliance has for its cause especially if it be in concert with the party the endeavour to save a party he being in the wrong from loss of suit as above intimation may be made to him that in relation to the interest of the party in the suit such noncompliance will have the same effect as if it had been by the party himself that it had been manifested and such accordingly in case of necessity is the arrangement that may be made if it be a pursuergeneral or defendergeneral or the registrar or their deputes respectively the judge will cause make a minute in terminis of such discourse as by the several persons who took part in it was employed which minute will constitute an article in the incidental complaint book so if it be a fellowmember of the quasijury so if it be the officiating judge §  0 opinative function the judges recapitulatory statement opinative decree and imperative decree having been delivered—thereupon comes the quasijurys function—the opinative function having for its subjectmatter the two abovementioned decrees of the judge of this function the exercise is in the nature of the case susceptible of any one of the following shapes and in any one of these shapes they are equally free to exercise it—   express refusal to pronounce any opinion   consent to the whole tacitly given   consent to the whole expressly given   dissent to the whole expressly given but without proposal of substitute or amendment   dissent to a part expressly given but without proposal of amendment   dissent to the whole with proposal of substitute   dissent to a part with proposal of amendment the opinion of the quasijury being in one or other of these shapes made known entry is accordingly made on the record by the registrar stating the shape in which it was so made known silence after presentation of all these several shapes to their option and a sufficient pause for the expression of it—silence being taken for tacit and universal consent if to the whole or to a part any substitute or amendment is proposed the judge either assents to it and changes or amends his decree or decrees accordingly or declines doing so in either case entry accordingly is made on the record in the three firstmentioned cases—namely express refusal to pronounce opinion consent tacit and consent express—execution in virtue of and conformity to the judges imperative decree unless appeal be made follows of course in the four lastmentioned cases unless appeal be made it rests with the judge to cause execution to have place if appeal be made it takes its course in these four cases as it would have done in any of the three first as to the appeal in what cases it shall and in what cases it shall not have the effect of obliging the judgeimmediate to stay execution will be found determined regard being had to the several particular cases in the penal and nonpenal codes if from noncompliance with any substitution     or amendment proposed by a quasijury irreparable damage will ensue while from compliance equiponderant damage will not ensue—the judge will in this case regard himself as bound to make exercise of his suspensive or say executionstaying function to that effect only in the case of its being the act of the quasijury in its collective capacity can entry be made of dissent in any one of its four shapes as above but the act of the majority of the jury is the act of the jury—of the jury in its collective capacity to a minority of the jury on this occasion as to all persons on all other occasions the press is open for the reception of the free expression of their sentiments on being thereto requested by the quasijury the pursuergeneral present is expected to lend his assistance to the purpose of giving apt form to any such proposed substituted decree or amendment as above so the defendergeneral under the dominion of unwritten law called also jurisprudential law the question of law to be determined is—what on the individual occasion in question are those terms of the law which in default of all relevant law made by the legislature may with most propriety as if it had been made by the legislator be made by the judge—as being most analogous to the tenor of the rule of action which has place in the political community in question—statute law and jurisprudential law taken together the question of fact is either an absolute question or a comparative question a comparative question is a question concerning degree an absolute question of fact is every question in which the consideration of degree has no part degrees are either degrees of quantity or degrees of quality degrees of quantity are no otherwise determinably expressive in any absolute form than by numbers every absolute question of fact may without regard to quantity be so worded as to be susceptible of a true answer either by a yes or a no a question concerning quantity admits of as many answers as there are degrees in the scale in question numbers or series of numbers contained in it of which it is assumed that on the occasion in question some one or other is the proper a question the answer to which is either guilty or not guilty is a question concerning law and fact combined in the answer expressed by the word guilty two assertions are contained namely—  the individual in question at the time and place in question or at any rate at some time and place did perform a certain act positive or negative   the act performed is of the number of those which stand interdicted by some portion of law namely legislatorially existing law or by the judge in question may and ought to be considered as interdicted by a portion of imaginary law to be made by him for the purpose examples of scale of quantities—  money as where a fixation is to be made of the sum to be transferred from a defendant to a pursuer in compensation for loss or injury or from defendant to the public in the name of punishment   time as when in case of chronical punishment a fixation is to be made of the length of time during which it shall continue say banishment confinement imprisonment §    warrant for appeal if to a set of men thus composed any determinately efficient power be fit to be given a case in which it may be of use to give it is the giving admission to the faculty of appeal divested of the inconveniences naturally attached to it in those criminal cases in which if left at the option of the defendant it would be sure to be made by all who were guilty and in so far produce much vexation to the injured without benefit to the criminal among these are such as are at the same time of the most mischievous kind and the most frequent occurrence in particular offences of the predatory kind when committed by habitual and as it were professed depredators especially if accompanied with homicide housebreaking or personal violence or menace in a case of this sort appeal if allowed will come in a manner of course it will come for the sake of the delay applied to the punishment and the chance which all delay affords or appears to afford of ultimate escape but by every appeal suffering is by the innocent and injured almost constantly experienced under the worst system in existence the instances in which a person really innocent is condemned and in consequence of condemnation actually made to suffer punishment are probably comparatively speaking very rare rare even under the system of secret procedure acted upon in despotic states still more rare under the system of publicity which has place in england and elsewhere under englishbred law under the here proposed system with such checks as are here applied to the purpose of securing moral aptitude on the part of the judge they may it is hoped be reasonably expected to be still more so at the same time a state of things in which it lies in the absolute power of a single person in the situation of judge even with his moral aptitude thus checked and guarded to subject a human being perhaps innocent to the extremity of allowed punishment is a state of things which to a human mind cannot but present considerable alarm     but the state of things in which claims of this sort are not only so probable but so extensively felt is a state of things which under a system of which the present proposed code forms a part would scarcely in any instance have place this state of things is one in which punishment in its nature absolutely irreparable is lavished either with the most savage and deliberate cruelty or with the most thoughtless extravagance there is but one mode of punishment the mischief of which is absolute and totally irreparable—and that is mortal punishment for arguments sake instead of mortal punishment suppose even mutilation employed—mutilation even in parts or organs more than one not altogether unsusceptible of reparation would even this punishment be for for suffering in this shape reparation and to a very wide extent is almost everywhere actually in use witness this in the pensions granted in the sea or military service and it is a matter generally understood that by the individuals by whom on this account reparation in this shape and degree is received it is not unusually regarded as adequate insomuch that if asked whether for the same reparation they would originally have been content or would now if it were to do over again be content to be subjected to the same suffering the answer would be in the affirmative the temperament here proposed is accordingly that in such instances in regard to those criminal cases of the higher order which are of the highest degree of frequency appeal should not in general be admitted but that on a certificate given either by an entire quasijury or by a portion of it or say perhaps in some cases even by a single quasijuryman that in his opinion innocence is certain or culpability doubtful appeal should be allowed to be made of an arrangement of this sort one effect it cannot be denied would be the putting it in the power of a criminal by means of a bribe given to a quasijuryman or to the number of quasijurymen in question to obtain a certain quantity of delay in the execution of the sentence of appeal in highly criminal cases in general what shall be the effect the appellate judicatory—shall it pronounce its decree upon the bare view of the evidence as reported from the immediate judicatory—shall it of course try the cause over again by hearing evidence as if none had before been given—or shall it have the option between the reported evidence and the giving a fresh hearing to the evidence on the choice between these three courses it is manifest how much would depend and how considerable between them respectively might be the difference in point of effect so likewise as to the nature of the offence—whether it has or has not anything in it of a constitutional character §    costs of quasitrial of the quasijury the expense taken in all its parts is very considerable it is composed of the evils correspondent and opposite to the collateral ends of judicature namely delay vexation and useless expense this considered two consequences follow—   one is that when in the judgment of those who have any interest in the suit this check with its expense is needless the expense ought not to be incurred   another is that in so far as the evil consisting of the expense is preponderant over the good consisting in the security neither in this case ought it to be employed hence a proposition which may naturally enough appear incontrovertible at first sight is that if no one of the parties conceive himself to have any ground of complaint against the conduct of the experienced judge there can be no use whatever in clogging the operation by a multitude more or less considerable of unexperienced ones if to the justice of these observations there be anything to oppose it must be on this ground or some such ground as this—namely that by reason of the relative ignorance and inexperience of a party it may happen that though the conduct of the judge has been unapt and that to such a degree as to have been productive of misdecision to the injury of the party in question yet by reason of his own relative inaptitude it may be out of his power to determine whether in that same conduct there has been or has not been anything unapt or else that by timidity—by fear of incurring the resentment either of the judge in question or of the class of men to which the judge belongs he may be effectually prevented from availing himself of any such security as that in question supposing it here to have given him the faculty of employing it or lastly that by indigence it may happen to him to be incapable of making use of it to the order for quasitrial the judge adds in relation to the expected costs thereof such order as the nature of the case—consideration had of the pecuniary circumstances of the several parties—appears to him to require the options are as follows—   he leaves the burthen of costs in its natural seat leaving it to each party to bear his own part of it   in case of need he requires a party or parties on one side to make advance of money on this account in any proportion in favour of a party or parties on the other his care will be not to suffer the additional delay vexation and expense to be employed     by the party who can best endure it as an instrument for the oppression of one who can least endure it §    features in jurytrial here discarded first come the features of jury procedure and under the head of each of them the opposite state of things here will be briefly undernoted these may be distinguished into such as are regarded as being productive of evils opposite to rectitude of decision the main end of justice—and such as are regarded as productive of evils opposite to the collateral ends of justice namely needless delay vexation and expense   in a jury number of persons twelve in a quasijury not more than three   of a jury on failure of instantaneous agreement forced transference to a closed room no other persons present at their deliberation of a quasijury no such transference unless they desire it or one of them desires it   in the case of a jury immediately before the commencement of the hearing—a solemn promise exacted of each to declare an opinion on one side of the question whatever it be or on the other side on the part of a quasijury no such promise is exacted or received note that on every question in relation to an opinion and that which is in contradiction to it the possible states of the mind are three namely decision on the affirmative side decision on the negative side and indecision and of this last state the exemplification will be the more frequent the less the degree of instruction is on the part of those to whom the question is put as for example speaking of an individual in the character of defendant in a penal suit questions no more than two is he guilty—or is he not guilty answers which the nature of the case admits of three namely guilty i e my opinion is that he is guilty—not guilty i e my opinion is that he is not guilty or i have not been able to form an opinion whether he is guilty or not of the real state of the mans mind one or other of these answers cannot fail to be the true expression the true one will be this third state as often as the same opinion fails of being entertained by all of them unless a decided disagreement has place—one or more entertaining the positive opinion the other or others the negative but for this absence of all opinion frequent as it cannot but be the law has not provided any expression the consequence is that in the instance of every one of the jurors who has found himself unable to form a decided opinion on either of the two opposite sides the promise which the law has forced him to make is violated to the conception of the founders of roman law this natural state of the mind had presented itself a form of words namely non liquet had accordingly been provided by them for the expression of it but obvious as is the conception on the part of the founders of english law in this particular the state of mind was too barbarous to admit of it no distinction did they know of between decision and indecision as little perceptible to them was the distinction between unconscious and selfconscious misdecision—between blameless error and intentional injustice supposing the decision erroneous the conclusion was that those who joined in it could not but be conscious of its being so accordingly by the verdict of a second jury to punish the first jury with one and the same punishment in every case and that a punishment involving utter ruin was a practice as common as that of simply sending the original suit to a second jury is at present   a declaration of an opinion on the one or on the other of the opposite sides of every question except in the case of a special verdict—which declaration is consequently—on the part of every one whose opinion fails of being exactly the very opinion declared as and for the opinion of the whole—false and the correspondent promise violated in cases styled civil a verdict styled special is admitted but in cases styled criminal not to speak of those styled civil no such verdict can without the concurrence of the judge be admitted and in this case too of a special verdict the same declaration of unanimity as in the case of a general verdict is indispensable in speaking of the verdict of a jury the language universally employed is as often as any such difference of opinion has place undeniably false what is said is that it is unanimous that is to say that they are all of one mind to render the expression true it would be necessary to substitute to the word unanimous some such word as univocal all of one voice—all joining in the voice of the foreman where as for example in a case called criminal the words he pronounces are guilty or not guilty in the case of a quasijury no such univocality is exacted   to the promise thus made—the promise made by every man that his opinion shall be the same as that declared by the foreman is attached a religious ceremony by which it is converted into an oath the ceremony consists in a mans saying so help me god and thereupon kissing a book which for this purpose has been put into his hand the promise having been thus converted into what is called an oath though with more propriety it might be called a vow     every violation of it is thereby converted into an act of perjury in the case of a quasijury no oath is administered no perjury therefore can have place   in case of disagreement confinement inflicted on all until a universal declaration of agreement has been produced on the part of every one of them confinement accompanied with circumstances of unendurable and consequently never endured affliction such as convert it into torture torturemaster the judge the torture being continued till they all join in declaring an opinion dictated by him or in his default any one of the jury—until they all join in that one of the two decisions which is dictated by him if the verdict they come out with is not agreeable to the judge he sends them back again till they are agreed and this he does as often as he pleases of late the functions of torturemaster in this way have not frequently been performed by the judges but there is nothing to hinder it and it may be administered for any length of time whether this function be or be not administered by the judges it may on any occasion be administered by any one of the jurymen to all the rest the ceremony is to make every one of them keep his promise the torture is to make some of them break it the torture has always been more powerful than the ceremony so plainly irresistible is the possible amount of it that the actual scarcely ever amounts to anything more than a comparatively slight temporary uneasiness thus it is that for making eleven good men and true for such is their appellation perjure themselves the equivalent of the prick of a pin suffices in the case of the quasijury production of perjury being no part of the danger neither in that shape nor in any other—neither by the judge nor by a quasijuror is any such function as that of a torturemasters allowed to be exercised   concealment of what passes—concealment from all but the patients while the torture is at work the time is supposed to be passed in deliberation but for this supposition however the nature of the case furnishes not any apparently strong ground if the contest were a contest between understanding and understanding yes but the understanding has nothing to do in the business the contest is between will and will the question is who is likely to endure the inconvenience for whoever it be by whom it is longest endured by that one are the terms of the verdict determined the victory is to him by whom the part of an obstinate man is acted with the most success to the arguments urged by professional advocates on the part which he espouses it is not likely that under such circumstances any material and efficient addition should be made by him whose determination is to conquer or die in the case of the quasijury of course no such concealment can have place   responsibility to the power of the legal sanction excluded altogether punibility none a quasijuror is in case of selfconscious delinquency punishable   responsibility to the publicopinion tribunal if not excluded altogether minimized nothing but the bare verdict guilty or not guilty being exposed to the public eye the grounds of it being thus covered by impenetrable darkness what blame can under such circumstances be passed is in the instance of each one reduced to next to nothing by the multitude of those amongst whom it is shared could but the light of publicity by some such power as that of the devil upon two sticks be regularly thrown upon the business of this wellclosed theatre the scenes that would be exhibited would be such as would be enough to dry up the stream of eloquence now so perpetually poured forth upon this matchless fruit of the wisdom of english ancestors this however is physically impossible laid open indeed to the public might everything be that passed but the scenes which in that case would be exhibited would have little resemblance to those which have place among a set of men in whose instance the sense of common distress and common weakness could scarcely fail to be productive of mutual indulgence and prudential silence out of a school thus circumstanced tales of ridicule are in little danger of being told in the case of a quasijury in the instance of any one of its three members to whose mind an observation which he is desirous of communicating to his colleagues has presented itself—if it be the pleasure of the others to hear him they retire for that purpose in the judicatory itself they cannot continue because that would be incompatible with ulterior business a retiring room is provided for them and as to the giving admission to such other persons as the room will hold the difference between the giving and withholding it does not present itself as being of much importance chapter xxvii recapitulatory examination or quasitrial in certain cases superadded to the usual examination of the evidence is another styled a recapitulatory examination in which cases the preceding examination is for distinctions     sake styled the original examination synonymous to recapitulatory examination is quasitrial as being before a quasijury at the recapitulatory examination whatsoever evidence was received in the course of the original examination at one or any greater number of sittings and hearings is received a second time and if possible altogether at one and the same sitting no adjournment being made unless at that sitting the time capable of being employed at one sitting be exhausted at the recapitulatory examination no evidence is received which was not received at the original examination at the recapitulatory examination the question of law may at the desire of a party on either side be reconsidered the original examination was performed by a judge acting singly no recapitulatory examination is performed except before a quasijury the judge has them for assessors to bring the suit under the cognizance of this section of the publicopinion tribunal is one principal purpose of this second examination exceptions excepted by what judge soever whether principal or depute the original examination was performed so may the recapitulatory the cases in which a recapitulatory examination has place are the following—   where for his own satisfaction or that of the public the judge himself desires it for his own satisfaction to wit that the several portions of evidence which had been received on the original examination may be reexhibited confronted compared and reconsidered   where on either side any party is desirous that it should have place in certain cases consideration had of the necessary severity of the punishment and the probable helplessness of the class of persons most liable to be exposed to it the law for the better security of the defendant requires the check of a quasijury to be applied to the power of a judge when the original examination has been gone through it will rest with the judge either to pronounce the definitive opinative decree or to appoint a recapitulatory examination adding in this case the day on which and the judge by whom it shall be performed the opinative decree pronounced together with the imperative decree grounded on it—it will rest with parties on both sides either to acquiesce in it or to make requisition for a recapitulatory examination which examination will at the requisition of any party be accordingly performed unless preponderant evil in any shape shall have been shown as resulting from it for example intolerable expense to any party or in consequence of the delay a loss of evidence a requisition for this purpose differs from an appeal in the ordinary sense of the word no otherwise than in this namely that it may be from the judge in question at one time to the same judge at another time and by this quasiappeal the expense delay and vexation produced by the transference of parties and evidence to another and commonly more distant judicatory is here saved if appointment made of the recapitulatory examination be on the part of the judge spontaneous it will be desirable if the other business of the judicatory permit that the judge by whom it comes to be performed should be the judge by whom the original examination was performed by the recollection of the lights afforded by the original examination especially in respect of consistency and inconsistency as between the testimony given by a witness on the one occasion and the testimony given on the other occasion by that same individual additional clearness correctness and completeness may frequently be given by the conception formed on the later occasion by the judge when by the judge no recapitulatory examination is desired he so declares and thereupon pronounces his definitive decrees puting it at the same time to each of the several parties whether it be his desire to have such examination or not if of any one of them the answer be forthwith in the affirmative a day and hour are thereupon appointed if by any one time for consideration is requested a day and hour are appointed for the answer and in the event of its being in the affirmative the appointment of day and hour for the quasitrial remains till such answer is given the decrees are declared provisional when the answer is given in the negative they are declared peremptory if it be at the requisition of a party it may be matter of doubt and discussion whether on the latter occasion it be better that the judge be the same or a different one to set against the advantages of identity as above there may in this case be the disadvantage resulting from mutual dissatisfaction as between party and judge the danger lest from the dissatisfaction testified by the requisition displeasure with correspondent partiality be produced in the mind of the judge to obviate uneasiness on this score as far as may be will of course be among the objects of his solicitude antecedently to this examination to obviate useless delay vexation and expense the judge will call upon the parties on both sides to admit all such relevant facts in respect of which no sincere doubt can have place anywhere giving them to understand   0 that of all delay vexation and expense produced by insisting on the reexhibition or exhibition of evidence of a matter of fact in relation to which no sincere doubt can have place the burthen will be made to fall on the head of him or them by whom the evil in this same shape has been produced and that for any such insincerity over and above the burthen of making compensation punishment under the name of punishment may whenever the occasion calls for it eventually be inflicted the recapitulatory examination may have either or both of two purposes—namely   deriving additional instruction out of the mass of evidence   exposing the conduct of the judge to scrutiny and comment at the hands of the committee of the publicopinion tribunal specially commissioned for that purpose to the first end it may be contributary even where there is but one piece of evidence and that a mass of oral testimony delivered from the mouth of one individual though the case in which the probability of its usefulness is likely to be greatest is that in which by the collision of mutually contradictory testimonies new lights indicative of the truth are struck out or endeavoured to be struck out but although in the case in question it should be clear that in this shape no good can be produced there remains that other shape in which it may in any case be produced the judge does what in him lies to the purpose of preventing the right of requiring a recapitulatory examination from being employed by insincerity as an instrument for the manufacture of useless delay vexation or expense in this view if upon completion of the examination the requisition appears groundless he imposes upon the parties concurring in the requisition the burthen of making compensation for the damage produced by it in all shapes if moreover it appears to him that in the mind of the requisitionist it had no other object than the production of useless delay and expense to the injury of any other party or parties he imposes in addition to the burthen of compensation a pecuniary punishment to the use of the public or in case of insolvency the succedaneous punishment provided by the penal and nonpenal codes but the quasijury may if they think fit reduce in any proportion the ulterior punishment a requisition is said to be accompanied with insincerity where the nature of the case being such that on the part of the individual in question while any such belief as that by a recapitulatory examination the evidence can be placed in a light in any respect new is morally impossible he perseveres in making his requisition notwithstanding in certain cases the course of the original examination will lead it to assume the character of an explorative or say an evidencediscovery examination—during which the procedure will wear the character and be designated by the name of investigatorial procedure investigatorial procedure as will have been seen in the chapter on evidence has place in so far as one lot of evidence is employed for the discovery of another a lot of evidence which of itself would not throw light in any shape upon the fact in question and which accordingly would not be fit to enter into the composition of the grounds on which the opinative decree is founded may be not the less well adapted to the purpose of bringing to the cognizance of the judge apt and appropriate evidence as where auditor says i did not see anything that passed but by oculator i have been informed that he did here then from auditor whose testimony with relation to the fact in question is not relevant the judge is informed of the existence of another individual whose testimony if the former said true will with relation to that same fact be apt and appropriate evidence the testimony delivered by auditor will with relation to that same appropriate evidence be indicative evidence it may happen that not only the evidence of the same person but the same article of evidence shall operate on the same occasion in both characters—that of appropriate and that of simply indicative evidence as if auditor were to say i saw what happened and so at the same time did oculator he being at that same time near me and looking the same way on the occasion of the recapitulatory examination all evidence which has been merely indicative and not appropriate will of course be omitted that is to say the individual by whom it was exhibited will not on this occasion be examined unless perchance such examination should prove necessary to the purpose of corroborating or infirming the testimony of him whose evidence had been stated as being relevant and appropriate evidence as if oculator though stated by auditor as having been present on the occasion in question and upon the original examination admitted his having been so should upon the recapitulatory examination deny his having been so in this case it might be of use that auditor should be forthcoming for the purpose of being confronted with him that so with the help of mutual interrogation the truth of the matter may be brought to light on a day in which there is no recapitulatory examination on the paper the quasijury will add itself to the company of spontaneous visitors when in consequence of the recapitulation the definitive imperative decree is delivered     the burthen of the costs caused by the delay so produced will be imposed by the judge on the parties in such proportion as to him seems meet if it be at the motion of a party that the recapitulatory trial takes place and such motion of the party is sincere the judge not being an object of his distrust it will have had for its cause a hope that when with a quasijury to insure a more attentive consideration the judge has furnished his mind with this ulterior stock of instruction his decrees will on this second occasion be more favourable than they were at the first if the party be insincere the act in question may have had other causes examples are—  material evidence which had been unfavourable to his side of the suit at the original examination is no longer forthcoming   the delay vexation and expense inseparable from such ulterior examination is such as the party on the other side would not be in a condition to support supposing the first of these cases to have place the fact in question being ascertained it may constitute a sufficient ground for refusing the recapitulatory examination—or rather for receiving on the occasion of the second examination the minutes of the evidence delivered on the former occasion in lieu of a second oral examination of the same witness performed in the course of the recapitulatory examination if by a party on either side the performance of the recapitulatory examination be objected to on the ground of his being unable to defray the ulterior expense this may be a sufficient reason for the refusal of it unless the party or parties requesting it will provisionally take upon themselves the expense and make compensation for the delay and vexation in other shapes subsequently to the conclusion of the recapitulatory examination and antecedently to the exercise of his opinativelydecretive and imperativelydecretive functions the judge addresses to the quasijury his recapitulatory statement of the topics touched upon in the judges recapitulatory statement examples are as follows—   on the pursuers side of the suit—   his demand that is to say the service demanded by him at the hands of the judge   his ground in the field of law and whether real law or fictitious law   his ground in the field of fact individual facts the existence of which he asserts as belonging to a class of facts designated as giving to a person being of the class of persons mentioned for that purpose of which he says he is one a title to receive at the hands of the judge the service prayed at the expense and charge of the person or persons on the other side of the suit by the portion of law in question added to the facts the existence of which is asserted is composed the efficient cause of the pursuers right or say title to the service which he demands   evidence adduced by him in proof of the facts the existence of which at the times and places in question was asserted as above   arguments employed on the pursuers side namely on the question of law the question of fact or both arguments having for their object the inducing the persuasion that the import intended by the law is the import he ascribes to it and that the facts of which he asserts the existence did at the time and place in question exist accordingly ii on the defenders side of the suit—   his defence if any consisting either of the denial of the justice of the demand or of the counterassertion of some portion of law or matter of fact the effect of which is admitting the demand to have been just to produce the extinction of it   if denegatory in respect of the matter of law thereupon comes his counterinterpretation of the portion of law referred to on the pursuers side   if denegatory in respect of the matter of fact thereupon comes counterevidence   counterargument   if the defence has been counterassertive thereupon comes on this side the same topics as those on the pursuers side the state of the case according to the judges conception of it being thus brought to view follow such observations if any as in his eyes are necessary or useful to render apparent the aptitude of the decrees opinative and imperative which he has it in contemplation to pronounce next and lastly follows the tenor of these same decrees accompanied or followed by such further observations or comments if any as in his eyes promise to be conducive to that same purpose chapter xxviii appeal and quasiappeal §   appeal and quasiappeal what appeal is where a definitive imperative decree having been pronounced by a judgeimmediate application is made by a party to a judgeappellate requesting him to reverse or modify it quasiappeal is where by the judgeimmediate no definitive imperative decree has been as yet made but by something which has been done or omitted to be done by the judgeimmediate such effects have been produced as that in disfavour of the quasiappellant the same effect has been or is about to     be produced as would have been produced by a correspondent imperative decree a quasiappeal is therefore a petition praying for relief in a case in which by relative inaction that is to say for the want of some appropriate decree and execution and effect thereto given the quasiappellant has suffered and is suffering a wrong to the same effect as if an imperative decree in his disfavour had been issued and executed if by relative inaction the effect of a positive decree in disfavour of a party is produced it will be by means of the want of forthcomingness on the part of some thing or things person or persons either to the purpose of justiciability or to the purpose of evidence if it be for want of forthcomingness for the purpose of evidence the justificative cause of complaint will be because had the piece of evidence in question been forthcoming it would either of itself or in conjunction with some other piece or pieces of evidence have been at once sufficient to form an adequate ground for the definitive decree which on the side of the party in question it is the object of the suit or the defence to obtain from the judge if it be for the want of forthcomingness for the purpose of justiciability it will be because had the thing or the person in question been forthcoming execution and effect might in a certain shape have been given to a decree in favour of the party by whom it was prayed for in the course of his pursuit or his defence as the case may be whereas for want of it neither in that same shape nor in any other adequate to it could such execution and effect be given to such decree if issued of forthcomingness on the part of persons and things for the purpose of justiciability examples are as follows—   production of a person within the physical power of the judge for the purpose of his being eventually placed within the physical power of a party of the person of a wife for the purpose of her being placed under the physical power of her husband of a child under the physical power of his or her father or other guardian   production of a thing claimed by a pursuer for the purpose of its being placed under the physical power of such pursuer production of a mass of property belonging to a defendant for the purpose of its being sold in the way of auction by an appropriate functionary of justice to the end that the produce of the sale may be delivered by him to the pursuer in satisfaction for a debt due to him from the defendant if for want of such dispatch as could have been and ought to have been given by the judge immediate irreparable injury by want of forthcomingness of some person or some thing whether for the purpose of evidence or for the purpose of justiciability is produced such judge is responsible nonpenally or even penally or in both ways as the case may be of incidents whereby forthcomingness which in regard to a thing necessary as a means of satisfaction or of punishment or of evidence might within the proper time have been effected but which by the lapse of that same time has been rendered impossible examples are as follows—   expatriation—the thing carried out of the power of the whole judicial establishment as well as of the particular judicatory in question   latentey—the place in which the thing is unknown namely to those whose knowledge of the place where it is is necessary to the forthcomingness of it   deperition   relative deterioration of occurrences whereby as a means with relation to the like effect relative forthcomingness in the instance of a person may have been rendered impossible examples are as follows—   expatriation   latentcy   insolvency   death   relative deperition or deterioration of appropriate faculties in so far as it is in the character of a source of evidence that the thing or the person might and would have been made to minister to the purposes of justice—to rectitude of decision in the case in question the causation of nonforthcomingness has the effect of suppression of evidence suppression of which on one side the effect may have been the same as forgery of evidence—namely as forgery of evidence having with the same force the opposite tendency §   grounds for quasiappeal necessary to the actual execution of any ordinance of the law in conjunction with the means of proof the means of execution and the means of appropriate communication on the part of all pursuers on whom the result depends—are the disposition and the power to employ them to that purpose with effect suppose these requisites all of them to have place—you suppose the effect to have place suppose any one of them not to have place—you suppose the effect not to have place by delay by what cause soever produced whether by purely physical agency or human agency if by human agency whether avoidable or unavoidable and if unavoidable whether with or without blame—the effect of misdecision may in any one of these cases alike     be capable of being produced in so far as it is unavoidable there is nothing to be done—in so far as it is avoidable thereupon devolves upon the legislator the care of preventing it of preventing it and in so far as blame is attached to the existence of it punishing it in an effectual manner by precipitation the shapes in which the effect of misdecision ultimate or antecedent is also produced are as follows— all the several modes in which as above it is producible by delay for suppose for example an ultimate decision pronounced at a time when either the requisite means of proof or disproof that could have been employed have not been employed or some necessary means of execution which but for this promptitude of the decision might have been employed have failed to be employed in this case likewise the decision pronounced will either be misdecision or be productive of the same effect as if misdecision had had place an effect opposite to that which would have had place had due execution been given to the law may in consequence have had place in comparison with delay promptitude has the advantage of not being as delay essentially is productive of vexation and expense in addition to misdecision or the evil effect of it on the other hand instances occur in which by precipitation misdecision actual or more or less probable is capable of being produced in cases in which delay is scarcely of itself capable of being productive of the like effect cases may on any sort of occasion have place in which to the rendering of a right decision and consequently to the avoidance of misdecision one or both of two things for the guidance of decision are necessary these are—   argumentation hearing or reading from the lips or pens of others such observations whether on the question of law or on the question of fact as may be necessary to the placing the matter of fact or the matter of law in a clear light   consideration which is in effect an operation of the same sort as that of argumentation with only this difference that the mind of the judge is the only seat of it a ground for a quasiappeal is any act affirmative or negative on the part of the judge below—any act affirmative or negative the effect of which is or would be to place the quasiappellant in the same situation as if an undue definitive decree in his disfavour had been issued and executed or but for the remedy demanded by the quasiappellant would be referable to one or other of the heads following is every judicial act having the effect of misdecision—   denial declared or virtual of means of proof to wit either in the aggregate or in the instance of some one understood and assignable means or article of evidence   denial declared or virtual of some means of execution actual or eventual in possession or in expectancy   denial declared or virtual of some means of communication necessary to the obtainment of some means of proof or of some means of execution or acquittal in time for the purpose   denial declared or virtual of means of defence actual or eventual in possession or expectancy   undue delay whereby the obtainment of some means of proof in appropriate time or of some means of execution actual or eventual in a direct way or by withholding of some means of communication is prevented or unduly retarded   undue precipitation whereby the obtainment or use of some means of proof execution or communication as above or of some means of elucidation in the way of argument is prevented wrong in these its several shapes has its correspondent remedy which if the quasiappeal be well grounded it belongs to the appellate judicatory to apply as also to each such remedy its correspondent petition or demand   for denial of means of proof remedy imperative decree ordering supply of means of proof in the shape belonging to the nature of the case and determined by the appellate judge either in exact compliance with the terms of the demand made by the quasiappellant or in conformity to his own more or less different views of what the case requires as expressed in his correspondent opinative decree name of the correspondent demand—petition for supply of means of proof   for denial of means of execution remedy imperative decree ordering supply of means of execution in the shape belonging to the nature of the case and determined by the appellate judge either in exact conformity with the terms of the demand made by the quasiappellant or in conformity to his own more or less different views of what the case requires as expressed in his correspondent opinative decree name of the correspondent demand—petition for supply of means of execution   for denial of means of communication remedy imperative decree ordering supply of the means of communication in the shape belonging to the nature of the case and determined by the appellate judge either in exact compliance with the terms of the demand made by the quasiappellant or in conformity to his own more or less different views of what the case requires as expressed     in his correspondent opinative decree name of the correspondent demand—petition for supply of means of communication   for denial of means of defence remedy imperative decree ordering supply of means of proof or means of judicial assistance for the purpose of information advice or argument in the shape belonging to the nature of the case and determined by the judgeappellate either in exact compliance with the terms of the demand made by the quasiappellant or in conformity with his own more or less different views of the case as expressed in his correspondent opinative decree name of the correspondent demand—petition for supply of means of defence   for undue delay whereby timely obtainment of means of proof or execution or means of acquittal or defence may have been prevented and on the pursuers side execution and on the defendants side acquittal are at any rate retarded—remedy imperative decree ordering dispatch either in exact compliance with the terms of the demand or in conformity with the more or less different views of what the case requires as expressed in the correspondent opinative decree name of the correspondent demand—petition for dispatch   for undue precipitation whereby obtainment of means of proof means of execution means of communication means of elucidation by argument or means of acquittal or defence have or may have been definitively or temporarily prevented—petition for reversal with such particular remedy as the case may require in a certain case over and above vexation and expense by delay the effect of misdecision may be produced this is when the period within which a means needful and of itself in conjunction with other means sufficient to give execution and effect to the portion of law in question might have been obtained has been suffered to elapse rectitude of decision is thereby rendered impossible and misdecision is made to take its place say for shortness—through delay misdecision necessitated or through delay right decision impossibilitated of other competent grounds for a quasiappeal examples are as follows—   nonallowance of the faculty of taking a transcript of the record or of so much as to constitute a sufficient ground for his petition   out of the record omission of some particular which ought to have been inserted   in the record insertion of some portion of discourse not conformable to the truth   in the record substitution of some portion of discourse not conformable to truth to some portion of discourse conformable to truth which ought to have been contained in it   insertion given in the record to matter irrelevant or otherwise immaterial whereby to the labour or expense of transcription a needless addition has been made in each of the above cases the mischief from the wrong will of course depend upon its effect on the issue of the suit in so far as things can be placed in the same state as they would have been in had the wrong not been done—to place them in that state will be the appropriate remedy in so far as this cannot be done compensation at the expense of the wrongdoer and of all concerned in the doing of the wrong will be the remedy required the provision here made supposes that the relief here allowed to be prayed for at the hands of the appellate judge has in substance been denied by the immediate judge the hearing before the quasijury is the stage at which if at any arguments in form with or without professional advocates are heard if on any occasion the decision of the judge fails of being acceptable to a party on either side that is the stage at which he prefers to the appellate judicatory an appeal or a quasiappeal the quasiappeal is as has been seen a petition in any one of the six forms just mentioned it is called a quasiappeal because though not in any one of those instances what has been commonly understood by the word appeal yet in every one of them the effect which it seeks to produce is the same as that which in the case of success is produced by it—the remedy producing in favour of the complainant an effect which is the opposite of that which would have been produced by the alleged grievance complained of of everything that passed as well on the original examination as on the recapitulative examination if being granted it take place minutes will be to be taken on this occasion as on the others by the registrar so likewise may they by any and every person so disposed in this case they may eventually form a ground of accusation against the judge either before the justiceminister or before the publicopinion tribunal with a view to eventual dislocation as per chap xxii—appellate judicatories constitutional code if by reason of noncompliance with a petition for a supply either of means of proof or means of execution—misdecision or nondecision misexecution or nonexecution shall have taken place the judge by whose default misdecision or the equivalent of it shall have taken place is responsible compensationally or even punitionally by decision of the justiceminister if such failure has had evil consciousness or rashness for its accompaniment     §   uses of appeal what is the use of appeal if judges who act in the first instance are subject to error—are liable to be deficient in appropriate aptitude—so are those who act in the second instance and from the mere circumstance of their being set to work after the first what ground can you have for the expectation of a higher degree of aptitude on the part of the second answer the use is that one set of judges may have another to stand in awe of—a set in whose instance if on any occasion it happens to him who acts in the first instance to be actuated by sinister interest in whatever shape love of ease included there will be another who by the love of power as well as the sense of obligation will be naturally disposed to correct his errors the purpose might therefore be in a main degree answered if the functions were reversed the immediate judges made appellate only and the appellate judges made immediate only hence one reason why immediate jurisdiction should not be given to appellate judges for if it were there would be none of whom they would stand in awe from immediate judges arbitrary power is taken away by the setting of appellate judges over their heads from appellate judges arbitrary power is taken away by their not having the initiative and because if they make any undue alteration in the decrees pronounced by the immediate judges there stand already those same decrees with their respective reasons constituting a standard by which the operations of the appellate judges will be tried by the publicopinion tribunal as the operations of the immediate judicatory have been by the appellate when once it is established that there ought to be two sets of judicatories one above another it is better that those who have had most experience should sit in judgment over those who have had the least than those who have had the least over those who have had the most but rather than there should not be two different sets those of one set sitting in judgment over the acts of those who have acted in the first instance it were better that appeal should in particular cases go from the appellate to the immediate judicatories than that there should be no appeal from the appellate—than that there should be any judge whose proceedings there should be no other judge to take cognizance of with a power of eventual correction not having had the advantage of hearing the orally extracted evidence while the immediate judge has had that faculty the appellate judge is empowered it may be observed to reverse the decree of the immediate judge in respect of the matter of fact although his means of coming at the truth are so much less efficient and as the publicopinion tribunal at large is so circumstanced as not to have the possibility of availing itself of those superior means any more than the appellate to whom those means are denied why not leave the power of determining the fate of the cause in the hands of those whose means for forming a right judgment are so much superior to any that can be employed either by the judge above or by the ultimate superiors of the highest grade—the possessors of the constitutive authority in their character of members of the publicopinion tribunal answer the least important advantage must yield to the most important a check applied by superordinate authority to a power which would otherwise be arbitrary placing everything dear to man in the hands of an unchecked functionary or set of functionaries is a security too indispensable to be foregone on any account whatever the advantage from vesting the power of deciding on the question of fact in the hands of the same individual by whom the evidence in relation to it has been received and collected would be indeed a very considerable advantage but in point of importance this cannot enter into competition with the other in all probability this advantageous union will have had place in the great majority of the whole number of instances only comparatively in a small proportion will appeal have place and of those cases in which it has place only in a very small proportion will the appellate judge think fit to substitute his opinion to that of a judge whose means of judging the whole matter have been to such a degree more instructive than his in this case it is not for what he is likely to do—it is only for what it will be seen that in case of necessity he has it in his power to do—that the faculty of undoing what the immediate judge has done is put into his hands by the publicopinion tribunal the exercise of a power thus extraordinary is not likely to be left unwatched the party in whose disfavour it is exercised is not likely to be backward in complaining of any abuse with which in his opinion it can be made chargeable in all the cases in which power is given to the appellate judge of reversing the decrees of the immediate judge on the ground of the evidence as it stands upon the record power is also given to him to send the question of fact to be tried over again in a neighbouring judicatory the orally extracted evidence which is the only sort of evidence to which the question applies to be there extracted anew—such of it as remains still obtainable this option in case of his disapproving of the     decrees below it will be naturally expected that he should embrace where the importance of the suit is such as to warrant the additional expense and it is manifest how considerable the reduction is which will require to be made from this source from the number of instances in which the decrees of the original judicatory are likely to undergo material change number of cases in which appeal may be made say  00 of these the number in which the decree below undergoes alteration in consideration of the opinion formed on the question of fact  0 of these ten the number of those in which without sending the question to another trial reversal or other material alteration takes place two what is the consequence answer that notwithstanding the power of reversal lodged in the appellate judicatory the fate of the suit is decided in    instances out of    by the immediate judge if the union in question is to such a degree beneficial as above supposed the more beneficial it is and is seen to be the greater will be the degree of confidence reposed by the publicopinion tribunal in a decree passed by a judge by whom this advantage has been possessed as compared with that reposed in the decree of a judge by whom this same advantage has not been possessed thus then the strength of the check rises in proportion to the demand for the application of it the greater the extent to which the publicopinion tribunal keeps itself in accordance with the opinion expressed by the decrees of the judiciary establishment the more perfectly will the system of procedure fulfil the ends of its institution if instead of committing the second trial to another judicatory the appellate judge had the power of receiving and extracting the orally delivered evidence in his own person and to decide in dernier resort on the ground of the evidence so collected and extracted his power would thereby be unchecked and arbitrary as above there being no other authorized to reverse or modify it but suppose the second trial to be by another judge immediate the decree of the second judge immediate would in the same manner as that of the first be subjected to reversal or modification at the hands of another judge namely the judge appellate and thus saved from the charge of arbitrariness stages of appeal why not more than one answer because by a single one the beneficial effects above mentioned are secured and by every additional stage the evil opposite to the collateral ends of justice would receive vast increase while to the obtainment of the direct ends of justice no additional probability would be given question why allow modification or reversal of the decree of the judgeappellate in case of his being actually punished and not otherwise answer because if the decree might be reversed or modified without the judges being actually punished criminality would be imputed by the appellant as a matter of course for the mere purpose of obtaining the right of appeal and by wrongdoers in possession frequently for no other purpose than that of increase of delay vexation and expense question why not allow the appellate judicatory to have for its decrees any other ground than what has been afforded by the record of the proceedings of the immediate judicatory—why not allow it to examine fresh evidence answer—  the proper point of view for the appellate judicatory to contemplate the evidence and other proceedings in is that in which alone the publicopinion tribunal can contemplate them   only from such evidence and grounds as he had before him can the appellate form any just conception of the conduct of the immediate judge   if the case be such that subsequently to the decrees of the immediate judicatory fresh evidence impugning the decree has come to light it is to the immediate judicatory that it ought to be presented and not to the appellate if presented to the appellate without passing through the immediate the evidence would not have the benefit of an examination before a quasijury if it is for want of evidence that might and should have been contributed to and received by the immediate judicatory that a supposed misdecision has taken place the remedy that should be applied is a petition to the immediate judicatory—a petition for supply of evidence of which petition the denial forms a ground for quasiappeal §   proceedings before the appellant judge on the occasion of a petition for a supply of evidence the party gives indication of the source from whence the evidence is desired and states the terms in which it is his desire that the appropriate imperative decree should be expressed adding in case of noncompliance a petition for the hearing of the former petition before a quasijury on the occasion of a petition for securing eventual forthcomingness of means of execution the party gives indication of—  the existence of the objects or   the articles in question with their general description   the necessity of apt arrangements for securing their eventual forthcomingness and   the terms in which it is his desire that the appropriate imperative decree shall be expressed adding in case of noncompliance a petition for hearing as above before a quasijury     on the occasion of a petition for a recapitulatory hearing before a quasijury appointment is prayed of a day and time on which the hearing shall have place on the occasion of a petition for dispatch the party gives indication of each particular operation or set of operations which it is his desire to see performed and states the terms in which it is his desire that the imperative decree for the performance of it shall stand expressed adding in case of noncompliance a petition for hearing as above before a quasijury on the occasion of a petition for right execution he states the particulars in which the execution given to the imperative decree in question has failed of being conformable to it adding in case of noncompliance petition for hearing before a quasijury on the occasion of a petition for execution he states the time and manner in which it is his desire the execution should be performed adding in case of noncompliance petition for a hearing before a quasijury at the time appointed for argumentation the official respondent on the appellants side declares whether he does or does not see any objection to the decision appealed from if he does not the decision is confirmed unless the appellate judge of himself sees any sufficient specific ground which he declares accordingly for reversal or modification if the declaration of the official respondent be in the affirmative he thereupon states his objections and argues in support of them and upon hearing the argumentation on both sides the judge appellate decides if on either side the party or any substitute professional or nonprofessional deputed by him appears and argues the duty of the official respondent does not take place on that side in a penal suit if the appellant being the defendant is not in a state of incarceration he is at liberty to repair to the appellate judicatory and make representation in his own person as well as in the person of a substitute professional or nonprofessional so if he is in a state of incarceration on paying the expense of conveyance in custody unless his case be of the number of those in which to warrant appeal the fiat of the quasijury is necessary neither in this case is he transferred to the appellate judicatory unless for such transference a separate fiat from the quasijury be granted in a penal suit if the decision of the immediate judicatory be simply confirmed without modification to prevent undue delay and on the part of the pursuer groundless vexation and expense the defendant will be liable to additional punishment as of course but with power to the judgeappellate to remit it in the whole or in part for specific cause assigned in regard to the quantum of such punishment in the several cases provision will be made elsewhere on this occasion the minimum of that which will suffice for the prevention of insincere appeals is all that will be appointed in every case alike where the quasiappeal is regarded as groundless or not sufficiently grounded the appellate judge issues his opinative decree quasiappeal naming it to wit petition for supply of means of proof for means of execution c groundless or not sufficiently grounded terms of the imperative decree addressed to the judge below proceed to execution or proceed to acquittal as the case may be if from what appears on the face of the record the nature of the case is such that wrong in one or more of the above shapes having been committed the appellate judge can see what is the proper issue of the suit he declares as much and decrees accordingly giving such definitive decree as might have been given had the definitive decree been pronounced by the immediate judicatory in disfavour of the party wronged and an appeal made against it in consequence if no such conception can be obtained he declares so much by his opinative decree and by an imperative decree orders a new quasitrial if that can afford a remedy in the same judicatory or another as seems to him most apt in any case for injury in whatever shape produced by the wrong he orders compensation §   checks except as to the differences resulting from difference of situation the checks applied to conduct and thence the several securities established against misconduct in the case of the immediate have place in the case of the appellate judge these differences are as follows— in the case of the judgeappellate to the security afforded by the obligation on the part of the judgeimmediate principal to have served in the capacity of judgeimmediate depute is added that of having served in the capacity of judgeimmediate principal modified in the case of the judgeappellate is the check applied in the case of the judgeimmediate by the attendance of law students in the visitors gallery antecedently to the admission to practise in the appellate judicatory to the five years of attendance requisite to admission to practise in the immediate judicatory are added  months and no more of attendance in the appellate judicatory in the case of a judgeappellate the check which in the case of a judgeimmediate as applied to the virtual appeal from a judge     without a jury to a judge in the name judicatory with a jury cannot have place a judgeappellate not hearing anything without a jury in the case of an appellate judicatory the check applied by appeal to a superior judicatory has no place except in the case in which the part allotted in ordinary cases to an immediate is performed by the appellate judicatory such as that of a complaint of the number of those registered in the incidental complaintbook in this case from the decrees of the appellate judicatory appeal lies to the justiceminister to the situation of judgeappellate the check applied to the situation of judge immediate by his dislocability by the judgeappellate is obviously excluded by the nature of the case as to dislocation dislocable is an appellate judge not by the electors of any subdistrict but by those of the district or assemblage of districts over which his local field of service extends there follows as to undue delay a check not applicable to the case of an immediate judicatory if within a certain length of time after receipt of the record no decree has by the appellate judicatory been pronounced the decrees of the immediate judicatory are thereupon understood to be confirmed and if after receipt of notice given of the lapse of the interval to the registrar of the appellate judicatory and due time to wit  days allowed for inhibition therefrom no such inhibition has been received execution is forthwith given by the immediate judge to his decree so if in the mean time application for argumentation has been publicly made to the judgeappellate by a party on either side and the faculty of argumentation has been refused namely directly or virtually by nonappointment of day and hour or by omitting to hear argumentation after appointment—to the registrar it belongs to make entry thereof on the record antecedently to retransmission made as above so if to application publicly begun to be made the judgeappellate should refuse ulterior audience such refusal would moreover be a punishable offence and might be denounced as such to the justiceminister and thereby to the publicopinion tribunal to pave the way for eventual dislocation §   options of judgeappellate as to judgeimmediate on view of the record after entry made of his decrees opinative and imperative in relation to the suit brought before him whether in the way of appeal or in that of quasiappeal the judgeappellate will subjoin an opinative decree on the subject of the conduct of the judge below the options given to him on these particulars are expressed in the words which follow—   judgment supposed erroneous as expressed—in respect of intention conduct blameless   judgment supposed erroneous as expressed—mind supposed not sufficiently attentive follows a statement declaring the passages in which this opinion has had its ground   decree erroneous as expressed suspicion is entertained of a deficiency in respect of appropriate aptitude stating in which branch moral intellectual or active as the case may be follows a statement declaring the passages in which the opinion has had its ground if the last of those options be embraced the judgeappellate transmits the record or a transcript thereof to the justice minister who thereupon acts as per chap xxii constitutional code §   evidence discovered after ultimate decrees how far producible in relation to any matter of fact what may sometimes happen is that after a suit instituted and terminated evidence transpires by which had it been received in time decrees opposite to those by which the suit has been terminated would have been pronounced in such cases the proper judicatory to apply to is the judicatory in which the suit has been so terminated but in such a case exceptions excepted the judge will not grant and appoint a fresh recapitulatory quasi trial unless upon examination of the party applying he is satisfied that of the evidence in question the party had not antecedently to the utterance of the definitive decrees in question any knowledge exceptions are as follows—   where though at the time in question he did not either tender or require the extraction of the evidence in question he gave indication of the existence of it—the nonproduction of it having for its cause the conception of the adequacy of the mass of evidence actually adduced coupled with the desire of avoiding the delay vexation and expense inseparable from the production of it and the persuasion of the nonnecessity of it as above   where antecedently to the termination of the suit as above the existence of a certain article of evidence material to the corroboration of an article of newly discovered evidence was known but the newly discovered evidence itself not being known the materiality of it could not be then known—the     reason for giving indication of it had not place therefore at that time examples of such demand for subsequently and accidentallydiscovered evidence are as follows—   field of law the nonpenal branch—subjectmatter of suit aggregate mass of the property of a person recently deceased—ground of decision testament of a certain date—fresh evidence subsequently discovered a testament of posterior date in the custody of a person whose existence or chief abode was not at the termination of the suit known to the party on whose behalf the fresh examination is required   field of law the penal branch—defendant in a penal suit for homicide—quasitrial after recapitulatory examination and by appropriate decrees opinative and imperative acquitted evidence the existence of which was neither known nor suspected afterwards comes to light examples—   the defendant in contemplation of death smitten by remorse confesses but recants   in a fit of drunkenness or in his sleep defendant utters particulars which lead to the discovery of evidence the existence of which had not been suspected   habiliments or other goods known to have been the property of the deceased are discovered in the possession of the defendant or the dead body or the skeleton known by some peculiar marks to have belonged to the deceased   an individual who in relation to the transaction by which the death was occasioned had been an eyewitness or in relation to some fact probatively operating as an article of circumstantial evidence returns from beyond sea and makes known what he saw §   security against undue punishment of an irreparable nature without express confirmation by the appellate judicatory and the justiceminister no imperative decree ordering under the name of punishment or otherwise irreparable change in bodily condition shall be considered as intended to receive execution examples of such change are the following—   mortal punishment   mutilation loss of the substance or use of a portion or organ of the body   stigmatization understand when performed in such manner that the effect shall be indelible   in the case of a female defloration as where on the termination of a suit antecedently to known consummation a female is ordered to be delivered into the power of a man adjudged to be her husband for the completion of the list see the nonpenal and penal codes chapter xxix natural and technical systems compared one main feature of natural procedure is a special regard to avoid adding to the suffering of the innocent the indigent and the for whatsoever cause afflicted corresponding feature of technical procedure blind oppression of the innocent the indigent and the already afflicted examples—indiscriminate imposition of the burthen of costs in all stages from that of accusation to that of execution inclusive to this head belong all fees exacted of persons imprisoned on mesne editor process and thence before conviction as well as on imprisonment in consequence of conviction the infinitely diversified but in most cases enormous length of time during which in consequence of accusation and before trial in cases liable to incarceration persons are subjected to it in all cases of penal procedure the declared supposition is that the party accused is innocent and for this supposition mighty is the laud bestowed upon one another by judges and lawwriters this supposition is at once contrary to fact and belied by their own practice the defendant is not in fact treated as if he were innocent and it would be absurd and inconsistent to deal by him as if he were the state he is in is a dubious one betwixt nondelinquency and delinquency supposing him nondelinquent then immediately should the procedure against him drop everything that follows is oppression and injustice of this oppression the immediate cause is the enormous interval so wantonly interposed between one part of the procedure and another this is a consequence of the unfeeling disregard above mentioned of that disregard the original sin of judicial procedure more or less flagrant perhaps in all countries but more particularly in england the substitution of the actual ends of judicature to the ends of justice to such a length has this disregard proceeded as to have produced a tax and that to an enormous amount on what are called free pardons† for pardon though under english   0 law altogether arbitrary there are several incontestably proper causes as to this see constitutional code chapter xxv justice minister §   dispunitive function oppression of the indigent grievous in proportion to their indigence oppression in this shape has for its cause the employment given to fixed sums on whatsoever accounts imposed viz penalty for delinquency in its various shapes by substantive law taxes and fees to functionaries of both sorts judiciary and professional under procedure law the effect which blind fixation has in giving encouragement and birth to crime in all manner of shapes is a topic of animadversion elsewhere what belongs to the present occasion is the effect it has on the suffering of the absolutely or comparatively indigent an effect which goes to the rendering the suffering of one individual rise to some thousand times the amount of the suffering of this or that other from a cause nominally and in the eyes of a careless observer the same the case mentioned as the case of the already afflicted belongs more particularly to that in which the offence is not considered on the footing of a criminal one but only as injurious and thus producing a demand for compensation if prevention of such offences were the end in view matters would be so managed as that whatever expense were imposed or left unremoved should antecedently to decision be minimized and after decision thrown with its whole weight state of pecuniary circumstances considered on the party in the wrong in the case of rashness with a purposed addition in case of evil consciousness between operation and operation in the course of the suit beginning with the first whatever that may be long intervals are established by general rules without regard to the difference in respect of length of intervals rendered necessary to justice by the circumstances of the several individual cases these intervals are fixed in regard to time without any regard to distance in respect of place by general rules transference from judicatory to judicatory and back again thence vast delay vexation and expense without any benefit on the contrary with great detriment to justice in respect of avoidance of misdecision by breaking the thread of the evidence belonging to the suit appointing one part to be elicited by one judicatory in one place another part by another judicatory at another place and the other parts at the judicatory in which the suit commenced mode of proceeding by action at common law in the three commonlaw judicatories of the metropolis—the kings bench common pleas and exchequer—the mode of procedure in this case is not very materially different first comes the writ but the only end and effect of this is to cause the defendant to appoint an attorney to carry on the suit in his stead here the instrument of summons warning notice or whatever it may be called is at a fixed price or at any rate at a price that ought to be fixed purchased of a subordinate instrument and justiceseller of the judge—the judge himself never knowing anything of that which in this way is done by his authority and in his name next comes the declaration but this though an assertion and though in that character effect is given to it is not considered in the character nor designated by the name of evidence it has always more or less of falsehood in it the attorney for the party never knows any more of the matter than the judge does utters this falsehood knowingly and wilfully and without any apprehension because without any danger of suffering from it for the utterance of it he and his instrument and accomplice the special pleader are well paid and except the receiving of this pay the only effect of it is to elicit under the name of a plea the corresponding mass of falsehood and absurdity from the attorney in league with a special pleader on the other side thus continues the chain of falsehood and absurdity from mouth to mouth and from year to year between one link and another there being in particular four long intervals one of them of the length of three or four months lest the suit should come too early to a close all this while no assertion made which under the name of evidence is admitted to constitute a ground for the ultimate decision by which execution and effect is given or denied to the portion of law on which the demand is as by the declaration professed to be grounded if the instrument put forth in the first instance by the defendant in answer to the plaintiffs declaration is of such a nature as to come under the denomination of a general issue of which according to the nature of the demand there are five or six sorts there is another tissue of useless falsehoods and absurdities and the suit goes to some place in every variety of distance between 0 feet and about  00 miles from the place at which it was commenced to be tried that is to say now for the first time is any mass of assertion received to which as above the character and effect of evidence is ascribed here for the first time a functionary bearing the title of judge takes unless by accident as hereafter mentioned cognizance of the evidence of anything that has passed in the     course of the suit this judge is not necessarily the judge under whose authority the suit was commenced or the power of compelling the adverse party to act in the character of a defendant sold for the useless course of falsehood and absurdity months in large numbers as above or years in small numbers are allotted for the elicitation of the only mass of assertion which is so much as professed to be taken for the ground of decision sometimes not more than two or three days for all the number of suits that can come to be heard in the same place are allowed upon an average not more than two or three times as many hours are allotted for the only mass of information which is or can be applied to use as the number of months or even years that are allotted to the elicitation of that which is so completely useless proceedings by indictment—here a new scene opens the case where the proceedings by indictment are preceded by proceedings before a justice of the peace—this case not covering more than a part of the field covered by the mode of procedure termed an indictment must for the present be postponed here the scene opens with the proceedings before the grand jury the grand jury is a judicatory not presided over by a professional and permanently existing official person a judge but a company a miscellaneous company of men selected on the presumption of possessing a certain degree of opulence in number from    to    to pronounce a decision in favour of the demand    but not less than    are sufficient but here the information furnished is put upon the footing and bears the character and denomination of evidence here then is a mass of evidence what next becomes of it—is it never acted upon no never it is uniformly let drop and forgotten all the use made of it is the enabling this majority if such be their pleasure to send the cause to be tried upon evidence not quite so sure of perishing by a judge or jury in the same manner as an action as above is tried and this in many cases with needless delay as also in length various but in no case so enormous as to be worth mentioning in comparison with that which in the mode of suit called action has been seen organized now in this preliminary operation by which during a course of several days perhaps from    to    persons have been occupied in the situation of judges besides an altogether unlimited number in the character of witnesses what is the use answer absolutely none what is the effect to enable these    or    enquires as they are called to afford impunity without reproach to every malefactor to whom it suits their purpose to afford this encouragement to crime yes such is the purpose if not of the creation of the institution of the preservation of it and for this purpose it is if for any purpose at all that the veil of secresy by means of the sanction of an oath—that veil which originally was thrown over it for other purposes—is preserved over it parties appearance—various are the ways in which the institution by which parties are exempted from the obligation of appearing face to face in the judicatory in the presence of the judge and the assembled public is inimical to the ends of justice and conducive to the actual ends of judicature in the first place comes the pecuniary profit immediate and direct to both branches of the fraternity professional and official encouragement given to the relatively and comparatively opulent who are able without difficulty to defray the expense as above to oppress and provoke the relatively and comparatively unopulent from the provocation in so far as submitted to without retaliation no selfregarding profit accrues to the lawyer tribe in a pecuniary shape remains only the gratification to aristocratical sympathy from the spectacle of a class of men below them suffering under the yoke imposed upon them by the class to which they of the lawlearned class do belong but every now and then resentment under oppression gets the better of prudence then comes retaliation and from retaliation litigation in which the party originally oppressed and injured is made defendant great is the assistance which this plan of depredation receives from the darkness in which the whole system of procedure is involved by the thick cloud of technicalities no means has any ordinary man of knowing beforehand what the quantum of expense is in which before the termination of the suit he has in contemplation he may be involved in a commonlaw case in westminster hall to a question what the expense on the plaintiffs side suppose will be he is informed it may be about thirty pounds more or less nor is the information absolutely untrue but this amount may be taken as the minimum of this minimum according to circumstances it may swell out to hundreds or to thousands the most remote but upon the whole its comprehensiveness considered the most productive source of profit remains still behind this is the endemial and allinfecting depravity which it engenders and keeps alive in the community by withholding the great check by the application of which it would in so vast a proportion be kept from coming into existence were he assured of having his misconduct exposed and made public in the presence of a judge and a numerous auditory as it would be were he under the obligation of meeting his adversary face to face and     giving immediate answer to whatever partinent questions were proposed to him he would shrink from the exposure as it is at the expense of a series of lies—from the disgrace of which he is eased by a society of lawyers who are paid for originating and giving utterance to them—he being but the adoptive father and not understood to be so of them—he travels on in the road to iniquity—he perseveres in his course of injury without a check expense is the utmost he has to fear thus it is that the whole judicial system with everything that belongs to it is a perpetual hotbed for the raising a perpetual crop of depredation and oppression in every imaginable shape with proportionable profit to judge and co as often as it breaks out in the shape of litigation such is the state of the disease now as to the remedy a few words will suffice for the prescription of it of late years publicity has received an unexampled extension under the protection of a beneficent and comparatively wise ministry and reformation of morals in a sensible degree is become the consequence but in comparison of what it might be the extent is still extremely narrow think what it would be if in every instance of oppression in cases now called civil cases the oppressor saw himself under the obligation of facing his victim or intended victim in presence of a judge and a numerous and promiscuous auditory and to make true answer on pain as now of punishment for perjury to every question which the oppressee now no longer excluded from the judicatory by the expense of the tollgate leading to it might with the consent of the judge find cause to put to him at present opulence is to wrong in every shape so long as individuals alone are regarded as being the objects of it an effectual licence in the hereproposed code the licence will be withdrawn and in the judicatory now become the arena of justice the oppressor and the oppressed would meet on nearly equal terms in the english courts the first act continues to be an act of extortion and oppression—of extortion practised on those who have money to pay for the chance of what is called justice by any one whose desire it was to do justice to the demand would a refusal be given to hear what the demandant had to say on the subject—to hear whether upon the face of his statement there was any ground for the demand—any just and sufficient cause sufficient to afford a warrant for the vexation and expense no he would hear what the applicant had to say and upon so doing would in many instances do complete justice or at any rate learn more of the real state of the case than an english judge—commonlaw judge and equity judge put together—will unless the defendant chooses it at the end of eighteen months by this one act a double injustice is perpetrated injustice in the shape of extortion and oppression—extortion practised upon the man or the woman who is already injured—oppression on the man or the woman whose liberty is sold to the demandant without inquiry at the fixed price—the judge for the sake of the profit received by himself lending himself as an instrument to the profit of his accomplices and confederate worshippers in the professional branches of the law the judges immediate profit from the extortion—though several times the amount of that price for a days labour which thousands and scores of thousands would be happy to get and cannot—formed at its origin a very considerable proportion of the amount of that income which would suffice for the subsistence of a family during a whole year in the interval between that time and the present that price has not been raised in any proportion approaching to that in which the value of money has fallen but to the multitude of suits the result of the prodigious increase of wealth—of wealth absolute and relative what has been lost in the value of such items has been amply compensated for by what has been gained by the increased number of those same items for the facility of giving exercise to oppression in this shape where oppression is the object not so much as an account true or false is received or asked for at the hands of the purchaser afterwards indeed when the proposed defendant in jail or out of jail has by more fees made known his intention of appearing in that character an account is made and received but this account is made not by the party himself but by an attorney who by the course of the court has been obliged to compose it of a parcel of lies with only just so much truth in it as serves for a pretence for compelling the exhibition of a similar composition called a plea the parties on both sides for months or years are kept thus at a distance from one another by the judge while at longprotracted and altogether useless intervals they are compelled to employ the lawyer to carry on the war of words being composed of a mixture of lies abuse and nonsense with or as it may happen without a small particle or two of relevant or irrelevant truth interspersed by accident elicitation of evidence natural modes oral or epistolary in all cases according to circumstances in respect of delay vexation and expense     technical modes diversified according to circumstances which make no difference with relation to aptitude or probability as to the correctness and completeness of the evidence elicited unapt sources of diversification—   the power and consequent

mode alone and in this case in the utmost secresy by the examining judge alone no interrogative matter for counterinterrogatories admitted to be given to the parties on both sides or to a party on either side natural procedure—form of litis contestation from beginning to end exceptions excepted oral exceptions are—  impossibility by reason of local distance   preponderant evil in the shape of delay vexation and expense technical procedure—in equity practice scriptitive or say epistolary sole case in which oral discourse is received that in which the examinee is either an extraneous witness or a party litigant examined in the character of an extraneous witness of the two effectually distinct functions the requisitive and the probative the exercise is mixed up in the same document—to wit the bill the pursuer states the service he requires alleges supposed facts for the purpose of forming an efficient cause of right or title to the service demanded or say required at the hands of the defendant and eventually at the hands of the judge and exercises the evidenceelicitative function at the charge of the defendant the evidence delivered is what is called the charging part of the bill containing in it of necessity a large portion of false and mendacious statement the judicatory refusing all relief to every person who will not add to his requisition a tissue of false and mendacious statements known so to be by the judge in the commonlaw practice the litiscontestation is called pleading and that which is productive of delay vexation and expense in a special degree special pleading equity practice to its own peculiar mode adds incidentally the commonlaw mode this is the case as often as either instead of or in conjunction with what is called his answer the defendants lawyer delivers in what is called a plea or what is called a demurier if and in so far as justice—that is to say giving execution and effect to the correspondent portion of the substantive branch of the law—is the end in view no part of the matter found in any of the books under the head of pleading or special pleading will have any place in a procedure code having that same for its end in view no portion is there of it that is not completely useless for the purpose of giving execution and effect to that same branch of law or any part of it no more information will be to be had from it than from the koran of the evidence the judge commonly takes abridged memorandums of the argumentation none of these abridged minutes in general no use is made they are waste paper and as such dealt with for the moment they serve to assist his recollection when giving his charge to the jury the sole case in which any use is made of them is when application is made to another judicatory without a jury for a new trial by and with another jury in this case these minutes are conveyed somehow or other from the first judicatory to the second the argumentation not in this case instead of an appeal from the inferior judicatory to a superior on the ground of the evidence and the argumentation delivered to the inferior judicatory—is substituted an inquiry grounded on mutilated minutes for the correctness and completeness of which nobody is responsible—for the purpose of a determination whether evidence from the same source shall be elicited by another such inferior judicatory—no use whatever being made either of the argumentation or the evidence elicited by the inferior judicatory thus tortuously and awkwardly appealed from if to make good your claim it happens to you to have need of your adversarys confessional evidence you cannot have it without a suit in a judicatory called a court of equity nor in that judicatory to any the most simple question can you make sure of an answer from him in so short a time as a year—to a question to which if put to him by you in the presence of a judge as in a smalldebt court called a court of conscience a single moment would suffice you for extracting from him an answer and that an adequate one think of a nation in which a man at the head of the law will have the assurance to assert on all occasions that justice was and is the object of this system special pleading is a system of operations by which instead of the conjunct appearance of the parties in the first instance before the judge making their respective allegations subject to responsibility compensational and punitional in case of falsehood they are kept at a distance from the judges chamber for the purpose of causing to be delivered at intervals     of weeks or months their several allegations in the form of ready written discourses penned by their respective professional asssistants and without responsibility in any shape in case of falsehood special pleading is here utterly excluded what is it answer from beginning to end a perfect nuisance created and preserved in the teeth of the most obvious and recognised principles of justice in case of mendacity or temerity of assertion there will be responsibility compensational and punitional of evidence the elicitation performed vivâ voce by and in the presence of the judge throughout the whole course of the elicitation questions to be put arising out of the answers this is the course pursued wherever the obtainment of a correct clear and allcomprehensive conception of the appropriate facts belonging to the case is really an object of desire under the actual system the same individual in the character of a party is constantly exempted from that responsibility to which that same individual would in the character of a witness be as constantly subjected to what end but that under favour of this licence coupled with the exclusion from the eye and the ear of the judge and the scrutiny of crossinterrogations with the aid of questions arising immediately out of the answers he may be not merely invited but forced to that course of false assertion with factitious delay for months or years out of which profit to the amount of hundreds or thousands of pounds is by this system of mendacity fraud and deception extracted the system and course of procedure has for its professed object two things—  the obtaining a wellgrounded assurance respecting the facts alleged on both sides   the ascertaining the bearing of the law upon the facts the existence of which is on the ground of the several allegations believed by the judge now then as to the ascertainment of the facts if this course were really conducive to the professed end in any one case so would it be in every other if in any one sort of judicatory so would it be in every other conceive it now transported into the bosom of every family—into every committee of inquiry in the house of commons—into the judicatory of every justice of the peace and every sessions of justices of the peace suppose this course of inquiry and no other employed—but in vain should we tax our imagination in carrying it higher than the bosom of every family for how many weeks together—for how many days together—upon this footing could human society continue a project was on the carpet for giving to scotland the benefit of english special pleading the jurycourt it seems cannot go on without it great indeed must be the embarrassment thick the confusion portentous the expense when the enormity of it is too great even for those whose profit rises in proportion to it not much less perhaps still greater must be the embarrassment produced by the endeavour to substitute to this deleterious remedy another drawn from the same pharmacopœia the project is altogether a curious one by statute law to establish common law a rather more obvious more simple and if justice were the object a more effectual or rather the only effectual one would be by statutelaw to establish statutelaw the only objection is that the mode of conducting the business would if made as it ought to be and could be made be too effectual to uncognoscibility it would substitute universal notoriety to the maximum the minimum of vexation delay expense and consequently lawyers profit an oblique and indirect or fictitious way is the only way in which in this mode a conception such as it is as a rule of action can be grounded upon the assumption is that by competent authority a rule of action has been established and upon this assumption false to the perfect knowledge of all those who build upon it is grounded on each occasion the power they assume and exercise for these fifteen years past the utter impossibility of accomplishing on this plan in any tolerable degree the ends of justice has stood demonstrated but not those ends—on the contrary the ends diametrically opposite to them are on this occasion as on every other pursued where the workmen are lawyers and by the supineness of the people suffered to take their own course think of the impudence as well as the wickedness of these men so unaptly decorated with the name of judges sitting with the doors of their judicatories shut against the parties—the unhappy individuals kept out of sight and speech of each other and of the judge even when living both of them next door to the justicechamber and to what end to what but to fabricate a pretence how shallow it is every honest mind must see for setting at their expense their respective lawyers to pelt one another with these masses of absurdity and nonsense books upon books have been written and published to show how this trash may be manufactured to the greatest advantage—what a quantity of talent has been thus wasted of this series of altercation the whole use and purpose is the furnishing a pretence for the exaction of fees from the suitors for the emolument of the lawyers of all classes and grades neither to the number of the instruments by which this course of altercation is carried on nor to the length of any one of them nor consequently to the expense of the whole are there any certain limits as little are there to the length of the delay     thus organised and manufactured the whole of it being completely useless many are the thousands of pounds to which the expense—not small the number of years to which the delay—has thus been known to be swelled all this while not a syllable about the matter does the judge ever deign to know the fees go some of them to his own immediate use others to his profit in the shape of patronage through the hands of his instruments and nominees and for this remuneration not an atom of service does he perform the first and only occasion on which if at all any part of this altercation comes within his cognizance is when the stock of useless matter thus spun out comes at last to be exhausted a determination comes to be taken on the subject of the whole together even then not a tenth part of the contents of this lay stall is presented to the eyes or the ears of the judge by the advocates on each side those scraps are picked out which in the hurry of the moment are regarded by them as best suited to their respective purposes and the remainder is consigned to that neglect to which the whole is so well entitled in some cases the string of altercation terminates in what is called an issue and in these cases there is a question of fact which finds its way to another judicatory in which a jury is presided over by a judge before me lies a work on the subject of special pleading intituled on the principles of pleading in civil actions on looking into this work one sentiment that presents itself is a sentiment of regret called forth by the idea of the prodigious waste of mental labour and talent there employed applied to a subject essentially worthless and destined to disappear as soon as the light of truth shall have shone upon the subject raphael painting his cartoons al fresco upon a frozen pannel is the image that presents itself by this work of his the author superseded and converted into waste paper all the works of which before him the labour had been applied to this field his turn it will next be to be involved in the same fate of no lover of justice can it fail to be the wish and desire to see applied to the furtherance of justice that talent which without any imputation on the author has hitherto had no other occupation than the giving facility to the occupation of obtaining emolument by the giving increase to expense of which injustice is the real fruit under the name of justice ask how much written pleadings there should be in a suit ask first how much chaff and powdered bones there should be in a quartern loaf except for special and adequate reason in every case in every sort of case for giving execution and effect to the portion of law in question the course of procedure should be in everything the same no difference in any one case compared with any other much less a difference at the option of an individual on the pursuers side this feature of natural procedure compare it with the correspondent one in english technical procedure over a bottle or without a bottle before them between a priest of the established religion and a lawyer a dispute takes place and a scuffle ensues it occurs to the priest to make an instrument of revenge out of this and to betake himself to the law for vengeance the options that lie before him are—   action   indictment   information filed in the ordinary mode or by leave obtained of the judge   information ex officio filed by the attorneygeneral without need of such leave   libel in the ecclesiastical court termed also spiritual court suppose an information applied for in the ordinary way and refused—the attorneygeneral after this would he take upon him to file an information ex officio without leave applied for to the court who can say he may or may not it depends upon himself if the assailant be a duke and the person assaulted a priest and nothing more—probably in this case the attorneygeneral would not but suppose the assailant a bishop and the person assaulted a churchofengland priest a presbyterian layman or what is worse a unitarian priest very different now is the aspect worn by the case lord northington or lord thurlow either would have damned them both and bid them get about their business but lord eldon has no curses—but great doubts in every one of these cases the fact being by the supposition one and the same—not only the mode of proof and the shape in which the evidence is elicited is different but even the source from which the evidence is admitted an action the priest or bishop cannot maintain unless he has testimony other than his own at command or unless he has the means of affording adequate inducement to some one to give his evidence to the attorney that it may be put into the brief by which the instructions are given to the advocate called counsel—through whose lips for this purpose it has to make its way to the ears of the court what is it that he asks for is it money though it be but a farthing nothing he can say to get it is even if it be said under the sanction of an oath fit to be believed he is accordingly excluded from saying it is it     revenge everything he can say for the hope of gratifying the different passions is credible antecedently to his visit to the grand jury he may have made a like visit to a justice of the peace complaining to him of the breach made of the kings peace here then is another judicatory never yet was exemplified it may be said a case thus diversified as the above probably not but if not it really is not the fault of the law record in natural procedure—record in technical procedure—the instrument denominated a record—what if justice were the end in view would be the contents of it on the part of the judge the definitive decree with an account of the execution and effect given to it and the operations as well on the part of the judge as on the part of his subordinates and the parties and extraneous witnesses if any included in particular the evidence on which the several operations performed by the judge had been grounded would be introduced by the demand which had been made by the pursuer and the passage or passages in the text of the law on which that demand had been grounded if so it had happened that debate had taken place as to the import of the alleged portion of law for the applicability of the facts proved on either or both sides in relation to it—here would be a question of law and the interpretation put upon that occasion by the judge upon the law would form an incidental mass of matter proper to be entered but this is a sort of occurrence which comparatively speaking would be rare in a great majority of cases there never has been even in the most unsettled state of the law still less will there be under any tolerable improved state of the law any discussion respecting the bearing of the law upon the facts the common run of debts and common assaults are the occurrences by which the correspondent majority of the number of suits will have been produced the substance of the matter of which in every case the bulk of the record will be composed will be the peculiar and characteristic part of the matter being in each individual case different showing the ground on which the decree pronounced in that same individual case was founded other miscellaneous matters—such as any delay that had been produced either by the nature of the case or by reluctance on the part of parties or witnesses or misconduct on the part of judicial subordinates—will for one purpose or other need to be entered upon the record but they will be merely casual and collateral to the direct purpose of the suit that which will compose a constant and necessary part of the suit in every case is the matter of the demand itself—the matter of the defence if any and the evidence on which the demand and the defence if any was grounded thus much as to the matter belonging to the record now as to the matter of which under the technical system of procedure in use in english practice the instrument called a record is composed take in the first place the commonlaw courts—for in the sort of judicatories called equity courts the contents of the instrument called a record if indeed in these courts there be any instrument to which that denomination is authoritatively applied are altogether different an unrebuttable presumption this against one or the other and a presumption of no inconsiderable force against both but to begin with the commonlaw courts how stands the matter with regard to the evidence—what is done in relation to it answer absolutely nothing on this subject what it presents is total and constant silence of what nature then is the matter of which this is so regularly framed and carefully preserved document is composed answer with the exception of the decree called here judgment which in each class of cases is the same and a demand which is never expressed in the terms in which it comes from the party whose demand it is scarce anything but what is either irrelevant or to the knowledge of everybody in every case false as to the judge whose judgment it purports and pretends to be—never unless by some extraordinary accident has it come within his cognizance it is made for him by a sort of machinery like the turning of a wheel as to the incidental occurrences before alluded to entry is indeed for the most part if not in every instance made of them made but on what instrument not on the record but on this or that book distinct from it and not referred to in it the consequence is that to almost every purpose the information afforded by the record amounts to next to nothing not so as to mischievous purposes for purposes of that description are served by it in abundance mischief to the parties by the load of needles and useless expense—mischief to the whole community by the veil of obscurity and mystery with which it contributes to cover the whole system of no breach of duty however numerous such breaches may have been on the part of any of the actors of the judicial drama does it afford any information consequently to no such breach of duty does it afford any check not a particle does it contain of evidence but at the same time not sparing is the quantity of matter composed of allegations in these allegations however the matter is a medley composed of a mixture in indistinguishable proportions of truth and notorious falsehood     nothing do these pleadings such is the name by which they are distinguished—nothing do they contain of that matter on which under the name of evidence the decree will have been grounded what they are composed of is inferences drawn on both sides by anticipation from the evidence expected or pretended to be expected to be elicited a proper record as has been seen would be a plain statement of every relevant occurrence that happens to have taken place in the course of a suit sentence—special rational causes excepted the imperative decree or say the sentence should be pronounced at the same time with the opinative decree as in nonpenal so in penal cases special cause may be—time necessary for inquiry into the circumstances of the parties in english practice when the means of repression is determined by the jury as it is when compensation alone is awarded the jury are never allowed a moment between the pronunciation of the opinative and that of the imperative decree the opinative and imperative are one and the same but when the means of repression is determined by the judge as it is where punishment under the name of punishment is awarded an interval of days weeks months perhaps even years is made to have place between the pronunciation of the opinative decree by the jury and the imperative by the judge all this while the defendant is kept in a state of mental torment of costs increase to a considerable amount is unavoidable and to the quantum of the amount there are no limits this determination which the unlearned are held capable of coming to and forced to come to accordingly at once—is it that the learned judge after his twenty years lucubrations is unqualified for coming to no but the true and only cause of this uncertainty is the profit which it puts into the pockets of the lawyers of both classes professional and official and the power—the arbitrary and tyrannical power which the judges have been suffered thus to place in their own hands in natural procedure no needless concurrence necessitated in technical procedure needless concurrence abundantly necessitated examples of needless concurrence necessitated are—   in nonpenal law in conveyancing sinecure trusteeships consequence needless delay vexation and expense in obtaining concurrence at the hands of the original trustees much more at the hands of their representatives   in procedure equity procedure necessitating the concurrence of a defendant in the transfer made of his property instead of making the transfer uninterventionally by the authority of the judicatory consequence delay c as above to evillyconscious defendants a premium on noncompliance   in penal procedure under romebred law rendering the confession of the defendant necessary to his punishment and for the obtaining of this confession applying torture consequence in case of inability to endure the torture infliction of punishment on the innocent in case of ability impunity to the guilty in respect of ulterior punishment natural procedure the judge on issuing a mandate to any person suitor or nonsuitor requiring him to do or to forbear from doing in furtherance of justice a certain act to particularize beforehand the remedy or remedies punitional or satisfactional or both of which at the charge of the individual in question application will be made in the event of noncompliance with such mandate technical procedure for the purpose in question judicial power needlessly employed in causing or endeavouring to cause the individual on whom the obligation is intended to be imposed to give the appearance of consent by his signature attached to an instrument for that purpose appointed the evils attached to this practice are the following—   delay vexation and expense—partly natural and unavoidable—partly fictitious resulting from the performance of this needless and useless operation   needless and useless complication no reason is there why in one case more than in another consent on the part of a suitor should be necessary to give validity to the exercise appointed by the legislature to be given to the functions of a judge natural procedure—investigatorial process by means of indicative evidence—needful alike in all cases—employed in all cases technical procedure—confined to certain particular cases natural for each subsequent operation time fixed according to the circumstances of each individual case from the examination of the party or his proxy then present in the judicatory technical for each sort of operation one and the same period of time fixed by a general rule thence infinity to one the time is either more or less than sufficient if more     than sufficient the consequence is needless delay if less than sufficient needless expense employed in the endeavour successful or unsuccessful to obtain further time there is also needless delay in this case the power of depriving another of his liberty which the technical system gives to any one who applies for it and without responsibility on his part the natural system offers it is true to any one but in no case without the responsibility by eventual punishment to which he is subjected in case of mendacity so in the same manner is any extraneous party who is called as a witness to which responsibility when the case requires it is added the obligation of finding security either real by property of his own actually pledged by himself or by a conjunct obligation entered into by a juridical bondman who binds himself to concur in affording compensation to the defendant in the event of any abuse of power exercised at his charge the female sex that part of it which is in the married state are more strongly interested in the establishment of the natural system of procedure than are persons who belong to the male for cruelty on the part of the husband at the charge of the wife no relief is so much as professed to be given by any judicatories but those which belong to the ecclesiastical branch but inadequate as is the remedy thus applicable so great is the expense of application for a chance of it as of itself suffices to establish a denial of justice in nineteen out of every twenty cases not to say of ninetynine out of every hundred the class which being most exposed to injury in this shape and as such is most in need of remedy is the class to which all remedy is denied the fundamental principles of natural procedure are—   publicity maximized   exclusion of middlemen maximized   initiatory applications not epistolary but oral maximized   penal security against falsity universalized with warning of ditto   no one made defendant but on determinate and substantial grounds   epistolary statement receivable to save delay and vexation but never definitive oral interrogation always addible   mode of procedure for the discovery of the appropriate truth the same in all cases   delay vexation and expense minimized in all cases the fundamental principles of technical procedure are—   publicity minimized   number of middlemen maximized   initiatory application by party to judge not admitted   penal security against falsity—extent minimized distance from commencement of suit maximized   at the pleasure of every plaintiff any person made defendant antecedently to the allegation of any grounds determinate or undeterminate   recently established exception excepted and that flagrantly inadequate liberty of any man violated by confinement at the will of any man in the character of plaintiff   mode of procedure on pretence of the establishment of truth different in different cases   aggregate of delay vexation and expense maximized fictitious delay established in an infinity of proportion according to occasion and pretence appendix a initial sketch of the procedure code the procedure code as well as the judiciary establishment has for its business the avoidance of the evils opposite to the several ends of justice opposite to the declared ends are—  misdecision   nondecision in cases which call for decision they accordingly have for their common business the providing of the requisite securities against these same evils to know and provide those securities it will be necessary to ascertain the cause of these same evils these causes may be distinguished into—   those which are liable to have their origin in the state of the judicial establishment   those which are liable to have their origin in the system of procedure nondecision has for its causes—   noninstitution in cases which require institution   nontermination in cases in which institution has taken place causes of noninstitution are—   apprehension of partiality to the prejudice of the pursuers side   inability to defray the expense   apprehension of expense vexation and delay to an amount preponderant in value over the chance of success     causes of noninstitution having their seat in the judicial establishment—   insufficiency in the number of the judicatories   multitude of judges in the same judicatory apprehension thence of needless delay on the several occasions for decision causes of noninstitution having their seat in the state of the procedure code—   magnitude of the expense of institution   apprehension of the magnitude of the expense where there is much delay incident to continuance and preparatory to decision and execution in favour of the pursuers demand causes of delay having their seat in the procedure code with their correspondent securities—   fixation of time for the several steps correspondent security against delay exceptions excepted reception and accersition of parties witnesses and evidenceholders in each suit as soon as the time in the several cases admits so as not to accerse or prehend any individual earlier than necessary   the not having elicited in the most instructive manner the whole mass of the evidence bearing upon each fact in question correspondent security giving to each judge the faculty and the obligation of eliciting in that same most instructive manner as much as possible of that same mass of evidence the whole if possible except in so far as the expense vexation and delay necessary to that effect shall exceed the advantage gained in respect of superior probability of right decision instead of assigning to one judge the elicitation of part of the evidence and to another the elicitation of other parts or to one and the same judge the elicitation of one part of it in one mode to wit a superior mode and of other parts in another—to wit an inferior mode the advantage from the giving to one and the same judge who is to decide upon the fact in question the whole of the evidence as above the whole of it in the most instructive form—will be pointed out elsewhere admit at the same time the nonnecessity of giving to the ultimately deciding judge the whole of the evidence in so far as one part relates to one fact in question another to another not connected with it at the same time where it can be done without preponderant disadvantage in respect of delay vexation and expense of course it will be best on every account that the ultimately deciding judge should have for the basis of his decision all the several facts in question bearing upon the suit together with all the masses of evidence respectively bearing upon them state now the wanton departures from this rule on the part of the englishbred and romebred systems of procedure with the causes of these aberrations—to wit the inaptitude of the authors of the system in respect of moral and intellectual aptitude principally moral they deriving to themselves a sinister advantage from the aberrations englishbred law aberrations i divers judicatories employing each of them a different mode of procedure in this respect whereas the course of procedure best adapted to the purpose of extracting the truth of the case—the most instructive mass of evidence in relation to the several facts—is in every individual case one and the same exceptions excepted examples—   proceedings in case of an action in kings bench common pleas or exchequer   proceedings in case of an indictment in kings bench   proceedings in case of an information in kings bench   proceedings in case of an indictment in the old bailey or on the circuit in the court of oyer and terminer or the general sessions of the peace   proceedings in the romebred ecclesiastical and admiralty courts in a penal case   proceedings in the romebred ecclesiastical and admiralty courts in a civil case ii in one and the same judicatory proceeding in different courses in this respect and accordingly giving to the suit in those several cases different denominations examples—   in the kings bench proceeding by action indictment and information over and above the cases in which the judicatory exercises a controul over other judicatories   in the exchequer proceedings by action and by bill in equity iii in a suit on the occasion of one and the same individual demand transferring the suit from one judicatory to another in all cases indiscriminately and without any reason derived from the particular circumstances of the individual case examples—   in an action causing the suit to be commenced in the kings bench at westminster and from thence carried to the court of nisi prius either in westminster or in london at the sittings in or after term or in some country town at the court of assize sitting no more than twice ayear for a few days in each town   so on an indictment or information on the above occasions at the commencement of the suit in some instances proceeding without evidence in others with incomplete evidence on behalf of one side of the suit in others with incomplete evidence on the other side of the suit examples—   on an action proceeding without evidence   0 allowing the pursuer to harass the defendant and keep him in hot water for half a year without having made any ground for his demand   on an indictment at the commencement eliciting evidence on the pursuers side only that evidence not perfectly elicited and when elicited not made any use of on the occasion of the ultimate decision made use of no otherwise than to the purpose of determining whether the suit shall go on and evidence be elicited in a perfect manner at nisi prius half a year afterwards   on the occasion of an information commencing the suit by evidence but by evidence elicited in the most uninstructive mode and that evidence wasted by not being employed in forming the ground for the ultimate decision   on the occasion of a bill in equity eliciting evidence only on behalf of one side of the suit to wit the pursuers and that only the defendants disserving evidence the allegations of the pursuer not being admitted as evidence but being knowingly and purposely allowed and required to be false the elicitation of the evidence of extraneous witnesses being postponed to an indefinitely distant period and then elicited in no other than a mode eminently uninstructive in the establishment of these arrangements immorality has soared to such a pitch of impudence as will be matter of astonishment to any future age in which these abuses and the others connected with them shall have received a remedy in the case of an action at common law subjecting any man at the pleasure of every other man to the torment of litigation for an indefinite length of time—for years together if such be the tormentors pleasure without requiring any ground whatsoever in the case of a bill in equity not only not requiring on the part of the pursuer any ground whatever in the shape of true evidence but admitting and even forcing him on pain of miscarriage to launch out into a string of false allegations which being notoriously false are not and cannot be employed in the character of evidence order of elicitation as between evidenceholder and evidenceholder— no fixed order can be otherwise than mischievous what order will be most convenient it is impossible to know otherwise than from the particular circumstances of each individual case rules and circumstances on which the choice depends—   of the evidence of two evidenceholders a and b if the evidence of a and the effect of it can be understood without reference to the evidence of b while the evidence of b cannot be understood without reference to the evidence of a let the evidence of a be first elicited if while neither can be understood without the other or each may be understood without the other while in consequence of distance or ill health one of them can be elicited before the other let that one be first elicited which as above is capable of being first elicited the first evidence capable of being elicited will of course be that of the applicant but after that it is impossible to decide correctly by any general rule whether the evidence of the proposed defendant if there be but one or the joint demand or the evidence of a cointeressee of the applicant will be to be heard to most advantage in regard to a defendant all you can say in favour of his priority as between him and a cointeressee of the applicant is that a decision should not be given to his prejudice without his having an opportunity of being heard but this applies not without exception to any but penal cases for in civil cases to a considerable extent decisions affecting a defendants interest will always require to be given in cases in which by reason of distance or other causes he cannot have been heard only in these cases the decision should be provisional being liable to amendment in his favour in the event of his showing sufficient cause in the english system one circumstance that contributes to keep out of sight the demand for an indefinitely variable order of elicitation is the vast distance between the time of the delivery of the demand and the earliest time at which any ultimately employable evidence can be received to wit the halfyear between the completion of the chain of pleadings and in country causes the time of the circuit so vast is this time that in most cases all parties on both sides have time to prepare and produce their evidences but though in perhaps    instances out of  00 this time is some dozen or some hundred times more than sufficient cases there will always be in which it is not so much as sufficient in these cases application will be made for further time and if the case be that the defendant is in the wrong and his mind in a state of evilconsciousness here is another halfyear at least gained to him for the enjoyment of the fruits of his iniquity—to take advantage of his own wrong—while the lawyers of both classes official and professional are made sharers in his sinister profit by the price at which they concur respectively in the selling to him this undue advantage waste of evidence coupled mostly with the elicitation of evidence in an unapt shape—   testimonial evidence elicited in its best shape is elicited by vivâ voce reception and     undiquâque interrogation accompanied part passu with minutation followed by recordation   elicited in its next best shape it is elicited by scriptitive reception and undiquâque interrogation in the same manner backed by the assurance of the witnesses being upon occasion subjected to interrogation as to the same points vivâ voce evidence in its best shape is not yet at its maximum of aptitude unless subjected to amendment upon occasion—not only to reelicitation in that same best shape but to elicitation in the scriptitious shape of course no such supplemental evidence ought to be elicited without mandate from the judge with or without previous opportunity afforded of opposition when evidence is wasted the waste is the less to be regretted when being taken in an utterly unapt shape or a less apt shape where it might have been taken in a perfectly apt shape the shape it is taken in is one in which it ought not to have been taken   in the grandjury hearing antecedently to trial on indictment what evidence is taken is taken in the secret mode without opportunity of counterinterrogation or counterevidence   on the occasion of the equity mode of elicitation by bill concluding with interrogatories although so far as regards the interrogatories the shape is not inapt yet being necessarily introduced by a tissue of notoriously mendacious assertions it is in so far elicited in a supremely unapt shape in the affidavit shape it is elicited subject to counterevidence in the same bad shape but not subject to counterinterrogation in any shape much less subject to subsequential and emendatory undiquâque interrogation in the oral shape in this case the shape in which it is received is one in which it ought not on any occasion to be received in some sorts of suits it is received in no other than this bad shape and forms the sole groundwork which the ultimate decision can ever have these are—   in civil cases in all the judicatories all contestation relative to incidental demands made on the occasion of a suit except that in which the ultimate decision called the trial has place   on an information it has place on the occasion of the preparatory inquiry whether evidence elicited in the only good shape shall be received here it is elicited altogether in waste the more expensive mode of inquiry by evidence in this its worst shape being employed antecedently to the eventual employment of evidence in relation to the same facts elicited in the best shape on the occasion of the preparatory examination by a justice of peace in a case of felony the evidence is in the first place taken in the best shape but the whole of what on that occasion is taken in that best shape is taken in waste not being suffered to be employed on the occasion of the ultimate inquiry called the trial on every account the sinister interest of the judges is engaged in preserving the custom of taking the evidence in its worst shape nor is it exposed to doubt that it is by that same sinister interest that the custom of taking it in those bad shapes was produced   the interest of the purse this interest they have given themselves by the price which immediately or through the medium of their official subordinates and professional connexions they have established themselves in the habit of exacting by allowance from and in partnership with the government which on those same occasions has given itself the advantage of the sale and denial of justice   the interest of the pillow in the best shape—the oral shape—the judges have the long and laborious occupation of superintending and occasionally assisting the elicitation of the testimony of the witnesses that testimony is frequently drawn into tedious length by inaptitude in all its shapes on the part of the witnesses to wit moral intellectual judicial and appropriate relevant talent in its worst shape—the affidavit shape—it is presented to them through a channel the most agreeable to them of any in which it is possible to be presented their old friends and associates impregnated with the same sinister interest and the same stock of ideas acting in a sphere which is subordinate to their own and by which their style of address is kept constantly in a strain of reverential homage appendix b accounttaking judicatories there is a certain species of cases which will naturally appear to create a demand for a particular sort of judicatory acting by a particular set of rules these are the cases of which in common practice cognizance has been given to a special judicatory distinguishable from the ordinary ones by the name of an accounttaking judicatory by an accounttaking judicatory understand a sort of judicatory which has no other     employment than the settling the balance or say difference due as between one party and another in consequence of money or moneys worth disposed of at divers times by each at the desire or otherwise for the benefit of the other of the common characteristics of these cases the principal one and that an essential one is this on the occasion of the inquiry carried on between the parties opposition of interests has place but not unless by accident actual contestation from this principal characteristic arises another which accordingly may be termed a derivative one the evidence on which the decision is grounded consists mainly of a piece of written evidence the trustworthiness of which has not for its assurance the customary securities of counterinterrogation or by means of the ceremony called an oath punishment in case of falsehood a voucher is in english practice the name given to a piece of evidence to which this effect is given of a judicatory of this sort the ordinary occupation consists accordingly in the reception given by the judge to the vouchers presented by or on behalf of one of the parties on one side of the account stand the articles which the party admits that he has received of which reception no other proof it is manifest need be required on the other the articles which he alleges he has delivered or caused to be delivered and of the several acts of the delivery or assemblages of acts of delivery the several vouchers are exhibited as conclusive evidence but ere an account can be settled in a manner conformable to justice decision on the subject of divers collateral demands may incidentally require to be delivered each such demand being of a nature to be contested and thereby constituted the matter of a distinguishablyseparate suit of these demands examples are as follows—   application for the disallowance of a voucher on the ground of its alleged unauthenticity   allegation of a fraud in respect of the nonperformance or malperformance of some service the due performance of which is attributed by the voucher   application for liberty to exhibit evidence of the performance of some service of which it is alleged by one party that it was rendered by him to the other but that no voucher for it was received or that an appropriate voucher for it having been received was by some accident lost in any of which cases either the value of the service will of course be lost to the applicant or in proof of its having been performed such other evidence as the case happens to afford must be exhibited and received an account brought before a judge to be settled by him between the parties may thus be considered as a congeries of suits each party in case of contestation being pursuer in respect of the payment of every sum of money or other service which he alleges as being due to him and defendant in respect of each such service as being demanded at his hands he refuses to perform here then are in this as in other cases two parties interested and a judicatory which on the subject of each such demand is to decide between them certain cases however there are and even to a vast extent in which on no more than one side is any party seen acting on the other hand considering the variety of the matter above designated under the name of collateral matter that would be liable to come under consideration—no sufficient reason appears why on this occasion the qualifications requisite on the part of an ordinary judge should be regarded as superfluous still however a reason occurs and one which seems a sufficient one for committing this species of matter to a particular species of judicatory this is that a judgedepute whose time was exclusively or principally employed in the judication of business of so narrow a description could not thereby be in a situation to acquire experience extensive enough for forming the qualification of a judge at large on this and other accounts a competent person would scarcely be willing to accept for this business a pecuniary remuneration so small as what would content him in the other case business of this sort being an object of general dislike a judgeprincipal would not be able to obtain deputes in sufficient numbers on any other terms than in the case of each individual an engagement not to employ him on this business on all these accounts the most eligible arrangement seems to be the committing the location of functionaries for this purpose to the justiceminister at once or that that minister should locate an audit judgeprincipal and he locate deputes in such number as he should find sufficient appendix c british india—jury system      dear sir— in consequence of the good countenance shown last session in both houses when the subject of juries was incidentally brought forward mr wynn appears to have set himself to work at something—i could not exactly discover what but there is much virtue in a beginning and as i know mr wynn to have been seeking information on the subject from the very best authority he could resort to—sir a johnstone—i am     full of hopes trusting as i do that you will keep your eye on the thing in the house so that the indian minister may be encouraged as well as watched i would indeed it were possible to send out sir a johnstone to india to introduce native juries there as he so well effected it in ceylon—for i confess i have many fears for the result of the experiment on account of the unfriendly hands to which it must necessarily be entrusted what judge from scotland to bengal usque auroram ad gangem ever cordially loved to divide his power with a jury but in this case we have not to contend with that proclivity alone or in its simplest form the kings judges in the royal courts at the three great cities calcutta madras and bombay will probably not much like having to consult with juries henceforth in civil quasicriminal cases in making assessment of damages—or where the parties desire a juryverdict in praference to a benchverdict but the kings judges have never been accustomed to act in criminal matters without juries and they will rather feel favourable than otherwise to the admission of natives and halfcastes the danger i fear is from the companys servants who will have the sole conduct of the experiment in the provincial courts by far the most important part of it inasmuch as there it is wholly new to the people as to the judges and is in fact a politic and scarcely perceptible beginning—of teaching our subjects to take a share in selfgovernment and of giving them an interest in the support of our foreign regime to this i have no sort of doubt the company and their servants will bear no goodwill it is not in the nature of things they should if we consider who they are and how chosen that represent the company in england—and who they are and how brought up as a separate caste from early youth that compose the servants abroad and are the monopolisers of all office and power there—rising from the bottom to the top of a list of placemen all aspiring to hoard and bring away all they can bound to india by no sympathies—no permanency—no root in the land in the infancy of the meditated native juries everything will depend upon the provincial judges but where shall we look for a liberal philanthropic mind like sir a johnstone auxious that the thing should work well careful in selecting—in instructing—in discreetly leading the inexperienced and illqualified jurors in the early stages of the institution the native officers of our sepoys have all risen from the ranks—are all taken from the humble elasses of society—métayers dairyness and soldiers children but they have a plain and simple code of laws to deal with not simpler than might easily be compiled for all ordinary issues civil or criminal fit for our proposed juries and they are instructed discreetly in the law and have the evidence expounded by a european judgeadvocate in general courtsmartial—and by a european officer of their regiment completely skilled in minor courts in consequence though the entire administration of military law has been left in the hands of these native juries as they may be called even in the most ticklish times they are scarcely ever known to do wrong this has prevailed for sixty or seventy years from the same classes or better classes of society the civil jurors may be taken and the thing if not loaded with absurd and revolting oaths too much may be converted into a mark of distinction but all this depends on the companys servants the european officers of the sepoys are also companys servants but mark the difference of position as to checks the european judgeadvocate is selected for his talents out of a mass of candidates all quick to discern his faults and aspire to his shoes if he neglect his duty the court in which he and his native jurors sit is an open tribunal—white and black auditors frequent it the native officers are commissioned—they must be treated as gentlemen not bullied or put down with contempt the proceedings are all recorded saving the opinions of individuals which are strictly secrets they must go up to a division commanding officer who may be of the kings service—to the judgeadvocate to report on—to the commanderinchief who is always a kings officer and therefore of a different corps from the original european judge finally they may be handed up to government and are published invariably in general orders with the comments of the commander on them to every regiment but what checks are provided for the conduct of a companys civil servant what shall efficiently controul exaction and tyranny if he be capable of such what shall keep down his illwill to the jury system his jealousy of the partial eclipse which his autocracy in the province must suffer his habitual insolence of office the white mans—the rich mans—the civil servants feelings towards the black—the poor—the low man nothing but the feeble formal regular channel controul of official superiors distant many degrees of latitude or longitude perhaps—and all belonging to the same corps with the supposed offender there is no vicinage of his equals—no community to stand in awe of no one independent of his direct authority or indirect influence yes the tribunals are open—open to the povertyblasted ignorant timid black man who ventures to wage such a war with the great man of his district—open—but with every stage     loaded with costs stamps and lawtaxation greater in proportion to the extreme indigence of our wellground eastern subjects than those of england—and more remote more inaccessible than even our courts if no better checks than all this be provided the attempt to put natives on juries will utterly fail i know of but one companys judge in india to whom i would commit such a charge with full confidence      but he is of the liberal faction and not in favour with his brethren what then is to be done to prevent this excellently meant measure from miscarrying there is but one efficacious remedy and to that must we come at last in india as at home—publicity shame and intimidation are its offspring and bodies or classes of men i fear in all countries must be governed by these and by nothing else so effectually none are so powerfully and beneficially acted on by publicity and its consequences as judges—to none is it more happily applicable it is not the mere opening the doors of a court at which few attend and fewer still can interpose on the spot to resist abuse it is the reporting of those present to those absent—by those who have quick ears and ready memories or glib pens—to those at a distance who are capable of appreciating and judging and acting if need be the press—the free and anonymous comments of the press can alone do this and terrify evildoers let its abuse be subject to all the severity of your libel laws superadd thereon the sixact penalty of deportation if you will but let the penalties be inflicted after trial with or even without a jury so it be done judicially—done after hearing and determining in public and not vindictively privately summarily and by the executive power—by the fellowservants of the offended functionary the press to do any good in a country like india must be anonymous— st because who will dare openly to bell the cat in a country where the fortunes of every man depend on the nostril breath of the despots and their servants to whom england has delivered over india leasebound hand and foot secondly because there would be a violation of decorum in a servant criticising his master an inferior his superiors misdeeds which is entirely saved by the anonymousness of the criticism separating effectually the question of who writes from that of what is written now at this unhappy moment in india a man may not report in the newspapers the verbatim completed proceedings of a court of justice still less make any comments on what passes very recently mr     the editor of a bombay newspaper has been transported at a few days notice to england via china—ruined in short for reporting what he offered to prove by multitudes of witnesses on oath to be a literal and true report of what passed in court he was not allowed to do this but was required by governor     and his council at the instigation of the kings judges—    and    —to admit that what he had published was false or to be ruined he was accordingly transported the judges not choosing to exert their power in their own court of raising the question of contempt such are the facts they speak for themselves if such be the system approved of at home and to be acted on abroad of what avail can it be to make judicial reforms of any sort but in particular what rational hope can there be of effecting so great a change as that of admitting the natives of india to take any real share in the administration of justice among themselves but we shall be told if the press be set free to touch on judicial matters who shall restrain it in politics or hinder it from becoming the vehicle of safe complaint against oppression as to the latter what honest man or honest government considering itself the equal protector of all its subjects would wish to shut up any avenue by which the complaints of the weak and the wronged may possibly reach its ear or at least intimidate the wrongdoer but in respect to political discussion through the press this very governor himself has admitted as you may see in the oriental herald that there is not a shadow of danger in respect to the natives and most true it is that not one in a million is capable of comprehending the most common discussions on politics though able enough to understand the use of publishing their complaints aloud it is for the sake of keeping down the europeans and halfcastes and of keeping up the arbitrary system of the company and gratifying the haughtiness and official insolence of the privileged caste that the authorities in leadenhallstreet and in india to a man oppose anything like freedom of opinion they feel perhaps that the company could not long stand against the force of public opinion and are acting in natural selfdefence are you aware that in india there are no institutions no bodies no corporations—no two men in short who have a right to lay their heads together and petition the government using the plural we a single individual may no doubt bell the cat if he please but all meetings are as strictly forbidden as the use of types or expurgated books is prohibited even to europeans in the old slave colonies of england or the united states where the state of society is so fearfully delicate there are no laws against the press generally but woe to the printer or editor who should use his to excite the slaves to revolt or even run hard against the vitiated feelings of the slaveowning majority if he did not starve for want of congenial     readers woe to him if he should come before an infuriated jury of overseers and slaveattorneys on an easily trumpedup indictment for seditious libel can we not then in india a handful as we are of whites trust sufficiently to the esprit de corps and the sense of common safety to deter an editor if want of subscribers could not cool the quixote from exciting revolt and persuading the native to cut his own and his fellow europeans throats but i shall not further pursue this branch of the argument my object is mainly to show that without a press without institutions without rights of person or property without the privilege of using freely their skill industry and capital without safe and organized means of complaint or petition—europeans who in india are as yet the only considerable class capable of estimating and influencing the conduct of public men are powerless and helpless and that the introduction of jurytrial or any other improvement that depends materially on the conduct of those who are to set the machine in motion to be other than a mockery and waste of time must be accompanied by some safe and easy means of embodying public opinion on the spot where alone it can have that force in reacting on the judges of which delay and distance so effectually deprive the injured when it has to travel hither           to jeremy bentham esq sir alexander johnston   th may      charles w williams wynn from the right honourable sir alexander johnston to the right honourable charles w williams wynn president of the board of controul   th may      dear sir— i have the pleasure at your request to give you an account of the plan i have adopted while chiefjustice and first member of his majestys council in ceylon for introducing trial by jury into that island and for extending the right of sitting upon juries to every halfcaste native as well as to every other native of the country to whatever caste or religious persuasion he might belong i shall explain to you the reasons which induced me to propose this plan the mode in which it was carried into effect and the consequences with which its adoption has been attended the complaints against the former system for administering justice in ceylon were that it was dilatory expensive and unpopular the defects of that system arose from the little value which the natives of the country attached to a character for veracity—from the total want of interest which they manifested for a system in the administration of which they themselves had no share—from the difficulty which european judges who were not only judges of law but also judges of fact experienced in ascertaining the degree of credit which they ought to give to native testimony—and finally from the delay in the proceedings of the court which were productive of great inconvenience to the witnesses who attended the sessions and great expense to the government which defrayed their costs the obvious way of remedying these evils in the system of administering justice was—first to give the natives a direct interest in that system by imparting to them a considerable share in its administration secondly to give them a proper value for a character for veracity by making such a character the condition upon which they were to look for respect from their countrymen and that from which they were to hope for promotion in the service of their government thirdly to make the natives themselves who from their knowledge of their countrymen can decide at once upon the degree of credit which ought to be given to native testimony judges of fact and thereby shorten the duration of trials relieve witnesses from a protracted attendance on the courts and materially diminish the expense of the government the introduction of trial by jury into ceylon and the extension of the right of sitting upon juries to every native of the island under certain modifications seemed to me the most advisable method of attaining these objects having consulted the chief priests of the budhoo religion in as far as the chingalese in the southern part of the island—and the brahmins of ramiseram madura and jafua in as far as the hindoos of the northern parts of the island were concerned—i submitted my plan for the introduction of trial by jury into ceylon to the governor and council of that island sir t maitland the then governor of the island and the other members or the council thinking the adoption of my plan an object of great importance to the prosperity of the island and fearing lest objections might be urged against it in england from the novelty of the measure—no such rights as those which i proposed to grant to the natives of ceylon ever having been granted to any native of india—sent me officially as first member of the council to england with full authority to urge in the strongest manner the adoption of the measure under such modifications as his majestys ministers might on my representations deem expedient after the question had been maturely considered in england a charter passed the great seal extending the right of sitting upon juries in criminal cases to every native of ceylon in the manner in which i had proposed and on my return to ceylon     with this charter in november      its provisions were immediately carried into effect by me in order to enable you to form some idea of the manner in which the jurytrial is introduced amongst the natives and helfcastes of ceylon i shall explain to you—first what qualities a native of ceylon to be a juryman  dly how the jurymen are summoned at each session  dly how they are chosen at each trial and  thly how they receive the evidence and deliver their verdict every native of ceylon provided he be a freeman has attained the age of    and is a permanent resident in the island is qualified to sit on juries the fiscal or sheriff of the province as soon as a criminal session is fixed for his province summons a considerable number of jurymen of each caste taking particular care that no juryman is summoned out of his turn or so as to interfere with any agricultural or manufacturing pursuits in which he may be occupied or with any religious ceremony at which his caste may require his attendance on the first day of the session the names of all the jurymen who are summoned are called over and the jurymen as well as all the magistrates and policeofficers attend in court and hear the charge delivered by the judge the prisoners are then arraigned every prisoner has a right to be tried by thirteen jurymen of his own caste unless some reason why the prisoner should not be tried by jurymen of his own caste can be urged to the satisfaction of the court by the advocatefiscal who in ceylon holds an office very nearly similar to that held in scotland by the lord advocate or unless the prisoner himself from believing people of his own caste to be prejudiced against him should apply to be tried either by thirteen jurymen of another caste or by a jury composed of halfcastes or europeans as soon as it is decided of what caste the jury is to be composed the registrar of the court puts into an urn which stands in a conspicuous part of the court a very considerable number of the names of jurymen of that class out of which the jury is to be formed he continues to draw the names out of the urn the prisoner having a right to object to five peremptorily and to any number for cause until he has drawn the names of thirteen jurymen who have not been objected to those thirteen jurymen are then sworn according to the forms of their respective religions to decide upon the case according to the evidence and without partiality the advocatefiscal then opens the case for the prosecution through on interpreter if necessary to the jury and proceeds to call all the witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence is taken down through an interpreter if necessary in the hearing of the jury by the judge the jury having a right to examine and the prisoner to crossexamine any of the above witnesses when the case for the prosecution is closed the prisoner states what he has to urge in his defence and calls his witnesses the jury having a right to examine and the prosecutors to crossexamine them their evidence being taken down by the judge the prosecutor is seldom or ever unless in very particular cases allowed to reply or call any witnesses in reply the case for the prosecution and for the prisoner being closed the judge through an interpreter when necessary recapitulates the evidence to the jury from his notes adding such observations as may occur to him on the occasion the jury after deliberating upon the case either in the jurybox or if they wish to retire in a room close to the court deliver their verdict through their foreman in open court that verdict being the opinion of the majority of them the most scrupulous care is taken that the jury never separate nor communicate with any person whatever from the moment they are sworn till their veroict is delivered as aforesaid and has been publicly recorded by the registrar the number of native jurymen of every caste in ceylon is so great and a knowledge beforehand what persons are to compose a jury in any particular case is so uncertain that it is almost impossible for any person whatever may be his influence in the country either to bias or to corrupt a jury the great number of jurymen that are returned by the fiscal or sheriff to serve at each sessions—the impartial manner in which the names of the jurymen are drawn—the right which the prisoner and prosecutor may exercise of objecting to each jurymen as his name is drawn—the strictness which is observed by the court in preventing all communication between the jurymen when they are once sworn and every other person till they have delivered their verdict give great weight to their decision the native jurymen being now judges of fact and the european judges only judges of law one european judge only is now necessary where formerly when they were judges both of law and fact two or sometimes three were necessary the native jurymen from knowing the different degrees of weight which may safely be given to the testimony of their countrymen decide upon questions of fact with so much more promptitude than europeans could do that since the introduction of trial by jury no trial lasts above a day and no session above a week or ten days at farthest whereas before the introduction of trial by jury a single trial used sometimes to last six weeks or two months and a single session not unfrequently for three months all the natives who attend the courts as jurymen obtain so much information during their attendance relative to the modes of proceeding and the rules of evidence     that since the establishment of jurytrial government have been enabled to find among the halfcaste and native jurymen some of the most efficient and respectable native magistrates in the country who under the controul of the supreme court at little or no expense to government administer justice in inferior cases to the native inhabitants the introduction of the trial by native juries—at the same time that it has increased the efficiency and dispatch of the court and has relieved both prisoners and witnesses from the hardships which they incurred from the protracted delay of the criminal sessions—has independent of the savings it enabled the ceylon government to make immediately on its introduction since afforded that government an opportunity of carrying into effect in the judicial department of the island a plan for a permanent saving of ten thousand pounds ayear as appears by my report quoted in page   of the printed collection of papers herewith sent no man whose character for honesty or veracity is impeached can be enrolled on the list of jurymen the circumstance of a mans name being upon the juryroll is a proof of his being a man of unexceptionable character and is that to which he appeals in case his character be attacked in a court of justice or in case he solicits his government for promotion in their service as the rolls of jurymen are revised by the supreme court at every session they operate as a most powerful engine towards making the people of the country more attentive than they used to be in their adherence to truth the right of sitting upon juries has given the natives of ceylon a value for character which they never felt before and has raised in a very remarkable manner the standard of their moral feelings all the natives of ceylon who are enrolled as jurymen conceive themselves to be as much a part as the european judges themselves are of the government of their country and therefore feel since they have possessed the right of sitting upon juries an interest which they never felt before in upholding the british government of ceylon the beneficial consequence of this feeling is strongly exemplified in the difference between the conduct which the native inhabitants of the british settlements in ceylon observed in the kandian war of   0  and that which they observed in the kandian war of      in the war between the british and kandian governments in   0  which was before the introduction of trial by jury the native inhabitants of the british settlements were for the most part in a state of rebellion in the war between the same governments in      which was five years after the introduction of trial by jury the inhabitants of the british settlements so far from showing the smallest symptom of dissatisfaction took during the very heat of the war the opportunity of my return to england to express their gratitude through me to the british government for the very valuable right of sitting upon juries which had been conferred upon them by his present majesty as appears by the addresses contained from page    to page  0 in the printed papers herewith sent the charge delivered by my successor the present chiefjustice of the island in    0 contains the strongest additional testimony which could be afforded of the beneficial effects which were experienced by the british government from the introduction of trial by jury amongst the natives of the island see that charge in pages     and   0 of vol x of the asiatic journal as every native juryman whatever his caste or religion may be or in whatever part of the country he may reside appears before the supreme court once at least every two years and as the judge who presides delivers a charge at the opening of each session to all the jurymen who are in attendance on the court a useful opportunity is afforded to the natives of the country by the introduction of trial by jury not only of participating themselves in the administration of justice but also of hearing any observations which the judges in delivering their charges may think proper to make to them with respect to any subject which is connected either with the administration of justice or with the state of society or morals in any part of the country the difference between the conduct which was observed by all the proprietors of slaves in ceylon in   0  which was before the introduction of trial by jury and that which was observed by them in      which was five years after the introduction of trial by jury is a strong proof of the change which may be brought about in public opinion by the judges availing themselves of the opportunity which their charging the jury on the first day of session affords them of circulating among the natives of the country such opinions as may promote the welfare of any particular class of society as the right of every proprietor of slaves to continue to hold slaves in ceylon was guaranteed to him by the capitulation under which the dutch possessions had been surrendered to the british arms in      the british government of ceylon conceived that however desirable the measure might be they had not a right to abolish slavery in ceylon by any legislative act a proposition was however made on the part of government by me to the proprietors of slaves in   0  before trial by jury was introduced urging them to adopt some plan of their own accord for the     gradual abolition of slavery this proposition they at that time unanimously rejected the right of sitting upon juries was granted to the inhabitants of ceylon in      from that period i availed myself of the opportunities which were afforded to me when i delivered my charge at the commencement of each session to the jurymen most of whom were considerable proprietors of slaves of informing them of what was doing in england upon the subject of the abolition of slavery and of pointing out to them the difficulties which they themselves must frequently experience in executing with impartiality their duties as jurymen in all cases in which slaves were concerned a change of opinion upon the subject of slavery was gradually perceptible amongst them and in the year      the proprietors of slaves of all castes and religious persuasions in ceylon sent me their unanimous resolutions to be publicly recorded in court declaring free all children born of their slaves after the   th august      which in the course of a very few years must put an end to the state of slavery which had subsisted in ceylon for more than three centuries i have the honour to be dear sir yours very faithfully signed alexr johnston     the rationale of reward by jeremy bentham originally printed in        0     advertisement by the editor the history of the present work is somewhat curious it is extracted from two sets of manuscripts differing considerably as to their arrangement the one in french and the other in english written by mr bentham between forty and fifty years ago and which do not appear to have been ever confronted together both these manuscripts with mr benthams papers on punishment were at the desire of m dumont placed in his hands and together with some few additions from his own elegant pen form the matter of the work published by him at paris in      under the title of théorie des peines et des récompenses of this work three editions have been printed in france and one in england the rationale of reward occupies the second volume in preparing it for its appearance before the english public the editor has taken the above volume as the groundwork of his labours but having availed himself wherever he could of the original manuscripts his will in many instances not be found a literal translation of m dumonts work the additions made by m dumont are marked out where distinguishable by appropriate indications one of these additions being at variance with mr benthams present opinions has given rise to the remarks which immediately follow editor of original edition remarks by mr bentham catherines scale of ranks—bentham or dumont on pensions of retreat—which you please—you ask my present thoughts—i am all obedience allow me only to name the place not in your work but let it be in a sequel i am preparing for it from that which you have so kindly made yours those wicked thoughts would scare away readers whom if content with what you give them from my first friend that sequel may have a chance for in that production may be seen not in description only but in terminis the arrangements which after from forty to fifty years for reflection exhibit the practical—i do not say the now practicable—result of the principles of yours and that cleared forgive my saying so of what now shows itself to me as dross nor yet will it draw readers from yours—for in yours alone will be found discussions explanations and reasonings at length in the new one except where the opposite officially avowed principles are examined little else than results official aptitude maximized expense minimized in these words you have the title of a plan of official economy and education that gives denomination to the whole and an indication of the matter of the first and principal part send your readers if you have any to that work there with official education they may see national growing out of it—added and that without need of additional description or expense there confronted with radical they may see whig and tory economy and take their choice i say whig and tory for these two are one as to catherine and her ranks they rank not quite so high with me now as then pensions of retreat would be invited to make their retreat from your pages were it not for my respect for editors and readers in my own work may be seen a picture of them painted in those colours which now appear to me their proper ones revise impossible not to speak of my doing you more harm than good in the french alone the pensions of retreat have already cost me—i had almost said lost me—more days than i can endure to think of i who have so few left and work enough left for a hundred times the number what i have found possible i have done—looking over the titles of the chapters and sections still in the french alone and in relation to them submitting what appears to me an appropriate wording together with some little alterations and additions which presented themselves to me as amendments     preliminary observations the greatest happiness of the greatest number ought to be the object of every legislator for accomplishing his purposes respecting this object he possesses two instruments—punishment and reward the theories of these two forces divide between them although in unequal shares the whole field of legislation the subject of the present work is reward and not reward alone but every other use which can be made of that matter of which rewards may be formed in the following work the different sources from which rewards may be derived are examined the choice which ought to be made between the different modifications of which reward is susceptible is pointed out and rules are laid down for the production of the greatest effect with the least portion of this precious matter on the one hand indication is given of the venom more or less concealed which is included in the employments which have too commonly been made of it and an attempt has been made to take away from others certain imputations which the enthusiasm of virtue has cast upon them the limits have been traced between the fields of reward and punishment the springs of that mechanism developed whence those laws arise to which the power is attributed of executing themselves and directions given for that combination of remedies the sweet with the bitter whereby so happy a union is produced between interest and duty the advantages of a system of remuneratory procedure are pointed out an idea given of the course it ought to take and an enumeration made of the uses of the matter of reward which are not remuneratory the nature and effects of salaries and other official emoluments are inquired into the nature and degree of the encouragement proper to be afforded to the arts and sciences is discussed and finally the question—how far it is possible beneficially to apply artificial reward to the encouragement of production and trade is considered† book i— of rewards in general chapter i definitions reward in the most general and extensive sense ever given to the word may be defined to be—a portion of the matter of good which in consideration of some service supposed or expected to be done is bestowed on some one in the intent that he may be benefited thereby† when employed under the direction of the principle of utility it operates as a motive     for the performance of actions useful to society in the same manner as under the same guidance punishment operates in the prevention of actions to which we ascribe an injurious tendency the services in the production of which this precious matter may be employed may be distinguished into ordinary and extraordinary ordinary services may be subdivided into regularly recurring or routine and occasional by routine services i mean those which in all the various departments of government the public functionaries are bound to perform in virtue of their respective offices by occasional services i mean those required by the government at the hands of persons not in its employ they belong almost entirely to the administration of justice and that branch of the police which is connected with it—as denouncing and prosecuting criminals giving judicial evidence and seizing persons accused c to the same head may be referred services rendered to individuals in case of fires inundations and shipwrecks inasmuch as the government is interested in the preservation of every individual in the community these services may be considered as rendered to it to the head of extraordinary services may be referred—  services rendered to the whole community by new inventions giving to the operations of government in any of its different branches an increased degree of perfection such as important improvements in military or naval tactics fortification or shipbuilding c in the mode of administering justice regulating the police or the finances or in any other part of the field of legislation   services rendered in time of war by the seizure or destruction of objects contributing to the power of the enemy or by the preservation of such as belong to ones own country   services rendered by persons exercising the office of foreign ministers consisting in the prevention or termination of the calamities of war or in the bringing about useful alliances   discoveries of great importance to the augmentation of the national wealth new methods of abridging labour the introduction of new branches of industry c   discoveries in science which are not susceptible of immediate application to the arts   noble actions and distinguished instances of virtue in considering which not only the immediate benefit should be regarded but their influence as examples upon the cultivation of similar excellencies such is the field of services such therefore is the field of reward with regard to rewards the most important division is into occasional and permanent the first are applied according to times and circumstances to a single individual or to a number of individuals in virtue of some insulated and specific service the others are charged upon some general fund provided for an indefinite number of persons and for a succession of services in consequence of the extent and permanence of their effects it is principally with regard to the latter class of rewards that it will be found of importance to establish the true principles which ought to regulate their distribution occasional rewards being confined within narrower limits and their effects more transitory erroneous views respecting them are comparatively of trifling consequence the most extensive use of the matter of reward takes place in transactions between individuals in the case of personal services which are performed in virtue of a contract the pay given to him by whom they are rendered is his reward in buying and selling the reciprocal delivery is the reward for the mutual transfer but the public that is to say the government on account of the public has a demand for a variety of services and goods exactly similar to those of which an individual stands in need and it is thus that the most advantageous mode of employing the matter of reward even in the ordinary course of business enters into the sphere of politics and claims the attention of the legislator chapter ii matter of reward—sources between the four objects—delinquency punishment expenditure and reward there is an intimate connexion he who knows thoroughly the nature and possible modifications of any one knows thoroughly the nature and possible modifications of all the rest why so because they are all of them but so many modifications of good and evil—of the instruments or causes of pain and pleasure considered in a particular point of view whatever mischief being produced contrary to the will of the legislator takes the name of an offence the same when produced in pursuance of that will so it be with a direct intention on his part that the party shall be a sufferer by it takes the name     of punishment reward is to good what punishment is to evil reward on one part supposes expenditure on the other whatever is received by one party on the footing of reward is expended by some other—when a view then is given of the several possible modifications of offence a view is at the same time given in reality if not in name of the several possible modifications of reward this may at first sight appear a paradox but as the absence of good is comparatively an evil so the absence of evil is comparatively a good the notion therefore of evil and of all sorts of evil is included in the notion of reward the several modifications of the matter of reward may be comprised under four heads—  the matter of wealth   honour   power   exemptions in respect of the employment of the direct mode for affording pleasure it belongs not properly to political but to domestic government or education   the matter of wealth—money or moneys worth is by much the most common stuff of which rewards are made and in general the most suitable of which they can be made why it is so will appear hereafter   honour—honour may be made out of any stuff in some cases it is produced by the bearing a particular title not hereditary—as the name of the office a man holds in other cases it is hereditary and places the individuals bearing it in a distinct rank superior to that of the other classes—as in the case of the nobility in other cases it is unaccompanied with any distinguishing denomination or any particular title—as in the case of medals or public thanks conferred after any great victory in the name of the king and parliament a graduated scale of ranks especially when its gradations are determined by merit and depend upon actual service is an excellent institution it creates a new source of happiness by means of a tax upon honour almost imperceptible to those by whom it is paid it augments the sum of human enjoyment it increases the power of government by clothing its authority with benignity it opens new sources for the exercise of hope the most precious of all possessions and it nourishes emulation the most powerful of all incentives to virtuous actions such a graduated scale of ranks has at all times been in use in the military branch of the public service but in this case the principal object is not honour but power—superiority in rank is invariably accompanied by superiority in command the honour which accompanies the power is but an accidental appendage catherine ii extended the application of this arrangement to the civil service she distributed all the public officers in the civil department into distinct and even numerical classes corresponding with the distribution of rank in the army—secretaries judges physicians academicians all the civil functionaries being advanced by steps a perpetual state of emulation and of hope stimulated their labours throughout the whole course of their career it was an invention in politics which matches the most ingenious discovery in art that the present century has witnessed at one stroke without violence or injustice hereditary nobility was deprived of the greater part of its injurious prerogatives the foremost in rank and wealth began his career at the lowest step his ascent through each gradation depending upon the appointment of the sovereign if without merit he was left behind while men of the most obscure birth took precedence of him this engine was the more powerful from the gentleness with which it operated—the simple noncollation of reward performing the office of punishment another advantage gained by the transference of the denominations of the military ranks into the civil service is that the respect borne by the military to the civil functionaries is thus in no small degree increased it is an ingenious artifice for conquering the barbarous and absurd contempt for civil functions which prevails in all military governments the assimilation of ranks naturally leads to the assimilation of respect from the time that this arrangement was made the nobility were seen eagerly to engage in offices which before they had regarded with disdain orders of knighthood appear like floating fragments detached from some such regular system of honorary rewards in some states an order of knighthood has been established under the title of the order of merit it might be supposed that this order had been established as a jest by way of satire upon all other orders not so however whatever ridicule there may be falls exclusively upon those who are members of this order of all orders it is the least distinguished the nobility are not candidates for admission—they consider it derogatory to their birth it is the reward of—it may be purchased by service the higher ranks of knighthood are they to be considered as rewards—are they public rewards to this question it appears difficult to give a decisive answer they are     bestowed for so great a variety of reasons that to give any description of them which shall be applicable to all cases is impossible they are sometimes given for the performance of distinguished services but much more generally to courtiers and men of rank who are the companions of the sovereign to increase the splendour of his court in these cases the merit proved is that the individual has made himself agreeable to the sovereign but if persons thus decorated claim distinctions not belonging to other members of the community—if every one must yield them precedence ought not some public reason to be given for creating this superiority—for this comparative degradation of the largest portion of the community ought such drafts upon the respect of the public to be drawn in favour of an individual till it has been shown that he has rendered services to entitle him to this special homage when thus conferred is not a resource that might yield important fruits employed with bad economy we shall return to this subject   power—the principles which ought to regulate the distribution of this great object of human desire belong to the head of constitutional law rather than to our present subject power is created for a purpose altogether different from that of serving as matter of reward merit is not the only consideration by which its distribution must be governed under a monarchical government for example the inconveniencies attending the election of a king may be so serious that the supreme power ought to be attached to some qualification more manifest and indispensable than the personal merit of an individual in a mixed government also in which there is a chief magistrate and a body of hereditary nobles invested with certain powers it may be thought proper that this body should be composed of many members but the more numerous the less susceptible is it of that sort of selection which supposes in each individual distinguished merit thus far however we may determine in general viz that power wherever it can be employed without inconvenience as matter of reward ought to be so employed in thus using it the difficulty is to select any act or event that shall serve as evidence of the capacity of individuals for exercising the power with which they may come to be invested in public employments for example how various are the talents required for the possession of which no single act can be considered as satisfactory evidence were this not the case the greater number of public employments might be conferred as rewards for the performance of some determinate service respectively relating to them in the gazette notices might be given couched in the following terms—whoever produces the most perfect die shall be placed at the head of the mint—whoever produces a model of the most serviceable piece of artillery shall be placed at the head of the ordnance—he who constructs the swiftest sailing vessel united with the most perfect means of attack and defence shall be placed at the head of the naval architecture—the author who writes the best treatise upon commerce finances or the art of war shall be placed at the head of the board of trade shall be first lord of the treasury or commanderinchief respectively he who writes the best treatise on the laws shall be made chancellor at first view nothing can be more captivating than such a plan but upon the slightest examination it will be found more specious than solid why because it is by no means uncommon for a man who is in an eminent degree endowed with one of the qualities requisite to be altogether destitute of others equally indispensable there are besides cases in which even this imperfect mode of proof is altogether wanting during a long period of tranquillity by what describable service can a military man display his talents for command among the qualities most essential for such a duty are presence of mind enlarged views foresight activity courage perseverance personal influence c c by what specific act can an officer who has seen no service show himself to be possessed of any of these qualifications we are reduced then to mere conjecture the best founded opinions are drawn from his habits of life his attachment to his profession and above all the confidence reposed in him by those who are engaged in the same profession whose opinion is founded upon a multiplicity of acts which in the aggregate constitute his character discernment or the art of judging of individual capacity is a rare quality whose use it is impossible to supersede by general rules a slight advance might perhaps be made in this difficult art did we possess a catalogue of the indications of talents or capacity as applicable to the various departments of state       exemptions—the legislator creates two sorts of evils he appoints punishment for offences he imposes burthensome duties upon the various members of the community hence exemptions may be of two kinds exemptions from punishment already incurred exemptions from civil burthens an exemption from punishment already incurred is a pardon pardons have often been given in the way of reward that is in consideration of former services such acts cannot be foreseen and provided for by anticipation they are the result of the discretion entrusted in this behalf to the sovereign under the english law however there are instances in which by anticipation exemption from punishment is granted that is to say before the punishment is inflicted thus from the policy or weakness of the temporal sovereign the english clergy obtained in times of barbarism an exemption in all cases from capital and several other kinds of punishment an exemption which being by statute law confined in regard to causes on the one hand while by common law it was extended with regard to persons on the other has left this part of the penal branch of the law in the confusion under which it still labours† the nobility followed the example of the clergy in almost every country of europe they have found themselves invested with exemptions of this nature ancient rome set the example no citizen could be put to death verres convicted of the most atrocious crimes atoned for them by enjoying at a distance from rome the fruits of his plunder when catherine ii empress of russia convened together deputies from all the provinces of that immense empire under the pretence of their assisting in the formation of a code of laws a sort of parody of the legislative assemblies of free states which was not however without its use in so far as it contributed to the sprend of enlightened ideas she conferred upon them amongst other privileges an exemption from all corporal punishment cases of high treason excepted this species of distinction which as a reward for legislators could scarcely be imagined in any other state than one just emerging from a state of barbarism had doubtless for its object the increasing their self importance and the conferring upon them a sort of rank which should last beyond the duration of their duty as a man may be punished in his person his reputation his property—in like manner through necessity and not with the view of punishing him he may be burthened an exemption from a burthen is an exemption from the obligation of rendering service services are either services of submission in the rendering of which the will of the party has no share—or services of behaviour of exemption from services of submission not exacted in the way of punishment we shall not find a great variety of examples in great britain members of the upper house of parliament and other peers constantly and members of the lower house at certain periods are exempted from arrests this privilege they may be considered as enjoying partly on the ground of satisfaction partly that they may not be diverted from the exercise of their functions and partly because being members of the sovereign body they would have it so among services performed by action are some which may be styled services of respect it is a service of respect exacted by usage in every kingdom in europe not to wear a hat or what is equivalent in the presence of the king in spain some families among the nobility enjoy the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the king in ireland the head of one family the family of the de courcys earls of kinsale enjoys the like exemption as a reward for some service rendered by an ancestor by a british statute he who apprehends and prosecutes to conviction a criminal of a certain description received amongst other rewards an exemption from parish offices together with the privilege of transferring that exemption to another by other british statutes persons who have borne arms for a certain length of time in the service of the state were exempted from the obligation of those laws which lest industry should be too common forbade a man from working for his own benefit at a trade at which he had not worked seven years for the benefit of another there are various other exemptions of the same nature but as the object here is not to give an exhaustive view of these several exemptions but merely a few instances to serve     by way of example the above specimens may suffice one general observation applies to all cases of exemptions from general obligations imposed by law it is—that the more severe the laws the more abundant as drawn from this source is the fund of reward it may be created by a mere act of restitution by the rendering of justice to some may be given what ought to be left for all conditions may be annexed to what ought to be given gratuitously the greater the mass of injustice inflicted the greater the opportunity for generosity in detail the oppressive government of one sovereign is a mine of gold to his successor in the church it is the good works of their predecessors—in the state it is their bad works that increase the treasure of their successors in russia and in poland emancipation is a very distinguished reward a tyrant may reward by doing less mischief one word on the last article of reward—pleasures punishment may be applied in all shapes to all persons pleasure however in the hands of the legislator is not equally manageable pleasure can be given only by giving the means by which it is purchased—that is to say the matter of wealth—which every one may employ in his own way among certain barbarous or halfcivilized nations the services of their warriors have been rewarded by the favours of women helvetius appears to smile with approbation at this mode of exciting bravery it was perhaps montesquieu that led him into this error in speaking of the samnites among whom the young man declared the most worthy selected whomsoever he pleased for his wife he adds that this custom was calculated to produce most beneficial effects philosophers distinguished for their humanity—both of them good husbands and good fathers both of them eloquent against slavery how could they speak in praise of a law which supposes the slavery of the best half of the human species—how could they have forgotten that favours not preceded by an uncontrouled choice and which the heart perhaps repelled with disgust afforded the spectacle rather of the degradation of woman than the rewarding a hero the warrior surrounded by palms of honour could he descend to act the part of a ravisher and if he disdained this barbarous right was not his generosity a satire on the law voltaire relates with great simplicity that at the first representation of one of his tragedies the audience who saw the author in a box with an extremely beautiful young duchess required that she should give him a kiss by way of acknowledging the public gratitude the victim a partaker in the general enthusiasm felt apparently no repugnance to make the sacrifice and without the intervention of the magistrate we may trust to the enthusiasm of the sex and their passion for distinction for preferences that may animate courage and genius in their career chapter iii of reward and punishment combined there are some cases in which it would be improper to employ either reward or punishment alone they are those in which the two forces may with advantage be united—in which the legislator says to the citizen obey and you shall receive a certain reward disobey and you shall suffer a certain punishment the two modes may be properly united when the service required by the law depends for its performance upon a small number of persons in virtue of the peculiar circumstances in which they happened to be placed if for example the object be the securing a delinquent at the moment that he is about to commit an offence to inform against him or to prosecute him—it will be found expedient in order to ensure the rendering of such services to combine with a reward for their performance a punishment for their omission in such cases punishment is useful in two ways beside the effect produced by its own force it also sustains the value of the reward there is a very strong prejudice in the public mind against persons who accept pecuniary reward for the performance of such services but when a penal motive is added the public resentment is abated if not altogether removed the prosecution of a criminal for the sake of the pecuniary benefit derivable from it is generally regarded as discreditable but he who undertakes the prosecution to avoid being himself punished will be considered at least as excusable the desire of selfpreservation is called a natural propensity that is to say is regarded with approbation the desire of gain is a propensity not less natural but in this case although more useful it is not regarded with the same approbation this is a mischievous prejudice but it exists and it is therefore necessary to combat its influence we must treat opinions as we find them and not act as though they were what they ought to be this is not the only instance in which it is necessary to put a constraint upon mens     inclinations that they may be at liberty to follow them an instance of the judicious mixture of reward and punishment is furnished by the practice pursued in many schools called challenging all the scholars in the same class having ranged themselves around the master he who stands at the head of the class begins the exercise does he make a mistake the next to him in succession corrects him and takes his place does the second not perceive the mistake or is he unable to correct it the privilege devolves upon the third and so of the rest—the possession of the first place entitling the holder to certain flattering marks of distinction the two incitements are in this case most carefully combined punishment for the mistake loss of rank reward for the informer acquisition of that same rank punishment for not informing loss of rank the same as for the offence itself if under the ordinary discipline of schools in the case where the scholar has no natural interest which should induce him to point out the mistakes of his associate it were attempted to produce these challenges by the force of reward alone the opinion which the general interest would create would oppose an obstacle to the reception of the reward most difficult to be overcome but when the young competitors have to say in their defence that they have depressed their neighbour merely to avoid being depressed themselves they are relieved from all pretence for reproach every one without hesitation abandons himself to the suggestions of his ambition and under the sanction of the law honour combats with unrestrained impetuosity this ingenious expedient for exciting emulation is one among the other advantages of a numerous class in the private plan of education there are seldom actors in sufficient number for the performance of this comedy the most favourable opportunities for legislation are those in which the two methods are so combined that the punishment immediately follows the omission of the duty and the reward its performance this arrangement presents the idea of absolute perfection why because to all the force of the punishment is united all the attractiveness and certainty of the reward i have said certainty but this requires to be explained denounce a punishment for such or such acts the only individual who cannot fail to know whether or not he has incurred the punishment is interested in concealing his having incurred it on the other hand offer a reward and the same individual finds himself interested in producing the necessary proofs for establishing his title to it thus a variety of causes contribute to the failure of punishment—the artifices of the person interested the prejudices against informers the loss or failure of evidence the fallibility or mistaken humanity of judges—while to the attainment of reward no such obstacles occur it operates then upon all occasions with the whole of its force and certainty before a celebrated law which we owe to mr burke the lords of the treasury were charged as they still are with the payment of the salaries of certain of the public servants justice required that all should be paid in the same proportion as funds for that purpose were received but no law was as yet in force to support this principle as might naturally be expected all sorts of preferences had place they paid their friends first and it cannot be supposed they forgot themselves when the funds set apart to this service were insufficient the less favoured class suffered the delays of payment occasioned continual complaints how would an ordinary legislator have acted he would have enacted that every one should be paid in proportion to the receipts and that his regulations might not be wanting in form he would have added a direct punishment for its breach without inquiring if it were easy to be eluded or not mr burke acted differently he arranged the different officers in classes he prepared a table of preference in which the order is the inverse of the credit which they might be supposed to possess the noble lords with the prime minister at their head bring up the rear and are prohibited from touching a single shilling of their pay till the lowest scullion has received every penny of his had he permitted these great officers to pay themselves and prescribed his table of preference for the rest under the penalty of losing a part of their salaries what embarrassment what difficulties what delays—who would undertake the odious task of informer how many pretences of justification would they not have had who would have dared to attack the ministers in this arrangement of mr burke till they have fulfilled their duty they lose the enjoyment of all their salary they lose it without inquiry and without embarrassment thus rendered conditional their salary becomes in reality the recompence of their regularity in paying the others the advantages of this invention may be thus summed up their salary depending upon the performance of the service is no longer a barren gratification but a really productive reward the motive has all the force belonging to punishment by the suspension of payment it operates as a fine it possesses all the certainty of a reward the right to receive follows the completion of the service without any judicial procedure     chapter iv of the union of interest with duty and of selfexecuting laws what has been said in the preceding chapter will serve to clucidate the meaning of the above two expressions which though in familiar use with political writers have never yet been completely explained the legislator should say they endeavour to unite interest with duty this accomplished they consider perfection as attained but how is this union to be brought about—what constitutes it to create a duty and affix a punishment to the violation of it is to unite a mans interest with his duty and even to unite it more strongly than by any prospect of reward but this is not universally at least what they mean for if punishment alone were sufficient for the establishment of the desired connexion between interest and duty what legislator is there who would fail in its accomplishment—what would there be to boast of in a contrivance which surpasses not the ingenuity of the most clumsy politician in this phrase by the word interest pleasure or profit is understood the idea designed to be expressed is the existence of such a provision in the law as that conformity to it shall be productive of certain benefits which will cease of themselves so soon as the law ceases to be observed in a word the union in question is produced whenever such a species of interest can be formed as shall combine the force which is peculiar to punishment with the certainty which is peculiar to reward this connexion between duty and interest is to a high degree attained in the case of pensions and places held during pleasure let us suppose for example that the continuance of the pension is made to depend upon the holders paying at all times absolute obedience to the will of his superior the pensioner ceases to give satisfaction the pension ceases there are none of the embarrassments and uncertainties attendant on ordinary procedure there are no complaints of disobedience made against persons thus circumstanced it is against the extreme efficacy of this plan rather than against its weakness that complaints are heard in some countries by the revenue laws and particularly in the case of the customhouse duties it is not uncommon to allow the officers as a reward a portion of the goods seized by them in the act of being smuggled this is the only mode that has appeared effectually to combat the temptations to which they are perpetually exposed the price which it would be worth while for individuals to offer to the officers for connivance can scarcely equal upon an average the advantage they derive from the performance of their duty so far from there being any apprehension of their being remiss in its discharge when every instance of neglect is followed by immediate punishment the danger is lest they should be led to exceed their duty and the innocent should be exposed to suspicion and vexation the legislator should enact laws which will execute themselves what is to be understood by this speaking with precision no law can execute itself in a state of insulation a law is inoperative to produce its desired effects it must be supported and enforced by some other law which in its turn requires for its support the assistance of other laws it is thus that a body of laws forms a group or rather a circle in which each is reciprocally supported and supports when it is said therefore that the law executes itself it is not meant that it can subsist without the assistance of other laws but that its provisions are so arranged that punishment immediately follows its violation unaided by any form of procedure that to one offence another more easily susceptible of proof or more severely punished is substituted mr burkes law which has already been mentioned is justly entitled to be ranked under this head the clause which forbids the ministers and treasurers to pay themselves till all other persons have been paid possesses in effect the properties of a punishment annexed to any retardation of payments—a punishment which commences with the offence which lasts as long as the offence which is inflicted without need of procedure in a word a punishment the imposition of which does not require the intervention of any third person before the passing of this law large arrears on the civil list were allowed to accumulate their accumulation bore the character merely of a simple act of omission which could not be classed under any particular head of offence and the evil of which might moreover be palliated by a thousand pretexts after the passing of this law the ministers it is true might still in spite of the law continue to give to themselves a preference over the other creditors on the civil list—there is no physical force other than existed before to prevent them but in virtue of this law any such preference would be a palpable offence—a species of peculation which would be strongly reprobated by public opinion another example is furnished by the laws respecting the payment of stampduties—these laws are represented as among the number of those which execute themselves and are panegyrized accordingly this is true with regard to so much of these taxes as is levied upon contracts and lawproceedings  00 let us explain their mechanism the sanction given to private contracts and the protection afforded by the law to person and property are services which the public receives at the hands of the ministers of justice the method in which these duties then are levied is this these services are at first refused to all persons without exception they are then offered to all persons who at the price set upon them have the means and inclination to become purchasers thus a protection which might be considered as a debt due from the state to all its subjects is converted into a reward by means of the precedent condition annexed to it this is not the time for examining whether this duty which palpably amounts to the selling of justice is a judicious tax all that is here necessary to be observed is that the payment is insured by the security it affords and the danger with which the omission is accompanied to range over the whole field of legislation in order to ascertain the different cases in which this species of political mechanism has been employed or in which it might be introduced with advantage does not belong to our present subject—general directions might easily be framed for the construction of selfexecuting laws and their application might occupy a place in the recreations of legislation chapter v matter of reward—reasons for husbanding if it be proper to be frugal in the distribution of punishment it is no less proper to be so in the distribution of reward evil is inflicted in both cases the difference is that punishment is an evil to him to whom it is applied—reward to him at whose expense it is applied the matter of reward and the matter of punishment spring from the same root is money bestowed as a reward such money can only arise from taxes or original revenue—can only be bestowed at the public expense—truths so obvious that proof is unnecessary but which ought on all occasions to be recollected since all other circumstances being equal to pay a tax to a given amount is a greater evil than to receive it is a good rewards consisting in honour it is commonly said cost nothing this is however a mistake honours not only enhance the price of services as we shall presently see they also occasion expenses and burthens which cannot be estimated in money there is no honour without preeminence if then of two persons for example who are equal one profits by being made the higher the other suffers in at least equal proportion by being made the lower of the two with regard to honours which confer rank and privileges there are commonly two sets of persons at whose expense honour is conferred the persons from amongst whom the new dignitary is taken and the persons if any to whom he is aggregated by his elevation thus the greater the addition made to the number of peers the more their importance is diminished—the greater is the defalcation made from the value of their rank the case is similar with regard to power it is by taking away liberty or security that power is conferred and the share of each man is the less the greater the number of copartners in it the power conferred in any case must be either new or old if new it is conferred at the expense of those who are subject to it if old at the expense of those by whom it was formerly exercised exemptions given in the way of reward may appear at first sight but little expensive this may be one reason why they have been so liberally granted by shortsighted sovereigns it ought however to be recollected that in the case of public burthens the exemption of one increases the burthen on the remainder if it be honourable to be exempted from them it becomes a disgrace to bear them and such partial exemptions at length give birth to general discontent the exemptions from arrest for debt enjoyed by members of parliament are a reward conferred at the expense of their creditors exemptions from parish offices and military services are rewards conferred at the expense of those who are exposed to the chance of bearing them the burthen of exemptions from taxes falls upon those who contribute to the exigencies of the state a privilege to carry on in concurrence with a limited number of other persons a particular branch of trade is an exemption from the exclusion which persons in general are laid under with reference to that trade the favour is shown at the expense of the persons who are sharers in the privilege if there be an instance in which any modification of the matter of reward can be conferred without expense it will be found among those which consist in exemption from punishment when an exemption of this sort is conferred the expense of it if there be any is borne by those who are interested in the infliction of the punishment that is by those in whose favour the law was made which the punishment was intended to enforce but if by the impunity given the sanction of the laws be weakened and crimes consequently multiplied the pardon granted to criminals is dearly paid for by their victims the evil of prodigality is not confined to the diminishing the fund of reward it operates as a law against real merit if rewards  0  are bestowed upon pretended services such pretended services enter into competition with real services he succeeds best who aims not to entitle himself to the gratitude of the people but to captivate the goodwill of him at whose disposal the fund of reward is placed obsequiousness and courtly vices triumph over virtue and genius the art of pleasing is elevated at the expense of the art of serving what is the consequence real services are not performed or they are purchased at extravagant prices it is not sufficient that the price paid for them be equal to that of the false services beyond this there must be a surplus to compensate the labour which real services require if so much is given to one who has done nothing how much more is due to me who have borne the heat and the burthen of the day—if parasites are thus rewarded how much more is due to my talents and industry such is the language which will naturally be employed and not without reason by the man of conscious merit it is thus that the amount of the evil is perpetually accumulating the greater the amount already lavished the greater the demand for still further prodigality as in the case of punishment the more profusely it has been dealt out the greater oftentimes is the need of employing still more when by the display of extraordinary zeal and distinguished talents a public functionary has rendered great services to his country—to associate him with the crowd of ordinary subordinates is to degrade him he will feel in respect of the fund of reward in the same manner as the disposer of it ought to have felt he will consider himself injured not only when anything is refused to him but when anything is bestowed upon those who have not deserved it a profuse distribution of honours is attended with a double inconvenience in the first place it deteriorates the stock and in the next it is productive of great pecuniary expense when a peerage for example is conferred it is generally necessary to add to it a pension under the notion of enabling the bearer to sustain its dignity it is thus that the existence of an hereditary nobility tends to increase the price necessary to be paid in the shape of reward has a plebeian rendered such services to his country as cannot be passed by with neglect the first operation is to distinguish him from men of his own rank by placing him among the nobility but without fortune a peerage is a burthen to make it worth having it must be accompanied with pecuniary reward the immediate payment of a large sum would be too burthensome posterity is therefore made to bear a portion of the burthen it is true posterity ought to pay its share in the price of services of which it reaps a share of the advantage but the same benefit might be procured at a less expense if there were no hereditary nobility personal nobility would answer every purpose among the greeks a branch from a pine tree a handful of parsley—among the romans a few laurel leaves or ears of corn—were the rewards of heroes fortunate americans fortunate on so many accounts if to possess happiness it were sufficient to possess everything by which it is constituted this advantage is still yours—preserve it for ever bestow rewards erect statues confer even titles so that they be personal alone but never bind the crown of merit upon the brow of sloth such is the language of those passionate admirers of merit who would gladly see a generous emulation burning in all ranks of the community—who consider everything wasted which is not employed in its promotion can anything be replied to them if there can it can only be by those who jealous of the public tranquillity as necessary to the enjoyments of luxury and more alarmed at the folly which knows no restraint than at the selfishness which may be constrained to regulate itself would have at any price a class of persons who may impose tranquillity upon those who can never be taught in some states the strictest frugality is observed in the distribution of rewards such in general has been the case under republican governments though it is true that even in democracies history furnishes instances of the most extravagant prodigality and corruption the species of reward bestowed by the people upon their favourites with the least examination is power—a gift more precious and dangerous than titles of honour or pecuniary rewards the maxim woe to the grateful nation is altogether devoid of meaning unless it be designed as a warning against this disposition of the people to confer unlimited authority upon those who for a moment obtain their confidence after having said thus much in favour of economy it must not be denied that specious pretences may be urged in justification of a liberal use of rewards that portion of the matter of reward which is superfluously employed it is said may be considered as the fund of a species of lottery at a comparatively small expense a large mass of expectation is created and prizes are offered which every man may flatter himself with the hope of obtaining and what are all the other sources of enjoyment when put in competition with hope but can such reasons justify the imposition or continuance of taxes with no other view than that of increasing the amount of the  0  disposable fund of reward certainly not it would be absurd thus to create a real evil—thus to pillage the multitude of what they have earned by the sweat of their brow to multiply the enjoyments of the wealthy in a word whatever may be thought of this lottery we must not forget that its prizes must be drawn before we can obtain any useful services to the individual himself active is more conducive to his happiness than idle hope the one developes his talents the other renders them obtuse the first is naturally allied to virtue the second to vice in england reasons or at least pretexts have been found for the arbitrary disposal of rewards which would not exist under an absolute monarchy the constitution of parliament gives occasion to the performance of services of such a nature as cannot be acknowledged but which in the eyes of many politicians are not the less necessary a certain quantity of talent is requisite it is said to save the political vessel from being upset by any momentary turbulence or whim of the people we must possess a set of mediators interested in maintaining harmony between the heterogeneous particles of our mixed constitution a species of drill serjeants is required for the maintenance of discipline among the undulating and tumultuous multitude there must be a set of noisy orators provided for those who are more easily captivated by strength of lungs than by strength of argument declaimers for those who are controuled by sentimentalism and imaginative facetious or satirical orators for those whose object it is to be amused reasoners for the small number who yield only to reason artful and enterprising men to scour the country to obtain and calculate the number of votes there must also be a class of men in good repute at court who may maintain a good understanding between the head and the members and all this they say must be paid for—whether correctly or not does not belong to our present discussion it may be further said that the matter of reward besides being used for reward may be used as a means of power—and that in a mixed constitution like ours it is necessary to maintain a balance among its powers certain creations of peers therefore for example which could not be justified if considered as rewards may be justified as distributions of power there is at least something in this which deserves examination but its examination here would be out of place want of economy in the distribution of rewards may also be attempted to be justified by comparing the sum so expended with the expense incurred in the carrying on of a war i advise every one who has projects upon the public money to employ this argument in preference to every other when one calculates the immense sum expended during a single campaign either by land or sea when we reflect on the millions that vanish in sound and smoke all other profusion sinks into insignificance when we behold the treasures of a nation flowing away in such rapid torrents can any great indignation be felt against those who by art or obsequiousness or court favour detach from the mass a single drop or a small stream for their own benefit if the people so readily lend themselves to the gratification of political passions—if they part so freely with their gold and their blood for the momentary gratification of their vengeance or their passion for glory—can it be expected that they will murmur at the pomp they covet and the few insignificant favours which their prince bestows will they be supposed so mean as to be niggard with pence and lavish with millions this mode of comparison is not new to courts it ought to have been familiar to louis xiv if it be true as there is reason for believing that the building of versailles cost two thousand millions of livres in respect of expense this was more than equal to a war but at least it was expended without bloodshed there was no interruption of trade on the contrary it gave vigour to industry and shed lustre over the arts what a fortunate source of comparison to the advocates of absolute monarchy there is yet another mode of estimating the justness of any public expenditure—another source of comparison somewhat less agreeable to the eyes of courtiers compare the amount of the proposed expenditure with an equal portion of the produce of the most vexatious and burthensome tax in this country for example let the comparison be made with the produce of the tax on law proceedings whose effect is the placing of the great majority of the people in a state of outlawry the option lies between the abolition of this tax and the proposed employment of its produce they thus become two rival services it is a severe test for frivolous expenses but it is strictly just how disgraceful does wasteful luxury appear in the budget when thus put in competition with the good whose place it occupies or the evil of which it prevents the cure from these observations the practical conclusion is that the matter of reward being all of it costly none of it ought to be thrown away this precious matter is like the dew not a drop of it falls upon the earth which has not previously been drawn up from it an upright sovereign therefore gives nothing he buys or he sells his benevolence consists in economy would you praise him for generosity praise also the guardian who lavishes among his servants the property of his pupils  0  the most liberal among the roman emperors were the most worthless for example caligula claudius nero otho vitellius commodus heliogabalus and caracalla the best as augustus vespasian antoninus marcus aurelius and pertinax were frugal esprit des loix liv v ch xviii a most important lesson to sovereigns it warns them not to value themselves upon the virtue of generosity—in short not to think that in their station generosity is a virtue if not a strictly logical argument it is however a popular and persuasive induction—esteem not yourselves to be good princes for a quality in which you have been outstripped by the worst chapter vi remuneration ex post facto in the preceding chapter it was stated that in accordance with the principle of utility the costly matter of reward ought only to be employed in the production of service and that in accordance with that principle a reward can only consist of a portion of the matter of reward employed as a motive for the production of service this would seem to exclude everything which can be called liberality—every act by which a reward may be bestowed upon any service to which it has not been promised beforehand such may appear the consequence at first sight a reward it may be said ought only to be bestowed upon the performance of the service to which it has been promised since it is only where it has been foreseen that it can have operated as a motive why then bestow it upon a service how useful and important soever to which it has not been promised the service you would have been willing to purchase at the expense of a certain reward has been happily rendered without any engagement on your part to bear the expense why therefore should any reward be bestowed why pretend to employ reward in the production of an effect which has been produced without it is not this a useless employment of reward—is not this an expenditure in pure waste certainly such an expense cannot be justified as a means of producing an effect which has by the supposition already been produced but it may be justified as serving to give birth to other effects of a like nature as likely to cause future services to be rendered which will agree with those that are past—at least in this that they are services a reward which thus follows the service may be styled an ex post facto or unpromised reward the society of arts has recognised and employed this distinction a reward bestowed in fulfilment of a promise upon the performance of a specified service is called a premium a reward bestowed without previous promise is called a bounty to make it a rule never to grant a reward which has not been promised is to tie up the hands of true liberality and to renounce all chance of receiving any new kind of service there is only one supposition which can justify this parsimony it is that every service has been foreseen and endowed beforehand whether legislation will ever attain this perfection i pretend not to know it has not attained it as yet and till it be attained sovereigns may reckon liberality amongst the number of their virtues rewards which in this manner are the fruits of liberality possess a great advantage over those which are awarded in virtue of a promise these confined to one object operate only upon the individual service specified the genial influence of the others extends over the whole theatre of meritorious actions these are useful in determining researches to a particular point the others present an invitation to extend them to everything which the human mind can grasp these are like the water which the hand of a gardener directs to a particular flower the others are like the dew which is distilled over the whole surface of the earth a promised reward bestowed upon one who has not deserved it is entirely lost an unpromised reward thus improperly bestowed is not necessarily lost the hand of liberality has been deceived but the utility of the reward is not altogether thrown away whilst opportunity is left for a better application of it in future had alexander lavished upon the man who to obtain his bounty exhibited his skill in darting grains of millet through the eye of a needle the rewards he bestowed upon aristotle it would have been a proof of prodigality and folly whose effect would have been to multiply the race of mountebanks and jugglers in rewarding aristotle he without doubt rewarded much jargon of no greater value than this mans sleight of hand in darting millet but since in the midst of this jargon a certain quantity of useful and at that time new truth was found the rewards which this celebrated philosopher received may justly be placed to the account of useful liberality their tendency was to multiply the precious race of instructors of mankind—the race of philosophers in fact certain acts of liberality which could not be justified if considered as promised rewards may deserve more or less indulgence may possess a sort of utility of the same kind as that which belongs to rewards not promised even the act regarded as service may not strictly deserve to be connected with reward but the disposition displayed by the distributing hand in awarding a recompense  0  may give birth to the expectation of similar rewards for really meritorious service rewards bestowed in pursuance of a promise may be considered as conferred according to a law belonging to the class of written laws whilst unpromised rewards though not productive of similar evils may be considered as establishing a kind of law or rather tacit rule analogous to that established by means of punishment in what is called unwritten law it would be fortunate indeed if the penal law might remain unwritten with as little inconvenience as remuneratory law in the penal and even the commonly called civil branches these unwritten laws develope themselves by a train of hardships not to say of injuries whilst the worst which can happen in the remuneratory branch of unwritten law is this that by reason of its being unknown it may become a tissue of useless bounty catherine ii did not allow the remuneratory branch of her laws to be exposed even to this danger from which there is so little to be feared had the hand of liberality been expanded—was the dew of reward poured out upon the head of merit—immediately inserted in the gazette the notification of the reward connected with the name of the individual and the service which had deserved it was resounded throughout the most distant and unfrequented parts of her vast empire it would have been altogether glorious had she hastened to give the same character of publicity and certainty to those other branches of unwritten law in which it is required with so much greater urgency and had she never conferred favours which she would have blushed to see gazetted in england a noble example of reward ex post facto was exhibited in connexion with the first establishment of mailcoaches the manager of a provincial theatre having proposed to the minister this plan for the better conveyance of letters the plan was received and having been tried in one part of the kingdom it was afterwards extended to the whole and this service being in consequence performed with a celerity and economy of which formerly there was no idea—as a reward the inventor was appointed comptrollergeneral of the postoffice with a salary of £  00 per annum besides a proportion of the savings a reward thus judicious and equitable transports us to the year    0† it is equivalent to a proclamation to this effect—men of genius and industry employ your talents for the service of your country exert yourselves to the utmost produce your plans their reception shall depend alone upon the opinion formed of their utility your country will not grudge the labour necessary for their examination good intentions shall not be treated with contempt you shall not be nicknamed projectors by the idle and the incapable your plans shall not be disregarded because of their authors they shall not be thrown aside because they are extraordinary provided they be useful impartiality shall preside at their examination and their utility shall be the measure of your reward there may appear at first sight a discrepancy between this and the immediately preceding chapter but it is only in appearance i say here no less than heretofore that the upright dispenser of public treasures gives nothing he buys or he sells with promised rewards he purchases bespoken clearly defined and limited services with unpromised rewards he purchases services unbespoken indeterminate and infinite the difficulty in both cases consists in making a proper choice of the action to be rewarded this choice will form the subject of subsequent consideration chapter vii punition and remuneration—their relations wherefore throughout the whole field of legislation cannot reward be substituted for punishment is hope a less powerful incentive to action than fear when a political pharmacopœia has the command of both ingredients wherefore employ the bitter instead of the sweet to these natural but unreflecting inquiries i reply by a maxim that at first view may appear paradoxical—reward ought never to be employed when the same effect can be produced by punishment and in support of this paradox i employ another—let the means be penal and the desired effect may be attained without giving birth to suffering let the means be remuneratory and suffering is inevitable the oracular style however being no longer in fashion i shall in plain language give the solution of this enigma when a punishment is denounced against the breach of a law if the law be not broken no one need be punished when a reward is promised to obedience if everybody obey the law everybody ought to be rewarded a demand for rewards is thus created and these rewards can only be derived from the labour of the people and contributions levied upon their property in comparing the respective properties of punishment and reward we shall find that the first is infinite in quantity powerful in its operation and certain in its effect so that it cannot be resisted that the second is extremely  0  limited in quantity oftentimes weak in its operation and at all times uncertain in its effect the desire after it varying exceedingly according to the character and circumstances of individuals we may remark again that the prospect of punishment saddens whilst that of reward animates the mind that punishment blunts while reward sharpens the activity that punishment diminishes energy while reward augments it it is reward alone and not punishment which a man ought to employ when his object is to procure services the performance of which may or may not be in the power of those with whom he has to do this considered were it necessary to draw a rough line between the provinces of reward and punishment in a few words we might say that punishment was peculiarly suited to the production of acts of the negative stamp—reward to the production of acts of the positive stamp to sit still and do nothing is in the power of every man at all times to perform a given service is in many instances in the power of one individual alone and that only upon one individual occasion this arrangement of nature suits very well with the unlimited plenitude of the fund of punishment on the one hand and the limited amplitude of the fund of reward on the other the negative acts of which the peace and welfare of mankind require the performance are incessant and innumerable and must be exacted at the hands of every man the positive acts of which the performance is required are comparatively few performable only by certain persons and by them on certain occasions only not to steal not to murder not to rob must be required at all times at the hands of every man to take the field for the purpose of national defence—to occupy a place in the superior departments of executive or legislative government—are acts which it is neither necessary nor proper to exact at the hands of more than a few or of them except on particular occasions to discover a specific remedy for a disease to analyze a mineral to invent a method of ascertaining a ships longitude within a given distance to determine the quadrature of such or such a curve—are works which if done by one man need never be done again it is thus also with regard to such extraordinary services as depend upon accident such as the giving of information when required either in the judicial or any other branch of administration are you ignorant whether an individual is in possession of the information in question or if in possession of it whether he be disposed to communicate it punishment would most probably be both inefficacious and unjust as a means of acquiring this knowledge resort then to reward in regard to extraordinary services depending upon personal qualification the impropriety of punishment and the propriety of reward are the greater when the utility of the service is susceptible of an indeterminate degree of excellence as is the case with works of literature of science and the fine arts in these cases reward not only calls forth into exercise talents already existing but even creates them where they did not exist it is the property of hope one of the modifications of joy to put a man as the phrase is into spirits that is to increase the rapidity with which the ideas he is conversant about succeed each other and thus to strengthen his powers of combination and invention by presenting to him a greater variety of objects the stronger the hope so that it have not the effect of drawing the thoughts out of the proper channel the more rapid the succession of ideas the more extensive and varied the trains formed by the principle of association the better fed as it were and more vigorous will be the powers of invention in this state the attention is more steady the imagination more alert and the individual elevated by his success beholds the career of invention displayed before him and discovers within himself resources of which he had hitherto been ignorant on the one hand let fear be the only motive that prompts a man to exert himself he will exert himself just so much as he thinks necessary to exempt him from that fear and no more but let hope be the motive he will exert himself to the utmost especially if he have reason to think that the magnitude of the reward or what comes to the same thing the probability of attaining it will rise in proportion to the success of his exertions such is the nature of extraordinary services that it is neither practicable nor desirable for them to be performed by a large multitude of persons if punishment then were the means employed to induce men to perform them it would be necessary to pitch upon some select persons as those on whom to impose the obligation but of the personal qualifications of individuals the legislator as such can have no knowledge the case will also be nearly the same even with the executive magistrate if the number of the persons under his department be considerable for antecedently to specific experience in the very line in question a mans personal qualifications for any such extraordinary task are not to be conjectured a priori but from an intimate acquaintance—such an acquaintance as it is impossible a man should have with a large number the consequence is that among any multitude of persons thus taken at random the greater number would not perform the task because they would not be able to perform it but in this case by the supposition they must all be punished here  0  there would be a vast mass of punishment laid on in waste and perhaps the end not compassed after all—a mass of punishment imparting beyond comparison more pain than it would cost to provide a sufficient quantity of rewards on the other hand let reward be employed and not an atom need be spent in waste for it may be easily so applied and it is common so to apply it that it shall be bestowed in those instances only in which the end is compassed—in those instances in which not only a benefit is attained but a benefit more than equivalent to the expense by punishment a great expense would be incurred and that for the sake of a faint chance of success by reward a small expense is incurred and that not without a certainty of success again punishment in these cases would not only be less likely to produce the requisite effect but would have a tendency to prevent it how little soever the magistrate might be qualified to collect and to judge of appearances of capacity for such appearances he would however naturally keep some sort of lookout to exhibit those appearances would therefore be to run a chance of incurring the obligation and the punishment annexed to it the consequence is obvious to make sure of not appearing qualified men would take care not to be so we are told that in siam when a man has a tree of extraordinary good fruit it is seized for the kings use if this be true we may well imagine that gardening does not make any very extraordinary progress in the neighbourhood of the court of siam nature must do much for art we may be certain will do nothing we are told upon better authority of a time when it was the custom to give commissions to officers to look out for the best singers and press them into the kings service unless they were well paid at the same time which would have rendered the alarm occasioned by pressing needless one would not give much to hear the music of that day that selection which in cases like these is so impracticable in public is not equally so in domestic life to parents and other preceptors it is by no means impracticable to make use of punishment as a motive they are enabled to use it because the intimacy of their acquaintance with their pupils in general enables them to give a pretty good guess at what they are able to perform it may perhaps even be necessary to have recourse to this incentive—before the natural love of ease has been got under by habit and especially before the auxiliary motive of the love of reputation has taken root and while the tender intellect has not as yet acquired sufficient expansion and firmness to receive and retain the impressions of distant pleasures i say perhaps—for it certainly might be practicable to do with much less of this bitter recipe than in the present state of education is commonly applied all apparatus contrived on purpose might at least be spared towards providing a sufficient stock of incentives for all purposes a great deal more might be done than is commonly done in the way of reward alone by a little ingenuity in the invention and a little frugality in the application by establishing a constant connexion between enjoyment and desert granting little or nothing but what is purchased and thus transforming into rewards the whole stock of gratification or at least so much of it as is requisite if punishment should still be necessary mere privations seem to afford in all cases a sufficient store a complete stock of incentives might thus be formed out of enjoyments alone punishment by the suspension of such as are habitual reward by the application of such as occasionally arise but even when applied by parents and preceptors punishment how well soever it may succeed in raising skill to its ordinary level will never raise it higher one of the imperfections of punishment remains still insuperable accordingly in the training of young minds to qualify them for the achievement of extraordinary works of genius the business is best managed and indeed in a certain degree is commonly managed by punishments and rewards together in such sort that in the earlier part of mans career and in the earlier stages of the progress of talent a mixture of punishments and rewards both shall be employed and that by degrees punishment shall be dropt altogether and the force employed consist of reward alone there remains the case in which reward  0  is proper because punishment—at least punishment alone—would be unprofitable by unprofitable i mean not inefficacious but uneconomical unfrugal—the interest of the whole community together being taken into the account not forgetting that of the particular member on whom the burthen would be to be imposed and consequently the punishment in case of nonperformance to be inflicted this seems to be the case with all those offices which standing alone are offices of mere burthen whether the party favoured be the public at large or any individual or class of individuals in all cases the labourer is worthy of his hire and unless it be when every man must labour no man ought to be made to labour without his hire—the common soldier no more than the general the common seaman no more than the admiral the constable no more than the judge true it is that take any man for example it may with propriety be said that the public has a right to his services has a right to command his services for that the interest of any one man ought to give way to the interest of all but if this be true as to any one man who happens to be first taken equally true is it of any other and so in succession of every man on the one hand then each man is under an obligation to submit to any burthen that shall be proposed on the other hand each man has an equal right to see the burthen imposed not upon himself but upon some other if either of these propositions be taken in their full extent as much may be said in favour of the one of them as of the other in this case if there were no middle course to take things must rest in statu quo the scale of utility must remain in equilibrio one mans interest weighing neither more nor less than anothers the burthen would be borne by nobody and the immunity of each would be the destruction of all but there is a middle course to take which is to divide the burthen and lay it in equal proportion upon every man the principle is indisputable the application of it is not free from difficulties there are many cases in which the individual burthen cannot be divided an office the duties of which it requires but one man to perform cannot be divided amongst a thousand but a mass of profit may be formed sufficient to counterbalance the inconvenience which a man would sustain by bearing the office let the requisite mass of profit be taken from the general fund and the burthen is distributed proportionably amongst the different members of the community an expedient sometimes practised in these cases is instead of distributing the burthen of the office to lay it on entire upon some one person according to lot this prevents the injustice there would be in laying it upon any one by design but it does not correct the inequality the mischiefs of partiality and injustice are obviated but not so the sufferings of him upon whom the unfortunate lot falls the principle of utility is in this case only partially followed it is one of those instances in which the principle of utility would seem to have given occasion to a wrong conclusion according to this principle it is said that the interest of the minority ought to be sacrificed to that of the majority the conclusion is just if it were impossible to avoid a sacrifice palpably false if it is but to charge this as a defect upon the principle itself is as reasonable as it would be to maintain that the art of bookkeeping is a mischievous art because entries may be omitted we are now prepared for establishing a comparison between punishment and reward   punishment is best adapted for restraint or prevention—reward for excitement and production the one is a bridle the other a spur   in every case where very extensive mischief may be produced by a single act and particularly in the case of such acts as may be performed at any time punishment is the only restraint to be depended on such is the case of crimes in general when the act endeavoured to be produced is in an eminent degree beneficial it is proper to employ reward alone or to combine punishment with reward that the power of the governing motive may be doubled   considering the abundance of the one and scarcity of the other punishment is the only eligible means of regulating the conduct of people in general reward ought to be reserved for directing the actions of particular individuals by punishment mischievous propensities are subdued by reward valuable qualifications are improved punishment is an instrument for the extirpation of noxious weeds reward is a hotbed for raising fruit which would not otherwise be produced   necessity compels the employment of punishment reward is a luxury discard the first and society is dissolved discard the other and it still continues to subsist though deprived of a portion of its amenity and elegance   in every case where the service is of such a nature as that no individual possessed  0  of the qualifications requisite for its performance can with certainty be selected the denunciation of punishment would only produce apprehension and misery and its application be but so much injury inflicted in wanton waste in every such case offer a reward and it travels forth in quest of hidden or unknown talents even if it fail in its search it produces no evil—not an atom of it is lost it is given only when the service is performed when the advantage obtained either equals or surpasses the expense by the help of these observations we shall be enabled to appreciate the opinion of those politicians who after a superficial examination of this subject condemn legislators in general for the sparing use made of the matter of reward the author of the wealth of nations who has displayed such extraordinary sagacity in all his researches has upon this point been led away by mistaken notions of humanity fear says he is in almost all cases a miserable instrument of government it is an instrument which has oftentimes been much perverted from its proper use but it is a necessary instrument and the only one applicable to the ordinary purposes of society a young king in the first ardour for improvement having resolved to purge his kingdom from all crimes was not satisfied with this alone his natural gentleness was shocked at the idea of employing punishment he determined to abolish it altogether and to effect everything by reward he began with the crime of theft but in a short time all his subjects were entitled to reward all of them were honest every day they were entitled to new rewards their honesty remained inviolate a scheme for preventing smuggling was proposed to him wise king it was said for every penny that ought to be paid into your treasury give two and the hydra is vanquished the victory was certain but he perceived that like that of pyrrhus it would be somewhat costly a distinction which exists between domestic and political government may be here worth noticing no sovereign is so rich as to be able to effect everything by reward there is no parent who may not at sparta a bit of black bread was the reward of skill the stock of pleasures and of wants is an inexhaustible fund of reward in the hands of those parents who know how to employ it chapter viii remuneration—where hurtful a reward is mischievous when its tendency is to produce offences or to give birth to noxious dispositions to offer a reward to an individual as an inducement to him to commit an act prohibited by law is to attempt to suborn him the offence may be called subornation upon the present occasion this illegal subornation is not the subject of consideration the rewards of which we are about to speak have a corruptive tendency but do not possess the character of crimes they are authorized by custom sanctioned by the laws and given and received without disguise without criminal intention the evil is done with a pure conscience and often with the public approbation they are the result of erroneous conceptions the effects of universal prejudice or longestablished habit which as montaigne says blunts the acuteness of the judgment the present is one of those extremely delicate topics in respect of which it may be more prudent to put the reader in the path of truth and leave him to travel by himself in quest of discoveries than going through the subject in detail to wound established opinions or interfere with individual interests without restricting myself to any precise order i shall therefore exhibit some few examples in which the mischievous tendency is too palpable to admit of denial and i shall begin with an incontrovertible maxim which will furnish the criterion of which we are upon the present occasion in search for distinguishing good from evil— upon all occasions avoid bestowing anything in the shape of reward which may tend to interfere with the performance of duty according to this rule a judge ought not to find himself interested in the prolongation of law proceedings—the minister of state in the promotion of wars—the superintendent in promoting expense—the moral preceptor in setting an example of insinserity—the man of letters in maintaining mischievous prejudices at the expense of truth the more narrowly we scrutinize into the sources of public evils the more thoroughly shall we be convinced that they ought to be attributed to the neglect of this fundamental rule in support of this maxim it is not necessary to ascribe to men in general an extraordinary proclivity towards corruption ordinary prudence and probity are sufficient to enable a man to resist temptations to crimes or to lead him to abstain from whatever is reputed dishonourable but it requires somewhat more than ordinary honesty and prudence to be proof against the seductions of an interest that acts with continual energy and whose temptations are not opposed either by the fear of legal punishment or the condemnation of public opinion to yield to such temptations it is only necessary for him to follow in the beaten track in which he will be cheered by the presence of a multitude of fellowtravellers  0  and encouraged by the example of his superiors to resist these seductions he must expose himself to the imputation of singularity—he must proclaim that he is better than others—he must condemn his colleagues and predecessors and be bold enough to make an exhibition of his probity such magnanimity is not altogether unexampled but we must not reckon upon prodigies there are even some cases in which by its secresy this seductive interest is so much the more mischievous it operates like a concealed magnet and produces errors in the moral conduct against which there has been no previous warning we have said that the legislator ought to endeavour to combine interest with duty for a still stronger reason ought he to avoid as much as possible everything that yields to the public functionary a certain or a casual a known or an unknown profit resulting from the omission or violation of his duties we now proceed to give a few examples in england the superior judges beside their ample salaries which it would be improper to grudge them receive certain fees which it is impossible not to grudge them since it is from this source alone that they can generally be considered liable to corruption and that so much the more easily since they may be subject to its influence without themselves perceiving it these fees are multiplied in proportion to the incidents of procedure the multiplication of which incidents proportionably increases the expense and delay of obtaining justice in one case a judge receives nearly £  for tying for six months or a year the hands of justice and this in one of those cases in which indolence adds her seductions to those of avarice and the whole is effected in the presence of no other witnesses than such as are urged onward by a still stronger interest to aggravate the abuse another example from among a thousand under the lord chancellor there are twelve subordinate judges called masters in chancery when an account is to be taken before them the following is the mode of procedure the attorneys on the one side and the other ought to appear before the master either alone or in company with counsel as may be convenient first summons nobody appears second summons nobody appears at length third summons the parties appear and the matter is put into train care however has been taken to allow only half an hour or an hour to each set of suitors the parties are not always punctual the matter is begun the clock strikes and then the matter is dismissed at the following hearing it is necessary to begin again all this is matter of etiquette at each summons the fees to the judges and the counsel are renewed all the world must live extortion it is said is to be banished from the dwellings of finance at some future day perhaps it will not be found a fitting guest for the temple of justice—it will be deemed advisable to chase it thence in england as elsewhere it is asked why lawsuits are eternal the lawyers say it is owing to the nature of things other people say it is the fault of the lawyers the above two little traits which are as two grains of sand picked up in the deserts of arabia may assist the judgment as to the causes of delay in such procedures   previously to the year      the emoluments of the paymaster of the army whose duty as such consisted in signing or knowing how to sign his name were considerably higher in time of war than in time of peace being principally constituted of a per centage on the money expended in his department this great officer however always found himself a member of parliament and it is believed he was thus paid not for signing or knowing how to sign his name but for talking and knowing how to talk upon a question of peace or war the probity of this orator must have found itself in somewhat an awkward predicament continually besieged as it must have been by bellona with the offer of an enormous revenue which was to cease immediately he suffered himself to be corrupted by peace when the question of economical reform was upon the carpet this place was not forgotten it was generally felt at that time that so decided an opposition between interest and duty was calculated to produce the most pernicious consequences the emoluments of peace and war were therefore equalized by attaching a fixed salary to the office and the same plan was adopted with respect to various other offices in running over the list of functionaries from the highest to the lowest one cannot but be alarmed at the vast proportion of them who watch for war as for a prey it is impossible to say to what a degree by this personal interest the most important measures of government are determined it cannot be supposed that ministers of state generals admirals or members of parliament are influenced in the slightest degree by a vile pecuniary interest all these honourable persons possess probity as well as wisdom so that a trifle of money never can produce the slightest influence upon their conduct not even the effect of an atom upon the immoveable mass of their probity the mischief is that evilminded persons are not convinced by their assertion but continue to repeat that—the honesty which resists temptation is most noble but that which flies from it is most secure   0   in public and private works of all descriptions it is customary to pay the architect a per centage upon the aggregate amount expended this arrangement is a good one when the sum to be expended is fixed there is danger in the contrary case since the greater the expense the greater is the architects pecuniary profit   veracity is one of the most important bases of human society the due administration of justice absolutely depends upon it whatever tends to weaken it saps the foundations of morality security and happiness the more we reflect on its importance the more we shall be astonished that legislators have so indiscreetly multiplied the operations which tend to weaken its influence when the possession of the revenues or other privileges attached to a certain condition of life depends upon the previous performance of certain acts which are required at entering upon that condition these privileges cannot fail to operate upon individuals as incentives to the performance of those acts the effect produced is the same as if they were attached to such performance under the title of reward if among the number of these acts promises which are never performed are required under the sanction of an oath these privileges or other advantages can only be regarded as rewards offered for the commission of perjury if among the number of these acts it be required that certain opinions which are not believed should be pretended to be believed these advantages are neither more nor less than rewards offered for insincerity but the sanction of an oath once contemned is contemned at all times oaths may afterwards be observed but they will not be observed because they are oaths in the university of oxford among whose members the greater number of ecclesiastical benefices are bestowed and which even for laymen is the most fashionable place of education—when a young man presents himself for admission his tutor who is generally a clergyman and the vicechancellor who is also a clergyman put into his hands a book of statutes of which they cause him to swear to observe every one at the same time it is perfectly well known to this vicechancellor and to this tutor that there never has been any person who was able to observe all these statutes it is thus that the first lesson this young man learns and the only lesson he is sure to learn is a lesson of perjury† nor is this all his next step is to subscribe in testimony of his belief to a dogmatical formulary composed about two centuries ago asserted by the church of england to be infallibly true and by most other churches believed to be as infallibly false by this expedient one class of men is excluded while three classes are admitted the class excluded is composed of men who either from a sense of honour or from conscientious motives cannot prevail upon themselves publicly and deliberately to utter a lie the classes admitted consist—  of those who literally believe these dogmas   of those who disbelieve them   of those who sign them as they would sign the alcoran without knowing what they sign or what they think about it a nearly similar practice is pursued at cambridge and from these two sources the clergy of the church of england are supplied socrates was accused as a corruptor of youth what was meant by this accusation i know not but this i know that to instruct the young in falsehood and perjury is to corrupt them and that the benefit of all the other lessons they can learn can never equal the mischief of this instruction‡       it may be inquired whether rewards or other advantages ought to be offered for the defence of any opinion in matters of theory or science or any other subject upon which opinions are divided if the question be one of pure curiosity the worst that can happen will be that the reward will be expended in waste but if the opinion thus favoured happen to be a false one and at the same time mischievous the reward will be productive of unmixed evil but whether it be a question of curiosity or use if truth be the object desired the chance of obtaining it is not so great as when the candidates for reward are allowed to seek it wheresoever it may be to be found if error be to be defended to offer a reward for its defence would be one if not the only method to be adopted who is there that does not perceive that to obtain true testimony it is inexpedient to offer a reward to the witness who shall depose upon a given side—who does not know that the constant effect of such an offer is to discredit the cause of him who makes it if then anything be to be gained by such partiality it can only be by error truth can only be a loser by such partial reward this practice is attended with another and more manifest inconvenience it is that of causing opinions to be professed which are not believed—of inducing a truculent exchange not only of truth but of sincerity for money i do not know if governments ought even to permit individuals to offer rewards upon these conditions to establish error to repudiate truth to suborn falsehood—these in a few words are the effects of all rewards established in favour of one system to the exclusion of all others   charity is ever an amiable virtue but if injudiciously employed it is liable to produce more evil than good hospitals inconsiderately multiplied regular distributions of provisions such as were formerly made at the doors of many convents in spain and italy tend to habituate a large proportion of the people to idleness and beggary a reward thus offered to indolence impoverishes the state and corrupts the people luxury and i annex to this word whatever meaning except that of prodigality people choose to give to it luxury that pretended vice so much reprobated by the envious and melancholic is the steady and natural benefactor of the human species it is a master who is always doing good even when he aims not at it he rewards only the industrious charity is also a benefactor but great circumspection is required that it may prove so   there is another manner in which reward may be mischievous by acting in opposition to the service required—when for example the emoluments attached to an office are such as to afford the means and temptation not to fulfil the duties of it in such a case what may appear a paradox is not the less a great truth the whole does less than a part by paying too much the sovereign is less effectually served but this subject belongs naturally to the head of salaries   whatever weakens the connexion between punishments and offences operates in proportion as an encouragement to the commission of offences it has the effect of a reward offered for their perpetration for whether the inducement to commit offences be augmented or the restraining motives debilitated the result in both cases is the same thus a tax on justice is an indirect reward offered for injustice the same is the case with respect to all technical rules by which independently of the merits nullities are introduced into contracts and into procedure—of every rule that excludes the evidence of a witness the only depository of the fact upon which depends the due administration of justice in a word it is the same with every thing that tends to loosen the connexion between injury and compensation between the violation of the law and punishment if we open our eyes we shall behold the same legislators establishing rewards for informers and taxes and fees upon law proceedings they desire that the first should induce men to render them services of which they stand in need whilst the latter tend to weaken the natural disposition which is felt to render these same services at the threshold of the tribunal of justice are placed a bait and a bugbear the bait operates upon the few—the bugbear upon the multitude  0 there are cases in which to avoid a greater inconvenience it has been found necessary to dispose of the matter of reward in such manner as that it shall operate as a reward for the most atrocious crime yet in spite of the force of the temptation this crime is almost unexampled i allude to the rule established with respect to successions happily whatever may be the force of the seductive motives in this case the tutelary motives act in full concert with all their energy there are many men who for a trifling personal benefit for an advance in rank or even to gratify their spleen would without scruple use their utmost exertions to produce a war that would cost the lives of two or three hundred thousand of their fellowcreatures while among these men there would not be found perhaps one who though he were set free from the dread of legal punishment could be induced for a much greater advantage to attempt the life of a single individual and still less the life of a parent whose death would put him in possession of a fortune or a title     but though laws cannot be framed for its complete removal nothing which can be done without inconvenience ought to be left undone towards the diminution of this danger the persons most exposed to become its victims are those who are necessarily placed under the controul of others such as infants and women it is under the guidance of this principle that our laws in some cases have selected as guardians those persons upon whom no interest can devolve in the way of succession under the laws of sweden precautions of the same description are observed and it has been elsewhere shown that this consideration furnishes one of the arguments in favour of the liberty of divorce contracts relating to insurance furnish another instance of the same danger these contracts in other respects so beneficial have given birth to a new species of crime a man insures a ship or a house at a price greatly beyond its value with the intention of setting fire to the house or causing the ship to be lost and then under pretence of compensation for the loss of which he is the author claims the money for which the insurance is made thus one of the most beneficial inventions of civilized society is converted into a premium for dishonesty and a punishment to virtuous industry had the commission of this crime been attended with less risk or been less difficult to conceal this most admirable contrivance for softening inevitable calamities must have been abandoned chapter ix remuneration—where needless factitious reward is superfluous whenever natural reward is adequate to produce the desired effect under this head may be classed all inventions in the arts which are useful to individuals and whose products may become articles of commerce in the ordinary course of commerce the inventor will meet with a natural reward exactly proportionate to the utility of his discovery and which will unite within itself all the qualities which can be desired in a factitious reward after the most mature consideration no sovereign can find another measure so exact as is thus afforded by the free operations of trade all that the government has to do is to secure for a time to the inventor whatever benefit his discovery may yield this is generally done by the grant of an exclusive privilege or patent of this we shall elsewhere speak more in detail not many years ago a grant of £ 000 was made by parliament to a physician for the discovery of a yellow dye that money might without doubt have been worse employed but the reward was unnecessary for this discovery as for all others in the arts the proper test of its utility would have been its use in manufactures and commerce the grant of a determinate sum was a loss either to the inventor or to the public to the inventor if it were less than he would have gained under a patent to the public if it were more in a word wherever patents for inventions are in use factitious reward is either groundless or superfluous† i shall elsewhere treat of the encouragements to be given to the arts and sciences upon the present occasion all that i shall observe is that the greater the progress they have made the less necessary is it to tax the public for their support in this country for example if the exclusive property in his work be secured to an author a reward is at the same time secured to him proportionate to the service he has performed—at least in every branch of amusement or instruction that yields a sufficient class of readers there is no patron to be compared with the public and by the honour with which it accompanies the other rewards it bestows this patronage has a decided advantage over any that can be received from any other source with respect to the rewards that in some european states have been bestowed upon poets the amount of them is so insignificant as to save them from the severe scrutiny to which they might under other circumstances have found themselves exposed there are some countries in which the relish for literature is confined to such small numbers that it may upon the whole be beneficial to encourage it by factitious rewards but if we consider how intense are the enjoyments of the man born with poetic talents the sudden reputation which they produce and the ample profit they often yield especially in the dramatic line it will be found that the natural     rewards attached to them are far from being inconsiderable and that at least our attention ought in the first place to be directed to the department of the sciences the approaches to which are repulsive and the utility of which is indisputable happiness depends upon the correctness of the facts with which our mind is furnished and the rectitude of our judgment but poetry has no very direct tendency to produce either correctness of knowledge or rectitude of judgment for one instance in which it has been employed to combat mischievous prejudices a thousand might be cited in which they have been fostered and propagated by it homer is the greatest of poets where shall we place him among moralists can any great advantage be derived from the imitation of his gods and heroes i do not condemn prizes for poetry where the object is to excite youthful emulation i only desire that serious and truly useful pursuits may receive a proportionate encouragement chapter x proportion as to rewards in conferring reward the observance of exact rules of proportion is not nearly of the same importance as in the infliction of punishment these rules cannot however be neglected with impunity if too great a reward be held out for a given service competitors will be attracted from more useful pursuits if too little the desired service will either not be rendered or will not be rendered in perfection rule i the aggregate value of the natural and factitious reward ought not to be less than sufficient to outweigh the burthen of the service rule ii factitious rewards may be diminished in proportion as natural rewards are increased these two rules present three subjects to our observation—  the natural burthens attached to the service—  the natural rewards which either do or do not require factitious reward to supply their deficiency—  the drawback more or less hidden which in a variety of cases alters the apparent value of the reward   the natural burthens of any particular service may be comprised under the following heads—the intensity of labour required in its performance—the ulterior uneasiness which may arise from its particular character—the physical danger attending it—the expenses or other sacrifices necessarily made previously to its exercise—the discredit attached to it—the peculiar enmities it produces the wages of labour in different branches of trade are regulated in exact proportion to the combination of these several circumstances to the legislator however except in cases where it may be necessary to add factitious to natural reward considerations of this sort are in general subjects only of speculation that any particular service is more or less highly priced is of little importance it affects the individuals only who stand in need of it the competition between those who want and those who can supply fixes the price of all services in the most fitting manner it is sufficient that the demand be public and free to assist if necessary in giving publicity to the demand and in maintaining reciprocal liberty in such transactions is all that the legislator ought do do   natural rewards are liable to be insufficient in relation to services whose utility extends to the whole community without producing particular advantage to any one individual more than another of this nature are public employments it is true many public employments are attended by natural rewards in the shape of honour power the means of serving ones connexions and deserving the public gratitude and when these rewards are sufficient factitious rewards are superfluous to their ambassadors and many others of their great officers of state the venetians never gave any pecuniary reward in england the public functions of sheriffs and justices of the peace are generally discharged by opulent and independent individuals whose only reward consists in the respect and power attached to those offices   there are many circumstances which may diminish the value of a reward without being generally known beforehand but against all of which it is proper to guard does the reward consist of money its value may be diminished by a burthen of the same nature or by a burthen in the shape of honour honour and money may even be seen at strife with one another as well as with themselves by these means the value of a reward may sometimes be reduced to nothing and even become negative in this country where properly speaking there is no public prosecutor many offences which no individual has any peculiar interest in prosecuting are liable to remain unpunished in the way of remedy the law offers from £ 0 to £ 0 to be levied upon the goods of the offender to whoever will successfully undertake this function sometimes it is added that the expenses will be repaid in case of conviction sometimes this is not promised these expenses may amount to thirty fifty and even one hundred pounds it is seldom     they are so little as twenty pounds after this can we be surprised that the laws are imperfectly obeyed it may be added that it is considered dishonourable to attend to this summons of the laws an individual who in this manner endeavours to serve his country is called an informer and lest public opinion should not be sufficient to brand him with infamy the servants of the law and even the laws themselves have on some occasions endeavoured to fix the stain the number of private prosecutors would be much more numerous if instead of the insidious offer of a reward an indemnification were substituted the dishonourable offer being suppressed the dishonour itself would cease and who can say when by such an arrangement the circumstance which offends it is removed whether honour itself may not be pressed into the service of the laws there is another case in which by the negligence of legal and official arrangements a considerable and certain expense is attached to and made to precede a variable and uncertain reward a new idea presents itself to some workman or artist knowing that the laws grant to every inventor a privilege to enable him exclusively to reap the profits of his invention he enjoys by anticipation his success and labours to perfect his invention having in the prosecution of his discovery consumed perhaps the greater part of his property and his life his invention is complete he goes with a joyful heart to the public office to ask for his patent but what does he encounter clerks lawyers and officers of state who reap beforehand the fruits of his industry this privilege is not given but is in fact sold for from £ 00 to £ 00—sums greater perhaps than he ever possessed in his life he finds himself caught in a snare which the law or rather extortion which has obtained the force of law has spread for the industrious inventor it is a tax levied upon ingenuity and no man can set bounds to the value of the services it may have lost to the nation rule iii reward should be adjusted in such a manner to each particular service that for every part of the benefit there may be a motive to induce a man to give birth to it in other words the value of the reward ought to advance step by step with the value of the service this rule is more accurately followed in respect of rewards than of punishments if a man steal a quantity of corn the punishment is the same whether he steal one bushel or ten but when a premium is given for the exportation of corn the amount of the premium bears an exact proportion to the amount exported to be consistent in matters of legislation the scale ought to be as regular in the one case as in the other the utility of this rule is put beyond doubt by the difference that may be observed between the quantity of work performed by men employed by the day and men employed by the piece when a ditch is to be dug and the work is divided between one set of men working by the day and another set working by the piece there is no difficulty in predicting which set will have finished first hope and perhaps emulation are the motives which actuate the labourer by the piece the motive which actuates the labourer by the day is fear—fear of being discharged in case of manifest and extraordinary idleness it must not however be forgotten that there are many sorts of work in respect of which it is improper to adopt this mode of payment which tends indeed to produce the greatest quantity of labour but at the same time is calculated to give birth to negligence and precipitation this method ought only to be employed in cases where the quality of the work can easily be discerned and its imperfections if any detected the value of a reward may be increased or diminished in respect of certainty as well as amount when therefore any services require frequently renewed efforts it is desirable that each effort should render the probability of its attainment more certain arrangements should be made for connecting services with reward in such manner that the attainment of the reward shall remain uncertain without however ceasing to be more probable than the contrary event the faculties of the individual employed will thus naturally be kept upon the full stretch this is accomplished when a competition is established between two or more persons and a reward is promised to that one who shall render service in the most eminent degree whether it respect the quantity or the quality of the service proposed rule iv when two services come in competition of which a man cannot be induced to perform both the reward for the greater service ought to be sufficient to induce him to prefer it to the less in a certain country matters are so arranged that more is to be gained by building ships on the old plan than by inventing better by taking one ship than by blockading a hundred by plundering at sea than by fighting by distorting the established laws than by executing them by clamouring for or against ministers than by showing in what manner the laws may be improved it must however be admitted that in respect of some of these abuses it would be difficult to prescribe the proper remedy by what method can competition between two services be established the individual from whom they are required must either from personal qualifications or external circumstances have it in his power to render either the one or the other it is proper to     distinguish the cases in which this position is transient from those in which it is permanent it is in the first that the fault committed by suffering disproportion to subsist is most irreparable during the american war upwards of an hundred ships were at one time in one of the harbours of the revolted colonies it was of great importance that they should be kept in a state of blockade since many of them were loaded with military stores an english captain received orders to blockade them sufficiently skilled in arithmetic and in proverbs to know that two or three birds in his cage were worth a hundred in the bush he acted as the greater number of men would have acted in his place he stood off to a sufficient distance to give the enemy hopes of escaping as soon as they had quitted the harbour he returned captured halfadozen and the rest proceeded to their destination i do not answer for the truth of this anecdote but true or not true it is equally good as an apologue it exhibits one of the fruits of that inconsiderate prodigality which grants without discrimination the produce of their captures to the captors another example a man who has influence obtains the command of a frigate with orders to go upon a cruise the command of a firstrate is accepted by those only who cannot obtain a frigate it is thus that interest is put in competition with duty—cupidity with glory there are doubtless not wanting noble minds by whom the seductions of sinister interest are resisted but wherefore should they be so much exposed to what it is so difficult to resist it is true that their ears may not be altogether insensible to the call of honour the law has bestowed pecuniary rewards upon the captors of armed vessels—another example where one instance of profusion has created the necessity of a second—but these rewards are still unequal the chase of doves is more advantageous than the pursuit of eagles the remedy would be to tax and tax heavily the profits of lucrative cruises to form a fund of reward in favour of dangerous or merely useful expeditions by this arrangement the country would be doubly benefited the service would be rendered more attractive and conducted with more economy it may be true that if this tax were deducted from the share of the seamen their ardour might be cooled neither in value or in number are their prizes in this lottery susceptible of diminution but though this be true with respect to the lower ranks of the profession ought we to judge in the same manner of the superior officers whose minds are elevated as their rank and on whose conduct the performance of the duty has the most immediate dependence in the judicial department the service which belongs to the profession of an advocate and the service which belongs to the office of a judge are in a state of rivalry they constitute the elements of two permanent conditions of which the first among most nations is the preliminary route to the second in england the judges are uniformly selected from among the class of advocates now the interest of the country requires that the choice should fall upon the men of highest attainments in their profession since upon the reputation of the judges depends the opinion which every man forms of his security it is not of the same importance to the public that advocates should be supereminently skilful their occupation is not to seek out what is agreeable to justice but what agrees with the interest of the party to which chance has engaged them on the contrary the more decidedly any advocate is exalted in point of talents above his colleagues the more desirable is it that he should no longer continue an advocate in proportion to his preeminence is the probability that he will be opposed to the distribution of justice the worse the cause of the suitor the more pressing is his need of an able advocate to remedy his weakness  per annum in england the emoluments of the lord chancellor are reckoned at £ 0000 — vicechancellor  000 — master of the rolls  000 — chiefjustice of the kings bench   00 — chiefjustice of the common pleas  000 — chiefbaron of the exchequer  000 — nine puisne judges  000 now amongst the class of advocates there are always to be found about halfadozen whose annual emoluments average from eight to twelve thousand pounds of this number there is not one who would not disdain the office of puisne judge since his profits are actually two or three times as great as theirs to these advocates of the first class may be added as many more who would equally disdain these subordinate situations in the hope every day of succeeding to the advocates who shall succeed to the principal situations there are two methods of obviating this inconvenience the one by increasing the emoluments of the judges this course has been adopted upon many occasions and they have been raised to their present amount without success the other consists in lowering the profits of the advocates a desirable object in more respects than one but which can result only from rendering the whole system of the laws more simple and intelligible in the department of education there is a nearly similar rivalry between the profession of the clergy and the office of professor as between the profession of advocate and the     office of judge in the department of the laws in proportion as he is what he ought to be in order to be useful a clergyman is a professor of morality having for his pupils a larger or smaller number of persons of every class during the whole course of their lives on the other hand a professor as he is called has for his pupils a number of select individuals whose character is calculated to exercise the greatest influence upon the general mass of the people and among their number the clergy are generally to be found the period during which these individuals attend the lectures of the professor is the most critical period of life—the only period during which they are under obligation to pay attention to what they hear or to receive the instruction presented to them such being the relation between the services of the two classes let us see what is the proportion between the amount of reward respectively allotted to each in england the emoluments of the clergy vary from £ 0 to £ 0000 ayear while those of the professors in the chief seats of education—the universities—are between the twentieth and the hundredth part of the latter sum in scotland the emoluments of the professors differ but little from what they are in england but the richest ecclesiastical benefice is scarcely equal to the least productive professorship it is thus says adam smith that in england the church is continually draining the universities of all their best and ablest members and an old college tutor who is known and distinguished as an eminent man of letters is rarely to be found whilst in scotland the case is exactly the reverse it is by the influence of this circumstance that he explains how academical education is so excellent in the scottish universities and according to him so defective in those of england between two professions which do not enter into competition with each other for example those of operadancers and clergymen a disproportion between their emoluments is not attended with such palpable inconveniences but when by any circumstance two professions are brought into comparison with each other the least advantageous loses its value by the comparison and the disproportion presents to the eye of the observer the idea of injustice chapter xi choice as to rewards in making a proper selection of punishments much skill is required comparatively much less is requisite in the proper selection of rewards not only are the species of rewards more limited in number than those of punishments but the grounds of preference are more easily discoverable and there are not as in the case of punishments any passions which tend to mislead the judgment the qualities desirable in rewards are the same as in the case of punishments we shall enumerate them and then proceed to point out in what degree they are united in certain modes of remuneration a reward is best adapted to fulfil the purpose for which it may be designed when it is—   variable susceptible of increase or diminution in respect of amount that it may be proportioned to the different degrees of of service   equable that equal portions may at all times operate with equal force upon all individuals   commensurable with respect to other species of rewards attached to other services   exemplary its apparent ought not to differ from its real value this quality is wanting when a large expense is incurred for the purpose of reward without its becoming matter of notoriety the object aimed at ought to be to strike the attention and produce a durable impression   economical more ought not to be paid for a service than it is worth this is the rule in every market   characteristic as far as possible analogous to the service it becomes by this means the more exemplary   popular it ought not to oppose established prejudices in vain did the roman emperors bestow honours upon the most odious informers they degraded the honours but the informers were not the less infamous but it is not enough that it does not oppose the prejudice it is desirable that every reward should obtain the approbation of the public   fructifying calculated to excite the perseverance of the individual in the career of service and to supply him with new resources in the selection from among the variety of rewards of that particular one which most certainly will produce any desired effect attention must not only be paid to the nature of the service but also to the particular disposition and character of the individual upon whom it is to operate in this respect public regulations can never attain the perfection of which domestic discipline is susceptible no sovereign can ever in the same degree be acquainted with the dispositions of his subjects as a father may be with those of his children this disadvantage is however compensated by the larger number of competitors     in a kingdom every diversity of temperament and every degree of aptitude may be found united together and provided the reward be proportionate to the service it will be of little importance what may be its nature like the magnet which out of a heterogeneous mass attracts and separates the most hidden particles of iron it will detect the individual susceptible of its attraction besides the nature of pecuniary reward which is adapted to the greater proportion of services is such that every individual may convert it into the species of pleasure which he most prefers to form a judgment of the merits and demerits of pecuniary reward a glance at the list of desirable qualities will suffice it will at once be seen which of them it possesses and of which of them it is deficient it is variable equable and commensurable it ought to be added that it is frequently indispensably necessary there are many cases in which every other reward separated from this would not only be a burthen but even a mockery especially if the performance of the service have been attended with an expense or loss greater than the individual can easily support on the other hand pecuniary reward is not exempt from disadvantages speaking generally for there are many exceptions it is neither exemplary nor characteristic nor even popular when allowed to exceed a certain amount it tends to diminish the activity of the receiver instead of adding to his inclination to persevere in his services it may furnish him with a temptation to discontinue them the enriched man will be apt to think like the soldier of lucullus who became timid so soon as he possessed property to preserve ibit eo quo vis qui zonam perdidit inquit hor epist ii lib   there are also cases in which money instead of an attractive may have a repulsive effect—instead of operating as a reward may be considered as an insult at least by persons who possess any delicacy in their sentiments of honour a certain degree of skill is therefore required in the application of money as a reward it is oftentimes desirable that the pecuniary should appear only as an accessary to the honorary which should be made to constitute the principal part of the reward† every pecuniary reward may be as it were annihilated by its relative smallness a man of independent fortune and of a certain rank in society would be considered as degraded by accepting a sum that would not degrade a mechanic there is no rule for determining what is permitted or prohibited in this respect custom has established the prejudice but the difficulty it presents is not insurmountable by combining together money and honour a compound is formed which is universally pleasing medals for example possess this double advantage by a little art and precaution a solid peace is established between pride and cupidity and thus united they have both been ranged under the banners of merit pride proclaims aloud—it is not the intrinsic value of the metal which possesses attractions for me it is the circle of glory alone with which it is surrounded cupidity makes its calculation in silence and accurately estimates the value of the material of the prize by the society of arts a still higher degree of perfection has been attained a choice is commonly allowed between a sum of money and a medal thus all conditions and tastes are satisfied the mechanic or peasant pockets the money the peer or gentleman ornaments his cabinet with a medal the apparent value of medals is in some cases augmented by rendering the design upon them characteristic of the service on account of which they are bestowed by the addition of the name of the individual rewarded an exclusive certificate is made in his favour the ingenuity displayed in the choice of the design has sometimes been extremely happy a british statute gives to the person who apprehends and convicts a highwayman amongst other rewards the horse on which the offender was mounted when he committed the offence possibly the framer of this law may have taken the hint from the passage in virgil in which the son of æneas promises to nisus in case of the success of the expedition he was meditating the very horse and accoutrements which turnus had been seen to use‡ it is equally possible that the same knowledge of human nature which suggested to the latin poet the efficacy     of such a reward suggested it at once to the english lawgiver be this as it may this provision is commendable on three several accounts in the assignment of the prize it pitches upon an object which from the nature of the transaction is likely to make a particular impression on the mind of the person whose assistance is required acting in this respect in conformity to the rule above laid down which recommends and attention to the circumstances influencing the sensibility of the person on whom impression is to be made it also has the advantage of being characteristic as well as exemplary the animal when thus transferred becomes a voucher for the activity and prowess of its owner as well as a trophy of his victory an arrangement like this simple as it is or rather because it is so simple was an extraordinary stretch in british policy in which though there is generally a great mixture of good sense there reigns throughout a kind of littleness and mauvaise honte which avoids with timid caution everything that is bold striking and eccentric scarcely ever hazarding any of those strong and masterly touches which strike the imagination and fill the mind with the idea of the sublime examples of rewards of this nature abound in the roman system of remuneration for every species of merit appropriate symbolic crowns were provided this branch of their administration preserved the ancient simplicity of rome in its cradle and the wreath of parsley long eclipsed the splendour of the crowns of gold i was about to speak of their triumphs but here i am compelled to stop humanity shudders at that pride of conquest which treads under its feet the vanquished nations the system of legislation ought no doubt to be adapted to the encouragement of military ardour but it ought not to fan it into such a flame as to make it the predominant passion of the people and to prostrate everything before it honorary rewards are eminently exemplary they are standing monuments of the service for which they have been bestowed they also possess the desirable property of operating as a perpetual encouragement to fresh exertions to disgrace an honorary reward is to be a traitor to ones self he that has once been pronounced brave should perpetually merit that commendation to create a reward of this nature is not very difficult the symbolical language of esteem is like written language matter of convention every mode of dress every ceremony so soon as it is made a mark of preeminence becomes honourable a branch of laurel a ribband a garter—everything possesses the value which is assigned to it it is however desirable that these ensigns should possess some emblematic character expressive of the nature of the service for which they are bestowed with reference to this principle the blazonry of heraldry appears rude and unmeaning the decorations of the various orders of knighthood though not deficient in splendour are highly deficient in respect of character they strike the eye but they convey no instruction to the mind a ribband appears more like the finery of a woman than the distinctive decoration of a hero honorary titles have frequently derived a part of their glory from being characteristic the place which has been the theatre of his exploits has often furnished a title for a victorious general well calculated to perpetuate the memory of his services and his glory at a very early period of their history the romans employed this expedient in addition to the other rewards which they conferred upon the general who completed a conquest—hence the surnames of africanus numidicus asiaticus germanicus and so many others this custom has frequently been imitated catherine ii revived it in favour of the romanoffs and orloffs mahon twice in the eighteenth century furnished titles to its conquerors the mansion of blenheim unites to the eclat of the name a more substantial proof of national gratitude the romans occasionally applied the same mode of reward to services of a different description the appian way perpetually recalled to the memory of those who journeyed on it the liberality of appius† the career of legislation may also furnish some instances of honours which possess this character of analogy in the digest of the sardinian laws very praiseworthy care was taken to inform the people to which of their sovereigns they were indebted for each particular law it is an example worthy of imitation it may have been intended as a mark of respect as well as for convenience of reference that it has been customary to designate by the title of the grenville act the admirable law which this representative of the people procured to be enacted for the impartial decision of questions relative to contested elections had the statue of this legislator been placed     in the house of commons from which he banished a scandalous disorder it would both have been a monument of gratitude and a noble lesson it might have for its companion a statue of his noble rival the author of economical reform it is thus that the impartial judgment of posterity forgetting the differences which separated them delights to recollect the excellencies which assimilated them to each other it is thus that it has placed side by side of each other eschines and demosthenes the more men become enlightened the more clearly will they perceive the necessity at least of dividing honour between those who cause nations to flourish by means of good laws and those who defend them by their valour among the most obvious and efficacious means of conferring honorary rewards are pictures busts statues and other imitative representations of the person meant to be rewarded these spread his fame to posterity and in conjunction with the history of the service hand down the idea of the person by whom it was rendered they are naturally accompanied with inscriptions explanatory of the cause for which the honour was decreed when the art of writing has become common these inscriptions will frequently give disgust by the length or extravagance of the elogium and it will then become an object of good taste to say as much in as few words as possible perhaps the happiest specimens of the kind that were or ever will be produced are the two inscriptions placed under the statues of louis xiv and voltaire the one erected by the town of montpellier the latter by a society of men of letters of whom frederick iii king of prussia was one—a louis xiv après sa mort a voltaire pendant sa vie to the king though no longer the object of hope and fear to the poet and philosopher though still the butt of envy the business on occasions like these is not to inform but to remind history and the art of printing do the rest the greater number of the rewards of which we have spoken above are occasional that is applied to a particular action there are others which are more permanent in their character such as the hospitals of chelsea and greenwich in england and lhôtel des invalides at paris doubts have often been entertained of the utility of these establishments rewards it has been said might be extended to a much greater number of individuals if the annual amount of the expenses of these places were distributed in the shape of pensions while the individuals would thus be rendered much happier since men who have passed their days of activity united in a place where they are no longer subject to the cares and labours of life are exposed to the most ceaseless listlessness i shall not dispute the truth of these observations but on the other hand shall examine the effect of these establishments upon the minds of soldiers and sailors their imaginations are flattered by the magnificence of these retreats it is a brilliant prospect opened to them all an asylum is provided for those who having quitted their country and their families in their youth have frequently in their days of decrepitude and age no other home in the world those who are mutilated or disfigured with wounds are consoled by the renown which awaits them in the hospital where everything reminds them of their exploits it may also be for the benefit of the service more prudent thus to unite than to disperse them it is a luxury but it is rational exemplary and possesses a character of justice and magnificence these establishments being necessarily limited with respect to the number which can be admitted into them may be considered upon the footing of extraordinary rewards applicable to distinguished services they would thus constitute a species of nobility for the soldiers and sailors they would acquire an additional degree of splendour were their walls adorned by the trophies taken in war which would there appear much more appropriately placed than when deposited in the temples of peace the decorations of the chapel of lhôtel des invalides are admirable the flags suspended in the cathedral of st paul only awaken thoughts at variance with those of religious worship removed to chelsea or greenwich they would be connected with natural associations and would furnish a text to the commentaries of those who acquired them by their valour it is not often that every desirable quality is seen to be united in one and the same reward this union however frequently takes place in an almost imperceptible manner an instance of a reward particularly well adapted to the nature of the service is that of the monopoly which it is almost universally the custom to create in favour of inventors from the very nature of the thing it adapts itself with the utmost nicety to those rules of proportion to which it is most difficult for reward artificially instituted by the legislator to conform it adapts itself with the utmost nicety to the value of the service if confined as it ought to be to the precise point in which the originality of the invention consists it is conferred with the least possible waste of expense it causes a service to be rendered which without it a man would not have a motive for rendering and that only by forbidding others from doing that which were it not for that service it would not have been possible for them to have done even with regard to such inventions for such there will be where others besides him   0 who possesses himself of the reward have scent of the invention it is still of use by stimulating all parties and setting them to strive which shall first bring his discovery to bear with all this it unites every property which can be wished for in a reward it is variable equable commensurable characteristic exemplary frugal promotive of perseverance subservient to compensation popular and revocable chapter xii procedure as to rewards the province of reward is the last asylum of arbitrary power in the early stages of society punishments pardons and rewards were equally lavished without measure and without necessity the infliction of punishment has already in a measure been subject to regulation at some future time rules will be laid down for the granting of pardons and last of all for the bestowment of rewards if punishment ought not to be inflicted without formal proof of the commission of crime neither ought reward to be conferred without equally formal proof of desert it may be allowed that in point of importance the difference between the two cases is great that punishment inflicted without trial excites universal alarm whilst reward conferred without desert excites no such feelings but these considerations only prove that the advantage of formal procedure in the distribution of reward is limited to the prevention of prodigality and of the other abuses by which the value of reward is diminished at rome if certain travellers may be believed it is the custom when a saint is about to be canonized to allow an advocate who in familiar language is called the advocate of the devil to plead against his admission if this advocate had always been faithful to his client the calender might not have been so full as at present be this as it may the idea itself is excellent and might advantageously be borrowed by politics from religion litalico valor non è ancor morto there are yet some lessons to be learned in the capital of the world it is reported of peter the great that when be condescended to pass through every gradation of military rank from the lowest to the highest in his empire he took no step without producing regular certificates of his qualifications we may be allowed to suppose that even with inferior recommendations to those produced by this great prince he would have succeeded there was no advocate for the devil to contest the point and even had there been one his fidelity would have been doubtful but had the qualifications of the czar been as imperfect as according to the history they were complete his submitting to produce them would have offered a noble lesson in england when a dormant peerage is claimed by any individual the attorneygeneral is constituted the advocate for the devil and charged to examine into and produce everything which can invalidate his title wherefore is he not thus employed when it is proposed to create new peers why should he not be allowed to urge everything which can be said against the measure is it feared that he would be too often successful† in the distribution of rewards were it always necessary publicly to assign the reason for their bestowment a restraint would be imposed upon princes and their ministers to which they are unwilling to submit there formerly existed in sweden a custom or positive law obliging the king to insert in the patent conferring a pension or title the reason for the grant in      this custom was abolished by an express law inserted in the gazette of that court declaring that the individuals honoured by the bounty of the king should be considered as indebted to his favour alone did this monarch think that he stood in need of services which he would not dare publicly to acknowledge‡     in england the remuneratory branch of arbitrary power has begun to be pruned except in particular cases the king is not allowed to grant a pension exceeding £ 00 per annum without the consent of parliament since the passing of the act containing this restriction the candidates for pensions have been but few when m necker undertook the administration of the finances in france the total of the acknowledged pensions without reckoning the secret gratuities which were very considerable amounted to twentyseven millions of livres in england where the national wealth was not less than in france the pensions did not amount to the tenth part of this sum it is thus that the difference between a limited and an absolute monarchy may be exhibited even in figures in ireland the king upon his sole authority in      created an order of knighthood thus profiting by what remained of the fragments of arbitrary power no blame was imputed to him for establishing this tax upon honour had he levied a tax upon property the nation might not have been so tractable those who hoped to share in the new treasure were careful not to raise an outery against its establishment those at whose expense this treasure was established did not understand this piece of finesse they opened their eyes widely but comprehended nothing the measure could not have been better justified by circumstances every day the crown found itself stripped of some prerogative justly or unjustly the subject of envy it was therefore high time to avail itself of the small number of those in the exercise of which it was still tolerated become independent of great britain the honour of the irish nation seemed to require a decoration of this kind for what is a kingdom without an order of knighthood to enter into the consideration of the details requisite for the establishment of a system of remuneratory procedure comes not within the present part of our design a very slight sketch of the leading principles on which it might be grounded is the utmost that can here be given the general idea would of course be taken from the system established in penal and civil cases between these systems the most striking difference would however arise from the interest and wishes of the agent whose act might be the subject of investigation with respect to the publicity of the act in the one case the consequences of such his act in case it were proved being pernicious to him all his endeavour would be to keep it concealed in the other these consequences being beneficial his endeavour would be to place it in the most conspicuous light imaginable in the first case his endeavours would be to delay the process and if possible make it void in the latter to expedite it and keep it valid the most striking point of coincidence is the occasion there is in both cases for two parties in the civil branch there can hardly be a deficiency in this respect there being commonly two individuals whose interests are opposite and known and felt to be so but in the penal branch in one very large division of it there is naturally no such opposition i mean in that which concerns offences against the public only here therefore the law has been obliged to create such an opposition and has accordingly created it by the establishment of a public prosecutor in the remuneratory branch of procedure there is a similar absence of natural opposition and accordingly the grand desideratum is the appointment of an officer whose business it should be to contest on the part of the public the title to whatever reward is proposed to be granted in this way he might be entitled for shortness by some such name as that of contestorgeneral without a prosecutorgeneral in the large and important division of cases above mentioned there would not unless by accident—i mean when an individual is engaged in the task of prosecution by public spirit or what is much more natural by private pique—be any suit instituted any punishment inflicted for want of a contestorgeneral there is not unless by a similar accident any check given to the injustice of unmerited remuneration upon the whole then the penal and civil     branches of procedure but particularly the penal may in all cases serve either as the models or if the term may be admitted as the antimodels of the remuneratory branch of procedure chapter xiii rewards to informers the execution of a law cannot be enforced unless the violation of it be denounced the assistance of the informer is therefore altogether as necessary and as meritorious as that of the judge we have already had occasion to remark that with respect to public offences where no one individual more than another is interested in their prosecution it has been found necessary to create a sort of magistrate an accusergeneral to carry on such prosecutions in virtue of his office but it is indispensably necessary that offences should be denounced to him before he can begin to act in a wellordered community it would be the duty of every individual possessing evidence of the commission of a crime to denounce the criminal to the tribunals and such individual would be disposed so to do in most countries however men in general are desirous of withdrawing from the performance of this duty some refuse to perform it from mistaken notions of pity towards the delinquent others because they disapprove of some part of the law others from the fear of making enemies many from indolence almost all from a disinclination to submit to that loss which would arise from the interruption of their ordinary occupations in these countries therefore it has been found necessary to offer pecuniary rewards to informers so far as my knowledge extends governments have never been advised to discontinue this practice it is supported by authority but it is condemned by public opinion mercenary informations are considered disgraceful salaried informers odious hence it results that the reward offered by the law does not possess all its nominal value the disgrace attached to the service is a drawback upon its amount the individual is rewarded by the state and punished by the moral sanction let us examine the usual objections made against mercenary informations   it is odious it is said to profit by the evil we have caused to others this objection is founded upon a feeling of improper commiseration for the offender since pity towards the guilty is cruelty towards the innocent the reward paid to the informer has for its object the service he has performed in this respect he is upon a level with the judge who is paid for passing sentence the informer is a servant of the government employed in opposing the internal enemies of the state as the soldier is a servant employed in opposing its external foes   it introduces into society a system of espionage to the word espionage a stigma is attached let us substitute the word inspection which is unconnected with the same prejudices if this inspection consist in the maintenance of an oppressive system of police which subjects innocent actions to punishment which condemns secretly and arbitrarily it is natural that such a system and its agents should become odious but if this inspection consist in the maintenance of a system of police for the preservation of the public tranquillity and the execution of good laws all its inspectors and all its guardians act a useful and salutary part it is the vicious only who will have reason to complain it will be formidable to them alone   pecuniary rewards may induce false witnesses to conspire against the innocent if we suppose a public and wellorganized system of procedure in which the innocent are not deprived of any means of defence the danger resulting from conspiracy will appear but small besides the prodigious difficulty of inventing a coherent tale capable of enduring a rigorous examination there is no comparison between the reward offered by the law and the risk to which false witnesses are exposed mercenary witnesses also are exactly those who excite the greatest distrust in the mind of a judge and if they are the only witnesses a suspicion of conspiracy instantly presents itself and becomes a protection to the accused these objections are urged in justification of the prejudice which exists but the prejudice itself has been produced by other causes and those causes are specious the first with respect to the educated classes of society is a prejudice drawn from history especially from that of the roman emperors the word informer at once recalls to the mind those detestable miscreants the horror of all ages whom even the pencil of tacitus has failed to cover with all the ignominy they deserve but these informers were not the executors of the law they were the executors of the personal and lawless vengeance of the sovereign the second and most general cause of this prejudice is founded upon the employment given to informers by religious intolerance in the ages of ignorance and bigotry barbarous     laws having been enacted against those who did not profess the dominant religion informers were then considered as zealous and orthodox believers but in proportion to the increase of knowledge the manners of men have been softened and these laws having become odious the informers without whose services they would have fallen into disuse partook of the hatred which the laws themselves inspired it was an injustice in respect to them but a salutary effect resulted from it to the classes exposed to oppression these cases of tyranny excepted the prejudice which condemns mercenary informers is an evil it is a consequence of the inattention of the public to their true interests and of the general ignorance in matters of legislation instead of acting in consonance with the dictates of the principle of utility people in general have blindly abandoned themselves to the guidance of sympathy and antipathy—of sympathy in favour of those who injure—of antipathy to those who render them essential service if an informer deserves to be hated a judge deserves to be abhorred this prejudice also partly springs from a confusion of ideas no distinction is made between the judicial and the private informer between the man who denounces a crime in a court of justice and he who secretly insinuates accusations against his enemies between the man who affords to the accused an opportunity of defending himself and he who imposes the condition of silence with respect to his perfidious reports clandestine accusations are justly considered as the bane of society they destroy confidence and produce irremediable evils but they have nothing in common with judicial accusations it is extremely difficult to eradicate prejudices so deeply rooted and natural from necessity the practice of paying public informers continues to be in use but the character of an informer is still regarded as disgraceful and by some strange fatality the judges make no efforts to enlighten the public mind on this subject and to protect this useful and even necessary class of men from the rigour of public opinion they ought not to suffer the eloquence of the bar to insult before their faces these necessary assistants in the administration of justice the conduct of the english law towards informers furnishes a curious but deplorable instance of human frailty it employs them oftentimes deceives them and always holds them up to contempt it is time for lawgivers at least to wean themselves from these schoolboy prejudices which can consist only with a gross inattention to the interests of the public joined to a gross ignorance of the principles of human nature they should settle with themselves once for all what it is they would have they should strike somehow or other a balance between the benefit expected from the effects of a law and the inconveniences or supposed inconveniences inseparable from its execution if the inconveniences preponderate let there be an end of the law if the benefits let there be an end of all obstacles which an aversion to the necessary instruments on which its efficacy depends would oppose to its execution chapter xiv rewards to accomplices among informers criminals who denounce their accomplices have been distinguished from others and the offer of pardon or rewards to induce them thus to act has been condemned as altogether improper it must be acknowledged that so long as there is any other means of obtaining the conviction of a criminal without thus rewarding an accomplice this method is bad the impunity necessarily accompanying it is an evil but if there be no other means this method is good since the impunity of a single criminal is a less evil than the impunity of many in relation however to weighty and serious crimes no such rewards can with propriety be appointed by a general law a general law offering pardon and reward to the criminal who informed against his accomplices would be an invitation to the commission of all sorts of crimes it would be as though the legislator had said among a multitude of criminals the most wicked shall not only be unpunished but rewarded a man shall lay plans for the commission of a crime—shall engage accomplices with the intention of betraying them to the natural profits of the crime such a law would add the reward bestowed upon him as an informer it is what has often happened under english law it is one of the fruits of the maxim which prohibits the examination of suspected persons respecting facts which may tend to criminate themselves it is however criminals who can always furnish and who often can alone furnish the light necessary for the guidance of justice but the examination of suspected persons being forbidden as a means of obtaining intelligence there remains only the method of reward but when the reward instead of being bestowed in virtue of a general law is left to the discretion of the judge and offered only when necessary this inconvenience does not exist advantageous crimes can no longer be committed with security recourse being had to this costly method only when all other methods fail there will always be a longer or shorter interval during which every criminal     will feel himself exposed to the punishment denounced against his crimes the employment of reward in this manner having become usual will exercise upon the security of criminals the effect of a general law it might even be prescribed by such a law this method would then possess all the advantages of an unconditional law without its inconveniences beccaria has condemned without exception every reward offered to accomplices as the foundation of his opinion he produces only a confused sentiment of disapprobation attached to the words treason and faithlessness voluntary conventions among men are generally useful to society it would be in most cases productive of evil were they not considered binding infamy has therefore become constantly attached to the terms treason and faithlessness the acts however to which these terms are applied are only pernicious in as far as the contracts of which they are violations are at least innocent to render the security of society which crimes were they to remain unpunished would destroy subordinate to the accomplishment of all manner of engagements would be to render the end subordinate to the means what would become of society were it once established as a principle that the commission of a crime became a duty if once it had been promised that promises ought to be performed is a maxim which without a limitation excepting those the performance of which would be pernicious to society ought to have place neither in laws nor in morals it is doubtful which would be most injurious—the nonperformance of every promise or the performance of all far from being a greater evil than that to which it is opposed it would be difficult to show that the nonperformance of criminal engagements is productive of any evil from the performance of such an engagement an unfavourable judgment only can be formed of the character of the party how can a similar judgment be formed from its violation because he has repented of having committed or been willing to commit an action injurious to society and which he knew to be so does it follow that he will fail to perform actions which he knows to be innocent and useful from the violation of engagements among criminals what evil can be apprehended—that unanimity shall be wanting among them—that their enterprises shall be unsuccessful—that their associations shall be dissolved it is proverbially said there is honour among theives the honour which cements their conspiracies is the pest of society why should we not seek to inspire them with the highest degree of distrust toward each other—why should we not arm them against each other and make them fear lest they should find an informer in every accomplice wherefore should we not seek to fill them with a desire to inform against and mutually to destroy each other so that each one uneasy and trembling in the midst of his fellows should fear his companions as much as his judges nor be able to hope for security but in the renunciation of his crimes this is exactly what the consideration of the public welfare would lead us to wish and if we are to be turned aside from the care of this object by regard to the fidelity of thieves and murderers to their engagements for a still stronger reason from humanity ought we to abstain from punishing their crimes beccaria upon just ground condemns the sovereigns and judges who after having enticed an offender to become an informer afterwards violate their promise and render it illusory in this case we need not fear to give vent to the feelings of horror and indignation which so mischievous a proceeding inspires it is mischievous in the highest possible degree it destroys all future confidence in similar offers and renders powerless this most necessary instrument it cements instead of weakening the union of criminals among themselves and causes government itself to appear as the guardian of their society by adding mockery to the rigour of the law by punishing the individual who has confided in its promises but says beccaria society authorizes treason detested even by criminals among themselves we have already seen what is to be understood by this treason it is natural to criminals to detest it—it is their ruin it ought to be approved by honest men—it is their safeguard it will introduce crimes of cowardice and baseness no it will introduce acts of prudence of penitence and of public utility it will operate as an antidote to all crimes these pretended crimes of cowardice are more injurious to a nation than the crimes of courage the truth is exactly the reverse which produce most alarm in society privately stealing and swindling on the one side or highway robbery and murder on the other the tribunal which employs this expedient discovers its uncertainty it discovers that it can know nothing without having learnt it by what means can a judge attain to certainty without witnesses in what country is it customary for criminals to make the judges the confidants of their misdeeds and their plans the law exhibits its feebleness in imploring the assistance even of him who has broken it the law seeks the offender who flies from it if the means employed for his discovery are effectual it only exhibits its wisdom but if rewards are to be bestowed upon criminals who denounce their accomplices beccaria desires that it may be in virtue of     a general law which should promise impunity to every accomplice who discovers a crime rather than by a particular declaration in each particular case the reason he assigns is that such a law would prevent the combination of malefactors by inspiring each of them with the fear of exposing himself alone to danger and that it would not serve to give that boldness to the wicked who see that there are some cases in which their services are required but we have already observed that the particular declaration equally serves to prevent this combination and that it is the general law which tends to give boldness to the wicked and even creates the belief that justice cannot be executed without them a law of this nature adds beccaria ought to join to impunity the banishment of the informer a condition of this nature could only serve to render the law inefficacious in a variety of cases and also contains a contradiction in terms a law joining banishment to impunity is not banishment a punishment chapter xv competition as to rewards when a portion of the matter of reward is allotted for the purchase of services ought the liberty of competition to be admitted—in any and what cases—what is the general rule and what are the exceptions—in the case of what species of service—for what species of reward if popular opinion be allowed to determine the question concerning the general rule is already answered in all cases in which no particular reason can be given to the contrary the liberty of competition ought to be admitted upon the largest scale yet to this decision of the public the practice of nations that is of those who bear the sway in nations is by no means uniformly conformable there are privileges and there are exclusions—pursuits open to one set closed to another set of men all governments have been more or less infected with that intermeddling disposition which believes it can give perfection to particular species of service by appropriating its exercise exclusively to particular individuals that there may be cases fit to be excepted out of the above general rule is allowed but before we come to the consideration of the exceptions let us see how the matter stands upon principle—whether the people are most right or their rulers and in the first place by way of illustration let us stop a moment to examine the connexion there is upon this occasion between reward and punishment let us suppose apprehensions are entertained of the prevalence of murder and incendiarism against a particular person the suspicions are stronger than against any one else there is as yet no law against either of those offences the sovereign intending to do his utmost to guard the state against those calamities sends for the suspected person and prohibits him from committing any such crimes under such penalties as he thinks proper for the suspected person observe and for him only there being as yet no general law prohibiting such enormities and everybody else being left at perfect liberty if it were possible that any such incident could have happened within time of history should not we pronounce at once that either the nation could not yet have emerged from a state of the profoundest barbarism or else that the sovereign so acting could not have been in his right mind such however is the exact counterpart of the policy of him who wanting a service to be performed of such a nature as that for aught he can be certain there are several competent to perform it—some better than others and each man according to the motives that are given him better than himself—commits the business to one in exclusion of the rest if penal laws must be applicable to all that there may be a chance of preventing all offences the offer of reward ought to be general that there may be a chance of obtaining all services and of obtaining the best if we inquire in detail for the reasons why competition for reward and for everything else which can be bestowed in the way of producing service should be as open and as free as possible the question may be considered in two points of view—first as it     concerns the interests of those for whose sake the service wanted is to be performed secondly as it concerns the interests of those by whom the service might come to be performed with regard to the former set of interests it has already been observed as a reason for the employment of reward as a fitter instrument than punishment for attaining a given degree of excellence the idea of which has already been conceived by the person who wishes it to be attained—that the chance is greater when reward is employed as the incitement than when use is made of punishment because punishment can only operate upon a few selected individuals and should they be unequal to the task would be altogether employed in vain whatever number you select you forego all the chance which you might have of the service being performed by any one else the case is equally the same when rewards are offered to a selected few allowing the liberty of competition you may propose rewards to any number without expense—you pay it but to one you do not pay it till the service is performed and the chance of its being performed is in proportion to the number of persons to whom it is proposed another advantage which reward has over punishment as we have seen is that by means of the former the value of the service may be brought to an indefinitely high degree of perfection but this can only be effected by means of a free competition in this way and this only can individuals be led to exert their faculties were the reward proposed to one only having rendered the degree of service sufficient to entitle him to the reward he would stop there to make the exertions necessary to carry it to any higher degree of perfection would be to trouble himself to no purpose but let a reward be offered to that one of two competitors for example who best performs the service unless either of them know exactly the degree of skill possessed by the other and know it to be clearly inferior to his own each will exert himself to his utmost since the more perfect he makes his work the better chance has he of gaining the reward the matter is so ordered that for every part of the greatest degree of service he can possibly find means to render there will be a motive to induce him to render it the same reasoning may be applied to any other number of competitors and the chance of perfection will be increased if the faculties of the competitors are equal in proportion to their number should he who has the disposal of the reward assert—i am acquainted with an individual more competent than any other to perform the service in question and with whom no one can be placed in competition—his assertion is exposed to this dilemma upon a fair trial of skill either this person will stand first or he will not if he stand first the competition is not to his prejudice but redounds to his honour if another excel him the advantage of a free competition is proved partiality is either mischievous or unnecessary we next consider the question as it affects the interest of those who might be admitted as competitors reward in its own nature is a good all competitors think so and that a balance of good remains even after deducting the evil of that labour whatever it be which is expended in the performance of the service or they would not be competitors he who has the disposal of the reward thinks so or he would neither offer it nor be so anxious as he sometimes is to secure it for those to whom he wishes to give a preference but when there is no special reason to the contrary why should not all the members of a state have a chance of obtaining the goods to be distributed in that state to exclude any man from any chance he might have of bettering himself is at best a hardship if no special reason can be given for it it is injustice and one of those species of injustice which if administered on pretence of delinquency would openly bear the name of punishment it may be objected that if a free competition were allowed the number of competitors would be very great while the reward being confined to one or to a very small number one only will be paid for his labour the lot of the rest would be lost labour and disappointment that the public would be losers by their labours being diverted from services of greater utility and that the service would without this competition be performed in a sufficient degree of perfection or if performed in any higher degree would be of no further use the following considerations may serve as a reply to these objections where there is nothing more than the mere loss of labour to those who can afford to lose it or of any thing else to those who can afford to part with it the possible amount of mischief be it what it may can afford no sufficient reason for narrowing competition if there be the pain of disappointment after trial there has been the pleasure of expectation before trial and the latter there is reason to believe is upon an average much greater than the former the pleasure is of longer continuance it fills a larger space in the mind and the larger the longer it continues the pain of disappointment comes on in a moment and gives place to the first dawning of a new hope or is driven out by other cares if it be true that the principal part of happiness consists in hope and that but few of our     hopes are completely realized it would be necessary that men might be saved from disappointment to shut them out from joy it may further be observed that the liberty of competition seldom includes so many as if considered with regard to the particular nature of the service it would seem to include where it is not restrained by institution it is often restrained by nature and that sometimes within very narrow bounds services depending on opportunity are confined to those to whom fortune shall have given the opportunity—services depending on science or on art are confined to those whom education and practice have familiarized with the science or the art—services depending on station are confined to one or to the few if there be more than one who at the time in question are invested with that station thus the objection derived from the too great number of competitors is almost always without foundation it also often happens that independently of the reward given to the successful candidate the service even of the unsuccessful pays itself this is more particularly apt to be the case with regard to services of indefinite excellence which depend on skill some develope their talents—others obtain notoriety one discourse obtains the reward—twenty candidates have improved their minds in endeavouring to obtain it the athletic exercises which on such a vast variety of occasions were celebrated throughout ancient greece were to have been open to all comers it was but one at each game that could obtain the prize but even the unsuccessful combatants found a sort of subordinate advantage in the reputation of having contended and in the advances made by them in those energies which at that time of day gave distinguished lustre to every one who excelled in them it may even happen that the service of the successful shall be no object and that the services looked to on the part of him who institutes the reward shall be those which are performed by the unsuccessful the grecian games just mentioned may be taken as an example the strength of the successful combatant was no sensible advantage to the country the object aimed at was the encouragement of personal prowess and skill in this country the prizes given at horseraces have a similar sort of object from the few horses who win the public may reap no particular advantage but the horses which are beaten or never contend for the prize are improved by the emulation to which it has given birth by the english government very ample rewards are offered to him who shall discover the most perfect and practicable mode of ascertaining a ships longitude at sea one effect of this reward is to divert from their employments a multitude of artists and students in various branches of physical science of whom a few only can have any recompense for their expense and labour to pay all that would try might probably be impracticable but the benefit of the service appears to counterbalance this inconvenience and in point of fact the persons who can suppose themselves qualified to contend in such a race are so few that this inconvenience can scarcely be very considerable were the same reward to be given for running boxing or wrestling the common businesses of life would be deserted and all the world would become runners boxers and wrestlers amongst the athenians rewards not vastly inferior considering the difference in the value of money and the common rate of living were actually given to such athletic exercises but the athenians were as much in the right so to do as we should be in the wrong to imitate them in those days when success in war depended almost entirely upon bodily address and vigour encouraging the performance of these exercises was disciplining an army and the national wealth could suffer little since the labours of agriculture were chiefly carried on by slaves the advantages resulting from the most unlimited freedom of competition therefore are—  chance of success increased according to the number of competitors   chance of the highest success increased by invigorating the increased effort of each competitor   equality established   number of works multiplied   latent talents developed application of the above principle the cases to which this principle may be applied are much more extensive than might at first view be imagined it covers a great part of the field of legislation it may be applied to ecclesiastical to fiscal to administrative and to constitutional laws this rule is in direct opposition to the fundamental principle of hindoo legislation in that country every man belongs to a caste from which he cannot separate himself to each caste belongs the exercise of certain professions there is a caste of learned men a caste of warriors and a caste of labourers emulation is thus reduced within the narrowest bounds and the energies of the people are stifled this principle is opposed to those ecclesiastical regulations by which all who refuse to sign certain articles of belief or refuse to pronounce a certain number of words concerning theological subjects are excluded from certain professions the greater the number of individuals thus excluded the greater the loss sustained by the diminution of competition in the performance of those services this principle is in direct contradiction to     a multitude of fiscal and administrative laws establishing exclusive privileges in favour of certain branches of commerce and trade fixing the price of commodities and the places at which they are to be bought and sold prohibiting the entry or the exit of various productions of agriculture or of manufactures these are so many expedients limiting competition and are injurious to the national wealth the father of political economy has from this principle in a manner created a new science the application he has made of it to the laws relating to trade has nearly exhausted the subject by two opposite competitions prices are fixed competition among the purchasers secures to the producers a sufficient compensation for the outlay of their capital and labour competition among the sellers serving as a counterpoise to the other produces a cheap market and reduces the prices of commodities to the lowest sum for which it is worth while to produce them the difference between a low price and a high price is a reward offered to the purchaser by one seller for the service he will render to him by granting what remains to be gained to him instead of to his competitor who requires more in all trades and in all arts competition secures to the public not only the lowest price but the best work whatever degree of superiority is possessed by one commodity over another of the same description meets with its reward either in the quantity sold or in the price at which it is sold as to stores of every description of which the public stands in need why is not the competition left open to all who may choose to undertake the supply it is not difficult to find the determining reason it is more convenient to serve a friend a dependent or a partizan than a person unknown or perhaps an enemy but this is not an avowable reason for the public some other must be sought open competition would it is said produce a multitude of rash contractors the terms in appearance most advantageous to government would commonly be offered by some rash adventurer who in the end would be found unable to fulfil his engagements when the time came for the performance of his part of the contract the stores in question would not be provided and the service would suffer irreparable injury it is important that the men with whom we deal should be well known in some cases these reasons may not be without foundation but they are most frequently illusory† the very nature of the reward may sometimes render it necessary to depart from the system of competition it is not every office that can be offered to every one disposed to undertake it ought the education of a prince to be offered to him who writes the best treatise upon that education no such an office requires qualities and virtues and particularly a knowledge of the world which might not be possessed by the philosopher who had resolved the problem ought the office of master of the mint to be offered to any one who produces the best die no this important duty requires a probity an exactness a habit of regularity which has no connexion with manual skill this is a reason and the only reason for not offering such offices to all the world but it is no reason for not attaching to this service another reward to which all the world might aspire some services which are not directly susceptible of open competition are so indirectly that is by making the competition consist in the performance of some preliminary service the execution of which may serve as a test of a mans ability to perform the principal service this is what is done in the case of extensive architectural works when artists are invited to give in their plans and their models this is all that the nature of the service allows of‡     when some years ago it was designed to erect in the neighbourhood of london at the public expense a penitentiary house the mode of unlimited competition was adopted in order to obtain plans for it the superintendents received sixtyfive plans from among which they had an opportunity of making a selection instead of the one which they would have received had the system of favouritism been pursued if without reward a plan superior to the best of those thus obtained has since been devised it may be attributed to the share which chance has in every new invention the offer of a reward may accelerate the developement of new ideas without enabling an individual to complete the arrangement of his plans at a given moment when the british parliament offered a reward of £ 0000 for the discovery of a mode of finding the longitude they were not guilty of the absurdity of confining the competition to the professors of natural philosophy and astronomy at oxford and cambridge to resolve the problem of the best system of legislation is more important and more difficult why in mixed governments has it been hitherto confined to the members of the legislative body and in monarchies to the chancellor the determining reason is abundantly clear those who are in possession of the power—those to whom it belongs to propose this problem are ashamed to make a public avowal of their own incapacity to solve it they carefully avoid all acknowledgments of their own incapacity or indolence they are willing that their labours should be rendered as little burdensome as possible by following the ordinary routine and not that they should be increased by the exhibition of the necessity of reform in a word they desire not to be advised but to be obeyed while subject to the influence of such circumstances it can be considered no matter of surprise that they should as far as possible have made the science of legislation an exclusive monopoly the interests of human nature cry aloud against this contemptible jealousy the problem of the best system of laws ought to be proposed to the whole world it belongs to the whole world to solve it frederic the great twice attempted to make a general reform in the laws of his kingdom both times he applied to a single chancellor the first of them too contented with himself to suspect he could stand in need of assistance from others produced a work the most insignificant of any which has appeared the second m von carmer after having completed his labours acted very differently and much better before it received the authority of a law he presented it to the public with an invitation to learned men to communicate to him their observations upon it seconding his invitations by the offer of rewards it is with regret that i am constrained to ask why did not he who had in this respect thus far surpassed all his predecessors act still more nobly why only ask for criticism upon a given work—why not ask for the work itself why limit the invitation to germans alone as though there were no genius out of germany—why limit the reward to a sum below the price of those snuffboxes which are presented to a foreign minister for the service he performs in departing when he is recalled the richest diamond in his masters crown would not have been too great a reward for him who should thus have given to all the others a new and beforeunknown splendour on different occasions publicspirited individuals and societies have endeavoured to supply from their slender resources the neglect of governments and have offered larger rewards than the chancellor of the great frederic that which they could not offer and which it did not depend upon them to offer was the reward which the minds best adapted for the accomplishment of such an undertaking would esteem above every other i mean the assurance that their labours would be judged by those who could give them authority—who could make them useful in conclusion i do not say that with regard to certain services sufficient reasons may not be found for altogether excluding competition but that in every such case these reasons ought to be ready to be rendered otherwise it ought to be lawful to conclude that they do not exist†   0 chapter xvi rewards for virtue beccaria accuses modern legislators of indifference to this subject punishments says he and in many instances unduly severe punishments are provided for crimes for virtue there are no rewards these complaints repeated by a multitude of writers are matter of commonplace declamation so long as they are confined to general terms the subject presents no difficulty—but when an attempt is made to remove the ground of complaint and to frame a code of remuneratory laws for virtue how great is the difference between what has been asserted to be desirable and what is possible virtue is sometimes considered as an act sometimes as a disposition when it is exhibited by a positive act it confers a service when it is considered as a disposition it is a chance of services apart from this notion of service it is impossible to tell wherein virtue consists to form clear ideas concerning it it must altogether be referred to the principle of utility utility is its object as well as its motive after having thus far spoken of services to be rewarded—that is of manifest and public acts which fall not within the line of ordinary actions—it remains to be shown in relation to virtue—  what cannot be accomplished by general rewards   what it is possible to accomplish either by particular institution or occasional reward   we may observe in the first place that those civil virtues which are most important to the welfare of society and to the preservation of the human race do not consist in striking exploits which carry their own proof with them but in a train of daily actions in an uniform and steady course of conduct resulting from the habitual disposition of the mind hence it is precisely because these virtues are connected with the whole course of our existence that they are incapable of being made the objects of the rewards of institution it is impossible to know what particular fact to select at what period to require the proof to what particular circumstance to attach the distinction of reward   add to these difficulties that of finding a suitable reward which shall be agreeable to those for whom it is designed the modesty and delicacy of virtue would be wounded by the formalities necessary to the public proof of its existence it is fostered by and perhaps depends upon esteem but this is a secret which it seeks to hide from itself and those prizes for virtue which seem to suppose that conscience is bankrupt would not be accepted by the rich nor even sought after by the most worthy among the poor   every virtue produces advantages which are peculiar to itself probity inspires confidence in all the relations of life industry leads on to independence and wealth benevolence is the source of kindly affections—and though these advantages are not always reaped they generally follow in the natural course of events their effect is much more steady and certain than that of factitious reward which is necessarily subject to many imperfections in the reign of louis xiv a treatise was published—on the falsity of human virtues what is singular and what the author probably never suspected is that by some slight alterations it would be easy to convert this work into a treatise on their reality the author appears to have considered them as false because they were founded upon reciprocal interest—because their object is happiness esteem security and the peaceable enjoyment of life—because men in their mutual intercourse settle with each other for their reciprocal services but without these felicitous effects what would virtue be in what consists its reality what would it have to recommend it how would it be distinguished from vice this basis of interest which to this author appears to have rendered it false is precisely that which gives it a true and solid and we may add an immutable existence for no other source of happiness can be imagined† but if the most important class of virtues are already provided with sufficient motives to lead to their performance either in the sufferings they prevent or in the advantages to which they give birth is it not superfluous to add factitious motives the interference     of legislators is useful only in supplying the deficiency of natural motives   what would be our condition were things in a different state—were it necessary to invite men to labour honesty benevolence and all the duties of their several conditions by means of factitious reward pecuniary rewards it is evident it would be impossible to bestow honour it is true remains but how would it be practicable to create in the shape of honour a sufficient fund of reward for the generality of human actions the value of these rewards consists in their rarity so soon as they are common their value is gone in this case as in so many other cases there is an analogy between rewards and punishments it is an imperfection common to both these sanctions that they are applicable to actions alone and exercise only a distant and indirect influence upon the habits and dispositions which give a colour to the whole course of life thus rewards cannot be instituted for parental kindness conjugal fidelity adherence to promises veracity gratitude and pity legal punishments cannot be assigned to ingratitude hardness of heart violations of friendly confidence malice or envy—in a word to all those vicious dispositions which produce so much evil before they have broken out into those crimes which are cognizable before legal tribunals the two systems are like imperfect scales useful only for weighing bulky commodities and as an individual whose life has been less guilty than that of a man of a hard and false heart is punished for a single theft there is also often a necessity of rewarding a certain distinguished service performed by a man who is otherwise little entitled to esteem thus in regard to the moral virtues which constitute the basis of daily conduct there is no reward which can be applied to them by general institution all that it is possible to do is limited to seizing upon those striking actions readily susceptible of proof which arise out of extraordinary circumstances as opportunities of conferring occasional rewards rewards of this nature cannot be bestowed periodically the occasions for performing eminent services do not regularly recur it is the action and not the date in the almanack which ought to occasion the reward the french academy annually bestowed a prize upon the individual who among the indigent classes had performed the most virtuous action the judges had always one prize to bestow and they had but one they must occasionally have experienced regret at leaving unrewarded actions of merit equal to that which gained the reward and sometimes at being obliged to reward an action of an ordinary description besides by the periodical return of the distribution this prize would soon be rendered an object of routine and cease to attract attention the institution of la rosière de salency may be produced in answer to the above observations but it should be remembered that a village institution is of a different nature the more limited a society the more closely may its regulations be made to resemble those of domestic government—in which as we have already seen reward may be applied to almost every purpose it is thus that annual prizes may be established for agility skill strength—for every other quality which it may be desirable to encourage and of which the rudiments always exist there is not a village in switzerland which does not distribute prizes of this nature for military exercises it is an expedient for converting the duties and services of the citizens into fêtes geneva whilst it was a republic had its naval king—its king of the arquebuss—its commander of the bow—its king of the cannon the conqueror during the year of his reign enjoyed certain privileges little costly to the state the public joy marked the return of these national exercises which placed all the citizens under the eyes of their grateful country la rosière de salency designed to honour virtues which ought to be perpetuated and renewed from generation to generation might have a periodical return like the roses of summer the humane society established in england for the purpose of affording assistance to persons in danger of drowning and providing the means of restoration in cases of suspended animation distributes prizes to those who have saved any individual from death in this case the reward is not as in the french academy confined to the indigent class alone men of the first rank would consider it an honour to receive a medal commemorative of so noble an action besides the mode of conferring these rewards has not been dramatised the retired habits of virtue have been consulted there is no public exhibition to which it is dragged to be confounded or humiliated greater eclât might however without adding to the theatrical effect be given to these rewards were an efficient report made of them to the king and both houses of parliament an institution of a similar nature for the reward of services rendered in cases of fire shipwreck and all other possible accidents would still further contribute to the cultivation of benevolence and these noble actions brought in the same manner under the eyes of the legislators and inscribed in their journals would acquire a publicity of much less importance to the honoured individual than to society in general indeed though the reward applies only to one particular action the principal object designed is the cultivation of those dispositions which such actions indicate and this can only be accomplished by the publicity     which is given to the example and the public esteem and honour in which it is held when upon the site of the prison which had been the scene of an exalted instance of filial piety the romans erected a temple they inculcated a noble lesson they proclaimed their respect for one of the fundamental virtues of their republic independently of these eminently meritorious and always rare actions governments might render publicity subservient to the perfection of a great variety of services in the performance of which the regular discharge of duty is more important than the display of extraordinary virtues this project might be realized by the formation of a comparative table of the subordinate administrations of cities parishes or counties this table would require to be renewed at fixed periods and might be made to show which districts were most exact in the payment of taxes—in which the fewest crimes had been committed—in which useful establishments had been formed—in which the most liberal exertions had been made for the relief of calamity—what hospitals had been conducted with the greatest economy and had been most successful in the cure of diseases† what tribunals had decided the greatest number of causes and from which the smallest number of appeals had been made in what instances efficacious precautions had been adopted for relieving any particular district from causes tending to render it unhealthy—from mendicity from smuggling from vice and from misery such official reports independently of their political utility to the government would without parade produce all the good effects of reward—of that reward in honour which costs nothing to the country and yet maintains all the moral energies in full activity every distinguished service might find a place in these annals and the people always prone to exaggerate the vigilance and means of information possessed by their governors would soon be persuaded that a perpetual inspection was kept up not only with respect to their faults but also their meritorious actions this project is borrowed neither from the republic of plato nor the utopia of more it is even inferior to what has in our time been carried into effect in an empire composed of more than a hundred departments‡ in which tables exhibiting in columns all the results of civil economical rural and commercial administration were formed with greater facility and promptitude than would have been experienced by any russian noble had he been desirous of obtaining from his superintendents an account of the state of his property if rewards were established for virtue when exhibited by the indigent classes it would be improper to seek for striking instances of its display or to suppose that they are actuated by sentiments of vanity which operate feebly upon men accustomed to dependence and almost constantly employed in making provision for their daily wants institutions of this nature suited to small communities ought to be adapted to local circumstances and popular habits in a village or a town for instance it might be proper to assign a distinguished place in the church for the old men this distinction united to a sentiment of religion and granted with discretion need bear no appearance of flattery but might be a mark of respect towards old age rendered honourable by the blameless life which had preceded it there exist in england many charitable institutions for decayed tradesmen in which their situation is much preferable to that of the inhabitants of poorhouses they have their separate dwellings their gardens and a small pension those only whose conduct has been generally honourable being admitted to these asylums the metal badge which is worn in some instances so far from being considered as a disgrace is regarded as a mark of honour different agricultural societies bestow rewards upon servants who have lived during a certain number of years in the same place this circumstance being with reason considered as a proof of fidelity and good conduct some of these societies also give rewards to daylabourers who have brought up a certain number of children without having received assistance from their parishes this is an encouragement to economy and to all the virtuous habits which it implies but as a means of remedying the inconveniences arising from the poor laws its effect is extremely feeble in both these cases the reward generally consists of money but the money is connected     with honour the notoriety given to the reward operates as a certificate in favour of the individual in his particular district by examining everything which has been done in this respect in holland switzerland england and elsewhere we should become possessed of an assortment of remuneratory expedients applicable to almost every class in society everything depends however upon the mode of application for this duty governments are entirely unfit it is local inspection alone which can gain a knowledge of circumstances and superintend the details after all just and discriminating public esteem—that is to say public esteem founded upon the principle of utility—is the most potent the most universally applicable of all the species of reward if virtue be held in public estimation virtue will flourish let it cease to be held in such estimation it will decline in the same proportion the character of a people is the moral climate which kills or vivifies the seeds of excellence an inquiry into the causes of the high respect in which under certain governments particular virtues were held—why the virtues of a curtius of a fabricius of a scipio were nourished and developed at rome—why other countries and other times have produced only courtiers parasites fine gentlemen and wits men without energy and without patriotism—would require a moral and historical analysis only to be completed by means of a profound study of the political constitutions and particular circumstances of each people the result would however prove that the qualities most successfully cultivated were those held in most general esteem but public esteem it may be said is free essentially free independent of the authority of governments this copious fund of rewards is therefore withdrawn from the hands of the supreme authority this however is not the case governments may easily obtain the disposal of this treasure public esteem cannot be compelled but it may be conducted it requires but little skill on the part of a virtuous sovereign to enable him to apply the high reward of public esteem to any service which his occasions may require there already exists a degree of respect for riches honour and power if the dispenser of these gifts bestow them only upon useful qualities—if he unite what is already esteemed to what ought to be estimable his success is certain reward would serve as a proclamation of his opinion and would mark out a particular line of conduct as meritorious in his eyes its first effect would be that of a lesson in morality unrewarded the same service would not acquire the same degree of notoriety it would be lost among the multitude of objects soliciting public attention and remain undistinguished from the pretensions well or ill founded respecting which public opinion is undecided furnished with this patent from the sovereign it becomes authentic and manifest those who were ignorant are instructed those who were doubtful become decided the inimical and the envious are rendered less bold reputation is acquired and becomes permanent the second effect of the reward consists in the increase of intensity and duration given to public esteem immediately all those who are governed by views of interest who aspire to honour or fortune—those who seek the public good but who seek it like ordinary men not as heroes or martyrs—eagerly press into that career in which the sovereign has united private and public interest in this manner a proper dispensation of favours directs the passions of individuals to the promotion of the public welfare and induces even those who were indifferent to virtue or vice to rank themselves upon that side which promises them the greatest advantage such being the power of sovereigns be must be extremely inexpert in the distribution of honours who separates them from that public esteem which has so decided a tendency to unite with them nothing however is more common instances may be found in most courts of splendid decorations of stars and garters in double and triple range which do not even give a favourable turn to public opinion they are considered as proofs of favour but not as signs of merit honours in the hands of princes resemble those talismans with which the fairies according to the fables were wont to present their favourites they lose their virtue whenever they are improperly employed chapter xvii accompaniments to remuneration after having exhibited in what manner the matter of wealth is applicable to the purposes of reward we proceed to show other uses derivable from it for the public service which are not remuneratory the idea of reward will be much clearer when it shall have been distinguished and separated from these accessory uses which have certain relations with it—   wages necessary for the support of life—servants must be fed whilst they are employed and there are cases in which it is necessary to feed them even before they begin to work if the wages paid do not exceed what is necessary for this purpose as is sometimes the case among the soldiery and especially     if the enrolments are involuntary such wages being absolutely necessary are not reward   the instruction of servants—certain kinds of service require advances from government for this object if this instruction require much time it is naturally begun at an early age and is then called education this employment of the matter of reward is sufficiently distinct from that which regards subsistence with which however it is very frequently combined and confounded if there be a sufficient number of individuals willing to bear this expense so much the better otherwise it is necessary that government should bear it for them this has almost everywhere been thought to be the case with respect to the church it has also generally been considered necessary in new countries or countries but little advanced in the career of prosperity with respect to the teachers and professors in most branches of science in the war department the corps of cadets is a nursery for young officers the foundations of public schools are nurseries for the church the greater number however of these foundations are owing rather to the good intentions of individuals than to the cares of governments   equipment—that an individual may be in a condition to render service he must be furnished with the necessary equipments the warrior wants his accoutrements—the astronomer his observatory—the chemist his laboratory—the mechanic his machines—the naturalist his collections of natural history—the botanist his garden—the experimental farmer a plot of ground and funds to enable him to improve it   indemnity—when an individual is only indemnified he is not rewarded reward properly speaking only begins when indemnity is complete do we wish for services we ought to recollect that by the person from whom we seek to obtain them the inconveniences of every sort which compose the burthen of the service will be put into one scale the advantages he finds attached to it into the other to the head of indemnity belongs everything necessary to produce an equilibrium between the two it is only the excess which is thrown into the scale of advantages which strictly belongs to the head of reward   the assuring responsibility—in so far as the matter of reward is employed for this purpose it is employed in laying a foundation for the infliction of punishment the stock of punishment is in itself inexhaustible but when the body is withdrawn from the hands of the ministers of justice corporal punishment cannot be inflicted and all other punishments can be compensated if a servant possess property of his own so much the better if he possess none and a salary be given to him he will always have so much to lose the loss of this salary will be a punishment he will always be liable to undergo whatever may become of him the principal use of this employment of the matter of reward is in the case of offices which place property in the hands of those who fill them if there be no other means of securing their probity it would not be bad economy to make their appointments amount in value to but little less than the highest interest they could reap from the largest sum they ever have in their hands this would be to make them assure against their own dishonesty the difference between the actual salary and the least salary they could be induced to accept would constitute the premium it is rarely that a distinct sum is appropriated to this purpose on the one hand this end is partly effected by suretyship and on the other the sum considered requisite for the purposes of indemnity and reward equals or surpasses what could be proposed to be allowed for it but this function is not the less distinct from all the rest   aguarantee against temptations—money like the most valuable articles of the medical pharmacopœia may serve either as a poison or an antidote according as it is applied this employment of the matter of reward resembles that last mentioned without being confounded with it money employed for assuring responsibility will produce its effect though the individual be already corrupted the use of money employed as a guarantee against temptation is to prevent corruption a less sum may suffice in this case than in the former in that it was necessary that the revenue granted should preserve some proportion to the sum confided in this such proportion is not required the measure to be observed is only that of the wants of the individual placed in the rank that the office he occupies confers in a word salary considered as a pledge is only useful in the prevention of theft money employed as an antiseptic is equally useful in the prevention of peculation in all its forms in the prevention of all improper conduct which can have for its motive the desire of money and for its means the situation in which the individual is placed by his office   the support of dignity—public opinion exacts—it matters not by what reason—from every individual possessed of a certain rank a certain expenditure his wants are thus increased in proportion to his dignity dignity deprived of the wealth necessary for its support furnishes in proportion to its extent an incentive to malversation and at the same time generally furnishes the opportunity as an antidote to such temptations money may therefore sometimes be bestowed for the support     of dignity the good of the service may also require the same thing it is incontestably true that between wealth and power there subsists an intimate and natural union wealth itself is power it may be proper therefore that the support of the respect which it commands be not refused in favour of certain employments in which much depends upon the place they hold in public opinion   another use of the matter of reward consists in the excitement of alacrity i mean the production of an habitual disposition to do what is required with pleasure the greater the degree of mental enjoyment the quicker and more lively are ones ideas and the larger the quantity of work which can be performed in a given time the mind in a happy mood acts with incomparably more ease than when agitated by grief or even in its ordinary condition when it is moved only by habit it is the same with the bodily powers who knows not how much the power of the muscles depends upon the energy of the mind what comparison is there between the labour of slaves and of free men it is upon this that the superiority of hired soldiers over unpaid and arbitrary levies depends in the one case as in the other the motive which leads to exertion consists in the expectation of being treated according to their behaviour the motive is nothing else but the fear of pain but in the first case there is the gratification of reward to sustain the alacrity in the other the labour has no other accompaniment but grief the simple expectation of a reward how large soever it may be will not always produce the same effect as a reward previously bestowed the condition of expectancy in which the individual finds himself in such a case is a mixed and uncertain state in which despair and hope may alternately predominate the danger to be guarded against is lest rewards previously bestowed should produce diversions little favourable to labour either by suggesting the idea of some more favourite occupation or by supplying the means of its pursuit the progress of the thoughts may be accelerated but the thoughts excited may be of a different nature the dull ideas of labour may be supplanted by the enlivening considerations of shows and of pleasure whether or not it is proper to bestow such rewards depends upon the character of the individual that character must be known before it is possible to determine what will be their effect but in every case there can be no greater folly than to waste in previous gratifications everything which is destined for reward in conclusion these distinctions ought not to be abused the expense of rewards need not be increased on account of each of these items it is not necessary to appropriate a distinct sum to each the same sum may serve for many and even for all that which suffices for assuring responsibility will in general suffice as a guarantee against temptations and vice versâ so far as ends so uncertain may be effected by such means—and will in every case suffice for indemnification that which suffices for equipment may serve in part for the support of dignity and the excitement of alacrity that which suffices for the maintenance of dignity will be sufficient for almost all the other ends and the whole of whatever is employed for any other of these purposes except equipment cannot but serve for subsistence book ii— rewards applied to offices chapter i salary—how a reward there are many species of service and even services of a positive nature of which governments stand in constant and uninterrupted need such for the most part are the duties of those who are employed in the different departments of every government the political state or condition on account of which individuals possessing it are considered liable to render these services is called a place an office or an employment to these places it is both natural and customary to attach under the title of emolument certain portions of the matter of wealth if such emolument be determinate in amount and paid at regularly recurring periods it is called a salary it is the nature of a reward to operate as a motive and in that capacity to give birth to acts which by the person by whom the reward is held up to view are esteemed services the greater the reward the greater is the motive it constitutes the greater the motive the more strenuous the exertion it has a tendency to produce and if the value of the service be susceptible of an indefinite degree of perfection the more strenuous the     exertion to perform it the greater as far as depends upon the will of the party will be the value of the service hence it follows that if salary be reward as far as funds can be found salaries cannot be too large how different the state of things presented to us when we consult experience we see small salaries and the service admirably well performed large salaries and nothing done for them in certain lines we see the service regularly worse and worse performed in proportion to the largeness of the salary where then lies the error in experience there can be none in the argument there is none the error lies in its not being properly understood and that in general it has not been properly understood the bad management and weak measures so frequent in this line are but too pregnant proofs to understand the argument aright two points must be observed the one is to consider for illustrations sake that just in the same manner as punishment—and in no other manner though with less certainty of effect—is reward capable of acting as a motive the other point is to consider what is really the service for which a salary is a reward what then is the service with respect to which a salary operates as a motive the answer which would be generally given to this question is the continued service belonging to the office to which the salary is annexed obvious as this answer may seem it is not the true one the service and the only service with respect to which a salary can operate as a motive is either the simple instantaneous service of taking upon one the office or the permanent service of continuing to stand invested with it if the duties of the office—the services in the expectation of which the salary annexed to the office is bestowed happen to be performed it cannot be owing merely and immediately to the salary it must be owing to some other motive if there were no other motive the service would not be rendered nothing is done without a motive what then is this other motive it must be either of the nature of reward or punishment it may by possibility be of the nature of reward but if it be so one or other of these rewards would seem superfluous in common it is principally of the nature of punishment in as far as this is the case the service for which the salary considered as a reward is given is the service of taking upon one the obligation constituted by the punishment—the obligation of performing the services expected from him who possesses the office that the zeal displayed in discharging the duties of an office should not be in proportion to the salary will now no longer appear strange experience is reconciled to theory this subject will receive elucidation if we substitute punishment for reward and consider what tendency such a motive would have to give birth to any service if connected with it in the same manner as a salary is annexed to an office suppose a schoolmaster intending to conduct the business of his school with regularity were to make it a rule on a certain day at the beginning of every quarter to call all his scholars before him and to give each ten lashes committing their behaviour during the rest of the quarter altogether to their discretion—the policy of this master would be the exact counterpart of the founder of the school towards the master if he has sought to attach him to the duties of his office by bestowing upon him a salary suppose the master finding that under this discipline the progress of his scholars did not equal his expectations should resolve to increase his exertions and accordingly should double the dose of stripes—his policy in this case would be the exact counterpart of the founder who by the single operation of increasing the masters salary should think to increase his diligence a salary is not a reward for any individual service of the number of those which are rendered in consequence of a mans acceptance of the office to which the salary is annexed for the rendering of any one of these services the salary presents him not with any motive which can come under the head of reward the motives which it gives him belong entirely to the head of punishment it is by fear only and not by hope that he is impelled to the discharge of his duty—by the fear of receiving less than he would otherwise receive not by the hope of receiving more though he work ever so much more or better than a man who holds his office is expected to work he will receive nothing more than his salary if the salary be all that he has to hope for by working to a certain degree less or worse he may indeed stand a chance of having the salary or a part of it taken from him or he may be made punishable in some other way but if he continue to keep clear of that extreme degree in such case let him work ever so little or ever so badly he will not as far as artificial punishment is concerned be ever the worse he has therefore no motive so far as the salary is concerned for endeavouring to pass the line of mediocrity and he has a motive the motive of indolence or love of ease for stopping as far short of it as he can with safety suppose for instance a salary of £ 000 ayear annexed to the office of a judge of all the services he may come to perform in the discharge of his function of which one is this salary the reward of no one whatever take any one of the causes which would regularly come before him for hearing though he were to attend and to display ever so much     diligence and ever so much ability in the hearing of it he would receive no more that year than his £ 000 though he were to absent himself altogether and leave the business to his colleagues he would receive no less in short provided he does not so far swerve from his duty as to subject himself to fine or deprivation whether he perform his duty ever so well or ever so ill—whether he decide many causes or few—whether his attendance be constant or remiss—whether he display ever so much or ever so little ability—his salary is the same not that a man in this exalted station is in any want of motives to prompt him to exert himself in the discharge of its duties he has the pleasures of power to balance the pains of study—the fear of shame to keep him from sinking below mediocrity—the hope of celebrity to elevate him above it to spur him on to the highest pitch of excellence these motives are presented to him by his station but they are not presented to him by his salary the services and the only services which the salary presents a motive for his performing are in the first place the instantaneous act of taking upon him the station—that is of subjecting himself to the obligations annexed to it and in the event of his violating any of those obligations to the punishments annexed to such violations in the next place the discharging of the smallest portion of those obligations which it is necessary he should discharge in order to his receiving such or such part of the salary let it for instance be paid him quarterly if the first quarter be paid him in advance it will afford him no motive of the nature of reward for doing any of the business of that quarter he has that quarters salary nor can he fail of enjoying it unless in the way of punishment it be afterwards taken from him if it be not paid him till the end of the quarter the case will be still the same unless proof of his having rendered certain services—the having attended for example at certain times—be necessary to his receiving it with this exception it may equally be said that in both cases for any other than the instantaneous act of taking upon him the burthen of the station for that quarter he has no reward nor any motive but what operates in the way of punishment this distinction is of importance for if the salary given were the inducement of performing the services the chance of having them performed and well performed would be exactly as the magnitude of the salary if for example fifty pounds sterling ayear sufficed to insure fifty grains of piety assiduity eloquence and other sacerdotal virtues in a curate—five thousand of these same pounds ought to insure five thousand grains of these same virtues in a bishop or archbishop but what everybody knows is that this proportion does not hold on the contrary it most frequently happens that the proportion is inverse the curate labours much the bishop little and the archbishop less the chance of service is as the magnitude of the punishment and if the salary can be withdrawn it is so far indeed as the magnitude of the salary but it may be equally great without any salary—by the substitution of any other punishment instead of loss of salary we see then how it is that a salary he it great or small independently of the obligation which it pays a man for contracting has not in itself the smallest direct tendency to produce services whilst experience shows that in many cases in proportion to its magnitude it has a tendency to prevent them chapter ii rules as to emoluments before we enter upon this subject in detail it may be necessary to remark that the proper application of the following rules will depend upon the nature of the service required and its various local circumstances it is only by observing the peculiar character assumed by abuse in each office that appropriate remedies for each particular evil can be provided since it is impossible to make a complete catalogue of all errors and to anticipate every species of abuse the rules laid down may not constitute a perfect system they may however serve as a warning against errors and abuses which have by experience been found to exist and also against some which may be imagined likely to exist it is useful to erect beacons upon rocks whose existence has been made known by the shipwrecks they have caused among the rules about to be given some may appear so selfevident as almost to seem superfluous but if it can be shown that errors have arisen from the neglect of them in practice such rules though not entitled to be considered as discoveries must at least be regarded as necessary warning they may teach nothing new but they may serve to recall principles which it is desirable should be constantly and clearly remembered rule i emoluments ought in such manner to be attached to offices as to produce the most intimate connexion between the duty and the interest of the person employed this rule may be applied in insuring assiduous attendance on the part of the persons employed in different offices different services are required but the greater number of offices have this one circumstance in common that their duties may be performed it is necessary that the individual holding the office should be at a certain time in a certain     place hence of all duties assiduous attendance is the first the most simple and the most universal in many cases to insure the performance of this duty is to insure the performance of every other duty when the clerk is at his desk the judge upon the bench the professor in his school—if there be nothing particularly irksome in their duty and they can do nothing else rather than remain idle it is probable they will perform their duty in these cases the service required being of the continual kind and in point of quality not susceptible of an indefinite degree of perfection—the pay being required not for certain services but for such services as may come to be performed within a certain space of time—it may without impropriety be given in the form of a salary but even here the policy of making reward keep pace with service should be pursued as closely as possible and for this purpose the long continued mass of service should be broken down into as many separate services as possible—the service of a year into the service of days in the highest offices an individual if paid by his time should like the daylabourer and for the same reason be paid rather by the day than by the year in this way he is kept to his duty with more than the effect and at the same time without any of the odium of punishment in the station of a judge it is not common to exact attendance by the force of punishment—at least not by the force of punishment to be applied in each instance of failure but if it were the infliction of that punishment for trivial transgressions—that is for one or a few instances of nonperformance—would be thought harsh and rigorous nor would anybody care for the odium of standing forth to enforce it excuses would be lightly made and readily accepted punishment in such cases being to the last degree uncertain would be in a great measure ineffectual it might prevent continual but it would never prevent occasional or even frequent delinquency but what cannot be effected by punishment alone may be effected by punishment and reward together when the officer is paid separately for each days attendance each particle of service has its reward there is for each particle of service an inducement to perform it there will be no wanton excuses when inconvenience adheres inseparably to delinquency without the parade of punishment the members of the french academy and the academy of science notwithstanding all their dignity are paid their salaries by the day and not by the year and who are the individuals how low or how high soever who cannot and who ought not to be paid in this manner if pride have a legitimate scruple it is that which refuses to receive the reward for labour which it has not performed whilst as to the objection which might arise from the minute apportionment of the salary it is easily removed by counters given from day to day and converted into money at fixed periods in the act of parliament for establishing penitentiary houses among other good regulations this method of insuring assiduity of attendance has been adopted the three superintendents receive as the whole of their emoluments each a share of the sum of five guineas which is directed to be distributed each day of their attendance equally among those who are present a more ancient example of this policy may be found in the incorporated society in london for the assurance of lives the directors of this establishment receive their trifling emoluments in this manner and thus applied these emoluments suffice this plan has also been adopted in the case of commissioners of bankrupts and by different associations these examples ought not to be lost and yet from not having been referred to general principles they have not possessed the influence they ought to have how often have regulations been heaped upon regulations without success how many useless decrees were made in france to insure the residence of the bishops and beneficed clergy in england we have not in this respect been more successful that is to say more skilful laws have been enacted against the nonresidence of the clergy—laws badly contrived and consequently useless punishment has been denounced and a fine imposed which being invariable in amount has sometimes been greater and sometimes less than the advantage to be derived from the offence for want of a public prosecutor in this as in so many other cases it has been necessary to rely upon such casual informers as may be allured by a portion of the fine the love of gain has seldom proved a motive sufficiently strong to induce an endeavour to obtain this reward whose value not to mention the expenses of pursuit is destroyed by infamy till this motive be reinforced by personal animosity which bursts the bonds of infamy these laws are powerless such cases which may occur once or twice in the course of ten years throughout the whole kingdom are neither sufficiently frequent nor well known to operate as examples the offence remains undiminished the useless punishment constitutes only an additional evil whilst such laws and such methods powerless among friends serve only to bring enemies into contact whenever it is desirable that a clergyman should live in the midst of his parishioners—that is to say when they are amicable—the law is a dead     letter its power is exerted only when they are irreconcilable enemies that is in the only cases wherein its utility is problematical and it were to be wished that its execution would admit of an exception his return into his parish is a triumph for his enemies and a humiliation for himself had the salaries paid to the professors in the universities been interwoven with their services it might have been the custom for some of these pretended labourers to have laboured for their hire and to be a professor might have meant something more than having a title a salary and nothing to teach a salary paid day by day has an advantage beyond that of insuring assiduity of attendance—it even renders a service agreeable which with an annual salary will be regarded as purely burthensome when reward instead of being bestowed in a lump follows each successive portion of labour the idea of labour becomes associated with pleasure instead of pain in england husbandmen like other labourers are paid in hard money by the week and their labour is cheerfully and well performed in some parts of the continent husbandmen are still paid as they were formerly in england by houses and pieces of land given once for all and the labour is said to be performed with all the slovenliness and reluctance of slavery rule ii emoluments ought in such manner to be attached to office as to produce the greatest possible degree of excellence in the service rendered thus far the subject has only been considered as applicable to insuring attendance in cases where assiduity of attendance appears to suffice for insuring the performance of all other duties there follow some cases in which it appears possible to apply the same principle either in the prevention of abuse or in insuring an extraordinary degree of perfection in the employment of the powers which belong to certain stations instead of appointing a fixed salary invariably of the same amount as the emolument of the superintendent or superintendents of a prison a poorhouse an asylum for orphans or any kind of hospital whose inhabitants depend upon the care of one or a small number of individuals whatever may be the difference in the degree of attention displayed or the degree of perfection with which the service is performed—it would be well to make the emolument of such persons in some measure depend upon the care with which their duties have been performed as evidenced by their success in a penitentiary or other prison that the prisoners might be insured from all negligence or illtreatment tending directly or indirectly to shorten their lives make a calculation of the average number of deaths among the prisoners in the particular prison compared with the number of persons confined there allow the superintendent each year a certain sum for each person of this number upon condition that for every prisoner who dies an equal sum is to be withheld from the amount of his emoluments it is clear that having a net profit upon the lives of all whom he preserves there is scarcely any necessity for any other precaution against illtreatment or negligence tending to shorten life in the naval service the laws of england allow a certain sum for each vessel taken or destroyed and so much for every individual captured why is not this method of encouragement extended to the military service is the commander of an army employed in defending a province—allow him a pension which shall be diminished in proportion to the territory he loses is the governor of an important place besieged—allow him so much for every day that he continues the defence is the conquest of a province desirable—promise to the general employed besides the honours he shall receive a sum of money which shall increase in proportion to the territory he acquires besides giving him a pension as above for preserving it when acquired to the principal duty of taking and destroying those who are opposed to him might be added the subordinate duty of preserving the living machines whose exertions are necessary for its accomplishment the method proposed for the preservation of prisoners—why should it not be employed for the preservation of soldiers it must be acknowledged that no reward exclusively attached to this subordinate duty could in the mind of a prudent commander add anything to the weight of those arguments which arise out of the principal object a soldier when he is ill is worth less than nothing a recruit may not arrive at the moment—may not arrive at all and when he has arrived he is not like a veteran if therefore it be proper to strengthen motives thus palpable by a separate and particular reward it ought at least to be kept in a subordination sufficiently marked with respect to the principal object thus much as to a time of war in time of peace the propriety of this method is much less doubtful it is then that the attention of a general should be more particularly directed   0 to the preservation of his soldiers make him the insurer of their lives and he will become the rival of esculapius in medical science and of howard in philanthropy he will no longer be indifferent whether they encamp upon a hill or in a morass his vigilance will be exercised upon the quality of his supplies and the arrangement of his hospitals and his discipline will be rendered perfect against those vices of armies which are sometimes no less destructive than the sword of the enemy the same system might be extended to ships of war in which negligence is so fatal and in which general rules are so easily enforced the admiral or captain would thus have an immediate interest in the preservation of each sailor the admirable example of captain cook who circumnavigated the world and traversed so many different climates and unknown seas without the loss of a single sailor would no longer be unfruitful his instructions respecting diet change of air and cleanliness would not be neglected the british navy it is true is much improved in these respects but who can tell how much greater perfection might be attained if to the already existing motives were added the influence of a constantly acting interest which without injuring any virtue might supply the place of all if they were wanting in the application of these suggestions there may be difficulties are they insurmountable it is for those who have had experience to reply in the treaty made by the landgrave of hesse cassel relative to the troops which the british government hired of him to serve in america one stipulation was that for every man not returned to his country he should receive thirty pounds i know not whether such a stipulation were customary or not but whether it were or not nothing could be more happily imagined either for the fiscal interest of the sovereign lender or the interest of the individuals lent the spirit of party found in this stipulation a theme for declamation as if its only effect were to give to the prince an interest in the slaughter of his subjects whilst if anything could counterbalance the mischievous effects of the treaty it was this pecuniary condition it gave to these strangers a security against the negligence or indifference of the borrowers on account of which they might more willingly have been exposed to danger than native subjects the price attached to their loss would act as an insurance that care should be taken to preserve them it has been said that in some countries the emoluments of the commanders of regiments increase in proportion to the number of noneffectives that is to say that they receive always the same amount for the pay of their corps though they have not always the same number of men to pay such an arrangement is precisely the opposite of what is recommended above the number of noneffectives increasing by death or desertion the commander gains in money what he loses in men every penny which he is thus permitted to acquire is a reward offered if not for murder at least for negligence note—the principles thus laid down by mr bentham are susceptible of great diversity of application when mr whitbread brought into parliament his bill for the establishment of schools for the education of the poor i flattered myself that i had discovered one instance to which they might very readily be applied and in a letter addressed to sir samuel romilly from which the following paragraphs are extracted i explained my ideas upon the subject it will be perceived that the whole plan depends upon the principles laid down in this chapter— mr whitbread has been fully aware of the necessity of superintendence in respect to the masters—and he has proposed to commit it to the clergymen and justices of the peace but it is not difficult to foresee that this burthensome superintendence will be ineflicacious no good will be effected unless the interest of the master be constantly combined with all parts of his duty the only method of accomplishing this consists in making his reward depend upon his success in giving him no fixed salary in allowing him a certain sum for each child payable only when each child has learned to read—in a word in paying him as workmen are sometimes paid by the work done when he receives a fixed salary the master has only a slight interest in the progress of his pupils if he act sufficiently well to prevent his being discharged this is all that can reasonably be expected if he receive no reward till the service be performed he has a constant interest in performing it quickly he can relax his exertions only at his own expense there is no longer any necessity for superintendence the master will himself seek to improve the modes of instruction and to excite the children to emulation he will be disposed to listen to the advice and to profit by the experience of others when he receives a fixed salary every new scholar increases the trouble of the master diminishes his exertions and disposes     him to complain upon the plan which i propose it is the master who will stir up the negligent parents it is he who will become the servant of the law instead of complaining that he has too many pupils he will only complain if he have too few should he have three or four hundred or even as many as mr lancaster like him he would find the means of attending to them all he would employ the most forward in instructing those who were less advanced c c should a negligent or incapable master be appointed he would be forced to quit his place substitute for this plan examinations depositions and decisions and see what would be the consequence there would be no difficulty in the execution of this proposed plan it would be sufficient that twice or thrice in the year the clergyman and certain justices of the peace or other persons of consequence who were willing to promote so useful a work should meet together for two or three hours at the schoolhouse the examination of each scholar would not occupy more than half a minute the master himself might be trusted for selecting only such as were capable of undergoing the test and an honorary would thus be added to his pecuniary reward by the publicity given to his success —dumont chapter iii fees and perquisites—none another expedient is often employed in the payment of public officers i refer to the fees which they are sometimes authorized to receive on their own account from those who require their services this arrangement is attended with a specious advantage and a real danger the advantage is that the reward seems to be exactly and directly in proportion to the labour performed the danger lies in the temptation given to such officers to increase their emoluments by increasing the difficulties of those who need their services the abuse is easily introduced it is very natural for example that an individual who has been served with an extraordinary expedition should add something to the accustomed fee but this reward bestowed on account of superior expedition in the first instance infallibly becomes a cause of delay in all which follow the regulated hours of business are employed in doing nothing or in doing the least possible that extraordinary pay may be received for what is done out of officehours the industry of all the persons employed will be directed to increasing the profit of their places by lending one another mutual assistance and the heads of departments will connive at the disorder either for their share of the benefit or out of kindness to their inferiors or for fear of rendering them discontented the inconveniences will be yet greater if they relate to a service covered with a mysterious veil which the public cannot raise such is the veil of the law the useless and oppressive delays in legal procedure arise from very complicated causes but it cannot be doubted that one of the most considerable of these causes is the sinister interest which lawyers have in multiplying processes and questions that they may multiply the occasions for receiving fees integrity is more easily preserved in public offices in which there are no fees than in those where they are allowed a lawful right often serves as a pretext for extortion the distinction between what is permitted and what is prohibited in many cases is exceedingly minute and how many temptations may occur of profiting by the ignorance of strangers when circumstances will insure impunity an easy method of detecting offences is a great restraint whenever therefore fees are allowed a list of them should be publicly fixed up in the office itself this will operate as a protection to the persons employed against suspicion and to the public against vexation this mode of rewarding services supposes that the individuals who stand in need of them should bear the expenses of the establishment this is true only in case the benefit is solely for those individuals in all other cases fees constitute an unequal and very unjustly assessed tax we shall have occasion to recur to this subject shortly chapter iv minimize emolument rule iii the amount of the salary or other emoluments attached to every office ought to be the least that the individuals qualified to execute its duties are willing to accept for their performance the fair and proper price of any vendible commodity is the least that anybody will take for it so that the expectation of like payment shall be a sufficient inducement to the labour requisite to produce other like articles in future the fair and proper price of any service is the least that anybody will do it for so that if more were given it would be done either not at all the better or not so much the better as that the difference of quality should be equivalent to the difference of expense in this proper and necessary price is included of course everything necessary to enable the individual to perform and to continue to perform the service and also whatever is necessary on account of the disadvantages attending the service and on account     of the chance which may be given up of the advantages that might be expected from other services at the first establishment of an office it may be difficult accurately to determine what ought to be the amount of its emoluments in this as is the case with every commodity when carried to market for the first time we can only be guided by chance the number and character of the candidates will however soon determine whether the amount offered be too large or too small according to this rule the salaries paid to the judges in england which appear so considerable are scarcely enough since as we have already seen they are not sufficient to induce those who are best qualified to discharge the duty to undertake the office in france before the revolution scarcely any salaries were paid to the judges they were not drafted from the class of advocates and no sacrifice was required of them when they entered upon their duties it was not necessary that they should be possessed of much experience and their reward consisted principally in the honour and respect attached to their station in england the number of judges is so small that there is no place for cyphers it is necessary that each judge should possess from the first day be enters upon his office that skill which in the present state of immensity and obscurity in which the law is found can only be the fruit of long study in france among the enormous multitude of her judges there was always a sufficient number endowed with the requisite skill and the novice might so long as he chose preserve a pythagorean silence a method of ascertaining the proper amount of emoluments for any office simple as it is efficacious is afforded by allowing the persons employed to discharge their duty by deputy if no one employ a deputy the emoluments cannot be much too great if many individuals employ deputies it will be only necessary to observe what is paid to the deputies the salary of the deputy is the proper salary for the place if this rule be applied to the emoluments of the clergy and it be asked what is the proper price for their services the answer is not difficult it is primâ facie the price given by one class of the clergy and received by the other it is the current price of curacies i say always primâ facie for in reality the current price is somewhat greater part of the price being made up in hope for insuring the due performance of all the duties of their office this price is found to be sufficient the possession of any greater emolument is not only useless but pernicious inasmuch as it enables them to engage in occupations incompatible with the due performance of their function and as it tends to give them a distaste for the duties of that function the inequality observable in the emoluments of the established clergy is also disadvantageous in respect to the greater number of ecclesiastics the comparison which they make between their condition and that of the rich incumbents diminishes still further in their eyes the value of what they receive a reward so unequal for equal services degrades those who receive only their proper portion the whole presents the appearance of a lottery—of favour and injustice ill according with the moral character of their vocation it is a good rule of economy to employ only real labourers who do not think themselves superior to the work they have to perform dutch florists ought not to be employed in the cultivation of potatoes it is well also fully to occupy the time of the individuals employed the duties of many public offices require only three or four hours attendance daily after the officehours are passed such individuals seldom are able profitably to employ their time the leisure they possess increases their wants ennui the scourge of life is no less the enemy of economy it is among this class that those who are most discontented with their salaries are generally found chapter v no more nominal than real rule iv the nominal and real amount of salaries ought to correspond in other words no deduction ought to be made from the real value of a salary without reducing its nominal amount the practice which has frequently been adopted in england of reducing the real value of salaries and pensions by taxes and other deductions while the nominal amount of the salaries has remained unaltered has given rise to this rule in some instances the deductions thus made have amounted to onethird of the nominal salary no advantage arises from this arrangement but its inconveniences are numerous in the first place it is an evil in so far as it spreads an exaggerated idea of the sacrifices made by the public and the expense incurred under the head of salaries with respect to the public functionaries it is an evil to possess an income greater in appearance than reality the erroneous conceptions hence entertained of their wealth imposes upon them in deference to public opinion the necessity of keeping up a correspondent establishment under the penalty of being considered niggardly they are compelled to be extravagant it is true the public are aware in general that salaries and     pensions are subject to deductions but they are oftentimes only acquainted with a part of the deductions and they seldom in such cases enter into minute calculations in this manner the difference between the nominal and real value of a salary tends to produce an increase in the wants of the individual employed call the amount of his salary what it really is and he will be at ease but every nominal addition will prove a costly ornament if the opportunity of illicit profit be presented to him such nominal addition will be an incentive to corruption and should he not be dishonest it will prove a cause of distress the remedy is simple as efficacious the change need only be in words chapter vi couple burthen with benefit rule v the expenses of an office ought to be defrayed by those who enjoy the benefit of the services rendered by the office the author of the wealth of nations in investigating† the manner in which the expense of services ought to be divided has shown that in some cases it ought to be defrayed by the public—in others exclusively by those who immediately reap the benefit of the service he has also shown that there is a class of mixed cases in which the expense ought to be defrayed partly by the public and partly by the individuals who derive the immediate benefit to this class belongs public education the rule just laid down seems scarcely to stand in need of proof it may however be useful to mention the modes in which it may be violated as—i when for a service rendered to one person or set of persons the obligation of payment is imposed upon another this is partly the case of dissenters who support their own clergy in so far as they are obliged to pay for the support of the clergy of that established sect from which they dissent   when for a service rendered to a certain number of individuals the obligation of payment is imposed upon the public for example the expenses of a theatre wholly or in part paid out of the public purse   when for a service rendered to the public the obligation of payment is imposed upon an individual with respect to this third case the examples are but too abundant i the most remarkable example will be found in the administration of justice at first sight it may be thought that he who obtains a verdict in his favour reaps the principal or even the only advantage to be obtained and therefore that it is reasonable he should bear the expense incurred—that he should pay the officers of justice for the time they have been employed it is in this manner that the subject appeared even to adam smith b v sec   upon a closer examination we shall discover an important error the individual in whose favour a verdict is given is precisely the individual who has received least benefit setting aside the rewards paid to the officers of justice how many other expenses which the nature of things render inevitable remain it is he who at the price of his time his care and his money has purchased that protection which others receive for nothing suppose that among a million persons there have been for example a thousand lawsuits in a year without these lawsuits—without the judgments which terminate them injustice would have had nothing to hold it in check but the defensive energy of individuals a million acts of injustice would have been perpetrated in the same time but since by means of these thousand judgments a million acts of injustice have been prevented it is the same thing as if each complainant had himself prevented a thousand because he has rendered so important a service—because he has exposed himself to so many mishaps to so much trouble and expense does he deserve to be taxed it is as though the militia who defend the frontiers should be selected to bear the expenses of the campaign who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges saith st paul it is the poor litigant who makes war upon injustice who pursues it before the tribunals at his own risk and who is made to pay for the service which is rendered by him when such expenses are thrown upon a defendant unjustly dragged into the litigious contention the case is yet worse instead of anything having been done for his advantage he has been tormented and he is made to pay for having been tormented if the expenses are altogether thrown upon the party who is found to have done wrong although it often happens owing to the uncertainty either of the facts or of the law that there has been no wilful wrong on either side this cannot be done at first this party can only be known at the termination of the suit but then such a judgment would be a punishment and there is a chance that such a punishment may not be deserved another chance that the individual may not be in a condition to support it another chance that it will be either too great or too little‡     ii as another violation of this rule may be cited the practice of taking fees as carried on in most customhouses and which constituted a great abuse in those of england previously to the reform introduced by mr pitt many of the officers not receiving salaries sufficient for their maintenance were allowed to make up the deficiency by fees received for their own advantage this custom had an appearance of reason we pass your merchandise through the customhouse they might have said and you ought to pay for this service but this reason is deceptive without this customhouse the merchants might have replied our merchandise would have gone straight forward it is not for our advantage that this costly depôt is established—it is for the general wants of the state the state therefore which you serve ought to pay you and not us whom you torment with your services which we should be very happy to do without but it may be said this expense must be borne by somebody why should it not be borne by these merchants as well as anybody else because it is a partial and unequal tax taxes upon merchandise are generally in proportion to the value of the goods this abusive tax seldom is so a rich merchant does not feel it he is reimbursed by the sale of his goods a poor individual is oppressed by this second contribution which he finds it necessary to pay to the clerk after be has paid what is due to the exchequer and it with reason appears to him the more odious because it is oftentimes arbitrary iii in conclusion as a last example of the violation of this rule we mention the emoluments of the clergy in so far as they consist of tithes if the services of the clergy contribute to the maintenance of public morality and obedience to the laws even those to whom these services are not personally directed are benefited by them—they are useful to the whole state their expense whatever ought to be its amount ought to be borne by the whole community distributed as this expense is at present under the system of tithes in such manner that every one knows how much and to whom he pays it no advantage is derived from this knowledge whilst the inconveniences are but too manifest in that hatred which so frequently subsists between the parishioners and their minister the shepherd and his flock by means of which his labours so long as this enmity subsists are rendered worse than useless were this expense to be defrayed from the general source of the public treasure these scandalous dissensions would be avoided and whether the revenues were more or less ample it would be possible to preserve a more just proportion between them and the different degrees of labour instead of floating as at present between £ 0 and £ 0000 per annum under the direction of chance chapter vii by emoluments exclude corruption rule v in employments which expose the public functionary to peculiar temptations the emoluments ought to be sufficient to preserve him from corruption setting aside all considerations of the happiness of the individual the interest of the public requires that in all employments which afford the means of illicit gain the individuals employed should be placed above want if this important consideration be neglected we ought not to be surprised that men urged on by perpetually recurring wants should abuse the powers they possess under such circumstances if they are found guilty of extortion and peculation they are less deserving of blame than that government which has spread the snare into which it was scarcely possible that their probity should not fall placed between the necessity of providing the means of subsistence and the impossibility of providing them honestly they will naturally be led to regard peculation and extortion as a lawful supplement tacitly authorized by the government the examples of this mischievous economy and of the inconveniences resulting from it are more frequent in russia than under any other european government m de launay farmergeneral under frederick ii represented to the king that the salaries of the customhouse officers were too small for their subsistence and that it would be but justice to augment them he added that he could insure to his majesty that every one would then discharge his duty better and that the aggregate receipts in all the offices would be larger at the end of the year—you do not know my subjects said frederick they are all rogues where my interests are in question i have thoroughly studied them and i am sure they would rob me at the altar by paying them better you would diminish my revenues and they would not rob me less—sire replied m de launay how can they do otherwise than steal their salaries are not enough to buy them shoes and stockings a pair of     boots costs them a months pay at the same time many of them are married and where can they obtain food for their wives and families if it is not by conniving at the smugglers there is sire a most important maxim which in matters of government is too frequently neglected it is that men in general desire to be honest but it is always necessary to leave them the ability of being so if your majesty will consent to make the trial i propose i will engage that your revenues will be augmented more than a fourth the maxim in morals thus brought forward by m de launay appeared to the king—beautiful and just as it really is in itself—so much the more excellent from being in the mouth of a financier since men of this class are not in general reputed to know many such he authorized the experiment he increased the salaries of the officers by a half and his revenues were increased a third without any new taxes a salary proportionate to the wants of the functionary operates as a kind of moral antiseptic or preservative it fortifies a mans probity against the influence of sinister and seductive motives the fear of losing it will in general be more than equivalent to the ordinary temptations held out by illicit gains but in the estimation of a mans wants it is not merely to what is absolutely necessary that our calculation ought to be confined—fabricius and cincinnatus are not the proper standards to be selected the actual state of society ought to be considered the average measure of probity must be our rule public opinion assigns to every public functionary a certain relative rank and whether reasonably or not expects from him an expenditure nearly equal to that of persons in a similar rank if he be compelled to act in defiance of public opinion he degrades and exposes himself to contempt—a punishment so much the more afflictive in proportion as his rank is elevated wants keep pace with dignity destitute of the lawful means of supporting his rank his dignity presents a motive for malversation and his power furnishes the means history abounds with crimes the result of this illjudged policy if a justification be required for the extraordinarily high salaries which it is customary to pay to the supreme magistrates who are called kings it will be found in the principles above laid down the americans by denominating their chief magistrate a president have thereby made a small salary compared with what is paid in england to the sovereign answer every purpose of a large one why because the dignity of the president is compared with that of the other officers of the republic whilst in europe the dignity of the sovereign is measured by a sort of comparison with that of other kings if he were unable to maintain a certain pomp amidst the opulence of his courtiers he would feel himself degraded charles ii to relieve himself from the restrictions imposed upon him by the economy of parliament sold himself to a foreign potentate who offered to supply his profusion the hope of escaping from the embarrassments into which he had plunged himself drove him like an insolvent individual to criminal resources this mistaken economy occasioned the expense of two successive wars terminating in a peace more disastrous perhaps than either of the wars our strength was wasted in oppressing a necessary ally instead of being employed in checking the ambition of a rival with whom we had afterwards to contend with diminished resources thus the establishment of the civil list though its amount may appear large may be considered as a measure of general security it is true that the sum necessary to prevent charles ii from selling himself or in other words the amount which in this instance would have operated as a moral antiseptic or preservative could not have been very accurately calculated a greater or less portion of this antiseptic must be employed in proportion as there exists a greater or less proclivity towards corruption experience is the touchstone of all calculations in this respect provided these abuses are guarded against a low scale of salaries can never be an evil it must be a good if the salary be not a sufficient reward for the service to be performed the office will not be accepted if it be sufficient everything which is added to its amount is so much lavished in pure waste chapter viii give pensions of retreat rule vii pensions of retreat ought to be provided especially when the emoluments allowed are not more than sufficient to meet the absolute wants of the functionary† pensions of retreat are recommended by considerations of humanity justice and good economy they moreover tend to insure the proper discharge of duty and constitute a source of responsibility on the part of the individuals employed       there are many cases in which it is not desirable that a public functionary should continue to be employed after his activity and capacity have become impaired but since the infirmities of age tend to increase his wants this is not the time in which he will be able to retrench his expenditure and he will be induced by this consideration in his old age and impotency to continue to endeavour to perform with pain and even with disgrace the duties of a station which in his maturity he had filled with pleasure and reputation to wait till he voluntarily resigns is to expect a species of suicide to dismiss him without a pension of retreat is in the supposed state of his faculties a species of homicide a pension of retreat removes all these difficulties it is a debt of humanity paid by the public to its servants   by means of these pensions the scale of all salaries may be lower than otherwise without producing any ill effect upon the quality of the services rendered they will constitute an item in the calculation which every individual makes in the meantime government will obtain from all at a low price services the ulterior compensation for which on account of the casualties of human life will only be received by a few it is a lottery in which there are no blanks   in all employments from which the individuals are removable at pleasure the pension of retreat in consequence of the approach of the period at which it will become necessary or due will add an increasing value to the salary and augment the responsibility of the individual employed should he be tempted to malversation it will be necessary that the profit derivable from his malversation should compensate with certainty not only for the loss of his annual salary but also for the value of his future pension of retreat his fidelity is thus secured to the last moment of his continuing in office   we ought not to forget the happiness insured to the persons employed resulting from the security given to them by the provision thus made against that period of life which is most menaced with weakness and neglect hence an habitual disposition to perform the duties of their office with alacrity will arise they will consider themselves as permanently provided for and fixed in a situation in which all their faculties may be applied to the discharge of its duties without being turned aside by vague apprehensions of future distress and the desire of improving their condition which so often leads individuals successively to try different stations another advantage to the government instead of being badly served by novices it will possess a body of experienced functionaries expert and worthy of its confidence the amount of these pensions ought to be regulated by fixed rules otherwise they will become a source of abuse offices will be bestowed for the sake of the pension instead of the pension being bestowed for the sake of the office they ought also to increase according to the length of service leaving at all times an inducement to continued exertion without which precaution the services of experienced individuals which it might be desirable to retain would frequently be lost chapter ix of the sale of offices if it be desirable that the public servants should be contented with small salaries it is more desirable that they should be willing to serve gratuitously and most desirable that they should be willing to pay for the liberty of serving instead of being paid for their services such is the simple but conclusive train of argument in favour of the venality of offices abstractly considered such an arrangement is attended with another advantage a sum laid out in the purchase of an office renders the purchaser responsible in a higher degree than he would be were he to receive a salary equal to or even exceeding in amount the interest of the money he has paid the loss of a salary paid by the public is merely the cessation of so much gain the loss of an office which has been purchased is the positive loss of so much capital which the individual has actually possessed the impression produced upon the mind by these two species of loss is widely different the cessation of a gain is generally much less severely felt than a loss to a corresponding amount the gain which depends upon external circumstances is always precarious—it cannot be reckoned upon with certainty on the other hand if an individual have purchased an office with his own capital he looks upon it as absolutely his own it comes to be regarded as a certain fixed and permanent source of revenue and as identified with his original property upon which he has always reckoned when a man purchases an office it may he fairly presumed that he possesses appropriate aptitude for the discharge of its duties are there pecuniary emoluments attached to an office—the office may be accepted for the sake of these emoluments are there no pecuniary emoluments—the office can be desired only on account of its duties or of the natural rewards of honour and power which are inseparable from it such at least is the ordinary state of things it is however possible that such an office might be desired as a means of obtaining some hidden profit prejudicial to the public but this would be a     particular case whose existence ought to be established by proof it is not by names alone that we can determine whether it be most advantageous for the public that offices should without emoluments be given away or when with emoluments should be sold this question can only be determined by an accurate account exhibiting the balance of the sums paid and received if however there be any offices without emoluments for which purchasers can be found—were it possible to sell purely honorary appointments offices connected with public pomp and show it would be entirely consistent with good economy it would be to convert a tax upon honour unfelt by any one but established in favour of the purchasers into hard cash a tax would thus be levied upon vanity the gain would be real though the bargain like that of the lapland sorcerers were only for bags of wind as it respects offices of which the emoluments are fixed the question of economy is simple the amount of the emoluments does not differ from a perpetual rent but when an office is sold the profits of which whether received from the public or levied upon individuals are uncertain in amount this uncertainty causes a presumption against the economy of the bargain it is disadvantageous to the public to be subject to uncertain expenses and it is not probable that these uncertain profits will sell for so large a price as would willingly be paid for a salary equal to their average amount again as to emoluments derived solely from individuals these are a species of tax often created and alienated at the same time in favour of the office the general presumption cannot but be unfavourable to taxes imposed under such circumstances in former times when the science of political economy was in its cradle—when taxes and the methods of collecting them were little understood—governments have frequently thus alienated large branches of the public revenue tempted by an immediate supply they either did not or would not regard the extent of the sacrifices they made the history of french finance is replete with instances of this kind the customs of orleans which were originally purchased by a duke of orleans for  0000 francs afterwards yielded to his posterity a yearly revenue of more than  000000 francs the venality of offices in that kingdom had created an exceedingly complex and consequently exceedingly vicious system the sale of offices conferring hereditary nobility was especially mischievous since this nobility enjoyed a multitude of exemptions the nobles paid no taxes hence every creation of nobility was a tax equal in value to the exemption granted thrown upon those who continued liable to pay them should the price for which an office is sold form a part of the emoluments of the head of the office and not be received by the public this would make no difference in the question of economy as respects giving and selling that the produce of the sale is afterwards wasted is an accident unconnected with the sale the emoluments received by the head of the department may be too large or not if not too large the public gains by the operation since in suppressing the sale it would be necessary to increase his emoluments by other means if too large the excess might be made applicable to the public service the sale of offices considered with respect to particular departments public opinion is at present adverse to the sale of public offices it more particularly condemns their sale in the three great departments of war law and religion this prejudice has probably arisen from the improper use to which it has sometimes been applied but whether this be the case or not the use of the word venal seldom if ever but in an odious and dysolgystic sense has tended to preserve it he who has bought the right of judging will sell judgments is the sort of reasoning in use upon this subject instead of an argument it is only an epigram the members of the french parliaments were judges and they purchased their places it did not by any means follow that they were disposed to sell their judgments or that they could have done so with impunity the greater number of these parliaments were never even suspected of having sold them countries may however be cited in which the judges sell both justice and injustice though they have not bought their places the uprightness of a judge does not depend upon these but upon other circumstances if the laws be intelligible and known—if the proceedings of the judges are public—if the punishment for injustice surpass the profit to be reaped from it judges will be upright even though they purchase their offices in england there are certain judicial offices which the judges sell—sometimes openly sometimes clandestinely the purchasers of these offices extract from the suitors as much as they can if they had not purchased their places they would not have endeavoured to extract less the mischief is not that this right of plundering is sold but that the right exists     in the english army the system of venality has been adopted military commissions from the rank of ensign to that of lieutenantcolonel are sold with permission to the purchasers to resell them the epigram upon the judges is not applied here the complaint is that the patrimony of merit is invaded by wealth but it ought to be recollected that in this career the opportunities for the display of merit do not occur every day it is only upon extraordinary occasions that extraordinary talents can be displayed and when these occur there can be no difficulty even under this system of bestowing proportionate and appropriate rewards besides though the patrimony of merit should by this means be invaded by wealth it would at the same time be defended from favouritism—a divinity in less esteem even than wealth the circumstance which ought to recommend the system of venality to suspicious politicians is that it diminishes the influence of the crown the whole circle over which it extends is so much reclaimed from the influence of the crown it may be called a corruption but it serves as an antidote to a corruption more to be dreaded it is the sale of ecclesiastical offices which has occasioned the greatest outcry it has been made a particular sin to which has been given the name of simony in the acts of the apostles we are informed that at samaria there was a magician named simon to whose gainful practices an immediate stop was put by the preaching and miracles of philip one of the deacons of the church of jerusalem who had been driven to samaria by persecution simon therefore regarding philip as a more fortunate rival enrolled himself among the number of his proselytes and when the apostles peter and john came down from jerusalem and by the laying on of their hands communicated to the disciples the gift of the holy ghost simon desirous of possessing something more than the rest offered to them money saying give me also this power that on whomsoever i lay hands he may receive the holy ghost upon which peter severely reprimanded him and the magician supple as he was intriguing asked forgiveness—and thus his history closes it is nowhere said that he was punished upon the strength of this story the roman catholic church has converted the act of buying or selling ecclesiastical benefices into a sin and the english law copying from the catholic church has constituted such an act a crime as the roman catholic church among catholics is infallible as to them it must have decided rightly when it declared such acts to be sinful our subject however leads us only to the consideration of the legal crime and between this crime and the offence of simon magus there is nothing in common presentation to a living and the reception of the holy ghost are not the same things if it be the object of this law to exclude improper persons more direct simple and efficacious means might be employed their qualifications might be ascertained by public examinations their good conduct by the previous publication of their names with liberty to all the world to object against them their moral and intellectual capacity being thus proved why should they not be allowed to purchase the employment or to discharge it gratuitously an idiot once admitted to priests orders may hold an ecclesiastical benefice but were a man gifted like an apostle to give five guineas to be permitted to discharge the duties of that benefice he would be borne down by the outcry against the simony he had committed what then is the effect of these antisimoniacal laws a priest may not purchase a benefice for himself but his friend whether priest or layman may purchase it for him he may not purchase the presentation to a vacant benefice but he may purchase the right of presentation to a benefice filled by a dying man or by a person in good health who will have the complaisance to resign and receive it again with an obligation again to resign whenever his patron requires it in reading these selfstyled antisimoniacal laws it is difficult to discover whether they are intended to prohibit or to allow the practice of simony their only real effects are to encourage deception and fraud blackstone complains of their inexecution he did not perceive that a law which is not executed is ridiculous chapter x of qualifications we have already seen that a salary may be employed as a means of insuring the responsibility of an individual and as a moral antiseptic to preserve him from the influence of corruption by the sale of offices it has been seen that the actual expense of a salary may be diminished and even reduced to nothing it is therefore evident that the important circumstance is that the individual should possess the requisite portion of the precious matter of reward and not that it should have been given to him if he possess it of his own so much the better and the more he already possesses the less is it necessary to give him in england such are the attractions of power and dignity that the number of candidates for their possession has been found so large that it has been thought desirable to limit the selection to the number of those who possess the required quantity of this moral antiseptic and this circumstance     has given birth to what have been called qualifications the most remarkable and important offices to which these pecuniary qualifications have been attached are those of justices of the peace and members of parliament a justice of the peace ought to possess at least £ 00 per annum of landed property there is no reasonable objection against this law the office is one of those for which an ordinarily liberal education is sufficient it is at the same time such an office that the individual invested with it might do much mischief were he not restrained by powerful motives as a qualification for the more important office of member of parliament the law requires of the member for a borough or city a similar qualification of £ 00 per annum and of the member for a county of £ 00 per annum this case differs widely from the other sufficient talent for carrying the laws into execution is possessed by a multitude of individuals but few are able to determine what laws ought to be framed the science of legislation is still in its cradle—it has scarcely been begun to be formed in the cabinets of philosophers among legislators in name scarcely any other practice can be found than that of children who in their prattle copy what they have learned of their nurses that a science may be learned a motive is necessary that the science of legislation may be learned or rather may be created motives so much the more powerful are necessary as this science is most repulsive and thorny for the pursuit of this study an ardent and persevering mind is required which can scarcely be expected to be formed in the lap of ease of luxury and of wealth among those whose wants have been forestalled from their cradle—among those who become legislators to gratify their vanity or relieve their ennui—there can scarcely be found one who could be called a legislator without mockery how shall he who possesses everything without the trouble of thinking be led to subject himself to the labour of thought if it be desirable that legislators should be men of enlarged and wellinstructed minds they must be sought among those who possess but little wealth—among those who oppressed with their insignificance are stimulated by ambition and even by hunger to distinguish themselves they must be sought among those who possess the habits of cyrus and not of sardanapalus among the children of luxury of whom the great mass of senators chosen by a rich people will always be composed there are but few who will undergo the fatigue of studying the lessons which at the expense of so much labour have been furnished them by beccaria and adam smith can it be expected then that from among their number the rivals of these great masters should be found qualifications in this case tend to exclude the individuals endowed with the greatest moral and intellectual capacity the reasons however in favour of qualifications are plausible it is alleged that the possession of a certain property tends to guarantee the independence of its possessor and that in no other situation is independence more desirable than in that of a deputy appointed to watch over and defend the interests of the people against the encroachments of the executive power supplied as that power almost necessarily is with so many means of seduction to this it may be replied that it is not the poor alone who are liable to be seduced multitudes possessing property exceeding in value the qualifications required are biassed by the seductive influence of places and pensions whilst the poor remain unmoved a law of this nature whose effect were it strictly executed would be to exclude the most capable is made to be evaded and in fact has constantly been evaded among those who have acted the most conspicuous parts in the british house of commons many have been able to enter there only by an evasion of this law means might be provided which would afford a perfect guarantee against such evasions but happily upon this as upon many other occasions the veil that hides from human weakness the distant inconveniences of bad laws hides also the means necessary for rendering such laws efficacious some years ago a member the honesty of whose intentions could not be doubted proposed to augment the qualifications for cities and boroughs from £ 00 to £ 00 per annum the proposition after having made considerable progress fell to the ground i know not whether this happened from a conviction of its trifling utility or from one of those accidents which in that slippery path equally befall the most useful and most mischievous projects when the greatest possible freedom is given to popular suffrage and even when no corrupt influence is used the popular employment of wealth being of all species of merit that of which people in general are best qualified to judge and most disposed to esteem there naturally exists an aristocracy of wealth is it desirable that this aristocracy should be rendered necessary and complete chapter xi of trust and contract management the capacity of the individuals to discharge the duties required of them having been ascertained and the most intimate connexion between their interest and the discharge of these duties having been established the only desirable circumstance remaining is to reduce   0 the amount of the emoluments to be paid for the discharge of these duties to the lowest term suppose the amount expended in the purchase of a given service to be a certain sum and that an individual equally capable of rendering this service should offer to render it at less expense is there any good reason for refusing such an offer i can discover none the acceptance of such a proposition is the acceptance of a contract the service thus agreed to be performed is said to be contracted for or let to farm to this method the mode of obtaining services by employing commissioners and managers is opposed general reasonings upon this subject are insufficient to determine which of these two opposite systems will be most advantageous in any particular department the nature of the service must be ascertained before the question can be decided if we confine ourselves to general principles contracts must be preferred to commissions under the system of contracts the interests about which the individual is employed are his own whilst under the system of commissions the interests about which he is employed remain the interests of the state that is the interests of another in the first case the subfunctionaries employed are the servants of an individual in the other they are the servants of the public—fellowservants of those who are to watch over them but the servants of the most negligent master says adam smith are better superintended than the servants of the most vigilant sovereign if this cannot be admitted as an infallible rule it is at least more frequently true than otherwise public opinion is however but little favourable to the system of contracts the savings which result to the state are forgotten whilst the profits reaped by the farmers are recollected and exaggerated upon this subject the ignorant and the philosopher—those who judge without thought and those who pretend to have examined the subject—are nearly agreed the objections which they bring forward against contractors for they relate to individuals rather than to the system are sufficiently specious i the contractors are rich if they are so this is not the fault of the system but of the conditions of the bargain made with them ii the contractors are ostentatious and vain and if they burst with vanity what then such inappreciable or rather imaginary evils cannot be brought into political calculations their vanity will find a sufficient counterpoise and punishment in the vanity of those whom they incommode whilst their ostentation will distribute their wealth among those whom it employs iii the contractors excite envy this is the fault of those who are envious and not of the contractors it is another imaginary evil in opposition to which may be placed the pleasure of detraction besides if the contracts are open to all unless improvident bargains are made through favour corruption or ignorance rapid fortunes will not often be accumulated by contractors should they still become rich it will be because they have deserved it iv contractors never find the laws too severe to insure the collection of the taxes for which they have contracted they will procure severe and sanguinary laws to be enacted if the laws are severe and sanguinary the legislature is in fault and not the contractors whether the taxes are managed by contractors or commissioners it is equally proper that the most efficacious system of laws for their collection should be established and certainly severe and sanguinary laws are not the most efficacious contractors therefore are not likely to seek the enactment of the most severe laws there are many reasons for supposing the contrary will be the case the better the law is executed that is to say the more certainly punishment follows the transgression of the law the less severe need it be but under the inspection of the contractor who has so strong an interest in its execution the law has a better chance of being put in execution than when under the inspection of a commissioner who has so little if any interest in the matter upon this point it is impossible to imagine by what means two interests can be more intimately connected than those of the contractor and the state it is the interest of the contractor that all who illegally evade the payment of the taxes should be punished this also is the interest of the state but it can never be the interest of the contractor to punish the innocent this would tend to excite the whole people against him of every species of injustice this is one which is least likely to meet with tranquil and acquiescent spectators adam smith who has adopted all these objections little calculated as they seem to me to appear in such a work as his also contends that the best and most frugal way of levying a tax can never be by farm if this were true it would be a conclusive reason against ever letting taxes to farm and it would be useless to seek for others when a fact is proved it is useless to trouble onesself with prejudices and probabilities it is true that without the hope of gain no contractor would undertake to collect the produce of a tax and to make the advances required but whence ought the profit of the farmer to rise this is what adam smith has not examined he supposes that the state would make the same profit by     establishing an administration under its own inspection the truth of this supposition is altogether doubtful the personal interest of a minister is to have as many individuals that is to say as many dependants employed under him as possible—that their salaries should be as large as possible and he will lose nothing by their negligence the interest of the farmer or contractor is to have as few individuals employed under him as possible and to pay each one no more than he deserves and he will lose by every instance of their negligence in these circumstances though no greater amount should be received from the people than would have been collected by the state a contractor might reasonably hope to find a source of profit adam smith has attacked with as much force as reason the popular prejudices against the dealers in corn so odious and so much suspected under the name of forestallers he has shown that the interest of the public is most intimately connected with the natural and almost necessary interests of this suspected class of merchants he might with equal justice have extended his protection to farmers of the public revenue a class of men nearly as little beloved in every branch of politics and especially in so wide a field as his subject embraced it was nearly impossible that he should examine everything with his own eyes it was almost of necessity that he was sometimes guided by general opinion this seems to me to have happened upon this occasion he forgot in this instance to apply the principle already cited and of which he had elsewhere made such beautiful applications i had myself once written an essay against farmers of the revenue i have thrown it into the fire for which alone it was fit i know not how long i should have retained the opinions it advocated had i not been better instructed by adam smith note—in burgoynes picture of spain vol ii page   c it is stated that in that country trust was found more economical than contract management but he does not state in what manner contracts were granted whether favour or corruption did not preside at their disposal whether the trust management had not superior means of enforcing the payment of the taxes nor whether their increased produce was not in part at least owing to the increase of trade and wealth chapter xii of reforms the emoluments annexed to any office being shown to be in excess and the mischiefs resulting from such an excess being ascertained the next question which occurs is what remedy ought to be applied the most obvious answer is a short one strike them off at once but thus unqualified this answer is far from being the proper one reform is the practical conclusion expected as the reward for all the labour bestowed on the examination of these theoretic propositions upon this subject nothing farther remains but to point out one limitation without which every reform can only be a greater abuse than the whole of those which it pretends to correct this limitation is that no reform ought to be carried into effect without granting complete indemnity to those whose emoluments are diminished or whose offices are suppressed—in a word that the only legitimate benefit to be derived by the public from economical reform consists in the conversion of perpetual into life annuities will it be said that the immediate suppression of these offices would be a gain to the public this would be a mere sophism the sum in question would without doubt be gained by the public if it came from abroad if it were obtained by commerce c but it is not gained when it is taken from individuals who form a part of that same public would a family be richer because the father disinherited one of his children that he might the more richly endow the others in this instance as the disinheriting of one child would increase the inheritance of the others the mischief would not be without some countervailing advantage it would be productive of good to some part of the family but when it relates to the public the emoluments of a suppressed place being divided amongst the whole community—the gain being distributed among a multitude is divided into impalpable quantities whilst the loss being confined to one is felt in its entirety by him who supports it alone the result of the operation is in no respect to enrich the party who gains whilst it reduces the party who loses to poverty instead of one place suppressed suppose a thousand or ten thousand or a hundred thousand—the total disadvantage will remain the same the plunder taken from thousands will have to be distributed among millions your public places will be filled with unfortunate citizens whom you will have plunged into indigence whilst you will scarcely see one individual who is sensibly enriched in consequence of all these cruel operations the groans of sorrow and the cries of despair will resound on every side the shouts of joy if any such are heard will not be the expressions of happiness but of that malevolence which rejoices in the agony of its victims by what means do individuals deceive themselves and others into the sanction of     such mischievous acts it is by having recourse to certain vague maxims consisting of a mixture of truth and falsehood and which give to a question in itself simple an appearance of deep and mysterious policy the interest of individuals it is said must give way to the public interest but what does this mean is not one individual as much a part of the public as any other this public interest which is thus personified is only an abstract term it only represents the aggregate of individual interests they must all be taken into the account instead of considering a part as the whole and the rest as nothing if it were proper to sacrifice the fortune of one individual to augment that of the others it would be still more desirable to sacrifice a second and a third and so on to any greater number without the possibility of assigning limits to the operation since whatever number may have been sacrificed there still remains the same reason for adding one more in a word the interest of the first is sacred or the interest of no one can be so the interests of individuals are the only real interests take care of individuals—never molest them—never suffer them to be molested and you have done enough for the public among the multiplicity of human affairs individuals have often been injured by the operation of particular laws without daring to complain or without being able to obtain a hearing for their complaints on account of this vague and false notion that the interest of individuals ought to give way to the public interest considered as a question of generosity by whom ought this virtue to be displayed by all towards one—or by one towards all which then is the most selfish—he who would preserve what he already possesses—or he who would seize even by force what belongs to another an evil felt and a good unfelt—such is the result of those magnificent reforms in which the interests of individuals are sacrificed to those of the public the principles here laid down it may be said are applicable to offices and pensions held for life but not to offices and pensions held during pleasure and which consequently may be revoked at any time may not these he reformed at any time no the difference between the two is only verbal in all those cases in which it has been customary for those places which are granted during pleasure to be held for life though the possessor may have been led to expect other causes of removal he has never expected this my superior he has said to himself may dismiss me i know but i flatter myself i shall never deserve to be dismissed i shall therefore retain my office for life hence the dismission of such an individual without indemnity is as great an evil as much unforeseen and equally unjust as in the former case to these reasons arising from justice and humanity may be added a prudential consideration by such indemnification the interests of individuals and the public are reconciled and a better chance of securing the latter is obtained assure those who are interested that they shall not be injured—they will be among the foremost in facilitating reforms by thus removing the grand obstacle of contrary interests the politician prevents those clandestine intrigues and private solicitations which so often arrest the progress of the noblest plans it was thus that leopold the grand duke of tuscany proceeded notwithstanding the multitude of reforms introduced by his royal highness since his accession to the throne there has not been a single office reformed in tuscany the holder of which has not either been placed in some other office equal to that suppressed must be understood or who has not received as a pension a salary equal in value to the emoluments of his office upon such conditions the pleasure of reform is pure nothing is hazarded good only is accomplished at least the principal object is secured and the happiness of no one is interrupted book iii— reward applied to art and science chapter i art and science—divisions a cloud of perplexity raised by indistinct and erroneous conceptions seems at all times to have been hanging over the import of the terms art and science the common supposition seems to have been that in the whole field of thought and action a determinate number of existing compartments are assignable     marked out all round and distinguished from one another by so many sets of natural and determinate boundary lines that of these compartments some are filled each by an art without any mixture of science others by a science without any mixture of art and others again are so constituted that as it has never happened to them hitherto so neither can it ever happen to them in future to contain in them any thing either of art or science this supposition will it is believed be found in every part erroneous as between art and science in the whole field of thought and action no one spot will be found belonging to either to the exclusion of the other in whatsoever spot a portion of either is found a portion of the other may be also seen whatsoever spot is occupied by either is occupied by both—is occupied by them in joint tenancy whatsoever spot is thus occupied is so much taken out of the waste and there is not any determinate part of the whole waste which is not liable to be thus occupied practice in proportion as attention and exertion are regarded as necessary to due performance is termed art knowledge in proportion as attention and exertion are regarded as necessary to attainment is termed science in the very nature of the case they will be found so combined as to be inseparable man cannot do anything well but in proportion as he knows how to do it he cannot in consequence of attention and exertion know anything but in proportion as he has practised the art of learning it correspondent therefore to every art there is at least one branch of science correspondent to every branch of science there is at least one branch of art there is no determinate line of distinction between art on the one hand and science on the other no determinate line of distinction between art and science on the one hand and unartificial practice and unscientific knowledge on the other in proportion as that which is seen to be done is more conspicuous than that which is seen or supposed to be known—that which has place is apt to be considered as the work of art in proportion as that which is seen or supposed to be known is more conspicuous than anything else that is seen to be done—that which has place is apt to be set down to the account of science day by day acting in conjunction art and science are gaining upon the abovementioned waste—the field of unartificial practice and unscientific knowledge† taken collectively and considered in their connexion with the happiness of society the arts and sciences may be arranged in two divisions viz—  those of amusement and curiosity   those of utility immediate and remote these two branches of human knowledge require different methods of treatment on the part of governments by arts and sciences of amusement i mean those which are ordinarily called the fine arts such as music poetry painting sculpture architecture ornamental gardening c c their complete enumeration must be excused it would lead us too far from our present subject were we to plunge into the metaphysical discussions necessary for its accomplishment amusements of all sorts would be comprised under this head custom has in a manner compelled us to make the distinction between the arts and sciences of amusement and those of curiosity it is not however proper to regard the former as destitute of utility on the contrary there is nothing the utility of which is more incontestable to what shall the character of utility be ascribed if not to that which is a source of pleasure all that can be alleged in diminution of their utility is that it is limited to the excitement of pleasure they cannot disperse the clouds of grief or of misfortune they are useless to those who are not pleased with them they are useful only to those who take pleasure in them and only in proportion as they are pleased by arts and sciences of curiosity i mean those which in truth are pleasing but not in the same degree as the fine arts and to which at the first glance we might be tempted to refuse this quality it is not that these arts and sciences of curiosity do not yield as much pleasure to those who cultivate them as the fine arts but the number of those who study them is more limited of this nature are the sciences of heraldry of medals of pure chronology—the knowledge of ancient and barbarous languages which present only collections of strange words—and the study of antiquities inasmuch as they furnish no instruction applicable to morality or any other branch of useful or agreeable knowledge the utility of all these arts and sciences—i speak both of those of amusement and curiosity—the value which they possess is exactly in proportion to the pleasure they yield every other species of preeminence which may be attempted to be established among them is altogether fanciful prejudice apart the game of pushpin is of equal value with the arts and sciences of music and poetry if the game of pushpin furnish more pleasure it is more valuable than either everybody can play at pushpin poetry and music are relished only by a few the game of pushpin is always innocent it were well could the same be always asserted of poetry indeed between poetry and truth there is a natural opposition false morals fictitious nature the poet always stands in need of     something false when he pretends to lay his foundations in truth the ornaments of his superstructure are fictions his business consists in stimulating our passions and exciting our prejudices truth exactitude of every kind is fatal to poetry the poet must see everything through coloured media and strive to make every one else to do the same it is true there have been noble spirits to whom poetry and philosophy have been equally indebted but these exceptions do not counteract the mischiefs which have resulted from this magic art if poetry and music deserve to be preferred before a game of pushpin it must be because they are calculated to gratify those individuals who are most difficult to be pleased all the arts and sciences without exception inasmuch as they constitute innocent employments at least of time possess a species of moral utility neither the less real or important because it is frequently unobserved they compete with and occupy the place of those mischievous and dangerous passions and employments to which want of occupation and ennui give birth they are excellent substitutes for drunkenness slander and the love of gaming the effects of idleness upon the ancient germans may be seen in tacitus his observations are applicable to all uncivilized nations for want of other occupations they waged war upon each other—it was a more animated amusement than that of the chase the chieftain who proposed a martial expedition at the first sound of his trumpet ranged under his banners a crowd of idlers to whom peace was a condition of restraint of languor and of ennui glory could be reaped only in one field—opulence knew but one luxury this field was that of battle—this luxury that of conquering or recounting past conquests their women themselves ignorant of those agreeable arts which multiply the means of pleasing and prolong the empire of beauty became the rivals of the men in courage and mingling with them in the barbarous tumult of a military life became unfeeling as they it is to the cultivation of the arts and sciences that we must in great measure ascribe the existence of that party which is now opposed to war it has received its birth amid the occupations and pleasures furnished by the fine arts these arts so to speak have enrolled under their peaceful banners that army of idlers which would have otherwise possesssd no amusement but in the hazardous and bloody game of war such is the species of utility which belongs indiscriminately to all the arts and sciences were it the only reason it would be a sufficient reason for desiring to see them flourish and receive the most extended diffusion if these principles are correct we shall know how to estimate those critics more ingenious than useful who under pretence of purifying the public taste endeavour successively to deprive mankind of a larger or smaller part of the sources of their amusement these modest judges of elegance and taste consider themselves as benefactors to the human race whilst they are really only the interrupters of their pleasure—a sort of importunate hosts who place themselves at the table to diminish by their pretended delicacy the appetite of their guests it is only from custom and prejudice that in matters of taste we speak of false and true there is no taste which deserves the epithet good unless it be the taste for such employments which to the pleasure actually produced by them conjoin some contingent or future utility there is no taste which deserves to be characterized as bad unless it be a taste for some occupation which has a mischievous tendency the celebrated and ingenious addison has distinguished himself by his skill in the art of ridiculing enjoyments by attaching to them the fantastic idea of bad taste in the spectator he wages relentless war against the whole generation of false wits acrostics conundrums pantomimes puppetshows boutsrimés stanzas in the shape of eggs of wings burlesque poetry of every description—in a word a thousand other light and equally innocent amusements fall crushed under the strokes of his club and proud of having established his empire above the ruins of these literary trifles he regards himself as the legislator of parnassus what however was the effect of his new laws they deprived those who submitted to them of many sources of pleasure—they exposed those who were more inflexible to the contempt of their companions even hume himself in spite of his proud and independent philosophy has yielded to this literary prejudice by a single piece says he the duke of buckingham rendered a great service to his age and was the reformer of its taste in what consisted this important service he had written a comedy the rehearsal the object of which was to render those theatrical pieces which had been most popular the objects of general distaste his satire was completely successful but what was its fruit the lovers of that species of amusement were deprived of so much pleasure a multitude of authors covered with ridicule and contempt deplored at the same time the loss of their reputation and their bread as the amusement of a minister of state     it must be confessed that a more suitable one might be found than a game at solitaire still among the number of its amateurs was once found potemkio one of the most active and respected russian ministers of state i see a smile of contempt upon the lips of many of my readers who would not think it strange that any one should play at cards from eve till morn provided it were in company but how incomparably superior is this solitary game to many social games—so often antisocial in their consequences the first a pure and simple amusement stripped of everything injurious free from passion avarice loss and regret it is gaming enjoyed by some happy individuals in that state in which legislators may desire but cannot hope that it will ever be enjoyed by all throughout the whole world how much better was this minister occupied than if with the iliad in his hand he had stirred up within his heart the seeds of those ferocious passions which can only be gratified with tears and blood as men grow old they lose their relish for the simple amusements of childhood is this a reason for pride it may be so—when to be hard to please and to have our happiness dependent on what is costly and complicated shall be found to be advantageous the child who is building houses of cards is happier than was louis xiv when building versailles architect and mason at once master of his situation and his materials he alters and overturns at will diruit edificat mutat quadrata rotundis and all this at the expense neither of groans nor money the proverbial expression of the games of princes may furnish us with strong reasons for regretting that princes should ever cease to love the games of children a reward was offered by one of the roman emperors to whoever would invent a new pleasure and because this emperor was called nero or caligula it has been imputed to him as a crime as if every sovereign and even every private individual who encourages the cultivation of the arts and sciences were not an accomplice in this crime the employment of those critics to whom we have before referred tends to diminish the existing stock of our pleasures the natural effect of increasing years is to render us insensible to those which remain by those who blame the offer of the roman emperor these critics should be esteemed the benefactors of mankind and old age the perfection of human life in league with these critics are the tribe of satirists—those generous men who without other reward than the pleasure of humbling and disfiguring everything which does not please them have constituted themselves reformers of mankind the only satire i could read without disgust and aversion would be a satire on these libellers themselves their occupation consists in fomenting scandal and in disseminating its poisons throughout the world that they may be furnished with pretexts for pouring contempt upon everything that employs or interests other men by blackening everything and exaggerating everything for it is by exaggeration they exist they deceive the judgments of their readers—innocent amusements ludicrous eccentricities venial transgressions and crimes are alike confounded and covered with their venom their design is to efface all the lines of demarcation all the essential distinctions which philosophy and legislation have with so much labour traced for one truth we find a thousand odious hyperboles in their works they never cease to excite malevolence and antipathy under their auspices or at least under the influence of the passions which animate them language itself becomes satirical neutral expressions can scarcely be found to designate the motives which determine human actions to the words expressive of the motive such as avarice ambition pride idleness and many others the idea of disapprobation is so closely though unnecessarily connected that the simple mention of the motive implies a censure even when the actions which have resulted from it have been most innocent the nomenclature of morals is so tinctured with these prejudices that it is not possible without great difficulty and long circumlocutions simply and purely without reprobation or approbation to express the motives by which mankind are governed hence our languages rich in terms of hatred and reproach are poor and rugged for the purposes of science and of reason such is the evil created and augmented by satiric writers among rich and prosperous nations it is not necessary that the public should be at the expense of cultivating the arts and sciences of amusement and curiosity individuals will always bestow upon these that portion of reward which is proportioned to the pleasure they bestow whilst as to the arts and sciences of immediate and those of more remote utility it would not be necessary nor perhaps possible to preserve between these two classes an exact line of demarcation the distinctions of theory and practice are equally applicable to all considered as matter of theory every art or science even when its practical utility is most immediate and incontestable appears to retire into the division of arts and sciences of remote utility it is thus that medicine and legislation arts so truly practical considered under a particular aspect appear equally remote in respect to their utility with the speculative     sciences of logic and mathematics on the other hand there is a branch of science for which at first a place would scarcely have been found among the arts and sciences of curiosity but which cultivated by industrious hands has at length presented the characters of immediate and incontestable utility—electricity which when first discovered seemed destined only to amuse certain philosophers by the singularity of its phenomena has at length been employed with most striking success in the service of medicine and in the protection of our dwellings against those calamities for which ignorant and affrighted antiquity could find no sufficient cause but the special anger of the gods that which governments ought to do for the arts and sciences of immediate and remote utility may be comprised in three things—  to remove the discouragements under which they labour   to favour their advancement   to contribute to their diffusion chapter ii art and science—advancement though discoveries in science may be the result of genius or accident and though the most important discoveries may have been made by individuals without public assistance the progress of such discoveries may at all times be materially accelerated by a proper application of public encouragement the most simple and efficacious method of encouraging investigations of pure theory—the first step in the career of invention consists in the appropriation of specific funds to the researches requisite in each particular science it may at first sight appear superfluous to recommend such a measure as this since there are few states which have not sometimes made such appropriations and since all governments in proportion as they have become enlightened have been more and more disposed to reckon such expenses necessary the most efficacious methods of employing the large funds which ought thus to be appropriated remain however to be examined it would be necessary that the funds applicable to a given science—chemistry for example—should be confided to the students of chemistry themselves they ought however to be bestowed in the shape of reward thus the chemist who upon a given subject should have produced the best theoretic dissertation might be put into possession of these funds upon condition that he should employ them in making the experiments which he had pointed out what more natural or useful reward could be conferred upon a philosopher than thus to be enabled with honour to himself to satisfy a taste or a passion which the insufficiency of his own fortune would have rendered rather a torment than a pleasure his talents are rewarded by giving him new means of increasing them other rewards often have a contrary effect they tend to distract his attention and to give birth to opposite tastes if this method of encouraging theoretic researches has been neglected it has been because the intimate connexion between the sciences and arts—between theory and practice—has only been well understood by philosophers themselves the greater number of men recognise the utility of the sciences only at a moment when they are applied to immediate use the ignorant are always desirous of humbling the wise gratifying their selflove by accusing the sciences of being more curious than useful all your books of natural history are very pretty said a lady to a philosopher but you have never saved a single leaf of our trees from the teeth of the insects such is the frivolous judgment of the ignorant there are many discoveries which though at first they might seem useless in themselves have given birth to thousands of others of the greatest utility it is in conducting the sciences to this point that encouragements might thus be advantageously employed instead of being bestowed in what are generally called rewards when the discoveries of science can be practically employed in the increase of the mass of general wealth they receive a reward naturally proportioned to their utility it is therefore for such discoveries as are not thus immediately applicable that reward is most necessary of this nature are most of the discoveries of chemistry is a new earth discovered—a new air—a new salt—a new metal the utility of the discovery is at first confined to the pleasure experienced by those interested in such researches this ordinarily is all the benefit reaped by the discoverer occupied in making further discoveries he leaves it to others to reap their fruits it is those who follow him who apply them to the purposes of art and levy contributions upon the individuals who are desirous of enjoying the fruits of his labour ought the master workman who sees no particular individual upon whom he may levy a contribution therefore to go without reward chapter iii art and science—diffusion the sciences like plants may expand in two directions—in superficies and in height the superficial expansion of those sciences which are most immediately useful is most to be desired there is no method more calculated to accelerate their advancement than their     general diffusion the greater the number of those by whom they are cultivated the greater the probability that they will be enriched by new discoveries fewer opportunities will be lost and greater emulation will be excited in their cultivation suppose a country divided into districts somewhat similar to the english counties but more equal in size say from thirty to forty miles in diameter—the following is the system of establishments which ought to be kept up in the central town of each district—   a professor of medicine   a professor of surgery and midwifery   an hospital   a professor of the veterinary art   a professor of chemisty   a professor of mechanical and experimental philosophy   a professor of botany and experimental horticulture   a professor of the other branches of natural history   an experimental farm the first advantage resulting from this plan would be the establishment in each district of a practitioner skilled in the various branches of the art of healing an hospital necessary in itself would also be further useful by serving as a school for the students of this art the veterinary art or the art of healing as applied to animals has only within these few years been separately studied in england the farriers who formerly practised upon our cattle were generally no better qualified for their duty than the old women whom our ancestors allowed to practise upon themselves the establishment of a professor of the veterinary art in every district might even be recommended as a matter of economy the value of the cattle preserved would more than counterbalance the necessary expense this professorship might for want of sufficient funds be united to one of the others the connexions of chemistry with domestic and manufacturing economy are well known the professor of this science would of course direct his principal attention to the carrying this practical part to its greatest perfection his lectures would treat of the business of the dairy the preservation of corn and other agricultural productions the preservation of provisions of all sorts the prevention of putrefaction that subtle enemy of health as well as of corruptible wealth the proper precautions for guarding against poisons of all sorts which may so easily be mingled with our provisions or which may be collected from the vessels in which they are prepared they would also treat of the various branches of trade—of the arts of working in metal of breweries of the preparation of leather and the manufactures of soap and candles c c botany to a certain degree is necessary in the science of medicine it supplies a considerable part of the materials employed it has a similar connexion with chemistry and the arts which depend upon it the combined researches of the botanist and chemist would increase our knowledge of the various uses to which vegetable substances might be applied it is to them that we must look for the discovery of cheaper and better methods if such methods are to be found of giving durability and tenacity to hemp and flax for the manufacture of linens ropes and paper for discoveries respecting the astringent matters applicable to the preparation of leather and for the invention of new dyes c and so on to infinity indeed it is the botanist who must enable the agriculturist to distinguish the most useful and excellent herbs and grasses from those which are less useful or pernicious the professor of natural history would also furnish abundance not only of curious but useful information he would teach the cultivator to distinguish throughout all the departments of the animal kingdom his allies from his enemies he would point out the habits and the different shapes assumed by different insects and the most efficacious methods of destroying them and preventing their ravages it might however perhaps appear were we fully acquainted with the history of all the animals which dwell with us upon the surface of this planet that there would be found none whose existence was to us a matter of indifference i have placed in the last rank the institution of an experimental farm—not because its utility would be inferior to all the others but because its functions may be easily supplied by individual industry in a country so well replenished with knowledge wealth and zeal as england there is no district which could not furnish an abundance of experiments in this department little more would be necessary than to provide a register into which they might be collected and in which they might receive the degree of publicity necessary for displaying their utility such a register england once possessed in the work of the enlightened and patriotic arthur young such a register numerous and excellent as the hints dispersed throughout it were was far however from supplying the place and rendering useless a system of regular and connected researches in which instruction should constitute the sole object in enumerating the branches of knowledge with which on account of their superior utility     it is most desirable that the great mass of the people should be acquainted it may well be supposed that i ought not to forget the knowledge of the laws but that this knowledge may be diffused a determinate system of cognoscible laws capable of being known is necessary unhappily such a system does not yet exist whenever it shall come to be established the knowledge of the laws will hardly be considered worthy of the name of science the legislator who allows more intelligible terms to exist within the compass of language than those in which he expresses his laws deserves the execration of his fellowmen i have endeavoured to present to the world the outlines of a system which should it ever be filled up i flatter myself would render the whole system of laws cognoscible and intelligible to all as to those arts and sciences which may be learned from books—such as the art of legislation history in all its branches moral philosophy and logic comprehending metaphysics grammar and rhetoric—these may be left to be gathered from books those individuals who are desirous of alleviating the pains of study by the charms of declamation upon these subjects may be permitted to pay for their amusements there is however one branch of encouragement which the hand of government might extend even to these studies it might establish in each district in which the lectures of which we have already spoken should be delivered an increasing library appropriated to these studies this would be at once to bestow upon students the instruments of study and upon authors their most appropriate reward i should not consider knowledge in these departments at once so useful and so curious ill acquired were it even acquired at the expense of latin and greek—an acquaintance with which is held in such high estimation in our days and for instruction in which the foundations are so abundant common opinion appears to have considered the sciences more difficult of attainment than these dead languages this opinion is only a prejudice arising from the comparatively small number of individuals who apply themselves to the study of the sciences and from its not having been the custom to study them till the labour of these other studies has been completed but custom and prejudice apart it is in the study of the sciences that young people would find most pleasure and fewest difficulties in this career ideas find easy access through the senses to the memory and the other intellectual faculties curiosity that passion which even in infancy displays so much energy would here be continually gratified in the study of language on the contrary all is abstraction there are no sensible objects to relieve the memory all the energy of the mind is consumed in the acquisition of words of which neither the utility nor the application is visible hence the longest and most detailed course of instruction which need be given upon all the sciences before mentioned would not together occupy so much time as is usually devoted to the study of latin which is forgotten almost as soon as learned the knowledge of languages is valuable only as a means of acquiring the information which may be obtained from conversation or books for the purposes of conversation the dead languages are useless and translations of all the books contained in them may be found in all the languages of modern europe what then remains to be obtained from them not by the common people but even by the most instructed i must confess i can discover nothing but a fund of allusions wherewith to ornament their speeches their conversations and their books—too small a compensation for the false and narrow notions which custom continues to compel us to draw from these imperfect and deceptive sources to prefer the study of these languages to the study of those useful truths which the more mature industry of the moderns has placed in their stead is to make a dwellingplace of a scaffolding instead of employing it in the erection of a building it is as though in his mature age a man should continue to prattle like a child let those who are pleased with these studies continue to amuse themselves but let us cease to torment children with them at least those children who will have to provide for their own subsistence till such time as we have supplied them with the means of slaking their thirst for knowledge at those springs where pleasure is combined with immediate and incontestable utility it is especially by a complete course of instruction that the clergy who might be rendered so useful ought to be prepared for their functions within the narrow limits of every parish there would then be found one man at least well instructed upon all subjects with which acquaintance is most desirable in exchange for this knowledge which constitutes the glory of man i would exchange as much as might be desired of that controversy which is his scourge and his disgrace the intervals between divine service on the sabbath might then be filled up by the communication of knowledge to those whose necessary avocations leave them no other leisure time for improvement an attendance upon a course of physicotheology it appears to me would be a much more suitable mode of employing this time than wasting it in that idleness and dissipation in which both health and money are so frequently lost     there are three causes which tend to strengthen an attachment to the dead languages—the first is the utility which they formerly possessed at the revival of letters there was nothing to learn but latin and greek and nothing could be learnt but by latin and greek the period when this utility ceased having never been fixed custom has led us to regard it as still subsisting a second reason is the time and trouble expended by so many persons in learning them the price of anything is regulated not only by its utility but also by the labour expended in procuring it few would be willing to acknowledge that they had spent a large portion of their life in learning that which when learnt was not worth knowing there are many individuals who have learnt latin and greek but have learned nothing else can it be expected that they should acknowledge these languages are useless as well might a knighterrant have been expected to acknowledge that his mistress was ugly the third cause is their reputed necessity this necessity though purely conventional is not the less real public opinion has attached a degree of importance to an acquaintance with them and he who should be known to be entirely ignorant of them would be branded with disgrace so long as this law subsists it must be obeyed a single individual is seldom able to withstand or change the laws established by public opinion as the public mind becomes enlightened these laws will change of themselves a sovereign may however hasten these changes if he believe them useful and if he consider the attempt worth the trouble he may reward individuals for teaching the arts and sciences and thus establish a new public opinion which shall at first compete with and at length ultimately subdue the previous prejudice he may also attain the same end by another less costly but more startling method he may prescribe an attendance upon different scientific lectures as a necessary condition to the holding of certain offices and particularly of all honorary employments to those who have completed their course of attendance an honorary diploma may be given which upon all occasions of public ceremony shall entitle those who possess it to a certain precedence in the times of feudal barbarism when war was the only occupation of those who did not belong to the commonality or the clergy the upper ranks in society were necessarily military the knight was the warrior who could afford to fight on horseback the squire was one who not being so rich as the knight could afford to be his principal attendant and this constituted their nobility in future times when other occupations shall be pursued and other manners established it is possible that knowledge may confer rank in europe as the appearance of it has for a long time past in china wealth independently of any convention possesses real power and will always mingle with everything which tends to confer respect the philosopher to his title of honour will unite the idea of an individual sufficiently wealthy to have supported the expense of a learned education knowledge whether true or presumptive might thus become a mark of distinction as the length of the nails is in china but it may be said that something more than attendance upon a course of scientific lectures is necessary if anything is to be learned and that the law which should bestow honour upon attendance would not insure study if it were necessary to have a nobility composed of real philosophers other methods must be pursued but when the object in view is merely to change the species of knowledge in which they are to be instructed from what is useless to what is useful what more need be required when interesting objects of study are substituted for those which are uninteresting they would not study less i know that public examinations are powerful means for exciting emulation but i have no desire to place additional obstacles in the   0 way of a plan whose novelty alone would render it but too alarming a project which to many will appear romantic need not be accompanied by an accessory whose aspect is alarming and whose utility is problematic the most stupid and inattentive could scarcely attend upon a long course of instruction without gaining some advantage they would at least be familiarized with the terms of art which constitute not only the first but the greatest difficulty they would form some idea of the principal divisions of the country they traversed and should they ever be desirous of directing a more particular examination to any particular division they will at least know in what direction to seek for it as all the world would then be occupied with the study of the sciences they would pretend thus to employ themselves and would be ashamed to be entirely ignorant of those things which were the subjects of general conversation russia is an instance of the ease with which a new direction may be given to the opinions of a whole people nobility of birth is but little respected—official rank is the only ground of distinction this change has been effected by a few simple regulations unless he be an officer no individual how rich or nobly born soever he may be can vote or even sit in the assembly of the nobility the consequence has been that all classes have pressed into the service of the state if they do not intend to make it their profession they quit it when they have attained the rank which confers this privilege note—if mr bentham had consented to revise his mss which were written more than forty years ago he might have seen reason to alter many of his observations in england much has been done in the interval public opinion has sensibly changed respecting the value of classical learning it is highly esteemed at college but elsewhere it is now only considered as an accessary the most enlightened parents regret that it is still the only object of instruction in our public schools since the establishment of the royal institution many similar institutions have been formed and a general desire for useful knowledge has been disseminated the ladies have displayed a persevering ardour in their attendance on these means of instruction so much the more praiseworthy as it has been uniformly excited by inclination alone elementary works have been multiplied but all this has been done by the exertions of individuals without any encouragement from the state as to public education it is more easily created than reformed a good institution would be the best criticism upon the bad if two or three colleges were founded in london suited to the wants of the more numerous classes of those who are destined to the pursuits of art trade or commerce in which not latin or greek almost always useless in these avocations should be taught but the national language which has generally been neglected together with all those branches of knowledge which if not absolutely necessary are always useful and agreeable we should soon see these seminaries draw together a crowd of scholars and the old colleges would be obliged to correct their system in order to maintain their ground it may be said that private schools may supply the deficiency but there is a great difference between public and private establishments private education can only succeed by a train of happy events whilst in public education a multitude of circumstances are overcome besides domestic education is limited to the rich whilst public instruction is adapted to the most moderate fortunes —dumont appendix a book i ch viii p   0 on subscriptions to matters of opinion of the two english universities oxford is the most ancient and most dignified of its numerous statutes which are penned in latin as many as fill a moderate duodecimo volume are published as the titlepage declares for the use of youth and of these care is taken for the honour of the government let it be spoken that those for whose observance they are designed shall not without their own default be ignorant since at every mans admission a copy is put into his hands all these statutes as well those that are seen as those that are not seen every student at his admission is sworn in latin to observe so help me god says the matriculated person touching as i do the most holy gospel of christ     the barbers cooks bedmakers errandboys and other unlettered refainers to the university are sworn in english to the observance of these latin statutes the oath thus solemnly taken there has not we may be morally certain for a course of many generations perhaps from the first era of its institution been a single person that has ever kept now though customary it is perhaps not strictly proper as it tends to confusion and to false estimates to apply the term perjury without distinction to the breach of an assertive and to that of a promissive declaration—to the breach of an oath and to that of a vow and to brand with the same mark of infamy a solemn averment which at the time of making it was certainly false—and a single departure from a declared resolution which at the time of declaring it might possibly have been sincere but if they themselves are to be believed who have made the oath and who break it—the university of oxford for this century and half has been and at the time i am writing is a commonwealth of perjurers the streets of oxford said the first lord chatham once are paved with disaffection that weakness is outgrown but he might have added then if that had been the statesmans care and any one may add still and with perjury the face of this as of other prostitutions varies with the time perjurers in their youth they become suborners of perjury in their old age it should seem that there was once a time when the persons subjected to this yoke or some one on their behalf began to murmur for to quiet such murmurs or at any rate to anticipate them a practitioner of a faculty now extinct but then very much in vogue—a physician of the soul a casuist was called in his prescription at the end of every one of these abridged editions of the statutes—his prescription under the title of epinomis seu explanatio juramenti c stands annexed† this casuist is kind enough to inform you that though you have taken an oath indeed to observe all these statutes—and that without exception yet in ninetynine instances out of a hundred it amounts to nothing what in those instances you are bound to do is—not to keep your oath but to take your choice whether you will do that or suffer—not to do what you are bid but if you happen to be found out for this proviso i take for granted is to be supplied to bear the penalty for—what now do you think your sovereign seriously wishes you to do when he forbids you to commit murder that you should abstain from murder at all events no surely but that if you happen to be found out and convicted you should sit quiet while the halter is fitted to your neck who is this casuist who by his superior power washes away the guilt from perjury and controuls the judgments of the almighty is it the legislator himself by no means that indeed might make a difference the sanction of an oath would then not with certainty be violated it would only with certainty be profaned it was a bishop saunderson who in the bosom of a protestant church before he was made a bishop had set up a kind of confessional box whither tender consciences repaired from all parts to heal their scruples this institution whether it were the fruit of blindness or of a sinister policy has answered in an admirable degree some at least of the purposes for which it was probably designed it has driven the consciences of the greater part of those by whom the efficient parts of government are one day to be filled into a net of which the clergy hold the cords the fear and shame of every young man of sense of spirit and reflection on whom these oaths are imposed must at one time or other take the alarm what says he to himself am i a perjurer if he ask his own judgment it condemns him what then shall he do perjury were it only for the shame of it is no light matter if his education have been ever so loose he has frequently heard it condemned if strict and virtuous he has never heard it mentioned without abhorrence but when he thinks of the guilt of it hell yawns under his feet what then shall he do whither then shall he betake himself he flies to his reverend instructors in a state of desperation these men are older than myself says he they are more learned they are therefore wiser on them rests the charge of my education my own judgment indeed condemns me but my own judgment is weak and uninformed why may not i trust to others see their hands are outstretched to comfort me where can be the blame in listening to them in being guided by them in short in surrendering my judgment into their hands are not they my rulers my instructors the very persons whom my parents have appointed to take charge of me to check my presumption and to inform my ignorance what obligation am i under nay what liberty have i to oppose my feeble lights to theirs do they not stand charged with the direction of my conscience—charged by whatsoever i ought to hold most sacred are they not the ministers of gods word the depositaries of     our holy religion the very persons to whose guidance i vowed in the person of my godfathers and godmothers to submit myself under the name of my spiritual pastors and masters and are they not able and willing to direct me in all matters of conscience then let me lay down to myself the following as inviolable rules—not to be governed by my own reason not to endeavour at the presumptuous and unattainable merit of consistency not to consider whether a thing is right or wrong in itself but what they think of it on all points then let me receive my religion at their hands what to them is sacred let it to me be sacred what to them is wickedness let it to me be wickedness what to them is truth let it to me be truth let me see as they see believe as they believe think as they think feel as they feel love as they love fear as they fear hate as they hate esteem as they esteem perform as they perform subscribe as they subscribe and swear as they swear with them is honour peace and safety without them is ignominy contention and despair such course must every young man who is brought up under the rod of a technical religion distinct from morality and bestrewed with doubts and dangers take on a thousand occasions or run mad to whom else should he resort for counsel—to whom else should he repair to the companions of his own age they will laugh at him and call him methodist for many a one who dreads even hobgoblins alone laughs at them in company to their friends and relations who are advanced in life and who live in the world the answer they get from them if they are fortunate enough to get a serious one is—that in all human establishments there are imperfections but that innovation is dangerous and reformation can only come from above that young men are apt to be hurried away by the warmth of their temper led astray by partial views of things of which they are unable to see the whole that these effusions of selfsufficiency are much better repressed than given way to that what it is not in our power to correct it were better to submit to without notice that prudence commands what custom authorizes—to swim quietly with the stream that to bring matters of religion upon the carpet is a ready way to excite either aversion or contempt that humanity forbids the raising of scruples in the breasts of the weak—good humour the bringing up of topics that are austere—good manners topics that are disgusting that policy forbids our offending the incurious with the display of our sagacity the ignorant with the ostentation of our knowledge the loose with the example of our integrity and the powerful with the noise of our complaints that with regard to the point in question oaths like other obligations are to be held for sacred or insignificant according to the fashion that perjury is no disgrace except when it happens to be punished and that as a general rule it concerns every man to know and to remember as he tenders his peace of mind and his hopes of fortune that there are institutions which though mischievous are not to be abolished and though indefensible are not to be condemned a sort of tacit convention is established give your soul up into my hands—i ensure it from perdition surely the terms on your part are easy enough exertion there needs none all that is demanded of you is—to shut your eyes ears lips and to sit quiet the topic of religion is surely forbidding enough as well as a forbidden topic all that you have to do then is to think nothing about the matter look not into touch not the ark of the lord and you are safe b book i ch viii p     mischievousness of reward latent—exemplifications when a reward is groundless it may be either simply groundless or positively mischievous the act which it is employed to produce may be either simply useless or pernicious it would be a nugatory lesson to say that reward should not be applied to produce any act of which the tendency is acknowledged to be pernicious and this whether such act have been aggregated to the number of offences or not the only cases which it can be of any use in this point of view to mention are those in which the mischievousness of the act or the tendency of the reward to produce it is apt to lie concealed to begin with the cases which come under the former of these descriptions—those in which the mischievousness of the act is apt to lie concealed one great class of public services for which rewards have been or might be offered are those which consist in the extension of knowledge or according to the more common though obscure and imposing phrase the discovery and propagation of truth now there is one way in which rewards offered for the propagation of truth that is of what is looked upon or professed to be looked upon as truth cannot but have a pernicious tendency and that of whatever nature be the proposed truth a point being proposed concerning which men in general are thought to be ignorant or divided if a man sincerely desired that the truth relative to that point should be ascertained and in consequence of that desire is content to furnish the expense of a reward the natural course is—to invite men to the inquiry how stands the matter which of the two contradictory propositions is the true one to     a question of some such form as this he requires an answer the service then to which he annexes his reward is the giving an answer to a question—such an answer as upon examination shall appear to be a true one or to come nearest to the truth the tendency of a reward thus offered to produce the discovery of the truth is obvious the tendency of it will at least be to produce the discovery of what to him who puts in for the reward shall appear to be truth what else should it tend to produce my aim being to establish what to you shall appear to be the truth what other means have i of doing this but by advancing what appears to me to be so accordingly thus to apply the reward is to promote a sincere and impartial inquiry and to pursue the best and indeed the only course that by means of artificial reward can be pursued for promoting real knowledge another course which has been sometimes taken is—to assume the truth of the one of two contradictory propositions that may be framed concerning any object of inquiry—and to make the demonstration of the truth of that proposition the condition of the reward in this course the tendency of the reward is pernicious the habit of veracity is one of the great supports of human society—a virtue which in point of utility ought to be and in point of fact is enforced in the highest degree by the moral sanction to undermine that habit is to undermine one of the principal supports of human society the tendency of a reward thus offered is to undermine this virtuous habit and to introduce the opposite vicious one the tendency of it may be to produce what is called logical truth or not as may happen but it is at any rate to produce ethical falsehood it may tend to promote knowledge or error as it may happen but it tends at any rate to promote mendacity the proposition either is true or it is false and be that as it may men are either agreed about its being true or they are not in as far as they are agreed the reward is useless in as far as they are not it tends to make them act as if they were and is pernicious it may be said—no all that it tends to do at least all that it is designed to do is to call forth such and such only whose opinion is really in favour of the proposition and to put them upon giving their reasons for it it is not to corrupt their veracity but to overcome their indolence but whatever may be the design the former is in fact its tendency on the one side they have reward to urge them on the other they have impunity to permit them for when a man declares that his opinions on a given subject are so and so who can say that they are otherwise—who can say with certainty what are a mans private opinions and if the effect be bad what signifies the intention or how indeed can the intention be pure if it be seen that the effect is likely to be a bad one thus would it stand were it doubtful whether there are any persons or no whose unbiassed opinions are on the opposite side to that on which the demonstration is sought to be procured but the case always is that it is clear there are such persons that it is the very persuasion of there being such that is the cause of offering the reward and that the more numerous they are the more likely it is to be offered and the greater it is likely to be such then is the danger of promoting mendacity to avoid which danger it may be laid down in short terms as a general rule that reward should be given—not for demonstration but for inquiry more than this a reward thus applied tends always in a certain degree to frustrate its own purpose and is so far not only inefficacious but efficacious on the other side it does as good as tell mankind that in the opinion of him at least by whom the reward is offered the probability is that mens opinions are most likely to be on the opposite side and in so far gives them reason to think that the truth is also on that opposite side people in general a man will naturally say to himself are not of this way of thinking if they were what need of all this pains to make them so this then affords another reason why reward should be given—not for demonstration but for inquiry such accordingly has been the course pursued in relation to almost every branch of science or supposed science the science or supposed science of divinity furnishes exceptions which are perhaps the only ones what should we say to a man who should seek to promote physical knowledge by such devices what should we say to a man who instead of setting men honestly and fairly to inquire whether in regard to living powers for example the momentum were in the simple or in the duplicate proportion of the velocity—whether heat were a substance or only a quality of other substances—whether blunt or pointed conductors of electricity were the safest—should pay them for endeavouring to prove that in living forces the momentum is in the simple proportion only that heat is only a quality and that blunt conductors are the safest in divinity however examples of this method of applying reward are frequent it may be said that an exception ought to be made from the rule in the cases wherein on whichever side the truth may be the utility is clearly on the side thus favoured thus there is use for instance in the peoples believing in the being and attributes of a god and that even in a political view since upon that depends all the assistance which the political     can derive from the religious sanction and that there can be no use in their disbelieving it that there is use again in the peoples believing in the truth of the jewish prophecies since upon that depends one argument in favour of the truth of that history the truth of which is one main ground of mens expectation of the rewards and punishments belonging to that sanction this observation certainly deserves great attention it exhibits a reason which there may be for making an exception to the rule it does not however invalidate the arguments adduced as above in favour of it it does not disprove the probability of the mischiefs on the apprehension of which it is grounded what it does is to exhibit a benefit to act in balance against these inconveniences if then the interests of religion be at variance with those of virtue and it be necessary to endanger the one in order to promote the efficacy of the other—so then it must be it is to be observed that all the advantage which can accrue to the cause from this manœuvre is composed of the difference between what it may derive from these hireling advocates and what were there no such artificial encouragement given it would derive from volunteers on this head it may be worth considering whether the calling forth of the one does not contribute to prevent the enlistment of the other what need is there for me a stranger to give myself the trouble when there are so many others whose particular business it is and who are so well paid for it of this sort is the language which a man will very naturally hold with himself on such occasions a strange circumstance it would be indeed—and one which would afford no very favourable presumption either of the truth or of the utility of the cause which it is meant to favour—if all the unbiassed suffrages of any considerable majority in number or value of the thinking men should if left to themselves be on the opposite side great indeed must be the penury of unbought advocates that can make it advantageous—i do not say merely to the cause of truth but to any cause however wide of the truth—to apply to mercenaries for assistance of how little weight the suffrages of the latter are in comparison of those of the former let any one judge who has observed the superior eclât with which the work of a layman is received when it happens to be on the side of orthodoxy but however the matter may stand with regard to questions of political importance in which utility is clearly on one side—whatever reason there be for violating the law of impartiality in this case it ceases altogether when applied to the merely speculative points which form the matter of those articles of faith to which on a variety of occasions subscriptions or other testimonies of acceptation are required these will serve as one set of instances of the other branch of the cases where the mischievous effects of reward are apt to lie concealed viz where in the case of a line of conduct produced by a reward apparent or no the tendency of the reward to produce it is apt not to be apparent at first glance—inasmuch as it may escape observation that the advantage held forth acts to this purpose in the capacity of a reward for an emolument to operate in the capacity of a reward so as to give birth to action of any kind it is not necessary that it should be designed so to do whenever any such connexion is established between emolument on the one part and a mans conduct on the other that by acting in any manner he sees that he acquires an emolument or chance of emolument which without acting in such manner he could not have—the view of such emolument will operate on him in the capacity of a reward it matters not whether it be the sole act which is to entitle him to the reward or only one act amongst many it matters not whether it be the act to which the reward is professedly annexed or any other act of which no mention is made it may not be held up to view in that character it may even be not held up to view at all in this unconspicuous way an emolument may operate and in a thousand instances does operate in the capacity of a reward on a long and indefinite course of action—in short on the business of a whole life whenever on the part of the same person two acts are so connected that the performance of the one is necessary to his having it in his power to perform the other a reward annexed to the latter operates eventually as if annexed to the former and whether designedly or not it promotes the production of the one act as much as of the other in this case the having performed the prior act is said to be a qualification for the being permitted to perform the posterior the emolument annexed to the act professedly rewarded is therefore in this case as much a reward for assuming the qualification as a reward for performing the act for the performance of which a man is required to qualify himself by the performance of the other in england for i will go no farther the subscribing a declaration of this sort is made a qualification for many of the principal emoluments to which a man can aspire for every preferment in the church—for the liberty of engaging in the instruction of youth—for admission to the benefits of that mode of education which is looked upon as most liberal and advantageous and thereby to the enjoyment or the chance of the enjoyment of any one of that ample stock of emoluments which     have been provided in the view of inducing young persons to put themselves in the way of that favourite mode of education the articles or propositions to which this subscription is required are termed articles of religion by subscribing to these articles a man declares that he believes the truth of certain facts which they aver among these facts there are many which whether true or not a point which is nothing to the present purpose are plainly in a political view of no sort of importance whatsoever i say of no importance since they contribute nothing to the furnishing either of any motive to prompt to action or of any rule or precept to direct it be they true or be they false—nothing is to be done in consequence—nothing to be abstained from the mischievous tendency which the giving a reward has in this case is much more palpable than what it has in the other because the probability of its giving birth to falsehood is the greater   in the case of demonstrative lectures all that it is absolutely necessary a man should do is—simply to state the arguments in favour of the proposition in question he does not necessarily assert his own belief of the truth of it such are the reasons he may say which induce other people and which if attended to may perhaps induce you to believe it whether they are conclusive or not it lies upon you to judge as to myself whether i myself believe it or no is another matter i do not tell you—i am not bound to tell you in the case of subscription he directly plainly and solemnly says—i believe it   in the next place the probability of falsehood is much greater in this case than in the other in the case of demonstrative lectures men are reasoned with lest otherwise they should not believe in the case of subscriptions men are rewarded for subscribing because it is known many do not believe had men never disbelieved or doubted they never would have been called upon to subscribe it would have been useless and needless nor would any one have thought of it those who are inclined to place in the most favourable point of view the political efficacy of subscriptions to such articles have called them articles of peace as if there were nothing more in saying i believe this proposition than in saying i engage not to say anything that tends to express a disbelief of it they would have been much better named had they been termed articles of war in regard to speculative opinions there are but two cases in which men can be said to be at peace when they think about it and are of the same opinion and when they think nothing about the matter unless we reckon as a third that of their thinking about it and differing about it and not caring about the difference that the expedient in question has no tendency to promote peace of the first kind has been already shown it is equally clear that it has none to produce peace of either of the two other kinds the tendency of it is just the contrary if left to himself there is not one person in a hundred who would ever trouble himself about the matter of this we may be pretty certain what motive should he have—what should lead him to it—what pleasure or what profit is there to be got by it if left then to themselves the bulk of mankind—or to speak more properly the bulk of those whom it is proposed thus to discipline—would think nothing about the matter they would therefore be in a state of the profoundest and most lasting peace if this should not be granted at least it will be granted that it would be possible for them to be so subscriptions render it impossible for making peace between men subscriptions are just the same sort of recipe that it would be for making peace between two mastiffs to set a bone before them and then tie them to the same stake when both parties are at liberty both parties are at their ease and there is peace between them but when the stronger party says to the weaker—stand forth and lie in the sight of god or give up the choicest advantages of society that we may engross them to ourselves what sort of peace is it that can subsist between them just that sort of peace which subsists between the housebreaker and the householder when the one has bound the other hand and foot and gagged him it is not to be denied but that there may be some sort of uneasiness between them in the firstmentioned state of things to wit where neither of them being sacrificed they are both at liberty and both of them protected but what sort of uneasiness is this just that sort of uneasiness which may perhaps subsist between two neighbours at the thought that neither of them can break into the others house against this sort of uneasiness peace it must be confessed affords no remedy but from the possibility of there subsisting this sort of uneasiness between two neighbours or two nations who ever thought of speaking of them as not being at peace if this method of insuring peace were good in one case how should it be otherwise in any other religion or rather the nonsense which has been grafted on it—for the part that is capable of being made useful is not thus exposed to controversy—religion i say is not the only topic which has given rise to controversy so long as there is any man whose knowledge falls short of omniscience and whose faculties are liable to error men     will have their differences they will differ about matters of judgment and about matters of taste—about the sciences about the arts about the ordinary occurrences of life in short about everything which has a name it would then be making peace among the lovers of music to make them swear before god that they think the italian style or that they think the french style of music is the more pleasing among the lovers of heroic poetry that they think it best in blank verse or that they think it best in rhyme among the lovers of dramatic poetry that the unities of time and place may be dispensed with or that they must be observed it would be making peace between an affectionate pair to question them about every possible point of domestic management till some slight diversity were found in their opinions and then force one of them to swear before god that he was convinced his own opinion was the wrong one it would be making peace—but surely by this time the pacific tendency of this policy must be sufficiently understood another mischievous effect of this policy is the tendency it has to vitiate the understanding over a mans genuine opinion such forms it has been shown can have no influence either his veracity must give way or his understanding or both he must deceive either himself or others a deceit of some kind or other he must put on somebody either on himself or others there is one thing which a man cannot do that is destroy the force of arguments which are actually present to his mind there is another thing which he is enabled to do in a great measure that is keep them from getting there this accordingly is what if the consciousness of falsehood sit uneasy on him he will labour to do with all his might to believe is not in his power for when all the arguments that have ever been urged or can be devised in favour of the proposition are collected and applied to his mind and make no impression what help is there what may perhaps be in his power is not to disbelieve and that if possible he will do but thus to shut the right eye if one may so say of the understanding and keep open only the left is not the work of a minute nor of an hour he must make many ineffectual attacks and return as often to the charge he must wage war against the stubbornness of the understanding—he must bring it under the dominion of the affections—he must debilitate its powers—he must render it incapable of placing in a clear light the difference between right and wrong in a word he must instil into his mind a settled habit of partiality and bad reasoning—a habit of embracing falsehood with facility and regarding truth not with indifference merely but with suspicion in the apprehension of being brought by it into trouble one might imagine that it could not have both these bad effects at once that if it have the one it cannot have the other if a man disbelieve his understanding—if he believe his morals—are yet safe but whoever thinks thus is led away by words he does not understand aright the workings of the human mind he supposes the mind fixed as between two rocks whereas it is perpetually shaken and tossed about as by a thousand waves he supposes a man at all times perfectly conscious of the state of his own mind and aware of the momenta and directions of the incessantly fluctuating forces that are operating on him but this is not the case with one man in a million in any the least degree nor perhaps with any man in perfection thus it is also with hypocrisy and fanaticism it might naturally be imagined that the one excludes the other but repeated experience and longcontinued observation have at length opened the eyes of most men upon that head and it seems now to be pretty generally understood that these two seemingly incompatible bad qualities are found frequently in the same receptacle     leading principles of a constitutional code for any state by jeremy bentham first published in the pamphleteer no                 constitutional code c c section i ends aimed at   this constitution has for its general end in view the greatest happiness of the greatest number namely of the members of this political state in other words the promoting or advancement of their interests by the universal interest understand the aggregate of those same interests this is the allcomprehensive end to the accomplishment of which the several arrangements contained in the ensuing code are all of them directed   government cannot be exercised without coercion nor coercion without producing unhappiness of the happiness produced by government the net amount will be—what remains of the happiness deduction made of the unhappiness   of the unhappiness thus produced is composed in the account of happiness the expense of government of the happiness produced by government the gross amount being given the net amount will be inversely as this expense   of the members of this as of other states in general the great majority will naturally at each given point of time be composed of the several persons who having been born in some part or other of the territory belonging to the state have all along remained inhabitants of it but to these for the purpose of benefit of burden or of both will be to be added sundry other classes of persons of whom designation is made in an appropriate part of the ensuing code   immediately specific and jointly allcomprehensive ends of this constitution are—subsistence abundance security and equality each maximized in so far as is compatible with the maximization of the rest   i as to subsistence† this speaks for itself   ii as to abundance this is an instrument of felicity on two accounts on its own account and as an instrument of security for subsistence in this latter character its usefulness may be still greater to those who possess it not than to those who possess it   iii as to security‡ this is for good   0 or against evil security for good is—either for the matter of subsistence or for the matter of abundance   security against evil is either against evil from calamity or against evil from hostility  0 by calamity understand human suffering in the case in which by its magnitude and indeterminateness in respect to extent it stands distinguished from and above the quantity ordinarily produced by one and the same cause    by evil from calamity understand evil from purely physical agency by evil from hostility evil from human agency but by purely physical agency no evil is producible which may not from human agency receive its commencement or its increase    of calamity the principal sources are—inundation conflagration collapsion explosion pestilence and famine    the evildoers against whose hostility that is to say against whose evil agency security is requisite are either external or internal by the external understand those adversaries who are commonly called enemies    internal adversaries against whose evil agency security is requisite are the unofficial and the official    by the unofficial adversaries understand those evildoers who are ordinarily termed offenders criminals malefactors these are resistible everywhere resisted and mostly with success    the official are those evildoers whose means of evildoing are derived from the share they respectively possess in the aggregate of the powers of government among these those of the highest grade and in so far as supported by those of the highest those of every inferior grade are everywhere irresistible    to provide in favour of the rest of the community security against evil in all its shapes at the hands of the abovementioned internal and so long as they continue in such their situation irresistible adversaries—is the appropriate business of the constitutional branch of law and accordingly of this code    as in difficulty so in importance this part of the business of law far surpasses every other of the danger to which an assemblage of individuals stand exposed the magnitude will be in the joint ratio of the intensity of the evil in question on the part of each the duration of it the propinquity of it the probability of it and on the part of all the extent of it the extent as measured     by the number of those who stand exposed to it measuring it in every one of these dimensions—taking into account every one of these elements of value in both cases—minute will be seen to be the danger to which the other members of the community stand exposed at the hands of those their resistible in comparison with that to which they stand exposed at the hands of these their irresistible adversaries in the first case it has place on no other than an individual scale in the other on a national scale    inferior even is the danger to which they stand exposed at the hands of foreign and declared enemies in comparison with that to which they stand exposed at the hands of their everywhere professed protectors foreign enemies in the event of their obtaining the object of their hostility withdraw most commonly from whatever territory they invade leaving the inhabitants thenceforward unmolested at the worst they keep possession of it and in that case from the external and resistible become the internal and irresistible adversaries such as those above mentioned  0 on the texture of the constitutional branch of law will depend that of every other for on this branch of law depends in all its branches the relative and appropriate aptitude of those functionaries on whose will depends at all times the texture of every other branch of law if in the framing of this branch of law the greatest happiness of the greatest number is taken for the end in view and that object pursued with corresponding success so will it be in the framing of those other branches if not not    iv lastly as to equality in the instances of subsistence abundance and security the title of the object to the appellation of an instrument of felicity is stamped as it were upon the face of it—designated by the very name not so in the case of equality    in the idea of equality that of distribution is implied distribution is either of benefits or of burdens under one or other of these names may every possible subjectmatter of the operation be comprised benefits are distributed by collation made of the instruments of felicity—burdens by the ablation of them or by the imposition of positive hardship    i in proportion as equality is departed from inequality has place and in proportion as inequality has place evil has place first as to inequality—in the case where it is in the collation made of those same instruments that it has place in this case it is pregnant with two distinguishable evils the one may be styled the domestic or civil the other the national or constitutional    the domestic evil is that which has place in so far as the subjectmatter of the distribution is the matter of wealth—matter of subsistence and abundance it has place in this way—the more remote from equality are the shares possessed by the individuals in question in the mass of the instruments of felicity—the less is the sum of the felicity produced by the sum of those same shares    the national or constitutional evil is that which has place in so far as the subjectmatter of the distribution is power it has place in this way—the greater the quantity of power possessed the greater the facility and the incitement to the abuse of it in a direct way this position applies only to power but between power and wealth such is the connexion that each is an instrument for the acquisition of the other in this way therefore the position applies to wealth likewise    of inequality as applied to both subjects—and of the evil with which in both the above shapes it is pregnant—the case of monarchy may serve for exemplification for exemplification and thereby for proof    of the maximum of inequality every monarchy affords an example of the matter of wealth to the monarch is allotted a mass as great as suffices for the subsistence of from  0000 to  00000 of the individuals from whom amongst others after being produced by their labour it is extorted yet does it still remain matter of doubt whether the quantity of felicity thus produced in the breast of that one be greater than that which has place in the breast of one of those same labourers taken on an average—has place or at least would have had but for the extortion thus committed    what is certain is—that the quantity of felicity habitually experienced by a gloomy or illtempered or gouty or otherwise habitually diseased monarch is not so great as that habitually experienced by an habitually cheerful and goodtempered and healthy labourer    true it is that if per contra by a monarch maintained at an expense such as the above good is by means of that same expense produced in greater quantity than by a commonwealth chief whose maintenance will not be a hundredth part of the monarchs—true it is that on this supposition the excess of expense vast as it is may be not illbestowed but by whomsoever the existence of any such excess of good is asserted upon him does it rest to prove or probabilize it  0 if in the case of those whose share in the instruments of felicity is greatest the excess of felicity itself is on an average so small—and in some individuals out of the small number belonging to this class the nonexistence of any such excess certain—still     less and less will be the probable amount of the excess of felicity in the case of those whose share in the instruments of felicity is less and less and thus it is that as in a pure monarchy the distribution made of the external instruments of felicity is in the highest degree—so in a pure aristocracy is it in the next highest degree—unfavourable to the maximization of felicity itself    hence throughout the whole population of a state the less the inequality is between individual and individual in respect of the share possessed by them in the aggregate mass or stock of the instruments of felicity—the greater is the aggregate mass of felicity itself provided always that by nothing that is done towards the removal of the inequality any shock be given to security—security namely in respect of the several subjects of possession above mentioned more shortly thus—    the less unequal the distribution of the external instruments of felicity is—the greater so as security be unshaken will be the sum of felicity itself    on the occasion of the distribution made of a mass of burdens delinquency either is or is not in question is not—as where it is for defraying the expense of government that the burdens are imposed    a burden imposed on the occasion of delinquency is imposed either for the purpose of its operating in the way of punishment or for the purpose of conferring a correspondent benefit on some other person or persons in compensation for damage sustained—sustained namely in consequence of the delinquency    correspondent to the evil produced by inequality in the case of collation is the evil produced by it in the case of ablation—ablation made of a mass of the external instruments of felicity in any shape and in particular in the shape of wealth other circumstances the same—the smaller the mass a man possesses of the instruments of felicity in this shape the greater is the loss of felicity produced in his instance by the ablation of any given mass of them by the ablation of fifty pounds more felicity will be abstracted from the breast of a man who has but one hundred pounds for his whole property than from the breast of one who has two hundred pounds much more would it if instead of the hundred pounds he had but that same fifty pounds    ii so much for felicity considered as the product of government now as to infelicity considered as the expense by means of which that same felicity is produced maximization was the object in regard to the desired product minimization is the object in regard to the expense now as to the elements of that same expense    the expense is evil—evil produced either for the exclusion of greater evil or for the production of more than equivalent good it may be distinguished into punishment and hardship    punishment is evil produced under the notion of its being a direct instrument or efficient cause of some good thereby desired and intended to be produced    hardship is evil produced as a collateral result of some operation employed for the exclusion of evil or for the production of good a collateral result not an efficient cause  0 in respect of its shape expense employed by government as above is either nonpecuniary or pecuniary    the nonpecuniary expense of government is hardship at large the principal modification of it is that produced by forced personal service and of forced personal service that produced by forced military service    as to the matter of expense in no shape can it ever be procurable by government in anything like sufficient quantity without hardship or punishment or the fear of it or both    whatever is done by government is done—partly by means of the matter of punishment or the fear of it partly by means of the matter of reward or the hope of it    the matter of reward is a portion of the matter of good considered as employed in the production of felicity in the breast of some individual in consideration of some act done or supposed to be done by him or about to be done by him    the matter of reward is not in any sufficient quantity procurable by government without expense—expense as above in the shape of hardship and punishment    accordingly on no occasion and for no purpose is good producible by government but through evil as above    hence in so far as may be without detriment to the net amount of good produced the maximization of national felicity requires that factitious reward reward applied by the hand of government at the expense of the community be in every shape minimized as well as the matter of punishment section ii principal means employed for the attainment of the above ends   these means are comprisable all of them in one expression maximization of appropriate official aptitude on the part of rulers   of this aptitude three branches are distinguishable   appropriate moral aptitude   appropriate intellectual aptitude   appropriate active aptitude       of appropriate intellectual aptitude there are two distinguishable branches   appropriate knowledge   appropriate judgment   by appropriate moral aptitude understand—disposition to contribute on all occasions and in all ways to the greatest happiness of the greatest number in other words to the promoting or advancement of the universal interest   if appropriate moral aptitude be to a certain degree deficient—the consequence is that by abundance of appropriate aptitude in those other shapes the aggregate of appropriate aptitude will naturally instead of being increased be diminished if hostile to the interests of the greatest number—the more able the functionary the more mischievous   to the different branches of appropriate official aptitude apply correspondently different means expressed in the shortest manner indication may be given of them by the following rules   i means applying to appropriate moral aptitude— rule   in the hands of those of whose happiness the universal happiness is composed keep at all times the choice of those agents by whose operations that happiness is to be promoted   rule   in the hands of each such agent minimize the power of doing evil   rule   leave at the same time as little diminished as may be the power of doing good  0 rule   minimize the quantity of public money at his disposal    rule   minimize the time during which it remains at his disposal    rule   minimize the number of hands through which it passes in its way to the hand by which it is received in payment    rule   extrareward give none without proportionable extraservice—extraservice proved and that by evidence not less conclusive than that which is required to be given of delinquency with a view to punishment    rule   maximize each mans responsibility with respect to the power and the money with which he is entrusted    rule   means by which such responsibility is maximized are—  constant dislocability   eventual punibility†    rule  0 by the several means above mentioned—so order matters that in the instance of each such agent the course prescribed by his particular interest shall on each occasion coincide as completely as may be with that prescribed by his duty which is as much as to say with that prescribed by his share in the universal interest ii means applying to appropriate intellectual and active aptitude—    rule   for appropriate intellectual and active aptitude—establish throughout the whole field of official duty appropriate preliminary tests and securities for these see the code itself    rule   maximize throughout the efficiency of these same tests and securities    rule   minimize in the instance of each office the pecuniary inducements for the acceptance of it  0 follow the observations on which rule   is grounded i the less the money required by a man for subjecting himself to the obligations attached to the office the stronger the proof afforded by him of his relish for the occupations    still stronger and in a proportionable degree will be the proof—if instead of receiving he is content to give    every penny—added to whatsoever remuneration is as above sufficient—adds strength to predatory appetites and to the means of gratifying them    a throne—seat of the most extravagantly fed—is so everywhere of the most invariably insatiable appetites    as to the means applying as above to appropriate moral aptitude—there is not one of them of which an exemplification may not be seen in the constitution of the angloamerican united states    under that constitution in so far as depends on government—has uncontrovertibly been and continues to be—enjoyed a greater quantity of happiness in proportion to population than in any other political community in these or any other times        by that one example is excluded and for ever all ground for any such apprehension real or pretended as that of inaptitude on the part of the people at large as to the making choice of their own agents for conducting the business of government    nowhere else has such universal satisfaction been manifested satisfaction with the form of the government—satisfaction with the mode in which satisfaction with the hands by which the business of it has been carried on no other political community is there or has there ever been—in which by so large a proportion of the population so large a part has been constantly taken in the conduct and examination of the affairs of government—no other in which the part so taken has been so perfectly unproductive of disorder and suffering in every shape    no other constitution is there or has there been under which in anything like so small a degree slavepurchasing and pertinaciously slaveholding states always excepted the interest and happiness of the many have been sacrificed to those of the ruling and influential few—no other under which what yet remains of that sinister sacrifice will with so little difficulty and sooner or later with such perfect certainty be abolished    thus much as to the allcomprehensive end of government in so far as the government is good as to the several abovementioned specific ends—the means for compassing them would not here have been in their place the description of them will be found to be in great measure different according to the differences between the respective ends they will form the subjectmatter—in the first place of the constitutional—in the next place of the penal and nonpenal codes     liberty of the press and public discussion by jeremy bentham     advertisement the lot of the present tract has hitherto been rather unfortunate it was begun continued and ended for the purpose and under the full assurance of its being translated into spanish and published at madrid it was sent in the hope of its reaching that capital time enough to be before the public antecedently to the day on which the proposed law which was the subject of it would come under final discussion the person by whom it was to have been translated and published was mr mora at that time editor of el constitucional the most popular the most ably conducted and the most distinguished of the madrid daily papers had they gone according to the course of the post the letters in question four in number would even the last of them have arrived in time but in the first instance in a proportion which has never been ascertained some or all of them miscarried as the miscarriages became ascertained or suspected other copies were sent and at last the complete series were received in the meantime the law the prevention of which they had in view passed but though the only individual object which they had in view was thus at an end and the design of them thus far frustrated the more extensive object which they had in view—more extensive in place as well as time—was neither at an end nor in its nature capable of being put to an end that object was—the rendering it manifest how indispensable at all times and everywhere those two intimatelyconnected liberties—the liberty of the press and the liberty of public discussion by word of mouth—are to everything that can with any propriety be termed good government thus it is that in respect of this its major object the work small as it is belongs not with less propriety to the country in the language of which it was written than to that for the language of which it was designed—to the present month of july      in which it is now published than to the months of september and october    0 in which it was written to these countries not to speak of other countries—to the present month and year not to speak of future ones the law against which these letters were directed was passed but the effects at the production of which it aimed have not been produced the spanish press has not been enslaved spaniards have not like englishmen submitted to be gagged spanish instead of being like english and french ministers absolute have been expelled as to massacres the authors of that of cadiz though they enjoy not the same triumph nor have obtained the same rewards have as yet it is believed enjoyed nearly the same impunity with those of the manchester massacre but the punishment of those who showed what legitimacy and social order is at cadiz is yet to come and may even yet not improbably come in that country punishment may yet be for the authors of misrule and massacre while in this country it is reserved for the victims of misrule—for those who have escaped from massacre of the reception experienced at madrid by subsequent addresses of the same author to the same people something may come to be said in another publication which is in readiness to pass through these same hands as to the present tract its lot at madrid remains still in abeyance it had been about half translated when by an act of the sort here protested against the translator was thrown into a prison the illegality of that act has since been recognized and his enlargement has been the consequence but under the extraordinary weight of the business which presses upon him in these eventful times whether the translation has as yet been published or so much as completed is not at present known if not by his it will however ere long be laid before the spanish public by some other hand the situation of that distinguished publicist is at this moment an altogether curious one a ministry has lately been expelled and in this expulsion he has borne a leading not to say the principal part to have been and to continue to be in a preeminent not to say a peculiar degree the object of the monarchs confidence has been at the same time matter of public and vehement accusation against him far from denying the fact he openly avows it you know says he what my opinions what my affections are you know that they are all liberal ones your wish is that the opinions—that the affections—communicated to your monarch should be liberal ones by whom can they be communicated but by those by whom they are entertained what would you be gainers if your monarch communicated with none that were not your enemies     jeremy bentham to the spanish people jeremy bentham  th october    0 london letter i on the liberty of the press—the approaching eight months sleep of the cortes—and the exclusion of experience from the succeeding cortes london  th october    0 spaniards— the madrid intelligence of the prosecution of a newspaper editor for comments on the madrid system of police and of the introduction of the proposed law against political meetings has just reached me i am astounded—what is it come to this—so soon come to this the men being men of their disposition to do this and more there could not be any room for doubt but that this disposition should so soon ripen into act this i must confess is more than i anticipated neither of the issue of the prosecution nor of the fate of the proposed law has the intelligence yet reached me but that any such prosecution should have been instituted—any such proposed law introduced—that the impatience of contradiction not to say the thirst for arbitrary power should so soon have ventured thus far—these in my view are of themselves highly alarming symptoms by the prosecution if successful unless the alleged offence have features in it such as i do not expect to find in it i see the liberty of the press destroyed by the proposed law if established i see the almost only remaining check to arbitrary power destroyed taken together they form a connected system—these two measures by the authors of this system you have of course been told that it is indispensably necessary—necessary to order to good order to tranquillity—and perhaps honourable gentlemen may have ventured so far into the region of particulars and intelligibles as to say—to good government and some other good things—spaniards it is neither necessary nor conducive to nor other than exclusive of any of those good things what says experience in the angloamerican united states of the two parts of this system neither the one nor the other will you see no prosecution can there have place for anything written against the government or any of its functionaries as such no restriction whatever is there on public meetings—on public meetings held for any such purpose as that of sitting in judgment on the constitution—on any measures of the government—or on any part of the conduct of any of its functionaries yet if there were a country in which these restraints or either of them would be necessary or conducive to good government it would be that for in that country the people are all armed armed at all times in much greater proportion than in any other country—armed at any time they please every one of them no in that only seat of real and established good government for yours alas is not yet established—in that country in which ever since that good government was established—in which for the forty years that it has been in existence public tranquillity has not known what disturbance is—there is no more restriction upon mens speaking together in public than upon their eating together in private people of spain do you know this you scarcely do but is it not high time you should     both these lessons of experience you shall see more particularly in time and place you will on that occasion see in the same manner a passage in history an allusion to which is     all that room can be found for here a law had been passed authorizing prosecution for the sort of offence prosecuted for as above among you under it one single prosecution took place—it failed the law was repealed—the authors of it lost the public confidence and with it their political influence i as to the restraints on constitutional liberty that my conception of the matter may at once be seen in its utmost extent i shall in the present letter state at once the measures which i would venture to recommend for examination but in the meantime it may be some satisfaction to you to see before you an outline of the considerations by which the wish to see some such measures carried into effect has been produced first as to the liberty of the press every expression betokening disapprobation of the texture of the government or of the conduct of any person bearing a part in the exercise of the powers of government conveys an imputation on reputation—on the reputation of the persons at the head of the government this cannot be denied for as at all times the texture depends upon the person so situated in proportion as the texture is ill adapted to the only proper end of government so are they to their situations and between one degree of disapprobation and another it is not possible to draw a line accordingly any such expression is at pleasure commonly considered by them in this light and punished if the imputation is to a certain degree particular—imputing an individual act legally punishable or at least disreputable—it constitutes the sort of act expressible by the term defamation if to a certain degree vague and general vituperation but these sorts of acts are both of them commonly treated on the footing of offences and this too even where the person who is the subject of the imputation is a private individual not bearing a part in the exercise of any of those powers on this subject the following are the assumptions that in governments in general seem commonly to have been made— whatsoever be the treatment of an offender in the case where the party offended is but a private individual in the case where he is a public functionary—especially if spoken of as such much more if the whole body of the rulers or those at the head of it are the parties offended—the offence is more mischievous or on some other account creative of a demand for a stronger repressive force in the shape of punishment as well as in all other shapes and this force ought to rise in magnitude as the rank of the person offended rises and the judicatory by which cognizance is taken of the offence should in this case be different as also the forms of procedure different my notion as confirmed by the practice of the angloamerican united states is in all those particulars the reverse in the case of the public functionary for vituperation how gross soever there should be no punishment at all for defamation no punishment unless the imputation be false and groundless nor even then unless the false assertion or insinuation be the result of wilful mendacity accompanied with the consciousness of its falsity or else with culpable rashness—namely with that which is exemplified by the giving credence and currency to an injurious notion adopted without any or on palpably insufficient grounds no separate judicatory no separate form of procedure styled penal or criminal while in the other case it is styled civil and in the case of defamation in disproof of rashness of assertion as well as of wilful falsehood the defendant should be at liberty to make proof of the truth of the imputation and for that purpose to extract evidence from the person who is the subject of it as he might from any other person at large for these notions speaking in general terms my reason is—that to place on any more advantageous looting the official reputation of a public functionary is to destroy or proportionably to weaken that liberty which under the name of the liberty of the press operates as a check upon the conduct of the ruling few and in that character constitutes a controuling power indispensably necessary to the maintenance of good government speaking more particularly whatsoever evil can ever result from this liberty is everywhere and at all times greatly outweighed by the good   the good consisting as it does in the security thus afforded for good government and covering as it does the whole field of government is plainly infinite   in comparison with this good the utmost evil that from this cause can result to any person or to any number of persons however situated would even if altogether unaccompanied   0 with compensation be comparatively minute   in the elevated situation in question whether the imputation be unmerited or merited the nature of his situation furnishes a man with means of support and defence—and in so far as the imputation is false means of disproof and refutation—increasing with the height of his situation and at any rate much beyond any which can be within the reach of an individual not so situated   in every such situation immediately upon his advancement into it and therefore antecedently to his becoming the object of any such imputation a man finds in the advantages attached to such his situation a compensation for all the evil to which in this and all other shapes taken together he stands exposed by it   the higher the situation the more abundant the antecedent compensation it thus puts him in possession of against the allowance of this liberty considered with a view to its effect on the goodness of the government no arguments that have been or may be adduced will bear the test of examination   first comes dangerousness dangerous it always and everywhere is for it may lead to insurrection and thus to civil war and such is its continual tendency answer in all liberty there is more or less of danger and so there is in all power the question is—in which there is most danger—in power limited by this check or in power without this check to limit it in those political communities in which this check is in its greatest vigour the condition of the members in all ranks and classes taken together is by universal acknowledgment the happiest these are the angloamerican united states and the kingdom of great britain and ireland in the republic this liberty is allowed by law and exists in perfection in the kingdom it is proscribed by law but continues to have place in considerable degree in spite of law take away this check there remains no other but the exercise of this same liberty by speeches in public meetings and in that shape besides that it is not applicable with nearly equal advantage it is much more dangerous ii next comes needlessness to the prevention of misgovernment the other remedies that government itself affords are adequate the rulers in chief whoever they are have nothing so much at heart as the happiness of all over whom they rule and that wisdom by which they are informed of the means most conducive to that end is in them perfect or if not absolutely free from all imperfection that endowment is in their situation much more so than in that of the subjectmany this being assumed—in this union of all the elements of official aptitude—appropriate probity appropriate intellectual aptitude and appropriate active talent—with uncontrouled power in the persons of the rulers in chief the subjectmany possess an adequate security against any want of correspondent aptitude in the persons of their several subordinates in case of simple inaptitude removal will follow in the case of inaptitude coupled with delinquency prosecution and thence punishment will follow answer the rulers in chief whoever they are if they are men have their own happiness more at heart than that of all over whom they rule put together the very existence of man will in every situation be found to depend upon this general and habitual selfpreference as to wisdom it can never be so near to perfection without as with these allcomprehensive means of information which nothing but the liberty here in question can give upon exertion depends the possession of all the several elements of official aptitude above mentioned and in particular the acquirement of the appropriate information as above but the higher the situation the less is the exertion which he who is in it is disposed to apply to the functions of it for the higher the situation the less he has to apprehend for himself in case of demonstrated inaptitude in any shape without this liberty the rulers in chief will not be sufficiently either disposed or enabled to apply so much as simple removal much less punishment for remedy against inaptitude on the part of their subordinates beholding in those subordinates so many everobsequious instruments in their hands—instruments continually applicable to their own personal purposes—the rulers will naturally and generally feel more sympathy for them than for the people at large they will not be disposed to remove or punish them merely for acting against the peoples interest much less for acting in favour of the separate and sinister interest of these same rulers as where the rulers themselves engross or share the profit of the offence to the formal prosecution at the suit of rulers—and where allowed at the suit of subjects—the informal informations which it is the property of this liberty to supply constitute in one case an assisting support—on the other a succedaneum and substitute destitute of this assistance and this substitute prosecution even when not refused is at once insufficient and over expensive so small as is the number of prosecutions compared with that of delinquencies the delay vexation and expense attendant on them compose no inconsiderable evil what if such prosecutions were as numerous in proportion     to delinquencies as under the liberty in question these informations are that are given by the exercise of it under the least bad systems of judicial procedure extant the prosecutions teem with factitious delay vexation and expense over and above what is natural and necessary attendant on informations there is neither factitious expense nor factitious delay vexation there is comparatively little—none but what is proportioned to delinquency and stands in lieu of punishment for the establishment of the truth or falsity of the imputation—for the establishment of the guilt or innocence of the party suspected of delinquency—the utmost stock of relevant and applicable facts and arguments that can be secured by prosecution is very imperfect without the addition of those which this liberty and nothing else is capable of supplying ii so much as to the liberty of the press now as to the liberty of public meetings without much variation the arguments that apply to the former of these two branches of personal liberty and constitutional security apply to this but of this branch the extinction is already known to have been taken for the object as well as subject of an already proposed law and ere this the object may have been effected by an established law in support of this extinction the english newspapers have brought to my view a system of argument stated as having been employed by various public functionaries to these after holding up to view the proposed law in what seems to me its proper colours i propose to give a distinct consideration in another letter from one who in regard to the individual facts of the case has no other information than what is above alluded to any observations made in such circumstances are not altogether out of all danger of being regarded as ungrounded and to such a degree as to be destitute of all claim to notice but—such is the nature of man when clothed with power—in that part of the field of government which is here in question whatever mischief has not yet been actually done by him today he is sure to be meditating today and unless restrained by the fear of what the public may think and do it may actually be done by him tomorrow of the documents which form the subject of the ensuing remarks it is impossible for me to say to what extent the accounts that have reached me may not be incorrect so far as regards individuals these remarks must therefore from first to last be considered as no other than hypothetical depending for their appositeness upon the correctness of the reports respectively given of these arguments but if considered as applied to the arguments themselves the remarks should be found justly applicable the fact that on the particular occasion in question the arguments were not actually employed by the persons to whom they stand ascribed will not detract much from the value of any information which the remarks may be thought to afford ungrounded in the character of a censure in that of a warning the remark may not the less have issue measures proposed   in regard to liberty of writing and speech on political subjects repealing what requires to be repealed place matters exactly on the same footing as that in which they are in the angloamerican united states and to narrow the inquiry let the footing be that on which they are in the territory immediately under the government of congress and where the subject of discussion is the conduct of the members of the ruling body so denominated or any of the official persons subject to their controul   in regard to assemblies in particular insert a declaration giving the people the assurance that forasmuch as there exists not any law to the contrary they remain at liberty at all times and in all places from which they are not excluded by special ownership to meet for the purpose of delivering their opinions in the freest manner on the conduct and character of their rulers—at any rate of all such of their rulers as are or may be the objects of their choice in the character of representatives as also of all such other persons as are subject to the controul of such their representatives and let it not be forgotten that all persons thus chosen are thereby not their masters but their servants in regard to secresy insert moreover a declaration that for keeping their proceedings as secret as they please they may take what precautions they please so that no engagement wearing the form of a religious oath be employed nor any scheme entered into for the performance of any act importing bodily or other injury to any individual or on any other account forbidden or made punishable by law be in the number of their objects and note that in regard to secresy on this footing stands in england the unreproached and irreproachable society of free masons in the united states whoever thought either of instituting secret societies or of being jealous of them if instituted of secresy under such a government what could be the object secresy in subjects supposes tyranny in rulers under these circumstances what fills me with apprehension is—the approaching nonentity of the cortes the only bridle to ministerial despotism taken out of its mouth     without a possibility of being replaced for eight months to come now if they had but the possibility of existence now then would be the time for meetings of the people for petitioning the cortes not to desert its post now would be the time for saying to them do not in deference to the rash and illjudged—the suicide letter of the constitution risk the destruction of the constitution itself or at least of the most essential portion of what is good in it true it is that in the cortes i see an authority under the eye of which the liberty of the press has i much fear to find been sadly weakened and perhaps destroyed true it is that in the cortes i see at any rate an authority by which the liberty of public discussion has without reserve been taken away true but in the cortes i see an assembly in which so long as it is sitting it is at all times in the power of any one member to use his endeavours for the restoration of the banished liberties and to spread over the whole kingdom the arguments on which these endeavours are grounded by this strange article of the constitutional code the cortes the only assembly in which should misrule reasume its recent enormity the voice of complaint can be heard is laid asleep is reduced to a state of nonentity for eight months and during these eight months what are the hands in which all the powers of government are lodged the selfsame hands in which till tother day they were employed—it is needless to say how by article     power the  th to the king it belongs to fill up all civil and military employments amongst others therefore the employments of the seven ministers of state and of public affairs those seven ministers by whom taken collectively during this long sleep as well as after the death of the cortes the whole mass of the powers of government is exercised these powers the king may at all times collectively and individually take and at each moment lodge in any hands he pleases to this choice i am unable to find any the smallest check i see indeed a council of state which in art     by a provision not very consistent in its terms with the terms of that same    st article shares with the king the power of conferring ecclesiastical benefices and offices of judicature as if offices of judicature were not civil employments—as it this were not enough supposing the unofficial advisers of the crown to be again what they were so lately and suppose at the same time that in the whole court and country persons in so large a number as seven are not to be found suitable to the purpose of giving to the whole power of government an exercise similar to that which was so lately given to it—one single minister unless prevented by some regulation no tidings of which have reached me may under this same constitution be made sufficient for by art     by a particular regulation approved by the cortes will be pointed out it is said the business peculiarly appertaining to each minister but till such demarcation has been made by the cortes everything is left at large and to any one or more of the seven as much of the power of all seven may be given as those same irresponsible advisers shall advise and amongst the rest the filling up and for aught appears after having emptied them for the purpose all civil and military employments under civil ecclesiastical and judicial being respectively included or not included let those who are sure say which what—says some one—have you then really any such fear as that of this eight months sleep of the cortes the restoration of the recent habits of government will be the consequence no i have not for how small soever may be the regard of the men in question for the security of the subjectmany their regard for their own security will be not the less and i see not by what means any tolerably effective provision can be made for it unless it be such by which along with the ruling few the subjectmany will be secured at least against any condition equally disastrous with that from which they have so lately emerged but knowing little more of them than that they are men what i am afraid of is this—namely that in the situations in question men will do what all men would be disposed to do in their places—that they will embrace every opportunity for sacrificing the interest of the whole community to their own particular interests that in particular they will give the utmost magnitude possible to the mass of useless and needless offices and to the emolument of those same offices as well as to that of useful and needful ones that they will dispose of offices for their own profit either in a direct way by selling them or—in a way not less effectual by being indirect—by giving them to persons in dependencies or otherwise in private connexion with them be the persons ever so apt or ever so inapt for the functions     of those same offices and that to the same end they will give and secure to every other branch of expenditure every practicable increase and to retrenchment every practicable diminution that with or without just cause should there be any persons to whom it has happened to incur their displeasure they will let slip no opportunities of allaying it by vengeance and that in a word they will do as those do and have been used to do under whom it has hitherto been my good hap to live unhanged unsabred unimprisoned unbanished and unruined this is not all for giving permanency to a system of this sort these instruments of monarchy would scarcely feel sufficient confidence in their own force they would look out for coadjutors in the aristocracy and thus in the union of the monarchical with the aristocratical interest you would see and feel as here an alliance defensive and offensive against the interest of the people—of the ruling one and the subruling few against the subjectmany they would call to their aid the landed proprietors of the country as such and in particular the proprietors of the vast overgrown properties in these they will find not only natural allies but sure and perpetual and steady and in every respect matchless ones the possessor of an office howsoever abundant in power may be removed out of it at any time and without so much as the imputation of injustice not so the great landholder—the proprietor of a tenth part an eighth part or a fourth part of the land of a whole province and with it of a proportionable mass of political influence but neither time nor space will here permit me to enter into any detail of the mischiefs with which such a confederacy is pregnant except to conclude with saying—that the last though not the least of my fears is—that to give completeness to the system the measures which at the instance as it seems of these same ministers have i fear already been taken by the majority of the cortes for the extinction of all power of controul in the hands of the people may by means of such an alliance be carried into full execution and perfected and perpetuated another set of fears though not quite so intense as the foregoing remains still behind—that they will give to those natural enemies of the people the fullest security that can be given to them against any idea so intolerable as that their as yet unhorn descendants will find themselves unloaded with wealth no prospect of which can ever have entered into their minds that they will secure them against so cruel an apprehension as that all their children but one should not always be impoverished for the benefit of that one and against the still more intolerable apprehension lest their creditors should receive any part of the amount of their just debts that in atonement for the injury thus done to their thus impoverished children they will secure to them at the expense of the still more impoverished lower orders a stock of sinecures of all classes matter of emolument granted at the expense of the state on pretence of rendering to man some service never rendered or on pretence of rendering some pretended service to that being to whom all service is unprofitable and to crown all that having with such efficient anxiety provided for keeping them stocked as richly as may be with the benefits of political society they will join in securing to them an exemption as extensive as may be from its burthens no nothing can be more inconceivable to me than the grounds if they were good and avowable ones on which for twothirds of every year the power in which you the people see your only hope should be reduced to perfect nullity† and of all times this too at the very commencement of the system on which all hope of salvation rested as if for eight months in the year all sheep dogs were to be kept locked up and the sheep committed during that time to the guardianship of the wolves at no time surely nor in any nation can there have been or can there be so much work to be done and at this time it is that of the quantity that might have been employed in work twothirds are taken off and taken off with every mark of anxiety—consecrated to idleness with us in england where everything how ill soever is so fully and permanently     and for so vast a length of time has been established the whole year may if so the king pleases be employed in doing with the exception of giving him a new wife whatever else he pleases strange as it is the article by which at the time when the demand for experience and for the talents formed by it stands at its highest pitch the next succeeding cortes is so anxiously deprived of all the experience and talent acquired in the present is not quite so strange in a jealousy entertained of the probity of these first objects of the peoples choice i can conceive a possible howsoever indefensible cause of it but while the jealousy of which the persons chosen by the people are the objects is so broad awake—that all jealousy of those against whose power these same objects of the peoples choice are to afford the sole security should be so perfectly asleep—this is the thing that astonishes me that such jealousy and such confidence should at the same time have found place in the same bosoms no it is not so much of a monarch that i am afraid for he is mutable it is of the aristocracy that i am so much afraid for that is immutable it is itself immutable and no less immutably adverse is its interest to the interest of the people postscript this moment comes information of the decision of the cortes in relation to the persas and of the whole number of    not more than one is to be so much as prosecuted at their own homes they are to continue and there should his majesty have any fresh occasion for their services there he knows where he may be sure to find them nothing can be more merciful—nothing more convenient now if from this mercy no mischief to the people shall ensue whosoever else may be dissatisfied with it i shall not be so it is not for any pleasure i can take in the contemplation of what he suffers that i would punish the most mischievous of criminals but a question i cannot help putting to myself is—if under the constitution those who seek the forcible destruction of it have nothing to fear while he who seeks the preservation of it by means not acceptable to those by whom this impunity has been granted has much to fear what chance has it for continuance any leading member in gratitude for all this mercy—has it happened to him to have received or to be about to receive a requital in any shape from any of those who have been preserved by it if any such gratitude has been manifested so much the better and it cannot be too extensively known for the more expensive the gratitude and the more extensive the knowledge of it the more extensive will be the assurance that should any such attempt to destroy the constitution be repeated and success fail of crowning the attempt the impunity will not be entire   th oct    0 letter ii on the liberty of public discussion in free meetings   th oct    0 spaniards i continue—my former letter was principally allotted to the liberty of the press intimation was there given that the arguments pleading in favour of that branch of personal liberty and constitutional security apply with little variation to that which forms exclusively the subject of the present letter the proposed law as it stood in four articles together with the speeches by which i found it supported will constitute the text of this discourse i commence with the proposed law itself the text of it in the state in which on the   st of september    0 according to the english translation it came out of the hands of mr goreli—traveller oct      0 the law regarding public societies i see it termed the law for the prevention of popular assemblies it might have been termed for of this law what is the object what the declaredly intended effect in respect of this security against misrule to place the people of spain exactly upon the same footing as the people of morocco yes exactly upon the same footing as the people of morocco this you will see four and no more is the number of its articles these are quite sufficient give but to language the extent it is susceptible of the fewer the words the greater the effect think of this ye who to make display of your humanity complain of the multitude nothing but the multitude of penal laws draco made but one death is for him who breaks any one of my laws art   all spaniards will have the right of speaking on political affairs by conforming to the disposition of the law good and so have all the moroccans what is it this same disposition of the law wait to the next article but one and you will see it art   every assembly not authorized by law will immediately cease if so and without revival then will ere long the constitution itself cease or at least everything that is good in it art   meetings shall not take place but in virtue of the permission of the local authority who will take the necessary measures to guarantee the public tranquillity the person or persons in whose hands the local authority is suppose then his own conduct among the proposed subjects of complaint—his own conduct or that of any person or persons to whose power or influence he stands subjected or that of any person or persons     who stand subject to his power or influence unless they happen to have incurred his displeasure this indispensable permission when and how often will it be given to it in the whole kingdom or in this or that part of it suppose these functionaries all or any of them in a league to betray their trust and abolish or otherwise render of no effect all that is good in the constitution how many of these assemblies will respectively be permitted to be held take the necessary measures o yes that he will of those who would have attended the meeting he will exclude one part—he will keep the rest under a guard by this means those and those only will be there who are of the same way of thinking or at least of speaking measures to guarantee the public tranquillity o yes doubt not but that by measures such as these the public tranquillity will be preserved as to permission—in every case in which there is neither need of nor use in any such public meeting permission will be ready for it in every case in which there is need of it or use in it punishment will be ready for it art   nevertheless these societies authorized by the competent authority will not be regarded as corporations so then according to the honourable gentleman if men in any number however great or ever small are but suffered to meet together whether at stated times or by accident for the purpose of conversing and conversing accordingly on the state of the nation there needs no more to constitute them a corporation to constitute them a corporation—or at least to give to the assembly an appearance so near to that of a corporation as to produce a danger of its being taken for such and that with mischievous effect lawyer or nonlawyer in the mind of the honourable gentleman can it really have been a subject of belief that by any such means in the sense put upon the word corporation by the law of his country—by the romebred law or by any other sort of law—a corporation would or could thus be constituted or that to any other reflecting mind it could be taken to be so i have tried hard but i have not as yet been able to find in any such supposition the faintest colour of probability but if not—i grieve to think of it—what is the consequence that on the occasion of the insinuation thus conveyed for the purpose of gaining his point and deluding into an acquiescence with a liberticide law his colleagues of the cortes and the spanish people their constituents he had recourse to misrepresentation wilful and studied misrepresentation to the people to induce them to sit still and without previous remonstrance or subsequent complaint see themselves deprived of a real and indispensable security he held up to view a danger purely imaginary and known by himself to be so at the same time to effect this liberticide purpose he scrupled not to use his endeavours to cause those whom he was depriving of their liberty to be regarded as a set of conspirators and usurpers conspiring to assume and exercise an illegal power for the purpose of employing it in acts of hostility against the government oh but as often as it pleases the local authority that any such assemblies shall be held and to give permission accordingly held they will be or at least may be oh yes that they may held in spain they may be and so they may be in morocco the emperor of morocco—is he in want of a prime minister let mr goreli tender his services but perhaps he may be provided nearer home but the law is mr gorelis and he has given us his reasons for it let us see them from the traveller   st september    0 madrid sept  —the cortes—sittings of the  th m goreli allowed that the members of the societies and their objects deserved respect and confidence—  that they took every precaution to admit none but persons of upright intentions and devoted to the constitution—  but that they were exposed to be taken by surprise by some who under the appearance of patriotism might lead them to impolitic conduct such are the premises and his conclusion is what has just been seen and is it come to this and did such logic then come from spaniards—and without fear of universal indignation could it thus be presented to spaniards and so it is from these premises that this same practical conclusion has been derived these societies are to be annihilated all societies of this description—all that now exist and all that would otherwise have existed plunged together and forever into one and the same bottomless pit—consigned for ever to annihilation—people of spain this same logic—would you see it in its true character this you may do and without much difficulty apply it wherever else it is equally applicable and observe the effect of it apply it then to the ministry—you annihilate the ministry apply it to the cortes—you annihilate the cortes apply it to the monarchy—you annihilate the monarchy yes the monarchy for was there not a monarch once who was not merely exposed to be taken but actually taken by surprise but why thus spend time in taking men one by one apply it to human kind you annihilate human kind would you give a top to the climax—apply this same logic to the maker of it apply it to mr goreli you annihilate mr goreli for is not even mr goreli exposed at least to be     taken by surprise and led into impolitie conduct ah why was it not applied to him—this logic of his—and applied with somewhat more than logical effect before he introduced this law was it that even he was taken by surprise when he was led into the conduct manifested by the framing and proposing of such a law ah no i see but too much of reflection in it—but too little of surprise deserving of respect and confidence—themselves as well as their objects—careful to admit none but persons of upright intentions and devoted to the constitution—exposed but only exposed to be led to impolitic conduct—led by some but only by some among them and by them no otherwise than by being taken by surprise—such according to mr goreli is the general character—not only of the societies but in each society that of the members such their character and notwithstanding their being all this—if not for their being all this—for this it is that they are annihilated what had their characters been the very opposite of all this—what worse could even in that case have been done to them and because in—it is not said how small—a number they are exposed to be taken by surprise their general excellence being at the same time thus admitted and proclaimed—it is for this that not only all that exist are at once to be consigned to nihility but all that otherwise would have existed well then the impolitic conduct they are exposed to be led into together with whatever mischief might have been the result of it—what would have been the cause of it surprise answers mr goreli himself—their being taken by surprise well and suppose them not so taken what would have been the mischief i answer—there would not have been any even mr goreli does not say there would against surprise then is there no other remedy—no remedy less drastic—than annihilation under the name of warning does not the nature of the case present a somewhat better known and better approved as well as milder remedy thinking as mr goreli declares he thinks of them some men in his place would have preferred giving warning mr goreli applies annihilation on this occasion as on all similar ones behold the same inexorable passion and the same course taken by it the elevation gained at the first opportunity the ladder by which it was gained is kicked down on this same occasion this is more explicitly confessed by other speakers excellent things those same societies while occupied in laying the foundation of our power deserving of annihilation the moment it is perceived that from the same useful and so lately necessary instrument that same power is exposed to feel a check take warning neapolitans take warning portuguese for warning you shall have and for your beacon you shall have the spanish cortes with mr goreli speaking the sense of it take warning—i know not whether to say spaniards—for alas for you i fear it is too late unless by favour of spanish dispatch some of the elements of the la isla army should still continue undissolved still the same division—the same most simple and commodious division—of human kind into two classes the good those by whom our purposes are served the bad those by whom they are thwarted and no sooner is it seen or thought that the good creatures who till this moment served our purposes thwart them than their essence is changed and they are become bad ones yes this is the division you may see made by legitimacy all the world over above all excellence beneath all depravity such is the arrangement—the systematical arrangement—of which despotism is the linnæus in the english statute book not a page in which it is not assumed and acted upon most excellent majesty o yes most excellent but most excellent in what and from majesty down to simple knighthood runs the scale of excellence spaniards would you wish to see the difference between a despotic government and an undespotic one you shall see it in few words it was not made for this purpose it was not made for a purpose it was made for all purposes be this as it may if it be admitted the account thus given of this difference the sort of government which by this law of his mr goreli has been endeavouring to establish—and i much fear has ere now established—is a despotic one yes notwithstanding everything that is to be found in your constitutional code a despotic one the letter of that code may be left to you and still the government may be a despotic government would it be agreeable to you moreover to have at hand a test by which the partisan of a despotic government and the partisan of an undespotic government or to use a more common phrase a lover and a hater of liberty may be distinguished such a test you shall see and if you approve of it occasions will not be wanting for making application of it time presses space is wanting the form i give it in must be as compressed as possible it will not be a substitute to thinking but an excitement be indulgent be expectant i cannot in so narrow a space do the argument anything like full justice spaniards behold then the distinction     between a government that is despotic and one that is not so in an undespotic government some eventual faculty of effectual resistance and consequent change in government is purposely left or rather given to the people not inconsistent with government—on the contrary indispensable to good government is the existence of this faculty not inconsistent for so experience as you will see proves next to nothing is the danger from the existence in comparison with that from the nonexistence of this faculty everywhere and at all times on the part of the subjectmany howsoever treated exists the disposition to obsequiousness birth observation of the direction taken by rewards and punishments by praise and dispraise of the habit and language of all around—by the concurrence of all these causes is the disposition produced and kept up to alter or weaken this disposition in such sort as to produce revolution in government or considerable mischief to person or property of individuals nothing ever has sufficed or ever can suffice short of the extremity of misrule upon this principle alone could or can the english revolution be justified upon this principle alone can the like change in spain be justified no such past change can be justified but by a principle by which the justification of all future change in like circumstances is already made of a government that is not despotic it is therefore the essential character even to cherish the disposition to eventual resistance on some other occasions you shall see—such of you as will honour my pages with a glance—how effectually and pointedly that indispensable element of security has been cherished cherished by the only government that stands upon a rock—the government of the angloamerican united states meantime see to this purpose—such if any of you as have in hand the means—the liberticide act of congress approved july         not forgetting the marginal note indicating the glorious expiration of it instruments necessary to the existence of such a disposition in a state adequate to the production of the effect are instruction excitation correspondence to the understanding applies instruction to the will excitation both are necessary to appropriate action and correspondent effect instruction and excitation in the case of each individual taken separately correspondence for the sake of concert amongst the number of individuals requisite and sufficient for the production of the ultimate effect coextensive with the instruction and excitation must be the correspondence and therefore as far as depends upon the government under the government if not a despotic one will be the facility allowed and afforded to correspondence when to a national purpose exertions on a national scale are necessary exertions made without concert need it be said are made without effect by instruction excitation and faculty of correspondence—by these three instruments in conjunction and not by any one or two of them alone—can the national mind be kept in a state of appropriate preparation—a state of preparation for eventual resistance it is by the conjunct application of all these instruments that minds are put and kept in a proper state of discipline as bodies are by the military exercise from this state of full and constant preparation result two perfectly distinct though so intimately connected uses—  effecting a change in government if ever and when necessary   in the meantime preventing or at least retarding the necessity by the constant application of a check to misrule as applied to individual cases—to misrule in all its several shapes necessary to instruction—to excitation—in a word to a state of preparation directed to this purpose—is who does not see it the perfectly unrestrained communication of ideas on every subject within the field of government the communication by vehicles of all sorts—by signs of all sorts signs to the ear—signs to the eye—by spoken language—by written including printed language—by the liberty of the tangue by the liberty of the writingdesk by the liberty of the postoffice—by the liberty of the press the characteristic then of an undespotic government—in a word of every government that has any tenable claim to the appellation of a good government—is the allowing and giving facility to this communication and this not only for instruction but for excitation—not only for instruction and excitation but also for correspondence and this again for the purpose of affording and keeping on foot every facility for eventual resistance—for resistance to government and thence should necessity require for a change in government in all this there is nothing new nothing that is new either in theory or in practice look around you my friends you will see it in theory and at the same time in correspondent practice in the angloamerican united states everybody sees it is in practice in that declaration of independence which stands at the head of their constitutional code anybody may see it plainly and openly avowed not that i wish to be understood as holding up as a pattern the logic of that document but at any rate there is thus much in it     of good politics after speaking of certain ends—meaning beyond dispute though not very appositely expressing the greatest happiness of the greatest number a phrase for which upwards of fifty years ago i became indebted to a pamphlet of dr priestleys it proceeds to say—whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and to institute a new government thus it is that in express terms and with the most direct and deliberative intention—thus it is that with discernment as well as magnanimity till then unexampled—that government—a government under which during the forty years that it has been in existence there has been more felicity—more undisturbed tranquillity than during the same period under any other that government let it never be out of your minds has with its eyes open and with its own hands laid the foundation of eventual resistance to itself even in england even in the records of the english parliament may be seen something of a show of it at the time of the revolution those who bore a part in that change saw their convenience in holding a sort of language from which the same conclusion was drawn namely that a state of things had at that time already taken place and was therefore capable of taking place—was then in contemplation and therefore might and ought to be upon occasion taken again into contemplation—in which it might be right that the people should take the government into their own hands an operation which of course could not be performed without resistance to the government then in existence the logic indeed was in this case still worse than in the american case for a falsehood was asserted and that a notorious one namely that the king had entered into a contract with the people whereas to the perfect knowledge of all who said he had he had never done any such thing that having entered into such contract he had broken it and that by so doing he had abdicated the government while as everybody knows he was clinging to it with all his might thus as may be seen in their journals said the house of commons and thus after kicking against the lie in vain said at length the house of lords the lie was the work of lawyers for without a lie in his mouth an english lawyer knows not how to open it but though being as it was an untruth the antecedent in this argument was unable to give any just support to its consequent or to anything else the consequent was in itself good and in that we have all that is to the present purpose so much for the difference or distinguishing criterion between a free government or to speak more clearly though less familiarly a nondespotic government and a despotic one now for the promised test by which when applied to a man it may be seen whether the government he means to give his support to is of the one sort or of the other put to him this question—will you sir or will you not concur in putting matters on such a footing in respect to the liberty of the press and the liberty of public discussion that at the hands of the persons exercising the powers of government a man shall have no more to fear from speaking and writing against them than from speaking and writing for them if his answer be yes the government he declares in favour of is an undespotic one if his answer be no the government he declares in favour of is a despotic one if yes his principles as to this matter are those of the angloamerican united states and as you will see if you have not seen already those of the spanish constitutional code if no they are those of— and of the emperor of morocco various are the modifications of which meetings for the purpose of political discussion are susceptible all of them are more or less contributory to both purposes at once—to instruction and to excitation but some of them are more particularly suitable to the one purpose others to the other some have more some less of the colour of dangerousness upon the face of them if at the expense of general utility particular anxieties were to be conceded to—if a door were in that case found necessary to be left open to compromise it night be worth while to bring to view the circumstances by which these several modes of communication stand distinguished it might be worth while to propose this or that succedaneum by which the anxieties might be calmed without quite so costly a sacrifice as the sacrifice of liberty on the altar of despotism but mr goreli is inexorable the principle he has displayed excludes all compromise whenever he sees either excitation or instruction there he sees an enemy meetings oh yes—in any number and everywhere meetings oh yes but on what terms on condition of their being everywhere under the yoke of a licence—on condition that is to say that on all occasions the instruction and the excitation shall be all on one side all on one side and that of course the side of the ruling few—the side which calls for passive obedience and nonresistance—the side in a word that stands in constant opposition to the only side on which it is in the nature of the case that they should be of any use—to the only purpose for which they are in demand not but that in all this mr goreli is perfectly consistent nothing can be more so     the government he has in view—the government the establishment of which is the object of these his endeavours is of the despotic species spaniards see whether i do him wrong—see whether the object of these his endeavours be not to exclude all possibility of change unless it be such as the people seeing it to be for the interest of their rulers and against theirs would if left at liberty manifest their disapprobation of—see whether it be not to exclude from misrule how consummate soever all means and thereby all possibility of correction—from misery how excruciating soever all possibility of relief not yet has he proposed the abolition of election meetings in their earliest stage—of those meetings of the subjectmany in all their number and to outward appearance in all their force no nor is any such change needful for the accomplishment of his purposes destitute of that necessary mental discipline which has just been brought to view—strangers to all instruction to all excitation to all political correspondence—meeting the electors will meet and act like puppets obsequious to this or that official showmans hand at the time of giving their votes the code itself inhibits all discussion and with it all instruction and excitation and now it is that mr goreli coming upon them with this law of his deprives men of all other opportunities of learning the mental exercise—that instrument of independence by which alone the man is distinguished from the puppet   th oct    0 letter iii on the liberty of public discussion in free meetings—continuation from letter ii spaniards i continue—the subject is of too great importance to be dismissed while the mass of documents with which it has furnished me remains in any part unexamined in my last you had some remarks of mine on the proposed law itself—the law regarding public societies as proposed to the cortes on the   st september by mr goreli in the name of the commission charged with that subject those remarks being followed by some others of mine on a speech of that same honourable gentleman which though delivered so long before as the  th of that same month exhibits the considerations which in the character of reasons had been employed by him to pave the way for the reception of this same proposed law on that same occason namely that of september  th i see exhibited for that same purpose reasons from two other public functionaries viz one of the kings seven ministers—the minister of the colonies so i see him styled and count toreno then and now a member of the cortes and since then president i begin with the minister of the colonies by this official name i find him designated and not by his proper name this mode of designation is a real relief to me it would have been no small one to have found mr goreli thus anonymous this relief is with great prudence provided for debaters by the tactics of the english parliament the sound of a mans name from the mouth of an antagonist whose utmost powers are at that moment put to the stretch in the endeavour to sink his reputation is a cause of irritation against which neither habit nor philosophy nor both together can sufficiently arm his patience next in order to the proposer of the proposed law to which at the end of seventeen days this debate gave rise—next in order in the debate to mr goreli but much more abundant as will be seen in length and detail comes the so happily unnamed minister of the colonies   he too is anxious—manifestly not less anxious than mr goreli—that every spaniard should enjoy full liberty yes but what sort of full liberty that sort of course which is or is to be founded on the law on the law good but on what law on that which we have seen already on the law which in embryo that representative of the people and this minister of the king bore each of them in his breast the law which i had to lay before you in my last the very proposed law by which as you have seen that same full liberty is proposed to be so fully destroyed   notwithstanding such anxiety the anxious gentleman could not admit the existence of political associations without dependence on the government and without responsibility of their members could not admit of this no that i will be bound for him he could not just as little as i myself could were i in his place but what is this to the purpose as much as if he said he could not admit of rape or robbery but his inability to admit of rape and robbery could not have afforded a passport to an insinuation which if produced in the shape of a direct assertion would have been seen to have been as completely groundless as it was false it would not have afforded a passport to the assertion no nor so much as a cover to the falsity of it what by meeting and talking together—let the subject of their talk be what it will in a room or out of a room in any number small or great—do a company of unarmed men become or it is possible they should fancy themselves to be independent   0 of the government under which they thus meet independent of that same government and exempt from being responsible to it any one of the societies in question on any charge of specific delinquency—would an officer of justice have found any greater difficulty in obtaining entrance into it than if the subject of their conversation had been confined to plays or bull feasts   the candour of this faithful servant of his majesty is truly admirable not less so than that of the representative of the people i know well he added says the report i know well that these associations owe their origin to a laudable object   and that to them continues the speech we owe the acquisition of the good we enjoy is it in the power of words to wind up candour to a higher pitch but my friends you have seen already what is at the bottom of it such being the grounds made for gratitude see in the next place the grounds made for annihilation in proof of gratitude   but the means it continues which have been employed to acquire it to acquire that same good far from being conducive to its preservation would be the great obstacle to its consolidation well here is assertion and assertion directly to the point this is the very thing which to afford a justifying reason for the proposed law required to be proved but the proof where is it go on a little further and you will see—if not a proof that which it has been gentlemens endeavour to cause you to accept for proof as to probable mischief in any determinate shape not any the slightest attempt is made to prove it instead of listening to a proof what he depends upon your doing is the taking the thing for granted without so much as an attempt at proof why no such attempt for a perfectly plain reason because success was in every eye impossible but if no such proof was brought by him and you will see whether there was any mind the logic of this his argument by these societies it is that all the good that has been done has been done till this moment by these same societies nothing but good has been done now for the conclusion—left as it is to be collected from the proposed law therefore says this conclusion by these same societies if suffered to subsist nothing will be done but what is bad—absolutely bad or at least when weighed against the good preponderately bad in future but he does not end here for now comes a tissue of irrelevancies in which in virtue of the confusion in which it promised to involve mens minds he evidently puts his trust mark well the suspicions which by means of it he seeks to infuse into them mark whether for any of these suspicions he has been able to make so much as the smallest ground   what comparison is there continues the speech—what comparison is there between individual liberty and that which may be arrogated to themselves by permanent juntas with peculiar constitutions secret sittings dignities offices and funds what comparison what means he by comparison what has it to do with the question who ever made any such comparison if there were any meaning to the word these are the questions by the answers to which it might be brought to light but meaning it has none if individual liberty must be spoken of that which the societies in question had been doing with it was the applying it to that constitutional purpose of the goodness of which his testimony has been so explicit does he think by this question—does he think to make you believe that by preventing you from meeting in societies with these good things in them no restraint upon your individual liberty will be imposed if not then by what else can any restraint be imposed upon it mistake me not my friends so far as to suppose me passing condemnation on a law as some have done on no other ground than that of its being a restraint upon individual liberty it is only by being such that laws can be laws putting aside these inanities in the production of which there is no saying in what degree the reporter and the translator may not have had their share—putting aside these debatable points let us take up the argument—it is this the societies in question have in themselves permanent juntas with peculiar constitutions secret sittings dignities offices and funds here we have the antecedent therefore says he they would if suffered to exist be the great obstacle to the consolidation    of the good we enjoy here we have the consequent here then we have so many elements of an unnamed something by the instrumentality of which the mischief to which he thus makes allusion would but for his remedy he would have you to think be produced to this unnamed and undescribed something by which such prodigious effects would have been produced i will under correction for the purpose of considering whether it be in the nature of the case that it should be composed of such elements any or all of them give the name of power political power if of itself the name of power be not sufficiently explicit i beg his pardon looking out for substantial political meaning i have overlooked that which is presented by grammatical rules true it is that for its indisputable proper     grammatical antecedent the relative pronounadjective that has the nounsubstantive liberty as modified by its nounadjective individual but it was by my too good opinion of his logic that my attention was then called off from his grammar what comparison is there between individual liberty says he—he means individual liberty at large—what comparison between it and that which may be arrogated c—what comparison my answer is that comparison which there is between a genus and a species of that same genus if by comparison he means relation—as i suppose he does if he means anything—taking this for his meaning his argument stands thus—in your opinion says he speaking to the cortes—in your opinion all restraints upon individual liberty are bad things and so they are in mine but it does not follow that a restraint upon this individual liberty which i am restraining is a bad thing for a restraint upon individual liberty in this shape is not a restraint upon individual liberty in any shape but putting aside nonsense and determined to have sense to argue with if possible i put aside individual liberty and return to the word power political power as to this matter—power and that pure from all responsibility and from all dependence on the government—this is what according to him these societies were thus arrogating to themselves the essence of this sophistry consists in a name—in the name given by him to the one first mentioned by him of these his pretended elements of independent and irresponsible power arrogated to themselves if you will believe him by these societies permanent juntas is the name he on this occasion gives to them for what purpose i answer as you many of you cannot but have answered already for the purpose of assuming as proved and causing you to regard as already proved the very thing which he was professing to prove and thus causing you to regard as proved that which neither by him had been nor by anybody else could be proved in your constitutional language junta is a name given to societies by which power is really exercised junta is a name which i have observed given to societies by which for a time even the supreme power in the state has been exercised in the ambiguity of this appellative—in the misrepresentation conveyed by the use here made of it—consists the sophism in which the main strength of his argument lies this irrelevant sense set aside—what in its original sense means junta a set of men who for any purpose whatsoever are joined together this is its generical and widest sense but by omission or abridgment it has come to be used moreover in a limited sense—in that limited sense in which it designates a set of men joined together for the purpose of exercising power in this one word then behold here the whole strength of his argument—of this argument which he thus insinuated—and for the absurdity of which he seeks a cover in the use he makes of this ambiguous word the persons in question are joined together therefore they are joined together for the exercise of power and that power as he had before insinuated independent and irresponsible still there remains the word permanent if by constituting themselves juntas the societies in question did not constitute themselves juntas arrogating to themselves power independent of government and irresponsible let us see whether they did so by constituting themselves permanent juntas a junta which after meeting once has not met a second time has not been a permanent junta but a junta which after meeting once has met a second time has been a permanent junta this indeed has been but a small degree of permanence it has been even the very smallest degree but still it has been permanence and whether by the smallest degree of permanence having place in a junta which at its first meeting arrogated to itself no power any power is arrogated any one may be left to judge and so if instead of two meetings it has had two thousand as to peculiar constitution funds and offices to say of these societies that they had these things is nothing more than to say that they were societies   peculiar constitution—if the society have an object be that object ever so perfectly innoxious some mark or other must the society have to express the object and to distinguish the members of the society from the same number of men taken at random as they pass along the street as also from other societies whatever these may be having this every society must on pain of not being a society have a peculiar constitution here then the right honourable gentleman sees that element of independent power which he calls peculiar constitution   funds—if in the society a memorandum is to be made of anything that has passed—it follows that for making the memorandum there must be pen ink and paper or something equivalent but neither pen nor ink nor paper are to be had for nothing here then the right honourable gentleman sees the element of independent power called funds   offices—collectors treasurers receivers secretarys presidents—if to obtain the purchasemoney for the pen ink and     paper a quarto from each member be requisite and the quartos are not all paid at the same moment here must be a collector if there be any person by whom the money when collected is kept till it is employed in the purchase here we have a treasurer if there be any person who receives it or any part of it on its way from the collector to the treasurer here we have a receiver if there be any person whose more particular business it is to make use of the pen and ink and paper for taking the memorandums or for any other purpose here we have a secretary if there be any person whose more particular business it is to prevent disorder in the conversation here we have a president if neither these nor any other denominations are employed the functions are not the less exercised here and in most formidable abundance the right honourable gentleman sees the element of independent power called offices   dignities—what the dignities may have been which the right honourable minister had in view i cannot pretend to say in the four preceding articles i have indicated so many ingredients necessary to the composition of every society for public discussion be the topic what it may on pain of its not being a society of dignities this is more than i can pretend to say without the help of a distinction if and in so far as the office be it what it may is regarded as a mark of illustration causing the owner of it as such to be regarded with more respect than if he were not so—on this supposition indeed so many offices so many dignities all this while true it is for aught i can pretend to say in this or that society there may have been this or that individual bearing or not bearing an office—there may have been one or even more by whom at the desire of the rest this or that mark of illustration has been possessed but with regard to the present purpose by any such mark of illustration how is the case varied if by the possession of it so it were that a man possessed anything that could be called power the persons over whom and in relation to whom it was exercised would be the members of the society but even over them how is it that by the bare possession of this dignity whatever it be anything that can be called power is or can be exercised it cannot then give power even when applied to them how much further then must it not be from giving any such thing when applied to anybody else here however may be seen all that the right honourable gentleman has for his element of independent power called dignities   secret sittings—as little do i know—and i care almost as little as i know—whether in the instance of any one of the societies by which such alarms were produced in so many right honourable breasts there were any sittings that could with propriety be called secret here however a distinction requires to be made not a little depends on the circumstance of time—relative time secresy imports fear it is even conclusive evidence of it where the secresy has for its accompaniment a design whether good or bad it at any rate imports fear of miscarriage supposing that known which is endeavoured to be kept secret now then if it was only while the society in question was engaged in the pursuit of the object which he had in view when he was honouring it with the epithet of laudable it was while they were engaged in the endeavour to free him as well as themselves from the yoke of that oppressive power to which that milder power in the exercise of which he is bearing a part and which he is making this use of has succeeded on this supposition the secresy had for its cause fear of oppression fear of being oppressed by the hands which were at the same time inspiring him with the same fear on the other hand if the time was no other than that during which the power was wielded by him and those with whom he acts the fear had for its object oppression by the hand of himself and colleagues if then during this latter period any such secresy in the sitting of any society for political discussion had place the secresy having necessarily fear for its cause—this being supposed if i were to learn that of that fear he had been the object and his conduct the source—if i were to learn this—judging him from all i know of him which is this speech and the proposed law in the support of which it was employed—my wonder i must confess would not be great on the one supposition he inflicts punishment for benefits received by him on the other supposition he first makes the crime and then punishes it be this as it may—supposing him really alarmed and the secresy and nothing but the secresy the object of his alarm the way to quiet it was to put an end to the secresy but his object was not the putting an end to the secret sittings of the societies but the putting an end to the societies themselves and this his proposed law but too sufficiently proves his object was the putting an end to all societies in which any such individual liberty should be exercised as that of representing his measures and designs in any such light as that in which they have presented themselves to the eyes of an impartial observer viewing them at this distance for of everything of that sort the tendency how faint soever—the tendency if it has any is to oppose an obstacle to what he calls     the consolidation of the good of which he and his colleagues are in the enjoyment—the good of which by the means that you have here a sample of they are thus labouring for the increase all these criticisms some will be forward enough to say—all these criticisms are minute and trifling criticisms on logic criticisms on grammar mere criticisms upon words yes considered merely in themselves and without regard to the result indicated they are as trifling as you please but if the result be regarded few things can be further from being trifling for the result indicated—is it not that the functionaries in question had for their object the substitution of a despotic government to the indespotic government of which your constitutional code affords so wellgrounded a promise—that they were not themselves in an error but occupied in the endeavours to deceive their colleagues and to deceive you—and that in this design it was that they wove and employed this web of sophistry which otherwise than by such verbal criticisms the nature of the case did not allow to be unravelled gratified my friends—most sincerely gratified should i be to find these my remarks as groundless as in my present view of it that conduct is to which you have been seeing them thus sincerely and anxiously howsoever mistakenly applying themselves my friends i have not yet quite done with this proposed law and its supporters the messenger presses but even already i can venture to propose two subjects for your consideration—whether under a government professing not to be despotic a law more mischievous in its complexion as well as tendency was ever proposed and whether any law could be proposed on grounds more consummately frivolous looking for the authority of example to supply the deficiency of reason the right honourable gentleman gives you an account of england a more complete misrepresentation has not been often given this i hope to show you in my next   th oct    0 letter iv on the liberty of public discussion in free meetings—continuation of the subject from letter iii spaniards i continue and i hope conclude—in my last on this subject i left unexamined so much of the speech of the minister of the colonies as regards england this together with the speech that bears the respected name of the conde de toreno— in representative governments adds the minister of the colonies—england for instance there are also societies but they meet for one determined object and when that is finished they are dissolved but permanent societies are unknown unless authorized by the law and when they have this character the government will be the first to support them   in representative governments says he—england for instance but why take england for his instance spaniards i will tell you because if it be the object of a minister to put or keep in the condition of a despotic one the government of which he forms a part england with its government is the country which at this moment will in a more particular manner suit his purpose oh yes it will give him a model and as complete and serviceable a one as if he himself had the making of it england a representative government indeed oh yes that it is but a representive of what of the people no but of the monarch and of the house of lords for in this government divided as the supreme power of it is into three branches—the concurrence of which is necessary indeed but at the same time sufficient for every considerable permanent measure—the monarch alone has one branch the lords house another the commons house the third this being the state of things if by the representative government he means a government containing in it a branch in which the people are represented—in the english government there is no such branch for in that lastmentioned house little less than a majority of those who have a right to sit in it are seated either by the monarch or by some member of the house of lords—one lord for example seats nine members and an overwhelming majority is composed of men seated by individuals whose particular interest completely identified as it is with the joint sinister interest of the monarch and the lords is decidedly and inexorably hostile to the interest of the great body of the people thus it is as to those who have a right to sit but as to those who on the several occasions actually sit the disproportion is always much greater for even of the few who might be honest if they were not idle the greater part are on each occasion kept from being honest by their idleness nor when they do sit do they sit any of them but in the atmosphere of a corruptive influence by which their particular interest is identified with the particular and sinister interest of the monarch and the lords yes and that still more effectually than if they had merely been seated by them all with scarce one exception being in the condition of men with bribes in their hands given them by the monarch and     capable of being taken back by him at pleasure or else upon the lookout for such bribes this state of things is just as notorious as the existence of the two houses themselves nor does any one even of those most interested in denying it so much as attempt to deny it for what purpose should be the books in which the facts are manifested—manifested in names numbers and proportions—being in everybodys hands in favour of it all that is ever said is contained in this—so it has been and is therefore so it ought to be all this while what i cannot but confess is—that in law fiction—that is in liars language—the government is a government representative of the people and english lawyers fiction to which the character of lying belongs or it does not belong to anything is the acknowledged foundation of everything with us that is called law in the language of lies the government then does continue a body representative of the people and as the state of the case is scarce ever brought to view but by the misrepresentation made of it by this lie and the vast majority of those who have faculty and leisure to make the distinction on such a subject between lies and truths are paid for giving currency to this and other such lies and for pretending to take them for truths for scarce ever does a judge pronounce a decision and never does a man go to church without some notorious lie in his mouth—thus it is that the right honourable minister of ultramaria had really a colourable pretence for giving on this occasion the government of england as an instance of a representative government if as is the case if i misrecollect not in the government of the netherlands in regard to all the representatives—if i say in england the monarch openly and in a direct form did nominate fivesixths of the house of commons—even thus if he left the remaining sixth to be elected by the people so it were upon your principles of universality secresy of suffrage practical equality and bienniality this would be no small improvement and i would gladly vote for it for in this case the habit of knowingly uttering and knowingly receiving lies as truths would thus far be narrowed and dishonest men could no longer join in assuring honest ones that the government is a government representative of the people as in so shameless a manner they do now even if the monarch did by the members of the house of commons as he does by the bishops—even if after having appointed a junta for the purpose he sent them a licence to elect whom they pleased and along with it the name of a man whom on pain that should follow they were to elect this even this would be an improvement for nowhere exists there any such impudence as to pretend to believe that in this case it is by any such junta that the priest is put into a palace and made a lord of that it is by the members of any such junta that he was thus made or in short by anybody but the monarch by whom they were made the government would thus be more universally seen than at present to be what it is—a government uniformly determined by a particular and thence sinister interest—an interest opposite to the interest of the people and to which the interest of the people is thus necessarily and on every occasion sacrificed in representative government indeed no my friends if it had been a government really representative that it had been his interest to direct you to an instance of he know well enough where to find one he would have directed you to those rulers by whose longsuffering and regard for the interests of their fellowcitizens not to speak of yours you have for so many years been saved from the additional miseries of an additional war to a government in which the interests of the ruling few and the subjectmany are so nearly identified that were it not for slaveholding—the monster they are actually employed in combating and the deceit put upon the people by their lawyers with the english commonlaw and its lying fictions in their mouths misrule in any shape would be a thing utterly unexperienced and in what state the societies in question are under that government i have already had occasion to inform or remind you in the first of these my letters but since the english is the government for the practice of which he has actually referred you as affording an authority for his support in the course taken by him in the proposing of such a law—follow him my friends to england and see how far his account of the state of the law in that country quadrates with the truth in england says he there are also societies but they meet for one determined object and when that is finished they are dissolved my friends look twice at this assertion and then see whether it even stands in need of any external evidence to convince you of the incorrectness of it in england there exist not any societies—any societies whatever existing for any purpose whatsoever—political or nonpolitical for thus allcomprehensive and unrestricted is the assertion that have any more than that degree of permanence if permanence it can be called consider whether in the nature of things this can be true but lest that should not be sufficient—lest the assertion should not yet be broad enough     he goes on and says—but permanent societies are unknown unless authorized by the law unknown then in england if he is to be believed—not only unexisting but unknown—are all permanent societies those included that have any beyond the smallest possible degree of permanence permanent societies unknown in england even had he so far narrowed his assertion as to make it applicable to the purpose—even had he said permanent societies occupied in political discussions are unknown in england—as well might he have said—sunshine is unknown in england to render intelligible the relation between the truth of the case and the right honourable ministers account of it i must beg your notice my friends for a distinction which he knew better it should seem than to bring to view this is—the distinction between the state of the government in question antecedently to the enactment of certain recent laws and the state into which it has been put by means of them applied to the recent state you will find his account possessing in part a colour of truth applied to the anterior state you will find it wholly destitute of all colour of truth in doing this i must begin with giving a determinate import to a phrase of his—authorized by law speaking of england permanent societies he says are unknown unless authorized by law now by authorized by law what he means is—existing no otherwise than under a licence which the law necessitates that is to use the words of his proposed law under the permission of the local authority for as to the being authorized by law—meaning real and not imaginary ex post facto law—everything is left authorized by law until it stands prohibited this being the case to constitute what he means by authorized by the law requires in the first place a prohibition—a general prohibition and upon the back of that a special permission exempting out of that general prohibition the special objects to which the permission applies this explained england being the country in question how stands the fact before the year      the things unknown were—not the unlicensed permanent societies which he says were unknown but the licensed ones which his endeavour is—to make you regard as being coeval with the constitution for till march   st in that year licences for meeting to talk politics in public were no more known in england than licences for meeting together to dine and whether by ceasing to be permitted societies such as those in question can in three and a half years cease to be known—of this my friends you will judge thus much as to the being unknown now as to the being in existence even as to this point the fact does not bear him out in his assertion regard being had to the breadth he has given to it permanent societies being here in question and not ephemeral ones they forming the subject of another mode of regulation the prohibition of permanent societies without licence is confined to places used for the purpose of delivering lectures or of holding debates thus stands english law while according to his account of it the prohibition of meeting without licence extends to all permanent societies without exception bad as it is—bad enough for the establishment of finished despotism—the english liberticide innovation thus introduced into the english government by the professed abhorrers of all innovation is not yet bad enough for his purpose to raise it up to his purpose you see how he gives to it an extent that does not belong to it in the breasts of the organizers of this english despotism there was a something that put a restraint upon it as to time in the first seditious meetings act as above—the earliest commencement of the act being the   st of march     —the duration of it was not longer than till the   th of july      not so much as    months in the second seditious meetings act the other being expired the earliest commencement being the   th of december      the duration of it was not made longer than five years from that time five years with no other addition than that of an indeterminate fraction extending however no longer than to the end of the then next session of parliament this for the present satisfied english despotism but this minister of your king nothing less than an eternity of such despotism would satisfy him or at least his supporter in the cortes mr goreli and when they have this character concludes this speech the government will be the first to support them namely permanent societies without exception this character namely the character of being in the language of english law licensed—in the language of the proposed spanish law in possession of a permission from the local authority my friends in this clause short as it is i see three erroneous notions presented for acceptance one is that societies of the sort in question are capable of standing in need of support in some shape or other from government another is that government has it in its power to render service in some shape or     other to the public by means of support given in some shape or other to these societies a third is that in some shape or other support meaning special support may be capable of being given by government to the sort of societies in question without being pernicious   first as to the need of support antecedently to any licence they have for their support the natural original unrestricted individual liberty the members as such have no need of any other as men they have indeed need of but of course have that protection whatever it be which the law affords to all other men this is support but not special support invade this liberty—narrow it by a prohibition—you thus indeed create in them the need of the permission whatever it be with which you will vouchsafe to narrow the prohibition but when you have done this for them you have done all they have need of unless it be the easing them of the prohibition of which by the supposition you will not ease them do this you have thus far replaced them in that original situation in which as above no support was either needful to them or of use   secondly as to governments having it in its power to render any service to the public at large by means of special support given in any shape to these societies   thirdly as to the disservice which government would do to the public at large by means of and in proportion to support given in any shape to these societies for these two points one consideration may suffice by support in any shape no service i say could government render to the public at large of support given to them in any shape the effects if any with reference to the public at large could not i say fail of being pernicious for according to the value of the support the effect would be to diminish whatever service they might be capable of rendering to the public if they were let alone such is my notion of the matter the following are the grounds of it— all the service capable of being rendered to the public by these instruments is as above observed comprised in the two words instruction and excitation—the excitation being no otherwise serviceable than as the instruction is so too but of the matter of instruction what is it the dissemination of which by any such means is or can be of a nature serviceable to the public this too has been already mentioned indication of what is amiss either in the texture of the government or in the conduct of those to whom the exercise of it powers belongs this and nothing else what nothing else says somebody—by the indication of what is right in both places is no service rendered to the public i answer no none that can be rendered by these societies over and above what would be sufficiently rendered without them whatsoever there is right in either place there are always men in abundance to hold up to view mankind must change its nature ere anything that is said in commendation either of government or of rulers can fail to be generally acceptable to the aggregate composed of those same rulers but without need of being expressly offered a mass of reward composed of all the good things that are at the disposal of government is by every man seen stationed over his head ready to drop in appropriate and adequate morsels into the mouth of every man who will be at the pains of earning it by signalizing himself in the defence of everything or anything and every person or any person he sees established of these ready defenders there never can be a deficiency supposing no such societies in existence of these same defenders as little can there be a deficiency supposing any number of these societies in existence thus it is that even without the advantage given them by the restraint imposed upon their adversaries by the licence and the fear of forfeiting it things and persons that are established are by the mere circumstance of being established put into possession of an undue advantage an advantage which the nature of their situation secures to them how opposite soever their character may be to what it should be as to everything that happens to be wrong in those same high places for the indication of it there is no such reward while for defence of it there is as we have seen in prospect and expectancy at least an infinity of reward thus stands the matter even without the licence as if that were not enough comes the licence and in endeavour at least not only leaves the evidence on one side of the cause without motives for bringing it forward but by an artificial door thus shut against it superadds the forcible exclusion of it such is the system of procedure according to which at the bar of the public its functionaries while their adversaries are under the yoke of a licence are tried government concludes the speech will be the first to support them—these same societies under this phrase lurks yet another fallacy as yet unexposed namely that even when the societies are thus licensed thus corrupted thus depraved thus filled with the defenders to the exclusion of the indicators of abuse government will be at the pains of taking any such active measures for their support of all such active     measures it has just been seen that they are altogether needless there upon a shelf just over their heads in goodly order—there in mens imagination stand the rewards—there without any need of special invitation hands enough will be ready enough to grasp them all this while that which in speaking of the corruptive influence of licences in this case is here said should it must be confessed be understood as applying more perfectly to what it is in the conception of those by whom the yoke is imposed than of the actual effect on those on whom it is imposed what is scarcely possible is that by the repressive influence of the licence every manifestation of disapprobation towards the conduct of those by whom the yoke is imposed should in every shape be prevented by degrees a sort of language will come into use a language that will be sufficiently understood for any such purpose as that of giving expression to complaint and indignation yet will not be sufficiently understood for any such purpose as that of affording a tenable ground for the infliction of punishment yes in every apartment defiled by this liberticide yoke the instrument of thraldom the parchment or paper on which it is written should be hung up on high—hung up in some spot universally conspicuous with an appropriate accompaniment for pointing mens attention to it by a single glance directed to this instrument of tyranny eulogy might thus be converted into satire—satire which be it what it may can never be too severe         an essay on political tactics or inquiries concerning the discipline and mode of proceeding proper to be observed in political assemblies principally applied to the practice of the british parliament and to the constitution and situation of the national assembly of france  00  0  essay on political tactics chapter i general considerations §   general view of the subject the word tactics derived from the greek and rendered familiar by its application to one branch of the military art signifies in general the art of setting in order it may serve to designate the art of conducting the operations of a political body as well as the art of directing the evolutions of an army order supposes an end the tactics of political assemblies form the science therefore which teaches how to guide them to the end of their institution by means of the order to be observed in their proceedings in this branch of government as in many others the end is so to speak of a negative character the object is to avoid the inconveniences to prevent the difficulties which must result from a large assembly of men being called to deliberate in common the art of the legislator is limited to the prevention of everything which might prevent the development of their liberty and their intelligence the good or evil which an assembly may do depends upon two general causes—the most palpable and the most powerful is its composition the other is its method of acting the latter of these two causes alone belongs to our subject the composition of the assembly—the number and the quality of its members—the mode of its election—its relation to the citizens or to the government—these things all belong to its political constitution upon this great object i shall confine myself to observing that the composition of a legislative assembly will be the better in proportion with the greater number of the points of its contact with the nation that is to say in proportion as its interest is similar to that of the community† in a treatise on tactics an assembly is supposed to be formed and the subject under consideration is only the manner in which its operations ought to be conducted  0  but there are points with respect to which it may be a question whether they belong to constitutional law or to tactics for example whether all the members should have the same rights or whether these rights should be divided among them so that some should have that of proposing—others that of deciding upon a proposition already made some that of deliberating without voting—others that of voting without deliberating whether their deliberations ought to be public whether absence ought to be permitted—and in case of absence whether the rights of an individual ought to be transmissible to another whether the assembly ought always to remain entire or whether it ought to be obliged or authorized to subdivide itself i shall consider these questions as part of my subject because it appears to me that their examination is intimately connected with that of the best rules to be followed in deliberation—it not being possible to treat well of the latter without referring to the others §   ends that ought to be kept in view in a code of regulations relative to this head the tactics of deliberative assemblies as well as every other branch of the science of government ought to have reference to the greatest happiness of society this is the general end but its particular object is to obviate the inconveniences to which a political assembly is exposed in the exercise of its functions each rule of this tactics can therefore have no justifying reason except in the prevention of an evil it is therefore with a distinct knowledge of these evils that we should proceed in search of remedies these inconveniences may be arranged under the ten following heads—   inaction   useless decision   indecision   delays   surprise or precipitation   fluctuations in measures   quarrels   falsehoods   decisions vicious on account of form  0 decisions vicious in respect of their foundation we shall develope these different heads in a few words—   inaction—this supposes that there are points which demand a decision and which do not receive it because the assembly is unemployed the want of activity may arise from many causes for example if there be not sufficient motives to overcome natural indolence—if there be no preestablished arrangement for beginning business—if the assembly can only act upon propositions presented to it by the executive power it may also remain inactive as was often the case with the ancient statesgeneral of france because there are preliminaries upon which it is not agreed questions of etiquette or precedence disputes concerning priority in the objects to be discussed c   useless decision—this is an evil not only on account of the loss of time but also because every useless decision by augmenting the mass of the laws renders the whole more obscure and more difficult to be retained and comprehended   indecision†—is the measure proposed a bad one indecision is not only an evil from the time lost but it allows a state of dread to subsist in the public mind—the dread lest this measure should at last be adopted is the measure proposed a good one the evil which it would have caused to cease is prolonged and the enjoyment of the good it would produce is retarded so long as the indecision subsists   delays—this head may sometimes be confounded with the preceding but at other times it differs from it there may be occasion of complaining of indecision when there is no delay as if after a single sitting nothing is done there may be ground for complaining of delay in cases in which a decision has been formed in matters of legislation indecision corresponds to denial of justice in affairs of justice superfluous delays in the deliberations correspond with useless delays in procedure under the head of delays may be ranked all vague and useless procedures—preliminaries which do not tend to a decision—questions badly propounded or presented in a bad order—personal quarrels—witty speeches and amusements suited to the amphitheatre or the playhouse   surprises or precipitations—surprises consist in precipitating a decision either by taking advantage of the absence of many of the members or by not allowing to the assembly either the time or the means of enlightening itself the evil of precipitation lies in the danger lest it should be a cover for a surprise or should give a suspicious character to a decision otherwise salutary   fluctuation in measures—this inconvenience might be referred to the head of delays and lost time but the evil which results is much greater fluctuations tend to diminish the confidence in the wisdom of the assembly and in the duration of the measures it adopts   quarrels—the time lost in these is the  0  least evil animosities and personalities in political assemblies produce dispositions most opposite to the search after truth and have even too much tendency to the formation of those violent parties which beget civil wars the histories of rome and poland furnish numerous examples but war is an assemblage of the most destructive acts and the evil of civil war is never less than double that of a foreign war but before reaching this fatal term the auimosities of political assemblies substitute objects altogether foreign from those which ought to occupy them a thousand incidents which daily arise lead them to neglect what ought to be attended to all who take any share in the assembly are in a state of suffering and agitation an excessive distrust deceives more than an extreme credulity the most certain result is loss of honour—disgrace for one of the parties engaged in the quarrel and often for both   falsehoods—i place under this general head all acts opposed to the most perfect truth in the procedures of a political assembly honesty ought to be its animating principle this maxim will not be contested even by those who are least observant of it but those who are most enlightened upon the public interest will the most strongly feel its justice and importance   decisions vicious on account of form—in french practice the resolutions of the chamber are reduced into form after the sitting of the assembly hence the resolutions as entered upon the journals may err in form though not in substance that is they may not entirely or not clearly express the intention of the legislature they err by excess when they contain anything superfluous they err by defect when they do not express all that is necessary they are obscure when they present a confused mixture of ideas they are ambiguous when they offer two or more meanings in such sort that different individuals may find in them grounds for opposing decisions  0 decisions vicious in their foundation—decisions opposed to what ought to be in order to promote the welfare of the society all the inconveniences before enumerated resolve themselves into this by lines more or less direct when an assembly forms an improper or hurtful decision it may be supposed that this decision incorrectly represents its wishes if the assembly be composed as it ought to be its wish will be conformed to the decision of public utility and when it wanders from this it will be from one or other of the following causes—   absence—the general wish of the assembly is the wish of the majority of the total number of its members but the greater the number of the members who have not been present at its formation the more doubtful is it whether the wish which is announced as general be really so   want of freedom—if any restraint have been exercised over the votes they may not be conformable to the internal wishes of those who have given them   seduction—if attractive means have been employed to act upon the wills of the members it may be that the wish announced may not be conformable to their conscientious wish   error—if they have not possessed the means of informing themselves—if false statements have been presented to them—their understandings may be deceived and the wish which has been expressed may not be that which they would have formed had they been better informed such then are the inconveniences to which a political assembly may be exposed from the commencement to the termination of its labours and its system of tactics will the more nearly approach perfection the more completely it tends to prevent them or to minimize or reduce them to their lowest term every article of its rules ought therefore to have for its object the obviating either one or more of these inconveniences but beside the particular advantage which ought to result from each rule taken separately a good system of tactics will present a general advantage which depends upon it as a whole the more nearly it approaches perfection the more completely will it facilitate to all the cooperators the exercise of their intelligence and the enjoyment of their liberty it is by this means that they will accomplish all that is in their power instead of embarrassing each other by their number they will yield mutual assistance they will be able to act without confusion and they will advance with a regular progression towards a determinate object every cause of disorder is a source of profit to undue influence and prepares in the long run for the approach of tyranny or anarchy are its forms vicious the assembly is cramped in its action always either too slow or too rapid lingering among preliminaries precipitate in reaching results it will become necessary that one portion of its members submit to exist in a state of nullity and renounce the independence of their opinions from that time strictly speaking it is no longer a political body—all its deliberations will be prepared in secret by a small number of individuals who will become so much the more dangerous because acting in the name of the assembly they will have no responsibility to fear  0  tabula ataxiologica or synoptical table giving an analytical sketch of the several heads of inconvenience corresponding to the several ends proper to be kept in view in framing a system of tactics for the use of a political assembly the ends proper to be kept in view in framing a system of tactics for the use of a political assembly correspond to the several inconveniences to which the proceedings of such assemblies are liable to give birth which are  incident to the business of the assembly being  of the  st order  and those  of a positive nature consisting in the existence of some improper decision—the impropriety being considered with reference to  the substance and being    absolute    comparative     negative     presumptive through absence of members    — through want of information    — through want of liberty     in the way of falsehood   the words  and existing    in the way of defect     — excess   0 — excess and defect together     by reason of ambiguity     — obscurity of a negative nature consisting in the want of some proper decision

nb—this table may be made to serve as a test of the propriety of all manner of rules and other institutions proposed or proposable for the regulation of proceedings in a political assembly every legitimate reason given in operating in favour of any such rule or institution consists in the allegation of its tendency to prevent the taking place of some one or more of the inconveniences therein exhibited every legitimate reason given as operating in disfavour of any such rule or institution consists in the allegation of its tendency to give birth to some one or more of those inconveniences   of the  st order viz inconveniences which are so in themselves   comparative viz the decision in question being compared with some other the formation of which has been prevented by it   negative viz the decision being of no use   want of liberty want of liberty may here be considered as capable of resulting not only from physical force or fear but from the action of any principle of seduction of the alluring class bribery for instance   falsehood viz where along with or instead of some declaration of will which is the proper and principal business of a political assembly the decision in question is such as conveys some false allegation relative to a matter of fact   the words in all motions in amendment the decision originally proposed is considered as chargeable with impropriety in this point of view   defect viz by reason of the want of certain words   inaction viz not meeting or meeting without motion or debate  0 indecision viz motion or debate without decision    action without an object instance debate or conversation without motion previous or consequential   of the  d order viz inconveniences which are so only in virtue of their tendency to give birth to some inconvenience or inconveniences of the  st order    fluctuation i e the successive formation of opposite decisions of which circumstances remaining unaltered one or more must accordingly have been improper    impropriety of behaviour for the several possible varieties of improper behaviour see the analysis of the several possible modifications of delinquency given in the principles of morals and legislation vol i p    ch xviii division of offences any instance of such misbehaviour in as far as its tendency is to give birth to absence of members want of information want of liberty inaction delay indecision precipitation surprise or fluctuation may be regarded in this respect as an inconvenience of the third order for those inconveniences considered in themselves are but inconveniences of the second order of all the inconveniences to which the nature of such an assembly is capable of giving birth those excepted which are merely collateral to the business of it the only radical ones are the formation of some bad decision or the nonformation of some good one suppose all the requisite good decisions formed and no bad ones all the other incidents marked as attended with inconvenience would either cease to exist or cease to be attended with that effect most of the above causes of inconvenience possess over and above their particular tendencies a sort of common tendency to produce an inconvenience of a more remote and general nature viz the bringing a degree of discredit on the proceedings and general character of the assembly acts of this tendency may be considered as so many offences against the reputation of the assembly want of liberty decisions chargeable with falsehood and frequent misbehaviour on the part of the members may be particularly noted in this view what life is to an individual reputation is to a political assembly an offence against the reputation of such an assembly committed by the assembly itself is a sort of approach to suicide  0  §   of political bodies in general the figurative expression of a bodypolitic has produced a great number of false and extravagant ideas an analogy founded solely on this metaphor has furnished a foundation for pretended arguments and poetry has invaded the dominion of reason an assembly or collection of individuals inasmuch as they are found united together in order to perform a common act forms what may in certain respects be called a body but a body does not necessarily imply an assembly since many individuals may declare their concurrence in the same act without having assembled for example by signing the same writing nothing is more common in england than petitions to parliament by hundreds and thousands of individuals who have separately signed them without having formed any assembly a certain body has a permanent existence a certain other may have only an occasional or so to speak an ephemeral existence as an english jury a certain body may have an unlimited extent as to number a certain other may be be circumscribed within a fixed number a certain body may be privileged a certain other not a privileged body is one of which the members acting together under certain regulations have received certain rights which the other citizens do not possess by bodiespolitic we generally understand privileged bodies which have under this name an existence more or less permanent they are often perpetual and of a limited number a certain body is simple another is compound the british parliament is a compound body which is formed of two distinct assemblies and of the supreme head of the state it may be easily conceived that from the rest of a great body already formed it is possible momentarily to detach a less numerous body this is what is called a committee that which constitutes a political body is the concurrence of many members in the same act it is therefore clear that the act of an assembly can only be a declarative act—an act announcing an opinion or a will every act of an assembly must begin by being that of a single individual but every declarative act the expression of an opinion or of a will beginning by being that of an individual may finish by being that of a body this says titius is what passes in my mind this is precisely what has passed in mine may sempronious equally say it is therefore the power of agreeing in the same intellectual act which constitutes the principle of unity in a body §   of permanent bodies a permanent political body is a collection of individuals designed to produce a train of actions relative to the object of their institution these actions will be those of all if they are unanimous but as it is impossible that there should exist a perfect and constant identity of sentiment in a great assembly of individuals it is generally the practice to give the same force to the act of the majority as to that of the total number the impossibility of an universal and constant concurrence of sentiments in an assembly is demonstrated by the experience of all times and places a government in which the legislative body should be subject to the law of unanimity is an extravagance so palpable that without the example of poland it would scarcely have been possible to believe that it had ever entered into the human mind whilst the example of poland equally shows that it such a law were made it could not be observed and that in the case in which it should be observed it would only produce the most frightful anarchy when we consider the decision of a political body what appears desirable in the first place is to obtain the unanimous wish of its members what is desirable in the second place is the will which most nearly approaches it this leads us to be contented with the will of the simple majority since how far soever this may be from the really universal will it is nearer to it than the contrary will are the numbers found equal on each side there results from it no general act—one will destroying the other no conclusion is arrived at—things will remain as they were unless there be a necessity for giving a predominant voice to some person  0  i have not as yet spoken of the case of absence which continually changes the identity of the assembly what shall be said of a will which is not declared it does not belong either to one side or the other it cannot be counted in the composition of the general will to annul the will of the assembly on account of absentees would be to give to the wills of the absentees the same effect as if they had been declared for the party of the minority which by the supposition has not been done in the calculation of suffrages the true value of an absent will to speak mathematically is one less one that is equal to zero to give to it the value of plus one or minus one would be equally a false calculation but is it always necessary to have a decision no without doubt there are many cases in which it would be too dangerous to permit a small portion of the assembly to act alone it is better not to have any decision than to have one which does not unite a certain proportion of the suffrages of the whole body the number necessary for rendering any act of the assembly legal should be fixed beforehand this important question is only mentioned here—it will be discussed separately hereafter it is enough to remark here that the ordinary formula—such has been the decision of the assembly—announces some very different facts with an assembly of which the numerical composition continually varies the only identity which exists is the legal effect of its decisions this is too metaphysical it may be said but it may be replied it is necessary since it is wished to explain the nature of a political body without having recourse to figurative language this expression has served as a pretext for allegories without end which themselves have become the foundation of a multitude of puerile reasonings the imaginations of writers have been stretched to give to political bodies the properties of different kinds of bodies sometimes they are mechanical bodies and then it is a question of levers and springs—of wheelwork—of shocks—of friction—of balancing—of preponderance sometimes they are animated bodies—and then they have borrowed all the language of physiology—they speak of health—of sickness—of vigour—of imbecility—of corrupton—of dissolution—of sleep—of death and resurrection i cannot tell how many political works would be annihilated if this poetical jargon were abstracted from them with which their authors have thought to create ideas when they have only combined words it is true that for purposes of abbreviation it is lawful to borrow certain traits of figurative language and that one is even obliged so to do since intellectual ideas can only be expressed by sensible images but in this case there are two precautions to be observed the one never to lose sight of simple and rigorous truth—that is to say to be always ready mentally to translate the figurative into simple language the other not to found any conclusion upon a figurative expression so far as it has anything incorrect in it—that is to say when it does not agree with the real facts figurative language is very useful for facilitating conception when it follows in the train of simple language it is mischievous when it occupies its place it accustoms us to reason upon the most false analogies and gathers round the truth a mist which the most enlightened minds are scarcely able to penetrate §   division of the legislative body into two assemblies is it desirable to have two assemblies whose agreement should be rendered necessary to the authority of a law there are reasons on both sides let us review them the division of the legislative body appears subject to the following inconveniences—   it will often have the effect of giving to the minority the effect of the majority the unanimity even of one of the two assemblies would be defeated by a majority of a single vote in the other assembly   this arrangement is calculated to favour two different intentions according to the quality of the members thus distributed if it be founded upon orders—for example peers and commoners—the result is to favour an undue preponderance—to set the interests of a particular class in opposition to the interests of the nation itself if there are two rival assemblies without distinctions—the result is to favour corruption since if a majority can be secured in the one it is enough the other may be neglected   each assembly would be deprived of a part of the knowledge it would have possessed in a state of union the same reasons are not presented in the two houses with the same force the arguments which have decided the votes in the one may not be employed in the other the proposer of the motion who has made the subject a profound study will not be present in the assembly in which objections are made against it the cause is judged without hearing the principal party  0    this division necessarily produces useless delays two assemblies cannot be engaged at the same time upon the same matter—at least in all those cases in which there are original documents to be presented or witnesses to be heard hence double labour—double delay such assemblies cannot exist without opposite pretensions there will arise questions of competency which will lead to negotiations and often to ruptures these disputes concerning powers or prerogatives beside their own inconveniences beside the loss of time they occasion will often furnish the means of striking both assemblies with immovability this continually happened in the ancient statesgeneral of france the court encouraged disunion between the different orders it combated the one by the other and always found in this discord a plausible pretext for dismissing them   the final result of this division is to produce a distribution of powers which gives to one of the assemblies the initiative and reduces the other to a simple negative—a natural and fruitful source of undue opposition of quarrels of inaction and of perpetuity for abuse everything tends to produce a repartition of this nature two independent assemblies cannot long exist without measuring their strength besides those who have the principal conduct of affairs cannot act without laying down a plan and without securing the means of its execution they must choose one of the assemblies in order to begin their operations there if one appear to have more influence than the other they will carry all important propositions thither this alone would be sufficient entirely to destroy the balance thus would be established not by right but in fact a distinction between the two powers the one being endowed with the initiative and the other with a simple negative but in reference to personal interest—the only motive upon which we can constantly reckon—that body which is reduced to a single negative will be opposed to everything it can only show its power by rejecting it appears as nothing when it accepts to play the first part is to govern—to play the second is to be governed deprived of the motives of honour this negative body will detach itself insensibly from the habits of business business will be considered an ungrateful task this body will reserve to itself the easiest part that of opposing everything except in those cases in which it fears to compromise itself with public opinion and to lose its reputation by an odious resistance the following are the reasons which may be alleged in favour of this division— first advantage maturity of discussion this division is a certain method of preventing precipitation and surprise it is true that in a single assembly rules may be established which prescribe multiplied examinations according to the importance of the business and it is thus that we find in the house of commons three readings three discussions at different intervals—discussion in committee article by article report of the committee examination of this report petitions from all who are interested appointment of a day for considering these petitions it is by these general precautions and others like them that the danger of surprise is obviated and maturity of deliberation secured this is true but a single assembly may have the best rules and disregard them when it pleases experience proves that it is easy to lay them aside and urgency of circumstances always furnishes a ready pretext and a popular pretext for doing what the dominant party desires if there are two assemblies the forms will be observed because if one violate them it affords a legitimate reason to the other for rejection of everything presented to it after such suspicious innovation besides multiplied discussions in a single assembly do not present the same security as those which take place among different bodies diversity of interests of views of prejudices and habits are absolutely necessary for the examination of objects under all their relations men who act long together contract the same connexions and modes of thinking a spirit of routine and of party which has its natural correction in another association a second assembly may therefore be considered as a tribunal of appeal from the judgment of the first second advantage restriction of the power of a single assembly an assembly of deputies elected by the people and removable would from this cause be in a state of dependence which would oblige them to consult the wishes of their constituents but until a system of absolutely free election and removability is established supposing such a system easy of establishment and without inconvenience it is no less true that a legislative assembly is only responsible to public opinion from which a very imperfect security results against the abuse of power if there be two assemblies differently constituted the one naturally serves as a restraint to the other the power of the demagogue will be weakened the same individual will scarcely be able to exercise the same influence in both assemblies there will arise an emulation of credit and talents even the jealousy of one assembly would become in this case a safeguard against the usurpations of the other and the constitution would be  0  preserved by passions which operate in different directions third advantage separation of the nobility and the people if there be in a state certain powerful and privileged bodies such as the nobility and clergy it is better to give to their deputies a separate assembly than to confound them with those of the people in one house why in the first place lest if their number were not determined they should obtain from the influence of their rank and fortune a considerable preponderance in the elections  dly if they act separately the whole responsibility of opinion will rest upon their own heads they cannot be ignorant that the public will explain their conduct by reference to their personal interests and that the refusal of a popular law will expose them to the severity of the judgment of the whole nation if they are confounded with the deputies of the people in one assembly they will possess means of influence which will act secretly and their peculiar votes will be hidden in the general vote  dly if in a great state you have only a single assembly it will be too numerous to act well or it will be necessary to give to the people only such a number of deputies as will be insufficient to establish public confidence of the five objections which have been presented against the division of the legislative power the fifth is doubtless the strongest one of the two assemblies will obtain the preponderance—it will have the initiation there remains nothing for the other in the majority of cases but the negative it appears sufficiently absurd to create a body of senators or of nobles solely for the purpose of opposing the wishes of the deputies of the people but in this manner of representing the matter it is considered only in respect of its abuse and there is a double departure from truth in trusting more to an assembly called representative than ought to be trusted and fearing more from an assembly of nobles than ought to be feared it cannot be denied that at all times the division of the legislative body whatever may be the composition of the two houses presents great obstacles to the reform of abuses such a system is less proper for creating than preserving this shows that it is suitable to an established constitution the vessel of the state secured by these two anchors possesses a power of resistance against the tempests which could not be obtained by any other means but if the division of the legislative bodies be extended to three or four assemblies it will be seen to give birth to a complication of irremediable inconveniences—not only are the delays the rivalries the obstacles to every species of improvement multiplied but a means is also given to the executive of stopping everything by a superior influence over a single assembly or of annihilating the power of one of these assemblies if the concurrence of two others decides everything there results from such a division an illegal and fraudulent association in which two of the associates have only to agree together in order to leave the third only the semblance of power it is thus that the nobility and clergy in denmark held the commons in a condition of nearly absolute nullity and it was thus also that by a union between the commons and the clergy against the nobility the states were destroyed and absolute power bestowed on the king sicily also had its parliament in which the two superior orders having always agreed among themselves against the third estate have reduced it to an existence purely nominal returning to the question of two assemblies if it were asked what good has resulted in england from the house of lords it would not be easy to cite examples of bad laws which it has prevented by its negative it is possible on the contrary by citing many good ones which it had rejected to conclude that it was more hurtful than useful but this conclusion would not be just for in examining the effects of an institution we ought to take account of what it does without being perceived by the simple faculty of hindering an individual is not tempted to ask for what he is certain beforehand will be refused no one undertakes an enterprise which is certain not to succeed a constitution becomes stable because there is a power established for its protection if there were no positive proof of good which the house of lords has done we may in part attribute to it the moderation with which the house of commons has used its power the respect which it shows for the limits of its slightly determined authority and its constant subjection to the rules which it prescribes to itself i shall confine myself to a simple enumeration of several collateral advantages resulting from a superior chamber such as the relief   0 which it gives to the government in the eyes of the people the greater force conferred on the laws when the nobility have concurred in sanctioning them the emulation which diversity of ranks spreads among the different classes of society the advantage of presenting a fixed and precise career to ambition in which a legitimate reward is worth more than the demagogue could promise himself from success and the still greater advantage of retaining the nobility within certain limits of rendering it hereditary only in the eldest son and of connecting its interest with the general interest by a continual transfusion of these noble families among the body of the nation there is no ducal house in england which has not in its bosom a part more attached by interest to the liberty of the commons than to the prerogatives of the peerage this is the principle of stability each one in this beautiful political order is more afraid of losing what he possesses than desirous of what he has not chapter ii of publicity before entering into the detail of the operations of the assembly let us place at the head of its regulations the fittest law for securing the public confidence and causing it constantly to advance towards the end of its institution this law is that of publicity the discussion of this subject may be divided into six parts—  reasons for publicity   examination of objections to publicity   exceptions to be made   the points to which publicity should extend   the means of publicity   observations on the practice established in england §   reasons for publicity   to constrain the members of the assembly to perform their duty the greater the number of temptations to which the exercise of political power is exposed the more necessary is it to give to those who possess it the most powerful reasons for resisting them but there is no reason more constant and more universal than the superintendence of the public the public compose a tribunal which is more powerful than all the other tribunals together an individual may pretend to disregard its decrees—to represent them as formed of fluctuating and opposite opinions which destroy one another but every one feels that though this tribunal may err it is incorruptible that it continually tends to become enlightened that it unites all the wisdom and all the justice of the nation that it always decides the destiny of public men and that the punishments which it pronounces are inevitable those who complain of its judgments only appeal to itself and the man of virtue in resisting the opinion of today—in rising above general clamour counts and weighs in secret the suffrages of those who resemble himself if it were possible to abstract ones self from this tribunal who would wish so to do it without doubt would be neither the good nor the wise man since in the long run these have nothing to fear but everything to hope the enemies of publicity may be collected into three classes the malefactor who seeks to escape the notice of the judge the tyrant who seeks to stifle public opinion whilst he fears to hear its voice the timid or indolent man who complains of the general incapacity in order to screen his own it may perhaps be said that an assembly especially if numerous forms an internal public which serves as a restraint upon itself i reply that an assembly how numerous soever will never be sufficiently large to supply the place of the true public it will be most frequently divided into two parties which will not possess in reference one to another the qualities necessary for properly exercising the function of judges they will not be impartial whatever the conduct of an individual may be he will almost always be secure of the suffrages of one party in opposition to the other the internal censure will not be sufficient to secure probity without the assistance of external censure the reproaches of friends will be little dreaded and the individual will become insensible to those of his enemies the spirit of party shut up within narrow limits equally strips both praise and blame of its nature   to secure the confidence of the people and their assent to the measures of the legislature— suspicion always attaches to mystery it thinks it sees a crime where it beholds an affectation of secresy and it is rarely deceived for why should we hide ourselves if we do not dread being seen in proportion as it is desirable for improbity to shroud itself in darkness in the same proportion is it desirable for innocence to walk in open day for fear of being mistaken for her adversary so clear a truth presents itself at once to the minds of the people and if good sense had not suggested it malignity would have sufficed to promulgate it the best project prepared in darkness would excite more alarm than the worst undertaken under the auspices of publicity but in an open and free policy what confidence and security—i do not say for the people but for the governors themselves let it be impossible that any thing should be done which is unknown to the nation—prove to it that you neither intend to deceive     nor to surprise—you take away all the weapons of discontent the public will repay with usury the confidence you repose in it calumny will lose its force it collects its venom in the caverns of obscurity but it is destroyed by the light of day that a secret policy saves itself from some inconveniences i will not deny but i believe that in the long run it creates more than it avoids and that of two governments one of which should be conducted secretly and the other openly the latter would possess a strength a hardihood and a reputation which would render it superior to all the dissimulations of the other consider in particular how much public deliberations respecting the laws the measures the taxes the conduct of official persons ought to operate upon the general spirit of a nation in favour of its government objections have been refuted—false reports confounded the necessity for the sacrifices required of the people have been clearly proved opposition with all its efforts far from having been injurious to authority will have essentially assisted it it is in this sense that it has been well said that he who resists strengthens for the government is much more assured of the general success of a measure and of the public approbation after it has been discussed by two parties whilst the whole nation has been spectators among a people who have been long accustomed to public assemblies the general feeling will be raised to a higher tone—sound opinions will be more common—hurtful prejudices publicly combated not by rhetoricians but by statesmen will have less dominion the multitude will be more secure from the tricks of demagogues and the cheats of impostors they will most highly esteem great talents and the frivolities of wit will be reduced to their just value a habit of reasoning and discussion will penetrate all classes of society the passions accustomed to a public struggle will learn reciprocally to restrain themselves they will lose that morbid sensibility which among nations without liberty and without experience renders them the sport of every alarm and every suspicion even in circumstances when discontent most strikingly exhibits itself the signs of uneasiness will not be signs of revolt the nation will rely upon those trustworthy individuals whom long use has taught them to know and legal opposition to every unpopular measure will prevent even the idea of illegal resistance even if the public wish be opposed by too powerful a party it will know that the cause is not decided without appeal hence persevering patience becomes one of the virtues of a free country the order which reigns in the discussion of a political assembly will form by imitation the national spirit this order will be reproduced in clubs and inferior assemblies in which the people will be pleased to find the regularity of which they had formed the idea from the greater model how often in london amid the effervescence of a tumult have not wellknown orators obtained the same attention as if they had been in parliament the crowd has ranged itself around them has listened in silence and acted with a degree of moderation which could not be conceived possible even in despotic states in which the populace arrogant and timid alternately is equally contemptible in its transports and its subjection still however the régime of publicity—very imperfect as yet and newly tolerated—without being established by law has not had time to produce all the good effects to which it will give birth hence have arisen riots for which there was no other cause than the precipitation with which the government acted without taking the precaution to enlighten the people   to enable the governors to know the wishes of the governed in the same proportion as it is desirable for the governed to know the conduct of their governors is it also important for the governors to know the real wishes of the governed under the guidance of publicity nothing is more easy the public is placed in a situation to form an enlightened opinion and the course of that opinion is easily marked under the contrary régime what is it possible to know with certainty the public will always proceed speaking and judging of everything but it judges without information and even upon false information its opinion not being founded upon facts is altogether different from what it ought to be from what it would be if it were founded in truth it ought not to be believed that government can dissipate at pleasure those errors which it would have been easy to prevent late illumination does not always repair the evil of a previously erroneous impression have the people from the little which has transpired respecting a project conceived sinister apprehensions we will suppose them unfounded but this does not alter the case they become agitated they murmur alarm is propagated resistance is prepared has the government nothing to do but to speak—to make known the truth in order to change the current of the public mind no without doubt confidence is of slow growth the odious imputations exist the explanations which are given of necessity are considered as the acknowledgements of weakness hence improvement itself produces a shock when improperly introduced     and when it is opposed to the inclinations of the people the history of the emperor joseph ii would furnish a multitude of examples to these major considerations may be joined others which ought not to be neglected   in an assembly elected by the people and renewed from time to time publicity is absolutely necessary to enable the electors to act from knowledge for what purpose renew the assembly if the people are always obliged to choose from among men of whom they know nothing to conceal from the public the conduct of its representatives is to add inconsistency to prevarication it is to tell the constituents you are to elect or reject such or such of your deputies without knowing why—you are forbidden the use of reason—you are to be guided in the exercise of your greatest powers only by hazard or caprice   another reason in favour of publicity—to provide the assembly with the means of profiting by the information of the public a nation too numerous to act for itself is doubtless obliged to entrust its powers to its deputies but will they possess in concentration all the national intelligence is it even possible that the elected shall be in every respect the most enlightened the most capable the wisest persons in the nation—that they will possess among themselves alone all the general and local knowledge which the function of governing requires this prodigy of election is a chimera in peaceful times wealth and distinguished rank will be always the most likely circumstances to conciliate the greatest number of votes the men whose condition in life leads them to cultivate their minds have rarely the opportunity of entering into the career of politics locke newton hume adam smith and many other men of genius never had a seat in parliament the most useful plans have often been derived from private individuals the establishment of the sinking fund by mr pitt it is well known was the fruit of the calculations of dr price who would never have had the leisure requisite for such researches if his mind had been distracted by political occupations the only public man who from the beginning of the quarrel with the american colonies had correct ideas upon the subject and who would have saved the nation from war if he had been listened to was a clergyman excluded by this circumstance from the national representation but without entering into these details it may easily be conceived how effective publicity is as a means of collecting all the information in a nation and consequently for giving birth to useful suggestions   it may be thought descending from the serious consideration of this subject to reckon among the advantages of publicity the amusement which results from it i say amusement by itself separate from instruction though it be in fact not possible to separate them but those who regard this consideration as frivolous do not reason well what they reckon useful is what promises an advantage amusement is an advantage already realized and this kind of pleasure in particular appears to me sufficient by itself to increase the happiness of any nation which would enjoy much more than those nations who know it not memoirs are one of the most agreeable parts of french literature and there are few books which are more profound but memoirs do not appear till long after the events which they record have happened and they are not in the hands of every one english newspapers are memoirs published at the moment when the events occur in which are found all the parliamentary discussions—everything which relates to the actors on the political theatre in which all the facts are freely exhibited and all opinions are freely debated one of the roman emperors proposed a reward for the individual who should invent a new pleasure no one has more richly deserved it than the individual who first laid the transactions of a legislative assembly before the eyes of the public† §   objections to publicity if publicity be favourable in so many respects to the governors themselves—so proper for securing them against the injustice of the public for procuring for them the sweetest reward of their labours—why are they so generally enemies of this régime must it be sought in their vices in the desire of the governors to act without responsibility—to withdraw their conduct from inspection—to impose upon the people—to keep them in subjection by their ignorance such motives may actuate some among them but to attribute them to all would be the language of satire there may be unintentional errors in this respect founded upon specious objections let us endeavour to reduce them to their just value first objection—the public is an incompetent judge of the proceedings of a political assembly in consequence of the ignorance and passions of the majority of those who compose it if i should concede that in the mass of the public there may not be one individual in a hundred who is capable of forming an enlightened judgment upon the questions which     are discussed in a political assembly i shall not be accused of weakening the objection and yet even at this point it would not appear to me to have any force against publicity this objection would have some solidity if when the means of judging correctly were taken from the popular tribunal the inclination to judge could be equally taken away but the public do judge and will always judge if it should refrain from judging for fear of judging incorrectly far from deserving to be charged with ignorance its wisdom would deserve to be admired a nation which could supend its judgment would not be composed of common men but of philosophers but the increase of publications it will be said will increase the number of bad judges in a much greater proportion than the good ones to this it may be replied—that for this purpose it is necessary to distinguish the public into three classes the first is composed of the most numerous party who occupy themselves very little with public affairs—who have not time to read nor leisure for reasoning the second is composed of those who form a kind of judgment but it is borrowed—a judgment founded upon the assertions of others the parties neither taking the pains necessary nor being able to form an opinion of their own the third is composed of those who judge for themselves according to the information whether more or less exact which they are able to procure which of these three classes of men would be injured by publicity it would not be the first since by the supposition it would not affect them it is only the third these judged before—they will still judge but they judged ill upon imperfect information they will judge better when they are in possession of the true documents whilst in respect of the second class we have said that their judgments are borrowed they must therefore be the echo of those of the third class but this class being better informed and judging better will furnish more correct opinions for those who receive them ready made by rectifying these you will have rectified the others by purifying the fountain you will purify the streams in order to decide whether publicity will be injurious or beneficial it is only necessary to consider the class which judges because it is this alone which directs opinion but if this class judge ill it is because it is ignorant of the facts—because it does not possess the necessary particulars for forming a good judgment this then is the reasoning of the partisans of mystery—you are incapable of judging because you are ignorant and you shall remain ignorant that you may be incapable of judging second objection—publicity may expose to hatred a member of the assembly for proceedings which deserve other treatment this objection resolves itself into the first—the incapacity of the people to distinguish between its friends and its enemies if a member of a political assembly have not sufficient firmness to brave a momentary injustice he is wanting in the first quality of his office it is the characteristic of error to possess only an accidental existence which may terminate in a moment whilst truth is indestructible it requires only to be exhibited and it is to effect this that everything in the region of publicity concurs is injustice discovered—hatred is changed into esteem and he who at the expense of the credit of today has dared to draw for reputation on the future is paid with interest as regards reputation publicity is much more useful to the members of an assembly than it can be hurtful it is their security against malignant imputations and calumnies it is not possible to attribute to them false discourses nor to hide the good they have done nor to give to their conduct an unfair colouring have their intentions been ill understood—a public explanation overturns the false rumours and leaves no hold for clandestine attacks third objection—the desire of popularity may suggest dangerous propositions to the members—the eloquence which they will cultivate will be the eloquence of seduction rather than the eloquence of reason—they will become tribunes of the people rather than legislators this objection also resolves itself into the first—that is the incompetence of the people to judge of their true interests to distinguish between their friends and their flatterers in a representative state in which the people are not called upon to vote upon political measures this danger is little to be apprehended the speeches of the orators which are known to them only through the newspapers have not the influence of the passionate harangues of a seditious demagogue they do not read them till after they have passed through a medium which cools them and besides they are accompanied by the opposite arguments which according to the supposition would have all the natural advantage of the true over the false the publicity of debates has ruined more demagogues than it has made a popular favourite has only to enter parliament and he ceases to be mischievous placed amid his equals or his superiors in talent he can assert nothing which will not be combated his exaggerations will be reduced within the limits or truth his presumption humiliated his desire of momentary popularity ridiculed and the flatterer of the people will finish by disgusting the people themselves     fourth objection—in a monarchy the publicity of the proceedings of political assemblies by exposing the members to the resentment of the head of the state may obstruct the freedom of their decisions this objection more specious than the preceding vanishes when it is examined and even proves an argument in favour of publicity if such an assembly be in danger from the sovereign it has no security except in the protection of the people the security arising from secret deliberations is more specious than real the proceedings of the assembly would always be known to the sovereign whilst they would always be unknown to those who would only seek to protect it if the means were left to them if then a political assembly prefer the secret regimé by alleging the necessity of withdrawing itself from the inspection of the sovereign it need not thus deceive itself this can only be a pretence the true motive of such conduct must rather be to subject itself to his influence without too much expoing itself to public blame for by excluding the public it only frees itself from public inspection the sovereign will not want his agents and his spies though invisible he will be as it were present in the midst of the assembly is it objected against the régime of publicity that it is a system of distrust this is true and every good political institution is founded upon this base whom ought we to distrust if not those to whom is committed great authority with great temptations to abuse it consider the objects of their duties they are not their own affairs but the affairs of others comparatively indifferent to them very difficult very complicated—which indolence alone would lead them to neglect and which require the most laborious application consider their personal interests you will often find them in opposition to the interests confided to them they also possess all the means of serving themselves at the expense of the public without the possibility of being convicted of it what remains then to overcome all these dangerous motives what has created an interest of superior force and what can this interest be if it be not respect for public opinion—dread of its judgments—desire of glory—in one word everything which results from publicity the efficacy of this great instrument extends to everything—legislation administration judicature without publicity no good is permanent under the auspices of publicity no evil can continue §   objects to which publicity ought to extend the publication of what passes in a political assembly ought to embrace the following points—   the tenor of every motion   the tenor of the speeches or the arguments for and against each motion   the issue of each motion   the number of the votes on each side   the names of the voters   the reports c which have served as the foundation of the decision i shall not stop to prove that the knowledge of all these points is necessary for putting the tribunal of the public in a condition for forming an enlightened judgment but an objection may be made against the publicity of the respective number of the voters by publishing these it may be said the authority of the acts of the assembly will be in danger of being weakened and the opposition will be encouraged when the majority is small to this it may be replied that it is proper to distinguish between illegal and legal opposition the first is not to be presumed the second is not an evil the first i say is not to be presumed the existence of a government regulated by an assembly is founded upon an habitual disposition to conformity with the wish of the majority constant unanimity is not expected because it is known to be impossible and when a party is beaten by a small majority far from finding in this circumstance a motive for illegal resistance it only discovers a reason for hope of future success if afterwards a legal opposition be established it is no evil for the comparative number of suffrages being the only measure of probability as to the correctness of its decisions it follows that the legal opposition cannot be better founded than when guided by this probability let us suppose the case of a judicial decision—that there have been two judgments the one given by the smallest majority possible the other by the greatest would it not be more natural to provide an appeal against the first than against the second but the necessity of appeal in judicial matters is not nearly of the same importance as in matters of legislation the decisions of the judges apply only to individual cases the decisions of a legislative assembly regulate the interests of a whole nation and have consequences which are continually renewed do you expect that you will obtain greater submission by concealing from the public the different numbers of the votes you will be mistaken the public reduced to conjecture will turn this mystery against you it will be very easily misled by false reports a small minority may represent itself as nearly equal to the majority and may make use of a thousand insidious arts to deceive the public as to its real force the american congress during the war of     independence was accustomed if i am not deceived to represent all its resolutions as unanimous its enemies saw in this precaution the necessity of hiding an habitual discord this assembly in other respects so wise chose rather to expose itself to this suspicion than to allow the degrees of dissent to the measures which it took to be known but though this trick might succeed in this particular case this does not prove its general utility the congress secure of the confidence of its constituents employed this stratagem with their approbation for the purpose of disconcerting its enemies the names of the voters ought to be published not only that the public may know the habitual principles of their deputies and their assiduity in attending but also for another reason the quality of the votes has an influence upon opinion as well as their number to desire that they should all have the same value is to desire that folly should have the same influence as wisdom and that merit should exist without motive and without reward §   exceptions to the rule of publicity publicity ought to be suspended in those cases in which it is calculated to produce the following effects—   to favour the projects of an enemy   unnecessarily to injure innocent persons   to inflict too severe a punishment upon the guilty it is not proper to make the law of publicity absolute because it is impossible to foresee all the circumstances in which an assembly may find itself placed rules are made for a state of calm and security they cannot be formed for a state of trouble and peril secresy is an instrument of conspiracy it ought not therefore to be the system of a regular government §   means of publicity the following are the means of publicity which may be employed either in whole or in part according to the nature of the assembly and the importance of its affairs   authentic publication of the transactions of the assembly upon a complete plan including the six points laid down in the preceding article—   the employment of shorthand writers for the speeches and in cases of examination for the questions and answers   toleration of other nonauthentic publications upon the same subject   admission of strangers to the sittings the employment of shorthand writers would be indispensable in those cases in which it would be desirable to have the entire tenor of the speech but recourse need not be had to this instrument except in discussions of sufficient importance to justify the expense in england in an ordinary trial the parties are at liberty to employ them in the solemn trial of warren hastings the house of commons on the one side and the accused on the other had their shorthand writers—the house of lords in character of judge had also its own with regard to nonauthentic publications it is necessary to tolerate them either to prevent negligence and dishonesty on the part of the official reporters or to prevent suspicion an exclusive privilege would be regarded as a certificate of falsity besides the authentic publication of the proceedings of the assembly could only be made with a slowness which would not give the public satisfaction without reckoning the evil which would arise in the interval from false reports before the authentic publication arrived to destroy them nonofficial journals completely accomplish this object their success depends upon the avidity of the public and their talent consists in satisfying it this has in england reached such a point of celerity that debates which have lasted till three or four oclock in the morning are printed and distributed in the capital before midday the admission of the public to the sittings is a very important point but this subject requires explanations which would not here be in their place it will be treated separately the principal reason for this admission is that it tends to inspire confidence in the reports of the journals if the public were excluded it would always be led to suppose that the truth was not reported or at least that part was suppressed and that many things passed in the assembly which it did not know but independently of this guarantee it is very useful for the reputation of the members of the assembly to be heard by impartial witnesses and judged by a portion of the public which is change every day this presence of strangers is a powerful motive to emulation among them at the same time that it is a salutary restraint upon the different passions to which the debates may give rise §   state of things in england in order to form a just idea of the state of things in england relative to publicity it is necessary to pay attention to two very different things—the rules and the actual practice the following are the rules—   all strangers that is to say all who are not members of the assembly are prohibited from entering under pain of immediate imprisonment     introduction by a member forms no exception to the prohibition nor any ground of exemption from the punishment this prohibition established during the stormy times of the civil war in    0 has been renewed seven times under circumstances which furnish neither this excuse nor any other   prohibition as well of others as of the members themselves to report anything that passes in the house or to publish anything on the subject without the authority of the house this regulation which dates from the commencement of the civil war has been renewed thirty times and for the last time in      in an order in which passion appears carried to its greatest height the language of the proudest despots is gentle and moderate in comparison with that of this popular assembly   since      there has been published by the house of commons what are called the votes of the house that is a kind of history of its proceedings meagre and dry containing the formal proceedings with the motions and decisions and in cases of division the numbers for and against but without any notice of the debates before this period this publication only took place occasionally these votes collected and republished at the end of the year with an immense mass of public laws and private acts form what are called the journals of the house these journals were formerly given to each member but not sold to the public†   projects of laws before they are passed by parliament these projects called bills are not printed under a general rule but the printing is ordered upon special motion and for the exclusive use of the members so that no one can know what they contain unless he obtain one of these privileged copies through a member it is however of more importance that the public should be made acquainted with these than with the votes how singular soever it may be thus to see the deputies of the people withdrawing themselves with so much hauteur from the observation of their constituents the principles of a free government are as yet so little known that there has been no general complaint against a conduct which tends to destroy all responsibility on the part of the representatives and all influence on the part of the nation but since public opinion more enlightened has had greater ascendency and principally since the accession of george iii though these antipopular regulations are still the same a contrary practice has prevailed in many particulars it is doubtless to be regretted that whatever improvement has taken place in england has been accomplished through a continual violation of the laws but it is gratifying to observe that these innovations insensibly tend to the general perfection the house of commons has allowed a small portion of the public to be present at its sittings—about one hundred and fifty strangers can be accommodated in a separate gallery unhappily this indulgence is precarious that the house ought to be able to exclude witnesses in the cases of which we have spoken is conceded but at present it is only necessary that a single member should require the observation of the standing order which being always in force is irresistible as to the contents of the debates and the names of the voters there are numerous periodical publications which give account of them these publications are crimes but it is to these fortunate crimes that england is indebted for her escape from an aristocratic government resembling that of venice these publications would not have obtained this degree of indulgence if they had been more exact at one time if a stranger were discovered in the gallery with a pencil in his hand a general cry was raised against him and he was driven out without pity but at present connivance is more extended and shorthand writers employed by the editors of the public newspapers are tolerated‡ among the lords the regulations are nearly the same but the tone is more moderate no admission to strangers—order  th april   0  no publication of debates allowed—order   th february      it was however among them that in our times the plan of indulgence which at present reigns was commenced this house has one custom which gives to one set of its opinions a publicity of which no example is found in the other i refer to protests these are declarations made by one or many members of the minority of the reasons for their dissent from the measures adopted by the majority and inserted in the journals these protests are printed and circulated in opposition to the regulations there results from this publication a singularity which ought to lead to consideration if consideration were within the province of routine it is that the only reasons presented to the public in an authentic form are those which are opposed to the laws the house of lords in permitting a portion of the public to attend its sittings has     rendered this favour as burthensome as possible there are no seats the first row of spectators intercepts the view and injures the hearing of those who are behind some of the more popular members have at different times proposed to give the public more accommodation but the proposition has always been refused by the majority of their colleagues either from considering that a painful attitude is more respectful or from an absolute horror of all change chapter iii of the place of meeting and its dependencies §   of the building suitable for a numerous assembly magnificence of architecture in a building intended for a large political assembly would be almost always injurious with regard to its utility the essential points to be considered are—   facility of hearing for the members   facility of seeing for the president   personal convenience for the individuals and lastly fitness for the service if any of the seats are so distant that the voice with difficulty reaches them attention being rendered painful will not be long sustained the same distance will deprive one part of the assembly of the inspection of its president and from this cause alone may give rise to habitual disorder besides those who do not hear are obliged to decide upon a borrowed opinion it was thus that the great popular assemblies in the ancient republics were necessarily subjected to the direction of two or three demagogues the difficulty of making themselves heard may also drive from the service the individuals of greatest ability if the strength of their lungs be not proportioned to the space that their voice is required to fill demosthenes might have been obliged to give way to stentor the first quality required would no longer be mental superiority but a physical advantage which without being incompatible with talent does not necessarily imply it the presumption is even on the other side and in favour of the feeble and valetudinary individual—inaptitude for corporeal exercises being partly the cause and partly the effect of a studious disposition a form nearly circular seats rising amphitheatrically above each other—the seat of the president so placed that he may see all the assembly—a central space for the secretaries and papers—contiguous rooms for committees—a gallery for auditors—a separate box for the reporters for the public papers—such are the most important points i do not enter into detail respecting the salubrity of the hall and its adaptation for the service i only add that a hall well adapted to all these objects would have more influence than would at first be suspected in securing the assiduity of the members and facilitating the exercise of their functions §   table of motions reference is here made to a very simple mechanical apparatus for exhibiting to the eyes of the assembly the motion on which they are deliberating the mere reading of a motion can only impart an imperfect and fugitive acquaintance with it there is no other method for really presenting it to the minds of the members of an assembly beside that of presenting it to their eyes a general idea of this table only will be presented here we may suppose a gallery above the presidents chair which presents a front consisting of two frames nine feet high     by six feet wide filled with black canvas made to open like folding doors—that this canvas is regularly pierced for the reception of letters of so large a size as to be legible in every part of the place of meeting these letters might be attached by an iron hook in such manner that they could not be deranged when a motion is about to become the object of debate it would be given to the compositors who would transcribe it upon the table and by closing the gallery exhibit it like a placard to the eyes of the whole assembly the utility of this invention in its most general point of view consists in so arranging matters that no one could avoid knowing upon what motion he ought to vote it is true that what is of most importance to be known is the sense of a proposition and not its tenor—the spirit rather than the letter but it is only by a knowledge of the letter that we can be sure of the spirit—a mistake in only a single word may entirely change the purport of a discourse when the words are no longer present to the memory we are in danger of falling into mistakes—a danger which it is a folly to incur when it may be avoided by so simple and infallible a method there is not a moment in the course of a debate in which each member has not occasion to know the motion and to be able to consult it either for making a correct application of what he hears or for the purpose of taking an active part in the discussion this knowledge is of the first importance to him whether he act as a judge by giving his vote—or as an advocate by speaking for or against it in the first place with respect to those who listen nothing could be more agreeable and useful to them than this table of motions everything which relieves the memory facilitates the understanding—there is much less doubt about the meaning when there is none about the words upon the simple enunciation or reading of a motion—all those who have been distracted—all those who readily forget—all those who are slow in understanding—are necessarily ignorant of the subject of debate or obliged to apply to others for information hence arise irregular movements reciprocal interruptions confusion and noise in the next place as to those who speak the utility of this table is still more clear if the motion be of a certain length it requires for its recollection an effort of memory which distracts the attention at a moment in which there is a necessity for employing it altogether in another manner there ought not to be a necessity of seeking for words when there is already too much to do in seeking for arguments the hesitation occasioned by such a search disturbs the current of the thoughts but besides this effort of memory is often inefficacious nothing is more common than to see orators and even practised orators falling into involuntary errors with respect to the precise terms of a motion if this be not perceived an incorrect judgment is the result of the error if it be perceived the protests against it produce either apologies or disputes and thence loss of time in accusations and defences the table of motions would contribute in many respects to the perfection of the debate we have seen that it would preserve the orators from involuntary errors it would be no less serviceable to the assembly as a security against intentional false misrepresentations—against insidious representations by which sentiments are imputed to an antagonist which do not belong to him this defect of candour springs from the same principle as calumny which hopes that some portion of the reproach with which it asperses will not be wiped away the individual who practises this meanness is screened by the difficulty of distinguishing his false representation from involuntary error remove this difficulty and the temptation to be guilty of the meanness will be removed also digressions are another inconvenience in debates they often arise from the weakness of the mind which without intending it loses sight of the point with which it ought to be engaged but when the orator forgets his subject and begins to wander a table of motions offers the readiest means for recalling him under the present régime how is this evil remedied it is necessary for a member to rise to interrupt the speaker and call him to order this is a provocation—it is a reproach—it wounds his selflove the orator attacked defends himself there is no longer a debate upon the motion but a discussion respecting the application of his arguments the unpleasantness of these scenes when they are not animated by the spirit of party leads to the toleration of a multitude of digressions experience having proved that the remedy is worse than the disease whilst as to the president although it be his duty to prevent these wanderings his prudence leads him to avoid giving frequent and disagreeable admonitions and entering into altercations which might compromise his dignity or his impartiality but if we suppose the table of motions placed above him the case would be very different he might without interrupting the speaker warn him by a simple gesture and this quiet sign would not be accompanied by the danger of a personal appeal it would be a sedative and not a stimulant—a suggestion and not an accusation it would be the act not of an adversary but of a judge the member would not be called upon to stop—would not be required to make a painful submission and avowal of error he would     only have in continuing his speech to return to the subject of discussion and he could not be ignorant that the sign of the president was an appeal to the assembly the attention of which had been directed to him in conclusion it may be observed that this table would give great facility in the production of good amendments if a simple reading be sufficient for correctly seizing the spirit of a motion it is not sufficient for giving attention to all its terms when observations are to be made upon style we must not trust to memory it is desirable that the writing should be under the eye—that it may be considered in many points of view—that the microscope of attention may be applied to all its parts and there is no other method of discovering the imperfections of detail this kind of criticism is a peculiar talent in which individuals are formed to excel who often do not possess any of the gifts of oratory the profound grammarian is more useful than is generally thought to the legislator this table would possess a further merit if it should only procure for the assembly the services of one clever man who had been discouraged by a defect of memory and retained by this defect in a state of inaction it is well known that the two most important faculties of the mind—judgment and invention—are often very strong in those individuals who have very weak memories especially with regard to words with respect to talent as well as virtue the smaller the service required the less the danger of its being wanting it may perhaps be said that the printing of the motions before the debate would nearly accomplish the same object and would supply the place of this table but in the course of a debate how many accidental and unforeseen motions may be made—how many amendments which there is not time to print it may also be observed that a paper to be read to be consulted does not afford to the hearers or the speaker the same facility as a table which remains immovably before their eyes it is not necessary continually to stoop for the purpose of listening or speaking but the eye glances over the lines of the table without interruption and besides this the great utility of the table the strength which its gives to the regulation against useless digressions simply by means of an admonitory sign is an advantage not to be obtained by printing the motion §   description of a table of motions the plan here pointed out may serve for a first attempt but the easier the mode of execution the less important are the details frames—they may be made like two folding doors they should be filled with canvas stretched so as to present an even surface not sinking in the middle size of the letters—this would depend upon the size of the place of meeting—a black ground the letters gilt—a strong light thrown upon the table—the form of the letter rather oblong than square method of fixing them—the letters being made like a button should have a hook by means of which they might be fixed with the greatest ease the regularity of the lines might be secured by a thread in the cloth composition of the table—the two folding leaves turn upon their hinges like a door the compositors whilst at work are visible to the assembly which will secure their diligence and emulation the two leaves closed together will present the appearance of two pages of an open book amendments—these might be exhibited upon a separate table placed immediately beside the others with a reference which would direct the eye to the part of the original motion which it was wished to amend and a word at the top of the table which should simply indicate that the amendment is suppressive additive or substitutive multiplication of tables—there might be an assortment of tables upon which all the known motions might be previously prepared and thus be made to succeed each other rapidly contents of the table of motions suppose that each frame is nine feet high by six wide and the letters one and a half   0 inch by three quarters of an inch the two leaves of the table would contain more than four ordinary octavo printed pages this may be ascertained by calculation at fiftytwo feet distant i have found in a church that the table of the decalogue was perfectly legible for ordinary eyes when the letters were three quarters of an inch high composition—the labours of the compositors may perhaps be accelerated by what is called the logographical principle which consists in composing not with letters but with entire words by the multiplication of tables a composition which was too long to be presented all at once to the eyes of the assembly might be presented in parts a project of a law for example whatever was its extent might be previously prepared and the tables shifted without suspending the labours of the assembly but this plan has its limits—that is to say there are cases and circumstances which would prevent its being employed on account of time and space these limits do not however furnish any argument against its utility upon all occasions on which it can be employed this utility is so great—the inconveniences of the present plan are so manifest that one might be astonished that this method had not been thought of before but in these affairs it is not proper to be astonished at anything under the auspices of routine barbarism gives law to civilization and ignorance prevails over experience §   on a table of regulations when good rules are established it still remains to make arrangements for facilitating their execution—for making them known a law can have no effect except as it is known the regulations of the assembly reduced into the form of a table and readable from all parts of the place of assembly ought to be placed by the side of the president if they are too voluminous the tables ought to be multiplied but the essential points ought to be collected together in the principal table in every large political assembly nothing is more frequent than an appeal to the regulations either for attack or for defence the contravention consumes time—the correction consumes still more the rules are always as if they were nonexisting for one part of the assembly the new members are but little acquainted with them and they are not always present to the minds of the most experienced veterans such at least is the state of things in the british parliament—and it cannot be otherwise because the regulations far from being exposed to the eyes only exist by tradition and are confided only to the keeping of a treacherous memory a small table would not answer the end a large table is an object of study in every moment when the attention is vacant the least deviation becomes sensible and hence deviations become rare for rules are rarely transgressed when they cannot be transgressed with impunity—when the law which condemns is before your eyes and the tribunal which judges you at the same moment no one will be more tempted to violate it than he would be tempted to steal redhot iron procedure which moves on other occasions with the pace of the tortoise is in this case rapid as the lightning general laws whatever may be done for their promulgation cannot be made universally notorious but particular laws made for one assembly may be constantly visible within it the method is so easy it cannot be said to be unknown there is not a club in england which has not its regulations exhibited in its place of meeting there is the same foresight in gaminghouses but the bitter reflection often recurs that the wisdom displayed in the conduct of human affairs is often in the inverse proportion of their importance governments have great progress to make before they will have attained in the management of public matters to the prudence which commonly conducts private affairs the cause may be easily pointed out but not the remedy chapter iv of what concerns the members present at a legislative assembly §   of the utility of a distinctive dress for members the establishment of a particular dress for the members during the hours of sitting is one of those points upon which it would not be proper to wound national customs the object however is not altogether so unimportant as might be thought at the first glance   a particular dress serves to distinguish the members from the spectators it may prevent the usurpation of their privilege   such a dress might attain the end of a sumptuary law without having its rigour this apparent equality would defend the poor man of merit from a disadvantageous comparison with the pride of fortune   such a dress tends in another manner to place the individuals upon a level by diminishing the disadvantages of those who have to strive against any bodily defect   it produces a certain impression of respect upon the spectators and places the members themselves in a more distinguished situation—two causes which equally tend to     the maintenance of order and the preservation of decency   in the course of a debate when parties are nearly balanced and when intrigue or corruption may be apprehended the peculiar dress may serve to detect the proceedings of the members and to signalize what passes among them every communication among them becomes more manifest and attracts the public attention this method i allow is not of great force but if it be possible without inconvenience to throw one additional grain into the scale of probity it ought not to be neglected   in a popular tumult such as every political assembly is exposed to see arise around it a dress which announces the dignity of him who wears it may dispose the people to respect and give the members more influence in calming the storm   if the tumult runs so high as personally to menace certain members of the assembly the simple act of laying aside their peculiar dress would favour their retreat the chancellor jefferies so noted under james ii for his bloody decisions succeeded by laying aside the marks of his dignity in eluding for a time the fury of the populace these different reasons are not equally applicable to all political assemblies §   of the manner of placing the members and of a rostrum for the orators in a numerous deliberative assembly there ought not to be any predeterminate places every one ought to take his place as he arrives this free arrangement is preferable to a fixed order for many reasons and first because it tends to produce a debate of a better kind the members of the same party ought to possess every facility for concerting their operations and distributing their parts without this concert it is impossible that the arguments should be presented in the most suitable order and placed in the most advantageous light it is only by a continual correspondence among the members themselves that they can prevent a multitude of useless operations delays contradictions repetitions inconsistencies and other incidents of which the common tendency is to interrupt that unity of plan which is necessary in conducting business to its termination in this respect party interests are the same as those of the public it is necessary for the public good that each party should plead its cause with all its force—should employ all its resources since truth only has everything to gain in the concussion consultations held previous to the assembly cannot supply these little consultations at the moment one particular observation one new proposition may give a new aspect to affairs and render necessary a change of measures the most consuminate foresight cannot anticipate all the incidents which may arise in the course of a discussion it is here as in a battle—the best plan previously formed cannot supersede the necessity of occasional orders suggested at the instant by the events of the day the english practice is conformable to this theory the arrangement being free the two parties naturally place themselves upon the two sides of the house the first bench upon the right of the speaker which is called the treasury bench is occupied by the ministers and other official persons but this is a matter of courtesy and not of right the first bench on the speakers left is that occupied by the principal persons of the opposition party there is one single exception to this freedom of places—an exception honourable in principle but too rare in practice to be productive of inconvenience it is commonly understood says mr hatsell vol ii p     that members who have received the thanks of the house in their place are entitled to that place whenever they come to the house at least during that parliament and it is generally allowed them by the courtesy of the house in the house of lords different benches are appropriated of right to the different orders—one to the bishops another to the dukes c but these appropriations are but slightly observed the states of holland and west friesland used to assemble in a hall in which to judge from appearances the fixation of places was most strict each town had its bench or its part of a bench the places being aloccupied no one could change without occasioning some derangement whether any inconveniences were the result or not is a matter of conjecture and nothing more since everything passed in secresy in these dutch assemblies they never understood the essential connexion between liberty and publicity which support each other this free arrangement is favourable to equality in a case in which equality not being hurtful to any one is justice to prevent disputes concerning precedence those vain contests of etiquette which have so often been the principal object of attention in great political assemblies would be in itself a great good to correct the disposition itself which attaches importance to these distinctions is a still greater advantage the mode by which this scheme of graduated injuries is carried into effect is begun by supposing that one place is preferable to every other and that the occupation of it is a mark of superiority this system of insults which goes on regularly increasing from the last to the first place     is what is called order subordination harmony and these honorary distinctions—that is to say these gradations of affronts—given and received with privilege are commonly regarded with more respect and defended with more obstinacy than the most important laws this then is one cause of contention and trifling which ought to be excluded from a political assembly distinction of places and disputes concerning rank ought to be unknown there merita sua teneant auctores nec ultra progrediatur honos quam reperiatur virtus in england a quarrel respecting precedence is sometimes heard of but it is only in assemblies for amusement most generally among females and only among themselves if these disputes reach the men they treat them as a joke ought there to be a place assigned for those who speak before answering this question two points ought to be determined—the form and size of the place of meeting and the number of members in a numerous assembly the speaker is best heard when he speaks from a tribune placed near the centre and visible to all the debate more easily followed causes less fatigue those who have weak voices are not obliged to strain themselves that they may make themselves heard at the extremities and this is a consideration which ought not to be disregarded in a political assembly in which there ought to be a large proportion of aged and studious men regularity is better preserved if every member may speak from his place there is at least a danger of confusion and it is more difficult for the president to prevent irregular interruptions the necessity of going to the tribune stops a crowd of insignificant and precipitate proposals it is a deliberate act which an individual will hardly perform without having first considered what he intends to say it makes him conspicuous and he must feel that it is ridiculous to fix attention upon himself when he has nothing to say wherewith to repay that attention besides when a tribune is established as the place from which to speak all the rest of the assembly ought to be obliged to be silent if any one speak out of the privileged place he commits an obvious irregularity and may immediately be called to order the tribune presents also a certain advantage connected with impartiality if the assembly according to the disposition of all political bodies form itself into two parties each naturally tends to station itself in a certain portion of the place of meeting and if each one speak from the midst of his party it is known beforehand on which side he is going to speak but there are always some men more or less impartial and independent it is well therefore to require all the members to speak from a tribune which being the same for all relieves the individual from the association of ideas which would connect him with a given party it must however be acknowledged that this method is not perfectly effectual because all the members know each other but it is well calculated to have this effect with the public who listen to him and who would be thus called upon to judge the speaker by what he says and not by the place from which he speaks it may be objected that this is a restraint and that this restraint may deprive the assembly of the information possessed by a timid individual who would fear to push himself forward upon the scene in too marked a manner it may be said that a loss of time would result from it if for a single word a short explanation a call to order it were necessary to cross the house and to ascend the tribune these two objections are of very little value the first supposes a degree of timidity which is soon overcome by use a practised speaker will speak from one place as well as another but he will speak best when he is best heard he will speak more freely or he will speak with less effort as to short explanations the president might permit a member to make them without quitting his place these are minutiæ with respect to which a routine of detail will readily be formed the two houses of the british parliament have no tribune and no great inconvenience results from the want it must be observed at all times that these assemblies are rarely numerous that there are few habitual orators and that those almost always occupy the same places but when a member speaks from a distant seat he speaks under manifest disadvantage he is less heard by the assembly and often not heard at all in the gallery there are few important debates in which the reporters for the public papers are not obliged to omit certain speeches of which only scattered sounds and broken phrases have reached them §   of the hours of business fixed or free it is very necessary to have a fixed hour for the commencement of business but is it proper to have a fixed hour for breaking up the sitting although in the middle of a debate there ought to be a fixed hour or very nearly so but it should be admissible to finish a speech which is begun this regulation appears to me very reasonable and more important than would be imagined at the first glance     with reference to the personal convenience of individuals this fixation of the hour is useful to all and necessary for the infirm and the aged an inconvenience which may deter feeble and delicate persons from this national service is worthy of consideration but the principal reason is that there is no other method of securing to each subject a degree of discussion proportioned to its importance when the duration of the debate is unlimited the impatience of those who feel themselves the strongest will lead them to prolong the sitting beyond the term in which the faculties of the human mind can exercise themselves without weakness the end of the debate will often be precipitated if it be only from that feeling of uneasiness which results from fatigue and ennui in those circumstances in which parties are most excited—in which each of them awaiting the decision would be most desirous of exceeding the ordinary time—it is then that the rule would be particularly useful by interrupting the debate it favours reflection it diminishes the influence of eloquence it gives to the result a character of dignity and moderation   but it will be said delay results from it those who dread being found in a minority will prolong the debates in the hope that another day may give them some advantage i think that a systematic plan of delay founded upon this law is but slightly probable the individual who should speak merely to consume the time would do too much injury to himself to talk to no purpose in an assembly in which are heard the murmurs of indignation and before the public which judges you is a part which demands a rare degree of impudence and moreover it would be necessary to suppose that a great number of individuals should enter into this disgraceful conspiracy in order to make it succeed   it may perhaps be said that it opens a door to intrigue—to that kind of intrigue which consists in personal solicitations to the members in the interval between two sittings but this objection amounts to nothing there is no greater facility for solicitation after the first debate than there was before it there is even less for those who have announced their opinions would fear to render themselves suspected by so sudden a change of opinion if this objection were solid it would lead to the conclusion that everything should be unpremeditated in political assemblies—that the object of deliberations should not be previously known and that the only mode of guaranteeing their integrity is to take them unawares and to separate them from all communication from without english practice there is a fixed hour for beginning the sittings there is none for their termination hence debates which excite great interest have sometimes lasted from twelve to fifteen hours and even beyond that the inconveniences which result from this practice are sufficiently numerous but there is no danger at least with regard to projects of laws because the regulations secure certain delays every bill must be read three times besides being discussed in committee two adjournments are therefore necessary and there may be a greater number the sittings do not generally commence before four oclock and even later this arises from the composition of the assembly the ministers are engaged in the morning in their offices the judges and lawyers in the courts of justice a great number of merchants are necessarily occupied with their business the different committees of the house require the attendance of a multitude of persons and this service in a large city can only be conveniently rendered during the day these circumstances have caused evening sittings to be preferred notwithstanding the inconvenience of prolonging the debates far into the night—of often producing precipitation from the desire of concluding them—of affecting the health of delicate persons and of exposing this public service to the formidable concurrence of all the dissipations of a large city if the ancient usage of assembling in the morning were reestablished this change alone would necessarily change the composition of the house of commons §   duty of attendance—mischiefs resulting from nonattendance i begin with two propositions—the first that in every legislative assembly the absence of the members is an evil—the other that this evil is sufficiently great to justify a law of constraint the inconveniences may be ranged under six heads—   facility of prevarication   occasion of negligence   admission of less capable individuals   inaction of the assembly when the number requisite for the validity of its acts is not present   danger of surprises       diminution of the popular influence of the assembly   facility of prevarication—there is more than facility—there is entire security not for complete prevarication but for demiprevarication suppose a measure so bad that a deputy if he were present could not in honour refrain from voting against it does he fear to offend a protector a minister or a friend he absents himself his duty is betrayed but his reputation is not compromised every voter produces by his vote two equal and distinct effects he deprives one party of his vote and gives it to the other the absent produces only one of these effects but there is always half the mischief   negligence—is one obliged to vote upon all questions it is natural to pay some attention to them to make ones self acquainted with them lest we become absolute ciphers in the assembly but this feeling of honour does not exist when individuals may freely absent themselves they will abandon their duty rather than compromise themselves—they will give themselves up to indolence and the more they neglect their business the less will they be qualified to engage in it   admission of less capable individuals—so soon as an employment becomes a source of consideration and of power without imposing any restraint it will be sought after—will be bought and sold by men who have neither inclination nor power to render themselves useful in it such places will often become the appanage of fortune and dignity but if it be requisite assiduously to discharge their functions the little motives of vanity will not outweigh the bonds of labour we shall only find among the candidates those who discover in these public duties some particular attractions—and though inclination for an employment does not prove talent for its discharge there is no better pledge of aptitude for the labour than the pleasure which accompanies it   inaction for want of the number required—this evil is connected with the preceding so soon as the places are occupied by men who only love the decorations they afford they will neglect to attend at least upon ordinary occasions it will become necessary to fix a quota for forming an assembly and this expedient will itself produce many days of inaction   danger of surprises—we may consider as a surprise every proposition the success of which has resulted from absence and which would have been rejected in the full assembly   diminution of influence—public opinion in a representative government is naturally disposed to conform itself to the wish of the assembly and requires only to know it but will the wish of the whole assembly be the wish of that portion from which the decision emanates it is this which becomes more problematical in proportion as this part is less than the whole is the part absent greater than that which is present the public knows not to which to adhere in every state of the case the incomplete assembly will have less influence than the complete assembly §   means of insuring attendance i confine myself here to the general idea the first of these means would consist in requiring of each member a deposit at the commencement of each quarter of a certain sum for each day of sitting in the quarter this deposit to be returned to him at the end of the term deduction being made of the amount deposited for each day for every day he was absent if the members receive a salary this salary should be placed in deposit subject to being retained in the same manner this retention should always take place without exception even in those cases in which there are the most legitimate excuses for absence this plan may at first appear singular but this is only because it is new this however is not a feasible objection to it if it be particularly efficacious it belongs to that class of laws which execute themselves if instead of this retention you establish an equal fine—there then becomes necessary an accuser—a process a judgment on the other hand the deduction is not liable to uncertainty—it operates after a simple calculation and does not bear the character of a penal law emoluments are the price of service—is there any ground of complaint if they are attached to the rendering of service if the employment be of a kind to be undertaken without salary the chance of losing a part of the deposit ought to be regarded as the price of the place to admit any cases of exception would be to alter the nature of this instrument its essence consists in its inflexibility—admit excuses you admit fraud you admit favour refusal to receive them would become an affront—you would substitute a penal for a remuneratory arrangement but it may be said in case of sickness is it right to add to this natural misfortune another factitious evil yes upon so important an occasion the professional man the artisan are subject to the same losses at the price of this single inconvenience contraventions without end are prevented the public service is secured which could not be secured by any means more easy and manageable this expedient itself will not suffice it is necessary to add to it a coercive punishment for it is always necessary to come to this to     give effect to the laws i only propose one day of arrest for each contravention it being always understood that every legitimate excuse for absence is admissible as a ground of exemption from this punishment this is necessary for constraining a class of persons upon whom the loss of the deposit would have only an uncertain influence the rich are often led by vanity to make pecuniary sacrifices they would not be indisposed to acquire an honourable office even though it were expensive provided they were not compelled to attend to its duties they might even glory in the infraction of a rule when the punishment was only a pecuniary fine hence there would perhaps be formed two classes in the assembly—those who were paid for their functions and those who paid for not fulfilling them and as wealth sets the fashion it might happen that a kind of degradation would be reflected upon the useful and laborious class a punishment is therefore necessary which should be the same for everybody—a slight but inevitable punishment it is true that excuses would be admissible but it is not to be expected that for the purpose of avoiding the inconvenience of one days arrest any one would compromise his honour by a lie these means should also be strengthened by a register in which every case of absence should be specified the name of the absent member should be inscribed therein with the date of his absence in order to indicate the sitting or sittings from which he was absent the excuses he has made or the days during which he was subject to arrest this memorial should be printed at the end of every session the power of granting leave ought not to exist this power would soon reduce the demand which was made of it to a mere formality if this regulation had existed in the roman senate the letters of cicero would not have contained so many bitter complaints against those senators who left him to strive alone against corruption and intrigue that they might enjoy their pleasure in voluptuous repose or rather that they might avoid compromising themselves and might prevaricate without danger §   british practice in relation to attendance in order to perceive how far this abuse of absenting themselves may be carried it is only necessary to consider what happens in england in the house of commons out of     members the presence of  0 is required to constitute a house and often this number is not found its annals offer few examples of a sitting in which onefifth of the whole number was not wanting an opinion may hence be formed of the ordinary attendance the two parties in this assembly are composed of persons to whom their parliamentary functions are only a secondary object setting aside the official personages and the heads of the opposition who seek to succeed them there remain lawyers merchants and men of the world who unless they have a particular interest in the question only attend the house as a show for the purpose of varying their amusements at the invitation of the slightest pleasure they leave the house it is these persons who in general compose the class whose votes are the object of dispute to the two parties and to whom they address their pleadings is this the fault of individuals no since in this respect as well as in every other men are what the laws make them to be the laws which exist for the prevention of this abuse are well calculated to be inefficacious in ancient times there was a statute of fines first five pounds afterwards ten and afterwards forty c this mode is gone by—there remains only imprisonment in the custody of the sergeantatarms this implies a sufficiently heavy ransom under the name of fees but even this punishment scarcely exists except as a threat it cannot take place but upon a call of the house as if a constant duty ought only to be performed at certain periods and in the case of a call of the house any excuse solid or frivolous vague or particular is sufficient to prevent the infliction of this punishment it is not possible to expect that the tribunal will be severe when all the judges are interested in the contravention of the laws neither can it be expected that a political body will make efficacious laws for the prevention of abuses in the continuance of which each member finds his account unless compelled to do so by the force of public opinion it must be acknowledged that this habitual negligence which has destroyed every other assembly has its palliatives which diminish its evil effects and which are peculiar to the parliamentary régime the division into two parties has insensibly led them to allow themselves to be represented by a certain portion of each each portion is as the whole in questions of importance—that is to say of an importance relative to the party—the chiefs give the signal and the members come up in mass there is little danger of surprise because the principal motions are announced beforehand and because all the ministerial measures pass through many stages upon different days if the decision taken by the small number be contrary to the wish of the majority they assemble in force the day following and abrogate the work of the previous day     §   of the practice of requiring a certain number to form a house with good regulations against absence there would be no necessity for a recurrence to this instrument its principal use is to contribute indirectly to the compelling an appearance is the fixed number deficient business is retarded public opinion is thought of an uproar is dreaded those who direct the assembly are obliged to take pains to obtain the attendance of the requisite number and rigorous methods have an excuse if the negligence become extreme this fixed quota is the last expedient to which recourse should be had with this view since the suspension of business oftentimes produced by it is nothing more than a punishment inflicted upon the constituents when the representatives only are in fault it appears at first extremely singular that the power of the whole assembly should be thus transferred to so small a portion it arises from the circumstance that abstraction made of intentional surprise nothing more is to be feared from a fraction of the assembly than from the total number allowances being made for the differences of individual talents—as is the whole so is each part if there be no disposition on the part of the whole to prevaricate there is no reason to attribute this disposition to any portions of the whole besides responsibility with regard to the public is always the same it might be apprehended that where parties existed those who found themselves one day in superior force would abuse this superiority to the production of a decree contrary to the will of the majority but this danger is not great for the majority of tomorrow would reverse the decree of the past day and the victory usurped by the weaker party would be changed into a disgraceful defeat the general advantage in case of absence is altogether on the side of the executive power it is this which is always in activity—it is this which has all the particular means of influence for securing the assiduity of its partisans §   visitors—mode of admission we have seen in the chapter on publicity the reasons for admitting a certain portion of the public to the sittings of the assembly and we have pointed out the cases of exception the number admitted ought to be as great as possible without injury to the facility of speaking and hearing—a principal consideration which reduces the size of the place of assembly to dimensions much less than those of an ordinary theatre since there ought not to be required of a deputy of the people the strength of voice and the declamation of an actor the experience of france has shown other dangers arising from the number of spectators equalling or exceeding that of the assembly it is true that these dangers might have been prevented by a severe police but this police is more difficult to be maintained in proportion as the number is large besides there are some men who surrounded with the popularity of the moment would be more engaged with the audience than with the assembly and the discussion would take a turn more favourable to the excitements of oratory than to logical proofs it would be proper in the distribution of these places to allow a particular seat for the shorthand writers another to students of the laws who would find there a school and models another for magistrates whose presence would be doubly useful it would be proper also to keep certain places in reserve at the disposal of the president for ambassadors and strangers who would carry from this exhibition advantageous impressions respecting the nation which would fructify in noble minds cyneas left rome more impressed with respect by his view of the senate than by all the magnificence of the court of persia with regard to places in the public seats they should be paid for this arrangement is most favourable to equality in a case where equality is justice if you allow them to be taken by the first comers when there is a large concourse many persons will be disappointed the strongest and the rudest will have all the advantage in the struggle the gallery would be filled with spectators who would be the least profited by the debates and who have the most to lose by the cessation of their labours their number and their want of education would often lead them to brave the anger of the assembly and to disturb its deliberations by their approbations or their murmurs if the granting of tickets of admission were in the hands of the government there would not be persons wanting who would accuse it of partiality and dangerous intention there they would say the ministers have surrounded us with their creatures in order to restrain our deliberations c this subject of discontent would be removed by giving the tickets of admission to the members themselves and i see only one objection to this it would restrict the prerogative of publicity instead of extending it by making a common right degenerate into a personal favour and thus opposing the principle of equality without any advantage†     a price of admission unites all the conditions it is an imperfect measure it is true but it is the only possible one of the value attached to this enjoyment it is also a proof of a condition in life which guarantees a respectable class of spectators this plan i acknowledge is not a noble one but the employment of the produce may ennoble it whilst as respects those witicisms which may be borrowed from the language of the theatre they must be expected and disregarded ought females to be admitted no i have hesitated i have weighed the reasons for and against i would repudiate a separation which appears an act of injustice and of contempt but to fear is not to despise them removing them from an assembly where tranquil and cool reason ought alone to reign is avowing their influence and it ought not to wound their pride the seductions of eloquence and ridicule are most dangerous instruments in a political assembly admit females—you add new force to these seductions and before this dramatic and impassioned tribunal a discussion which only possessed the merits of depth and justice would yield to its learned author only the reputation of a wearisome lecturer all the passions touch and enkindle each other reciprocally the right of speaking would often be employed only as a means of pleasing but the direct method of pleasing female sensibility consists in showing a mind susceptible of emotion and enthusiasm everything would take an exalted tone brilliant or tragical—excitement and tropes would be scattered everywhere it would be necessary to speak of liberty in lyric strains and to be poetic with regard to those great events which require the greatest calmness no value would be put but upon those things which are bold and strong that is but upon imprudent resolutions and extreme measures among the english where females have so little influence in political affairs—where they seek so little to meddle with them—where the two sexes are accustomed to separate for a time even after familiar repasts—females are not permitted to be present at the parliamentary debates they have been excluded from the house of commons after the experiment has been tried and for weighty reasons it has been found that their presence gave a particular turn to the deliberations—that selflove played too conspicuous a part—that personalities were more lively—and that too much was sacrificed to vanity and wit chapter v of the presidents and vicepresidents belonging to political assemblies §   of the office of president rules rule   in every political assembly there ought at all times to be some one person to preside     rule   in a permanent assembly that function is best provided for by a permanent president in chief with substitutes of equal permanency in such number that in case of absence or disability the place of the chief may at the instant be supplied the president ought to be permanent not only that the embarrassment arising from multiplied elections may be avoided but especially for the good of his office if permanent he will possess more experience he will know the assembly better he will be more conversant with business and will feel more interested in managing it well than an occasional president the occasional president whether he execute his office well or ill must lose it the permanent president who will only lose his office if he discharge it ill has an additional motive for performing all his duties well rule   in the character of president no more than one person ought to officiate at a time if there are two whenever there arises any difference of opinion between them there will be no decision if there are more than two they will form a little assembly which will have its debates which will uselessly prolong the business in hand rule   but two persons at least capable of officiating ought to be present at once this rule is necessary in order to prevent the assembly from being reduced to a state of inaction from the sickness death or absence of its president the omission of so simple and important a precaution announces so great a want of foresight that it could hardly be thought that men would be guilty of it if a striking example were not exhibited by one of the greatest and most ancient of political assemblies §   functions competent and incompetent rule   the functions that belong properly to a president belong to him in one or other of two capacities that of a judge as between individual members or that of agent of the whole assembly—as judge when there is a dispute for him to decide upon as agent where there is anything for him to do without dispute rule   as judge a president ought in every instance to be subordinate in the way of appeal to the assembly itself sitting under another presidence rule   as agent he ought in every instance to be subject to the controul of the assembly and that instanter as to everything transacted in the face of the assembly rule   in neither capacity ought he to possess any power the effect of which would be to give him a controul in any degree over the will of the assembly rule   in a numerous assembly† and in particular in a numerous legislative assembly a president ought not to be a member that is he ought not to possess a right either to make motions to take part in a debate or to give a vote this exclusion is as much for his advantage as for that of the body over which he presides—       it leaves him entirely at liberty to attend to his duties and the cultivation of the particular talents which they require if he be called to sustain the character and reputation of a member of the assembly he will be often distracted from his principal occupation and he will have a different kind of ambition from that which belongs to his office without reckoning the danger of not succeeding of offending and of weakening his personal consideration by illsustained pretensions   this exclusion is founded upon reasons of an elevated nature it is designed to guarantee him from the seductions of partiality and to raise him even above suspicion by never exhibiting him as a partisan in the midst of the debates in which he is required to interfere as a judge—to leave him in possession of that consideration and confidence which alone can secure to his decisions the respect of all parties but it may be said that the president no more than any one else can remain neuter with regard to questions which interest the whole nation—obliged especially as he is to be continually occupied with them even as matter of duty that it would therefore be better that he should be obliged to declare himself and make known his real sentiments and thus put the assembly upon its guard rather than that he should enjoy under a false appearance of impartiality a confidence which he does not merit to this objection there is more than one answer first it cannot be denied that so long as his internal sentiments have no undue influence upon his external conduct they are of no consequence to the assembly but that he cannot declare them without becoming less agreeable to one party—without exposing himself to a suspicion of partiality which always more or less alters the degree of confidence secondly if you permit him to remain impartial he will be so more easily than any one else he will regard the debates under altogether a different point of view from that of the debaters themselves his attention principally directed to the maintenance of form and order will be withdrawn from the principal subject the ideas which occupy his mind during a debate may differ from those which occupy the actors in it as much as the thoughts of a botanist who looks at a field may differ from those of its owner habit facilitates these sorts of abstraction if it were not so how could judges full of humanity fix their attention with a perfect impartiality upon a point of law whilst a trembling family stood waiting beneath their eyes the issue of their judgment it follows from what has been said that in a numerous political assembly in which it is to be expected that passion and animosity may arise that he who is called upon to moderate them ought not to be obliged to enrol himself under the banners of a party to make himself friends and enemies to pass from the character of a combatant to that of an arbitrator and to compromise by these opposite functions the respect due to his public character there have been assemblies which have only given a vote to the president when the votes have been found equal this mode is more opposed to impartiality than that of allowing him to vote in all cases and there is no reason which can be assigned in its favour the most simple and natural plan to adopt in case of equality is to consider that the proposition which has not had the majority of votes is rejected in matters of election it would be better to resort to lot than to give the preponderant voice to the president the lot offends nobody §   sequel choice rule  0 in a legislative assembly or any other free and numerous political assembly a president ought in every case to be chosen freely and exclusively by the assembly over which he is to preside rule    in the choice of a president the votes ought to be taken in the secret way and the majority ought to be an absolute one rule    a president ought ever to remain removable by the assembly at its free pleasure but not by any other authority rule    in a permanent assembly on the occasion of choosing a permanent president if there be no other president in office it may be better to accept a president pro re natâ from without doors upon the ground of any claim however slight if single than to stand in that instance upon its liberty of choice† rule    so for all kinds of business in an assembly which however free is but occasional‡ §   general observations a very simple observation will furnish a clue to all the reasons that can be produced or required in support of the propositions   0 above laid down throughout the whole business the grand problem is to obtain in its most genuine purity the real and enlightened will of the assembly the solution of this problem is the end that ought everywhere to be had in view to this end everything that concerns the president ought of course to be subservient it is for the sake of the assembly and for their use alone that the institution of this office is either necessary or proper the duty and art of the president of a political assembly is the duty and art of the accoucheur ars obstetrix animorum to use an expression of the first encyclopedist and his not unworthy successors—to assist nature and not to force her—to soothe upon occasion the pangs of parturition—to produce in the shortest time the genuine offspring but never to stifle it much less to substitute a changeling in its room it is only in as far as it may be conformable to the will of the assembly that the will of this officer can as such have any claim to regard if in any instance a person dignified with any such title as that of president of such or such an assembly possess any independent influence such influence proper or improper belongs to him not in his quality of president but in some foreign character any influence whatever that he possesses over the acts of the assembly otherwise than subject to the immediate controul of the assembly is just so much power taken from the assembly and thrown into the lap of this single individual it follows that nothing ought to be permitted by the assembly to be done by a president that the assembly itself could do in the same space of time in the case of an assembly and its president we see judicial power in the simplest form in which it can exist and in the simplest set of circumstances in which it can be placed the judge single the parties acting all the while under his eye complaint judgment execution treading with instantaneous rapidity on the heels of contravention happy the suitor if in the other cases of procedure instead of complication and delay this simplicity of situation and celerity of dispatch had been taken for the standard of comparison and model of imitation by the founders and expositors of law the regulations which have been proposed above appear so simple and so suitable that it is natural to suppose that they would have presented themselves to all political assemblies but if we proceed to consider what has been practised among different nations we shall find that almost all these rules have been forgotten the english system which most nearly approaches to them differs in an essential point it allows the president to deliberate and vote all establishments have commenced in the times of ignorance the first institutions could only be attempts more or less defective but when experience renders their inconveniences sensible the spirit of routine opposes itself to reform and also prevents our perceiving the true sources of the evil chapter vi of the mode of proceeding in a political assembly in the formation of its decisions §   introductory observations the subject we are now about to engage in is in its own nature abstract intricate and obscure of these undesirable qualities in the     subject but too strong a tincture must inevitably be imbibed by the work to judge by the celerity with which a motion is oftentimes made and an order framed in consequence     the path may at first glance appear short and simple but in this as in other instances practice may be short and simple where description and discussion are tedious and involved to put in action the whole muscular system is the work but of an instant but to describe the parts concerned in that action and the different modifications it admits of is to exhaust the stores of a copious and recondite science for affording a clue to this labyrinth at the first entrance no expedient seemed to promise better than that of singling out and laying before the reader at one view the essential points upon which the due conduct of the business seemed principally to turn suggesting at the same time such regulations as the dictates of utility seemed to prescribe in relation to those points chronological order the order of the incidents has for this purpose been broken in upon lest these points of primary importance should have been lost as it were in the multitude of less essential details but though broken in upon it is not anywhere reversed and in the subsequent discussions strict order will reassume its empire on these few points turn the essential differences between the british and what as far as i have been able to learn has been the french practice in this line in these points too if the reasoning which the reader will find as he advances be not erroneous resides the singular excellence or rather exclusive fitness of the former mode in matters of inferior importance invention has been set to work in these though equally disposed to have hazarded invention i have found nothing to do but to copy† in this byecorner an observing eye may trace the original seedplot of english liberty it is in this hitherto neglected spot that the seeds of that invaluable production have germinated and grown up to their present maturity scarce noticed by the husbandman and unsuspected by the destroyer the importance of these uninviting forms is no finespun speculation—no fanciful conceit political liberty depends everywhere upon the free action and frequent and genuine manifestation of the public will but the free action and genuine manifestation of that will depend upon the mode of proceeding observed in going through the several steps that must be taken before any such result can be produced without any such regulations as those here insisted on—in short without any regulations at all—a general will or pretended general will may come now and then to be declared but of what sort such an one as the will of him who gives his purse to save his life or signs a deed he never read or takes an oath with an et cætera at the end of it is to the free and enlightened will of the individual without rules the power of the assembly either evaporates in ineffectual struggles or becomes a prey to the obstinate and overbearing detur fortiori or rather robustiori would be its proper motto unanimity may glitter on the surface but it is such unanimity as famine and imprisonment extort from an english jury in a system of welldigested rules such as the english practice with little improvement would supply will be found the only buckler of defence that reflection can have against precipitancy moderation against violence modesty against arrogance veracity against falsehood simplicity against deception and intrigue without discipline public spirit stands as poor a chance in a numerous assembly as valour in the field happily the peaceful branch though hitherto less understood than the military is neither quite so difficult to learn nor quite so burthensome to practise the essential articles of it will be found comprised within the compass of a page it is the want of such a general will the natural effect of the total want of discipline that has been the great cause of the inefficiency and inutility so justly imputed to all former assemblies of the statesgeneral of france or to speak correctly it is in the nonformation of such will—in the perpetual failure of whatever efforts have been excited by the desire of forming one that this inefficiency has consisted but a political body lives only by the manifestation of its will here then intelligence is power and to administer intelligence is to give life the spirit of the people the generosity of its superior classes the unexampled virtue of the sovereign and the wisdom of the minister all concur in promising to france a constitution which may soon be an object of     envy if it is not of imitation to great britain but inestimable as such a blessing would be the benefit derivable from it will be found to hang upon so slender and to many an eye imperceptible a thread as the system of tactics or the nosystem which in the form of their proceedings the regenerated assembly may happen to embrace the pains employed in the construction of this great instrument of public felicity will prove but lost labour if the only true method of working with it remains unpractised powerful talents and publicspirited dispositions comprise the utmost good which the best possible constitution can produce but of what avail are talents and dispositions so long as either no decision is formed or none that answers to its name considerations of such essential importance as i shall have occasion to bring to view can scarcely indeed at this interesting crisis and at this era of inquiry have escaped altogether the researches of an acute and ingenious nation and the labours of many a pen better suited to the task have probably been employed ere now upon this great object but as the success with which the public is served depends upon the use which each man makes of his own powers and not upon the reliance he places on those of other men—as this like any other subject may profit by being exhibited by different writers in different points of view—and as the mention of these more striking articles would be necessary were it only to save the chain of reasoning that connects the whole from appearing broken and obscure the importance of them did not seem a sufficient warrant for the omission either of the provisions themselves or of any part of the reasoning by which that importance is holden up to view in my endeavours to communicate such lights as my researches may be able to throw upon the subject the following is in general the method i pursue—in the first place are exhibited such regulations relative to each head as the dictates of utility appear to recommend in the next place are subjoined in the way of question and answer the reasons by which such provisions came recommended to my notice after that follows a view of the british practice relative to the points in question after that again a view of what i have been able to collect relative to the french practice the justification and confirmation of which where it appears right—the correction of it where it appears wrong—and the completion of it where it appears deficient is the principal object of the present work lastly where occasion seemed to require a few general observations are subjoined containing such remarks as could not conveniently be brought under any of the former heads particularly for the sake of placing different branches of the subject in a comprehensive and comparative point of view for the purpose of giving an idea of the french practice relative to these points the fairest specimen and that which would have rendered every other of small importance would have been that of the statesgeneral of france but of this practice it seems to be agreed that no documents are to be found one may even see à priori that nothing of the kind could well have had existence between the want of efficiency and the want of form the connexion is in this instance so natural that in default of positive proofs either of those circumstances might serve as a presumptive evidence of the other if their proceedings had been attended with any effect we should have seen the mode in which they proceeded if their mode of proceeding had been in any tolerable degree suited to the purpose of giving birth to a general will a general will would at times have been formed and being formed would have been productive of some effect nihil fecit is the phrase in which some of the monkish historians have comprised the history of several of their kings† the same history with a small addition may serve for all their national assemblies nihil fecerunt gives the catalogue of their acts nullo modo the form of then procedure failing this source of intelligence the next one should naturally turn to is the practice of the few provincial states of ancient institution still subsisting in that great empire‡ from the journals of these assemblies if made public intelligence more or less satisfactory relative to this head could not but be afforded but unfortunately i have not been able to hear of any such publication and from circumstances i am strongly led to think no such publication has ever been made the only remaining source is that afforded by the modern provincial assemblies instituted at first in two provinces only∥ by way of experiment in the years      and      and at length in the year      communicated to the whole kingdom the regimen established in these assemblies if it does not give the most ancient mode of proceeding known in france gives what for the purposes of instruction is much more valuable the latest     it is more so in as much as through this medium may be obtained some sort of oblique view of the mode of proceeding observed in the old established provincial states for in drawing up a code of regulations for the first instituted of the provincial assemblies those established for the provincial states compose the model which the committee employed on that business expressly declare themselves to have taken for the basis of their work in this code adding to it the materials furnished by the succeeding establishments of the same kind we may therefore view the quintessence of that part of the national stock of wisdom which has applied itself to this important subject partly for shortness partly for precisions sake i have chosen all along as far as the nature of the case would give leave to exhibit the proposed regulations in the very words in which they might be couched this practice which in all authoritative compositions of this nature will be seen to be absolutely necessary is in unauthoritative ones highly useful at least and convenient by specification description is saved attention arrested and expectation satisfied description however well performed leaves the main work still undone §   principal points to be attended to in the mode of proceeding relative to the formation of the acts† of a political assembly   identity of the terms of the proposition‡ with those of the act proposed   fixation of the terms of the proposition by writing   unity of the subject of debate kept inviolate   distinctness of the process of debating from that of voting   in debating no fixed order of preaudience   the votes given not one after another but all at once∥ regulations proposed relative to the above points article i nothing shall be deemed to be the act of the assembly that has not been proposed in and to the assembly by a motion made for that purpose put to the vote and adopted by the majority of the votes† art ii every proposition designed to give birth to an act of the assembly shall be exhibited in writing by the mover and conceived in the very terms neither more nor fewer by which it is designed such act should stand expressed‡ art iii a proposition of any kind having been once received—until that proposition has been disposed of no other motion shall be made unless for one or other of three purposes—   to offer an amendment to the proposition already on the carpet   to propose a mode of putting an end to the business without decision or   to reclaim the execution of some law of order at the instant of its infringement art iv the process of debating and that of voting are distinct processes nor shall the latter be entered upon till after the former is gone through art v in debating no member after the author of the motion shall have the right of speaking before any other∥ but he who first offers himself shall be first heard§ or else the competition for preaudience shall be decided by lot¶     art vi votes when given openly shall be given not one after another but as near as may be all together §  — points i  ii motion written and in terminis questions with answers exhibiting reasons question i why nothing to be given as the act of the assembly that has not been put to the vote and carried in the assembly answer this is only saying in other words that no act of the assembly shall be forged british practice—from several orders of the house of lords made towards the beginning of the last century it should seem that about that period attempts to commit such forgeries had been made a counterfaction of this kind could not well have had for its author any other person than either the ministerial officer the clerk who has the penning of the journals or the presiding officer the speaker under whose authority and command the other acts the practice of the house of commons furnishes two examples and as far as appears but two of an incongruity the notice of which may serve by way of illustration to this rule one is that of a memorandum on the journals that the speaker by leave of the house declared it to be their sense so and so† was a motion in those words made put to the vote and carried if not no leave of the house was given no sense of the house was taken in the other supposition the history given in this memorandum which is a long and rather a perplexed one was of no use the usual introduction the word ordered or the word resolved would have been a much more intelligible one and just as proper in this case as in any other   as to the other instance at the commencement of every session immediately upon the return of the commons from the house of lords where they have been all hearing the kings speech in a place not big enough to hold a quarter of their number before any other business is done a bill in pursuance of ancient orders is read by the clerk by direction of the speaker for forms sake‡ this custom says mr hatsell∥ i understand to be nothing more than a claim of right of the commons that they are at liberty to proceed in the first place upon any thing they think material without being limited to give a preference to the subjects contained in the kings speech that such was the reason may be and upon the strength of such respectable authority i suppose is very true but such a form is as absurd in itself as incompetent to the end this thing called a bill what title can it be said to have to that name the clerk reads it because the speaker orders him whence comes it from the lords not so for as yet they have done nothing any more than the commons from the speaker but he has no right to make so much as a motion for leave to bring in a bill much less to bring in a bill without leave a bill is a composition presented by some member the thing here called a bill is a child without a father born like melchisedec in the way of equivocal generation the case seems to be that at the time this order was established no clear idea of the mode of generation of an act of the house seems to have been as yet formed it was not as yet understood that a composition to be an act of the house—that is of all or a majority of the members—must if it took its rise in the house have begun by being the act of some one member but to appear to be the act of some member it must have been exhibited by him as such and to make such exhibition is to make a motion years after this period or these periods take any of them in the house of lords as we have just been seeing things would be starting up pretending to be acts of the house—orders resolutions rules—nobody knew how there seems to be but too much ground for apprehending that this may still be liable to be the case in the french practice but of this a little further on make what one will of it being no act of the house it is no exertion of any right of the house it answers not that purpose any more than any other the right in question so far from receiving any support from this futile form neither requires nor admits of any support whatever it exists of necessity in the first instance it follows from the very constitution of that and every other political assembly nothing can be done—nothing can be expressed by the house without being done without being expressed at some time or other by some member of the house expressed either viva voce or by writing or in some other mode no matter what—say for instance viva voce by speaking but when a man is up to speak who shall say what it is he will speak abstraction     made of any antecedent rule he speaks not to the business offered to the house by the king but to that or any other business as he thinks fit for the house therefore to be in possession of this right there can need nothing but the nonexistence of a rule to the contrary the futility of this form appeared on the same recent occasion on which the establishment of it was recognised on the   th of november      before this pretended bill was read mr wilkes and mr george grenville start up together—mr wilkes to tell his own story about a breach of privilege and mr grenville then minister with a message on the same subject from the king great debates which should be heard first—mr wilkess speech mr grenvilles speech or the bill it was carried at last in favour of the bill what was got by this the house had the pleasure of hearing this bill and then there was the same matter to settle—who should be heard first—mr wilkes or mr grenville as before question ii why in writing answer   because it is only by writing that the tenor of any discourse can be fixed for any length of time   it is only by such fixation that it can be ascertained that the draught exhibited is capable of standing as a resolution of the assembly in the very words in which it is proposed question iii why put into writing by him who makes it and not by any one else answer   because no third person can so well tell what it is a man means as he himself can if the words of it as committed to writing are chosen by anybody else the utmost accuracy it can aspire to in the hands of such third person is the being as exactly representative of the meaning of the avowed author of the motion as if he himself had chosen them but the chances are rather against its possessing that extreme degree of accuracy and were they ever so much in favour of it yet so long as there is the smallest chance on the other side such chance will form a conclusive reason against the committing the business of penning the motion to anybody else   to save time between the penner and the author where they are different persons a conversation of some sort must be carried on this conversation may and frequently must occasion discussions and disputes the sense of the author may be perverted by accident or design or where no such perversion takes place or was intended it may be suspected all this while business must be at a stand and the assembly sitting to no purpose let it be of the movers penning and while he is about it no part of the assemblys time is taken up he may have penned it out of the house and ought so to do as will be seen farther on whenever it can be done   to promote maturity of composition—if the author of a motion is permitted to rely on a third person for the penning of it such permission will be liable to produce hasty indigested motions the impropriety of which the author himself had he been obliged to put them to writing might have discovered writing summons up the attention to apply itself to the discourse written and furnishes it with a fixed subject whoever in any instance has corrected what he had once written may find in that single instance a reason fully sufficient to justify the establishment of this rule question iv why in the very words in which when made an act of the assembly it is proposed to stand answer   because no other terms can express with the certainty of being accurate the object which the author of the motion proposes to the house the composition given as the act of the assembly is not really its act any otherwise than as far as it is the very composition which those whose votes form the decision of the assembly have given their votes in favour of if the discourse they had voted for differs in a single word for example from the discourse exhibited by the author of the motion then as to such word it is not of his penning which as has just been proved it ought to be the only discourse they can have meant to adopt the only discourse they can all of them and from the beginning have had under view is to a word the very discourse presented to them by the mover if the resolution given in their name by any one else—the secretary for instance or the president—differs from that original in a single word it is pro tanto a forgery i say in a single word for every one knows that in a single word may be comprised the most important alterations take for instance the word not† british practice—in every art the proper mode how simple soever and how incontestably soever when once hit upon and clearly stated it appears to be a proper one and even the only proper one is seldom the one pitched upon at first     in the british house of commons it was the ancient practice we are informed by mr hatsell for the speaker to collect the sense of the house from the debate and from thence to form a question on which to take the opinion of the house but this adds he has been long discontinued and at present the usual and almost universal method is for the member who moves a question to put it into writing and deliver it to the speaker who when it has been seconded proposes it to the house and then the house are said to be in possession of the question from lord clarendons account of his exploits in the character of chairmen of a committee† there appears some reason to suspect that at that time the practice spoken of in the above passage still subsisted otherwise it is not easy to conceive how that able statesman could have done so much mischief as be boasts of the way he took was amongst other things to report which he says he frequently did two or three votes directly contrary to each other he must therefore have contributed more or less to the making of them so or the entanglement he speaks of would not in any degree have been what he boasts of its being his work whatever had been their contrariety had they been moved in terminis and in writing by their respective authors it would not have been in his power to have had any share in it that such at any rate was the practice in the year    0 two or three and twenty years before the period lord clarendon speaks of appears from the commons journal of that year in which on an occasion where the speakers conduct had been the subject of animadversion in the course of the debates amongst other charges is that of a practice he was in of intricating the question and another of his having made many plausible motions abortive‡ french practice—provincial assemblies—what the practice has been in the french     assemblies of old standing such as the provincial states and the chambers of parliament does not appear in a direct way from any documents i have been able to meet with the affectation of secresy which till the present auspicious period has pervaded the whole system of french as in general of monarchical government keeps everything of this sort under a cloud but of the general practice and notions on this head the regimen prescribed to or imagined by the lately instituted provincial assemblies affords pretty good presumptive evidence and that evidence shows the practice in this respect to have been pretty much on a par with the english at the time spoken of by lord clarendon that is about a century and a half ago the reports of the committees says an author who has given us a general account of the constitution discipline and proceedings of these assemblies the reports of the committees are made with a good deal of care after having well settled the question an account is given of the different opinions avis of the effect produced by such and     such an opinion opinion of the number of persons who concurred in it of those who differed from it and why of the reasons motifs which occasioned each proposition to be adopted or rejected in part or in the whole in short of the opinions avis which prevailed generally or of that which was adopted this method adds the author ought always to be that of a committee the assembly names them not to pronounce a decision but to elucidate an affair and put the assembly in a way to judge this elaborate and careful plan which according to the authors notion ought to be the plan of every committee affords a pretty strong presumption that in those assemblies supposing this account to be a just one the simple principle of giving a determinate existence in writing to every proposition and so proceeding either to receive that proposition with or without amendments or to reject it was not known the resolutions of the meeting to judge from this account are jumbled with the minutes of the proceedings and the accounts of the debates in the conception of the author they are unquestionably as this is a subject of the first importance to the precision of the proceedings in the great national assembly to which it is my ambition to be of use to the genuineness as well as clearness of the results and to the efficacious development of their powers it may be worth while to give this account a pretty minute consideration for the purpose of comparing the proceedings as here described with the standard above laid down   after having well settled the question—après avoir bien pose la question what question the question meaning the motion or proposition in question if delivered in in writing by the author himself can neither require to be settled nor admit of it it has settled itself it may require amending indeed but that is a very different operation from settling   after having well settled the question an account is given of the different opinions upon it—on rend compte des differens avis what are these opinions—these avis they are not decisions upon the question they are not votes given towards forming such decision each question when put upon a single motion can admit of but one of two decisions—adoption or rejection each vote can admit of but one of three modifications—for the question against the question or neuter aris is perhaps here put for argument—argument used in course of the debate   account is given of the effect which such or such an opinion produced—de leffet qua produit telle ou telle opinion—a further reason for supposing that avis as well as opinion here means argument the effect that a decision produces requires no account—no separate account it produces the adoption of the resolution proposed or the rejection of it the resolution if adopted needs no account—it speaks for itself it not only does not stand in need of any account—it admits of none a composition given under that name if it be in the same terms with those of the resolution is not an account of that resolution but the thing itself if in different terms then so far as the difference extends the account it gives is a false one a vote if that were meant by avis and opinion requires not any more than the decision it has produced or failed of producing any account it is given one way or the other and the effect of it appears by the decision—by the adoption or rejection of the resolution proposed   of the number of the persons that concurred in it in such opinion or argument—of those who differed from it and why—de celles qui sen sont éloignées et pourquoi this why this pourquoi i must confess i know not very well what to make of i thought the opinions or avis had been themselves the arguments and included the reasons those pourquois then must have been the reasons of those reasons   of the reasons motifs which occasioned a proposition to be adopted or rejected in part or in the whole—des motifs qui ont fait adopter une proposition en partie ou en total the perplexity gets thicker and thicker here we have not only reasons upon reasons but reasons upon them for motifs must surely here as in french it does commonly when spoken of with reference to an opinion mean reasons—it cannot mean what in english we term motives it can never have been meant that in these committees the several members get up and render an account of the motives that have given birth to their respective votes saying one of them it was patriotism another it was the love of reputation another it was sympathy for the proposer another it was antipathy to the opposers another it was the hope of gaining a personal advantage by it that determined me as little is it likely that the penner of the report should have taken upon himself thus to answer for each mans motives   lastly of the opinions avis which prevailed generally or of that which was adopted—enfin des avis qui ont prévalu généralement ou de celui qui a été adopté this is still more perplexing than before what means this opposition between prevailing generally and being adopted and how is it that the opinions which may prevail generally are several while the opinion that can   0 be adopted is but one if by avis is meant here décisions—decisions of adoption or rejection on different questions you may have certainly as many decisions—in short one or other of exactly twice as many decisions as there are questions if by avis is meant here opinions given separately by the different members upon occasion of the same subject—discourses delivered which if adopted by the assembly would have been so many resolutions of opinion—these if never put to the vote are not acts of the meeting—acts of the body but mere acts of the individuals yet after all of this set of opinions there is it seems according to this author one and but one which has been adopted has it then been adopted it is then an act of the committee—a resolution of opinion passed by the committee on the other hand if only one of the set has been adopted how is it that the rest—which since they are thus constructed with that one must it should seem have been opposite and contrary to it—can have been generally received a proposition cannot be said to have been generally received by a meeting of any kind if it has not been received by a majority and if it has really been received by a majority how can it fail of having been adopted an account like this puts one in mind of the grammatical history of the cake—g got it and yet h had it considering this confusion as the work of the anonymous author it would not have been worth all this notice but the practice of which the éloge is thus given must surely itself have been very confused or it could scarcely have given birth to an account so perfectly confused nothing like this is to be found in the reports of any english committee i ever met with or heard of they do not report so much as their own minutes much less do they report their own debates no opinion is there given which is not the opinion of the whole is a resolution of opinion proposed if rejected no traces of it appear if adopted it is given not as the resolution of a or b but as the resolution of the committee is a statement of any affair or history of any transaction given one member it is true may have penned and proposed one part—another member another part but neither the one part nor the other would have stood in the report if they had not respectively been acceded to by a majority of the committee—if they had not each of them been the act of the whole were a composition like the one thus described presented under the name of the report of a committee to a british house of commons what would they say they would say this is no report you must go back again and make one they would send it back to be recommitted while a says one thing and b neither assenting to nor dissenting from what a has said says another this is no report of a committee the report of a committee is what is said throughout by the major part of the committee or by the whole but these it may perhaps be observed are but reports of committees the committees of which these are the reports are very small assemblies composed of a smaller number of members than what is commonly to be met with in the least numerous committees of a british house of commons the members may therefore be considered as acting in their individual capacity and the reports given under the name of such committees may be considered as reports made by individuals the reports of such committees as these may therefore be thus far informal and yet the proceedings of the entire assemblies to which these reports are made be regular and exact unfortunately the account given in the same book of the method in which the decision of the assembly itself is formed i should rather say of the paper published as the decision of such assembly seems to indicate but too plainly that the only simple and true method of forming such a decision is not less widely departed from in the one sort of meeting than in the other the opinion once formed by a plurality of voices votes voix says the author above quoted then comes the time for entering it writing it lécrire upon the minutes but this operation drawing up rédaction requiring a considerable time the assemblies name committeemen to perform it and the meeting of the next day opens with the extract of the minutes of the day preceding this regulation highly beneficial as it is since it saves time may be productive however of a mischief if this account be just it is impossible that the principle of the identity between the motion and the act of the assembly should have been observed in these assemblies for drawing up such act no committee could have been either necessary or of any use no time could have been saved but a great deal of time sadly wasted and consumed the act upon the only just and simple principle the nature of the case admits of is already drawn up by him who moves it to enter it upon the minutes is work—not for a committee but for a copying clerk committeemen may be of use to give a look occasionally to the journals and see whether the secretary has done his business properly that is whether he has entered all the acts and whether each of them be an exact copy of the original draught but such occasional inspection is a very different thing from their doing of that business themselves     the mischief here apprehended by the commentator is that of the assemblies in general following upon this occasion the example which in a passage which i have had occasion to quote elsewhere he takes notice of as having been set by the provincial assembly of tours this assembly it should seem had conceived it proper to see what it was their committeemen had been making them say and not to let the account thus given stand as definitive till they the assembly had heard it read to them the commentator full of diffidence of the assembly itself lest it should alter its own acts or pretended acts is as full of confidence in their committeemen it never occurs to him that either through design or misconception the latter can misrepresent or upon just grounds be suspected of misrepresenting an act which under such circumstances it must be so difficult to represent at all and which in truth can scarcely be said to have existence turn to the journals of these assemblies and what is more to the royal edicts published for the regulation of their discipline and we shall find them confirm in this respect the account given of them by their commentator in the case where divers opinions avis shall have manifested themselves the assembly says the royal edict for haute guyenne shall be obliged to reduce them to two and that which has the plurality of votes suffrages shall form the act of the assembly la délibération what must be done is done somehow or other however badly and therefore an assembly ordered by royal authority to reduce its avis whatever is meant by avis to two will contrive to do so but upon the principle of the identity of the terms of the motion and those of the resolution—and supposing only one motion upon the carpet at a time—and supposing the votes to be given upon that one no assembly could contrive to do otherwise for or against the motion—the motion adopted or rejected—there is no other alternative the truth is that these different avis which the royal penman considers as liable to be produced upon a given subject—these avis as far as they can be said to be anything seem to have been so many different propositions—so many different motions which were to be going on and debating at the same time they are not votes at least for votes suffrages it is understood are to be given upon them taking them for motions why the number of them should undergo this reduction is not by any means made apparent if all are consistent why not let them all pass into resolutions if the assembly choose it if any are inconsistent with others that are preferred the assembly one should think might be trusted to for not passing them if a man has not sense to keep him from falling into inconsistencies it is not a royal edict that will give it him the assembly accepts this regulation† adding an amendment palliating in some degree the inconvenience arising from a fixed order of speaking as hinted at on a preceding occasion‡ and more fully developed a little farther on the case which i should suppose the penner of this edict to have had in view is that of a number of motions started at the same time like candidates on an election in the english practice this can create no confusion for the one first started must be first disposed of the question can only be as to the adoption or rejection of that one the others come on afterwards as they are moved i do not say but that this method admits of improvement hereafter a regulation will be seen proposed with that view but what is the great point it thoroughly prevents that confusion which on the french method seems to be inevitable i set out with observing that to exhibit as the act of an assembly a proposition which has not been put to the vote and carried by the majority of votes in that assembly is to commit a forgery if credit may be given to an anonymous but very intelligent author∥ this forgery is in france a matter of ordinary practice it is where he has been speaking of the assembly of the statesgeneral and not only of that sovereign assembly but of the particular preparatory assemblies collected for the purpose of sending deputies and instructions to that general one resolutions avis says he are drawn up frequently when nothing has been put to the vote on rédige les avis et souvent on ne vote point §  — point iii unity of the subject of debate kept inviolate question with answers exhibiting reasons why not suffer a second proposition to be started except as excepted till a former has been disposed of answer   that in the instance of such or such a particular proposition the assembly may not by indecison with respect to that proposition be prevented from taking a course     which had its will been left free to exercise itself upon the subject it would have taken this we see is what may be at any time the case if a proposition about which the assembly had begun to occupy itself is thus permitted to be jostled as it were off the carpet by another proposition different from the former and incommensurable with it before they are aware   to prevent a degree of confusion by which for that time the assembly may be deprived of the faculty of forming any will at all without some such check nothing is more likely to happen even without design and that in any assembly much more in a newformed and numerous one and the endeavour to produce such an effect by design is one of the most effectual plans that individual fraud or conspiracy can pursue in this way a thousand propositions may be thrown out which had the assembly been left at liberty to occupy itself about them without interruption—in short had it been left master of its own will—must have passed a proposition suppose has been introduced a debate arises and in the course of the debate something is started from which somebody catches or pretends to catch the idea of something else that would be very proper to be done this something else happening to touch upon a more sensible fibre the next speaker takes this for his theme affections grow warm and crowding about this second subject the first is insensibly departed from and forgotten in the same manner a third takes place of this second and so on till mens minds are effectually confused and their whole stock of time and patience gone this divergency is what is the more liable to take place in any assembly especially in any newformed assembly inasmuch as it is what scarce ever fails to take place in private circles in this case it is productive of no sort of harm for amusement which is here the end in view is better provided for by rambling freely from subject to subject than by adhering to any one but in the case of a political assembly it is productive of the utmost harm which such an assembly as such is capable of suffering the more eligible in its nature and the more likely to have been embraced by the assembly any of these propositions may be in themselves the greater is the mischief that may result from such an irregular introduction of it introduced singly each at its proper time each one might have been carried introduced one upon the back of the other each stands in the others way—each throws another out and a confusion is raised to which they all of them fall a sacrifice at once the enforcing this law of unity and guarding it as well from intentional and insidious as unintentional violations is one of the uses that concur to evince the importance of keeping the composition which is the subject of debate exposed to the view of the whole assembly—but of this in another place british practice—as to this point so far as concerns as well the negative put by the general proposition to the introduction of extraneous matter as the choice of the exceptions the british practice is exactly conformable to the regulation above proposed but in respect of the details relative to the mode of conducting the several businesses which form the matter of those exceptions it has been deemed open to improvement in a variety of particulars which will present themselves as we advnce french practice—of the french practice relative to this point some intimation has been given under the preceding head what farther remains to be said of it will more conveniently be referred to the next the points themselves being so intimately connected and the practice relative to each being a consequence of the same principle it is next to impossible upon any one of these topics to avoid touching upon the rest §  — point iv the process of debating distinct from and prior to that of voting question with answers exhibiting reasons why not allow any vote to be given till the debate is finished answer   that the decision given may not prove an improper one on the score of its having been built upon insufficient and partial grounds to vote for or against a motion is to judge—to exercise the office of a judge to speak for or against it is to exercise the function of an advocate to vote before any one else has spoken in the debate is to judge altogether without documents—altogether without grounds to vote while there still remains any one to speak who has anything to say is to judge without documents pro tanto is there any one member whose speech is to be looked upon as proper to be attended to in this view—so for the same reason must that of every other since abstraction made of the differences in point of talent between individuals—differences of which no general rules can take cognizance every mans speech presents just the same probability of affording useful lights as that of every other   that the decision given may not be exposed to the danger of proving an improper one on the score of its being expressive of a will different from the real will of the majority of the assembly conceive a list of members speaking in a fixed order and each man     giving his vote as his turn comes at the end of his speech or without making any speech as he thinks fit the first upon the list after having said what he thinks proper gives his vote all the others down to the last give their votes on the same side the last when it comes to his turn gives a contrary vote grounded on arguments which had happened to escape all the preceding voters but which when once brought to light stamp conviction in their minds what is the consequence a decision is given purporting to want but one voice of being an unanimous one but in fact contrary to the unanimous will of all the members whose decision it purports to be british practice—in all political assemblies the idea of which would be presented by that name to an englishman unacquainted with or not thinking of the state of things in france the british practice agrees perfectly with the recommendation given by this article—so perfectly that it is to the rule itself that he would probably stand indebted for the first conception of its being possible to depart from it the mode of proceeding in courts of justice on this head might indeed if considered in this point of view furnish an exception to this rule but in this point of view an englishman would not be apt to consider it the business of a court of justice standing upon a footing altogether peculiar in this respect as will be seen hereafter french practice—the french practice relative to this important point is so inextricably interwoven with the practice observed in the same country in relation to the other less important points of which the enumeration has been already made that to touch upon any one of them without encoraching upon the rest is scarcely possible the process of speaking seems scarcely to have been distinguished from that of voting or the thing called a speech from the thing called a vote even in idea the same terms opinion and avis being employed as we have been to denote indiscriminately the one or the other or both together not being distinguished in name they would remain undistinguished in exercise and each man in making his speech whether it consisted of ten words or the amount of twice as many pages would of course give his vote at the same time and that perhaps without suspecting that in so doing he was doing two different things at once but whatever each man chose to say whether barely enough to give that signification of his will which a bare vote would give or enough to make a speech of two or three hours in length it happened to be so ordered that each man should say it in a fixed order as between man and man such a member if present always speaking first—such another second—and so on precedence—that is the order of sitting—was carefully settled upon such principles as were thought the proper ones in such case and preaudience including speaking and voting—preaudience as a matter of inferior importance was made dependent on precedence from this combination—of confusion in what required order and order in what required none—results an effect which it is difficult to state with any degree of seriousness the chance a man has of gaining partisans to his opinion is proportioned not to the cogency of his arguments but to the fancied height of the place in which he sits conceive this regimen adopted by the statesgeneral consisting suppose of   00 members he who sits first may hope to persuade  0   the hopes of his next neighbour are confined to number  0   and so down to the lowest who sees nobody on whom his eloquence can make any effective impression but himself on the other hand the chance a man has of forming a right opinion is exactly in the inverse ration of the chance he has of gaining partisans to that opinion he who has it in his power to govern everybody has it not in his power to receive lights from anybody he into whose lap the collected wisdom of the whole assembly is poured in a full tide sees no one to whom he can give the benefit of illumination but himself if the ingenuity of government had employed itself in considering by what means wisdom might be most effectually disjoined from power no other method equally happy can possibly have been devised one glance more at the regulations of the provincial assemblies they will afford an instructive example or two of ingenuity and observation struggling against precedent and prejudice first comes haute guyenne strangers to the principle of the identity of the motion and the resolution grounded upon it they had found themselves entangled in manner as above noted with a multitude of avis opinions—things that were neither motions nor speeches nor votes—but something betwixt all three springing out of one subject the kings provisional code had ordered the reduction of these avis to two viz the two which after one round of avis had found the greatest number of voices in its favour the consideration of this article had suggested to the guyenne committee an imperfect view of the inconvenience of this orderly method of proceeding the avis of a member low in the scale of opinans though it was possible it might be the better of the two could not possibly have so many suffrages in its favour as that of a member higher in the scale might acquire the remedy hit upon was—not to     keep the processes of debating and voting separate—that was a step too wide from precedent and establishment to be thought of—but to have two rounds of avis then say the committee a man who upon the first round has heard the avis given subsequently to his own with the reasons that may have been produced in favour of them may upon the second turn sacrifice his own to that of somebody else that he may is not to be disputed but will he unfortunately it is not quite so easy to human pride to adopt a right opinion after having avowed its opposite as before and it such be the case between equals how must it be where the conversion cannot take place without mortifying the pride of rank as well as the pride of wisdom this step towards reason was thought it should seem too bold seven years after this period the assembly of orléans though willing to do something had not resolution however to venture quite so far† it was settled that for ordinary business there should be but one round of opinions in which a man should be allowed to develope his arts but that in matters that appeared to require discussion the president in conjunction with the first opinans of each order‡ should judge whether the matter subjected to dliberation required two rounds of opinions and that this decision should precede the délibération∥ one assembly there is in which the process of debating and that of giving the opinions are distinguished and kept separate and this is that of picardy§ the province nearest to england has on this important point come over to the english practice¶ this coincidence however can scarcely be reckoned other than fortuitous it goes no farther these opinions are the same indeterminate sort of thing or nearly so here as elsewhere they are not mere speeches indeed but they are something betwixt motions and votes they are sorts of things of which an indefinite multitude are liable to start up and which in picardy as in haute guyenne require force to reduce the number of them to two to wean a man completely from an error from which the chains of habit have rendered it difficult for him to break loose no recipe is so effectual as the indication of its source in the present instance the cause of this entanglement of two processes which in point of utility it is so necessary to keep distinct may be traced pretty successfully in two circumstances the one which however may be looked upon as rather the effect than the cause is the confusion of ideas indicated by the equivocal nomenclature already noticed the other is the junction of the two processes in the practice of courts of justice in which as we shall presently observe such a junction stands upon a very different ground and is in some cases not productive of any inconvenience and in none of any degree of inconvenience approaching to that of which it is productive in the case of a political assembly of any other kind while no difference was as yet descried between original motion motion in amendment argument and vote—while men were as yet to learn how necessary the concurrence of all these objects is to the formation of a rational decision—how distinct they are in themselves and how important it is to keep them so—when the art of applying a correction to the original proposition in such manner as to enable the assembly to choose between the proposition uncorrected and that which would be the result of the correction was as yet unknown—when on offering a fresh proposition in the course of a debate a man had not yet learnt so much as to ask himself what influence it would have or what he meant it should have on the fate of another that was already on the carpet—what occasion what warning what motive should men have had for separating—in short in this state of the progress of intelligence what possibility of separating—argument from vote—and that so perfectly as that all the arguments should be exhibited at one time and all the votes at another in common discourse though the distinction equally exists no such separation usually takes place and common discourse is not only the natural but till some particular reason presents itself to the contrary the proper model for regular debate     all objects present themselves at first appearance in the lump discrimination and separate nomenclature are the tardy fruit of reflection and experience in europe a dog and a horse are become different animals at otaheite the first horse was a great dog not only in the unfettered intercourse of common conversation is this separation neglected but the case is the same in the regulated practice of the species of political assemblies instituted for the purposes of justice this practice is the model which the legislators of the modern provincial assemblies and before them those of the ancient provincial states would naturally have before their eyes it is from this source that the spirit of their laws would naturally be drawn the mode of proceding in the statesgeneral which ought naturally to have been the model for popular or pretendedpopular assemblies was too unsettled to serve as a model for anything even for itself courts of justice must have existed at all times and everywhere and everywhere and at all times the members of them must have delivered arguments and given votes that the regulations given provisionally to the provincial assemblies by royal authority or those settled by the assemblies had lawyers for their authors we are nowhere told as it is not natural that we should be that matters of law should be given to a lawyer to draw up is however nothing more than natural but to a lawyer the model of perfection is naturally the practice of his court that such should have been the regimen pursued by judges in courts of justice is not to be wondered at nor in courts of justice where the number of the judges is very small and which confine their transactions to the business of administering justice is it to be blamed the principal courts of justice in france the courts of parliament though always abundantly too numerous for courts of justice were at their first institution less so than at present and it was at that early period that their practice in this particular must necessarily have been settled these judicial assemblies and the sort of administrative bodies formed by the provincial assemblies were so far analogous that both sorts were assemblies of a political nature—both had propositions to decide upon resolutions to form and votes to give but there is one point in which the analogy totally fails and this point obvious as it appears when once started seems totally to have escaped the observation of the man of law in judicial assemblies in as far as they act judicially no resolution comes to be formed no vote comes to be given—not even that of him who stands foremost upon the list till after the question has undergone a full and elaborate discussion by advocates on both sides but in political assemblies in the narrower sense of the word in assemblies legislative administrative or merely popular there is no such distinct class of persons at least none such has anywhere that i recollect made its appearance hitherto separate from the rest in assemblies of these latter descriptions each member unites in his single person the distinct and in a certain sense opposite characters of advocate and judge by his vote he exercises the latter function by the part he takes in the debate—by his speech in a word—and in the case of the author of a motion by the making of that motion—he exercises the former he who standing first upon the list of speakers gives his vote at the conclusion of his speech without hearing any of the others acts exactly as a presiding judge would do who should begin with giving an opinion in favour of the plaintiff or of the defendant without hearing a syllable from the parties or their advocates on either side i mistake he acts still worse he decides not ignorantly without hearing anything from anybody but partially after hearing only on one side a proposition of some sort or other is upon the carpet it must have had somebody for its introducer this introducer has been heard in favour of it it is therefore upon this partial representation only that the vote of the member who stands first upon the list must under this regimen be formed in the judiciary line the french and british practice on this head are similar in appearance without being so in effect in both instances each mans vote it is true follows immediately upon his speech but in the british practice this usage is attended with no inconvenience the senior judge from being the first to speak and to give his vote loses nothing in point of intelligence the junior judge from being the last loses nothing in point of influence why because the speeches they make in public—the speeches they are heard to make are not the speeches by which their judgments have been determined in a word their speeches are not debates what debates may happen to take place among them are always private they are carried on in whispers or out of court among themselves before any one begins to speak every one of them knows the mind of every other their speeches accordingly are addressed not to one another but to the parties and the audience their object in making these speeches is not to make proselytes of one another that object is either already compassed or recognised to be unattainable their object if unanimous is to instruct the audience and plead each man in favour of the whole number—if there be a difference of opinion an incident in south britain at     least very rare to defend and justify at the bar of the public each man his own side how happens this because the smallness of their number renders this kind of concert practicable in england in ordinary cases the number is not more than four they sit close together the whisper of a moment is sufficient to inform them whether the opinion of the three junior judges coincides with that of the chief if it does not an adjournment of the cause to give them an opportunity of debating the matter over in private is the constant consequence when the whole twelve form themselves into one court—an incident that does not take place perhaps so often as four times in a twelvemonth—the small increase in number resulting from the junction makes in this respect no difference here as in the other case the public declaration of opinions is constantly preceded by private conference in the court of justice composed by the house of lords the numbers and other circumstances being so widely different the practice is accordingly different the number who have a right to be present is very large the number actually present is liable to prodigious fluctuation the members of this large body are not collected together in one place—are not in the constant habit of living with one another as are the members of that small brotherhood among the lords there can be no general conference but in a formal debate accordingly among them the process of debating is as distinct from that of voting when they act in their judicial capacity as when they act in their legislative the french parliaments—at least the principal body of that denomination the parliament of paris—bear in relation to the points in question a much greater resemblance to the house of lords than to the ordinary courts of justice in great britain and particularly in england the number commonly present in the house of lords is scarcely equal to the number commonly present in the parliament of paris when all the chambers are assembled when that body stepping aside out of the track of justice takes cognizance of business appertaining to the departments of legislation and administration its numbers instead of being less than on the other occasions are commonly greater both by the extraordinary affluence drawn by the importance of the business and by the addition of the peers whose presence on such great occasions is commonly requested yet in no instance as far as i have been able to learn does this assembly ever depart from the judiciary usage of confounding the two processes of debating and voting in manner above mentioned §  — point v in debating no fixed order of preaudience question with answers exhibiting reasons why not admit of any fixed order of preaudience in debate answer   because a fixed order is unfavourable to the growth of that intelligence on which rectitude of decision in great measure depends to wit in as far as intelligence is the fruit of industry excited by emulation a man who finds himself low upon the list may in ordinary cases naturally expect to find his arguments forestalled and the lower he is the less will it appear to be worth his while to be at the pains of studying the subject for so small a chance of distinguishing himself or being of use should superior ability or perseverance now and then get the better of this obstacle still it is an inconvenience in itself and a disheartening circumstance to reflect on that his arguments cannot be produced till after the attention of the hearers may have been exhausted and their appetite palled in this line as in every other the less a mans faculties seem likely to be worth either to himself or others the less labour will be bestowed in cultivating them   it tends to waste time by increasing the quantity of useless discourse what is lost in point of intelligence may be made up in words a man who stands high upon the list standing in that conspicuous station and finding himself perpetually called upon to speak may fancy himself bound as it were to obey the summons and speak at any rate as it were in his own defence something he must every now and then say to the purpose or not to the purpose willing or unwilling prepared or unprepared—for so many days together nothing but a silent vote this will never do i must make something of a speech today or people will begin to look upon me as nobody thus while the able and willing are shoved out of the list of speakers with one hand the illqualified and unwilling are dragged into it with the other   it tends to diminish the measure of intelligence imparted to the assembly and thence to diminish the chance in favour of rectitude of decision in another way viz by preventing that concert between persons possessed of different talents—that casting of the different parts which may be so necessary to the displaying of the strength of the cause on every side to the best advantage one man for instance shall be fittest for the business of statement and narration another man who is capable of urging this or that argument with a superior degree of force shall be unable to grasp the whole compages of the business     a third who can begin nothing of himself shall be excellent at improving a hint by another or correcting an error or supplying a deficiency a fourth though sparingly endued with the power of invention shall be good at summing the arguments offered by others and putting each argument in its proper place a fixed order with its blind inflexibility shall chop and change all these parts turn topsyturvy the order designed by reason and by nature the reasoner shall stand before the narrator and the recapitulator before both setting aside the case of previous concert and supposing the order to be fixed any how some error may be advanced by a man—say in matter of fact say in matter of argument which as it happens somebody of those who spoke before him is in a condition to correct but no one of those who are to speak after him what follows that if the rule of fixed preaudience be observed the error must pass uncorrected and be received for truth so often as this happens to be the case—and there is no occasion on which it may not happen—truth and this rule are incompatible   it tends to strengthen whatever hold might be obtainable by seductive influence and thereby to throw discouragement in the way of sincerity and truth every man having to say something in his turn and to show the side he takes by his vote at least if not by a longer speech those who stand lowest upon the list will be obliged whether they will or no to see and it will be known that they see the part that is taken by every man who stands above them but of this more fully under the next head   considered in respect to its influence on the rights of individuals it puts all the members upon an equal footing and on this head at least equality is justice whatever be the advantage of speaking before or after another man no reason can be given why one member should enjoy it in preference to another the consequence is they ought all to have an equal chance for it in point of real importance this last consideration rank at a great distance behind the preceding ones in those cases it is the interest of millions that is concerned in this it is the interest of units but even this ought not to pass unnoticed for millions are composed of units and in the present instance it is the interest of the units that is the most palpable and the most immediately at stake british practice—the order in which members speak is that in which they happen to present themselves for that purpose which they do by rising from their seats† in case of doubt which person out of a number was up at first it is the province of the speaker to decide‡ that is to say provisionally for ultimately nothing can be decided but by the house‡ upon each occasion the race if so one may term it is renewed by starting up second on any occasion a man does not acquire the right of being heard first upon a succeeding one this mode is liable to inconveniences which a person not rendered insensible to them by habit will not find it difficult to divine and which will be considered and a remedy endeavoured to be found for them farther on but these inconveniences are nothing in comparison of the advantage gained by the avoidance of those which we have seen are the inevitable result of every kind of fixed order whatever in the british practice the fundamental principle is equality and here in prescribing equality public utility concurs as we have seen with justice in the particular course taken to enforce and apply the principle injustice or at least the danger or appearance of it as we shall see hereafter have insinuated themselves but under the greatest practicable degree of injustice its efficacy on this head can never fail of meeting with a powerful controul in the influence of chance—that incorruptible power which in this as in so many other instances is the best guardian and firmest protector that equality can have at the worst it is but occasional injustice and between occasional and constant injustice there is no comparison french practice—in the english practice we have seen disorder at the surface—utility and justice at the bottom in the french we shall see order at the surface—inconvenience and injustice underneath the private injustice palliated or rather modified in different ways but the public inconvenience remaining unaltered and in full force in the code of regulations adopted by the first of the two patternassemblies the provincial assembly of berri the following is the course laid down the ecclesiastical members are to sit and speak in the order of their nomination to their respective benefices∥ the noblesse in the order of their age§ the third estate according to an order which it is declared shall be fixed as between the districts which they represent¶ the monster equality being thus by different processes extirpated from the three different classes of citizens order—good order bon ordre as doubtless it appeared—was established and the duty of the legislator done the clergy it is to be observed stand first     in dignity after them the noblesse the third estate in the rear accordingly the clergy are placed all together at the right of the president the noblesse on his left and the third estate below them on each side the important article of sitting being thus adjusted upon strict constitutional principles the inferior businesses of speaking and voting admitted of a temperament accordingly for the purpose of opining the whole assembly consisting when full of fortyeight members exclusive of the two procureursyndics is considered as distributed into parcels twelve parcels four in each parcel the four consisting of an ecclesiastic a noble and two of the third estate he who sits uppermost of the ecclesiastics is thus joined with him who sits uppermost of the noblesse and with the two who sit uppermost of the third estate and so downwards throughout the list if by this expedient the individuals concerned were satisfied that was one great point gained what was gained in the other points   nothing in point of emulation   nothing in point of saving time and words   nothing as to the convenience of casting the parts or correcting mistakes   a small matter as to the dimination of undue influence this influence as between men of different classes is reduced in some degree but the influence of man on man in the same class is left untouched†   nothing in the article of equality where all have a right to be upon an equal footing every scheme of preference is equally unjust in the second of these two original assemblies that of haute guyenne a fixed order is settled upon the same principles with some little variation as to the details and as a fruit of the experience gained in the two years that had elapsed between the institution of the two assemblies and as a means of providing the more effectually against any violations of this good order it is provided in terms more positive than those employed in the berri code that no member shall give his avis till called upon by the secretary for that purpose† the end in view was i suppose to prevent interruption but the means employed are such as render the exercise of every members right dependent upon their servants pleasure‡ in the assembly of the notables of      another course was prescribed by royal mandate the voices voix∥ were here to be taken not in the order of sitting which we may be sure was the order of dignity but in the reverse of that order this course was directed to be observed as well in full assembly as in the seven committees into which the assembly was immediately broken down§     this plan with all its impropriety was no inconsiderable improvement it was the least bad of all fixed orders that could be devised the influence of will on will is thus reduced to its minimum as far as the quantum of influence is to be measured by the degree of dignity other advantages might be pointed out were it worth while to spend words in measuring shades of inexpediency with perfect expediency in full view §  — point vi simultaneity of the votes question with answers exhibiting reasons why require the votes to be given all at once rather than one after another according to a predetermined order answer   to save time—of which in a numerous assembly the taking the votes one after another though it were in the most expeditious mode possible must occasion an enormous waste imagine the statesgeneral of france voting in the order of regular succession upon every motion how much soever in course and contrast this process with that observed in the british house of commons open as i conceive it will be found to be to further improvements in the house of commons when there is no division as is the case with perhaps ninetynine motions out of a hundred the business of taking the votes is the affair of two instants one in which the affirmative votes—the other in which the negative votes are called for in the statesgeneral of france under the regimen supposed that same business would be the affair of about eleven hundred such instants that is about five hundred times as much time would be consumed in the latter case as in the former one might even say more for when eleven hundred votes are given one after another accounts must be taken whatever be the eventual disparity and a deal of time consumed in taking care not to omit any man nor count the same man more than once   to lessen the efficacy of undue influence i say only to lessen it for if two men are absolutely and bonâ fide agreed to play the parts of master and slave or pope and devotee what possible means will there be of hindering them neither the process of crying aye or no nor that of holding up hands can be rendered so exactly simultaneous but that if the slave is bonâ fide upon the watch he may wait to observe the part taken by the masters voice or hand so that his may take the same but to the slave who feels an inward disposition to rebel the practice of simultaneity may upon occasion furnish excuses that may stand a better or worse chance of being accepted—i beg a thousand pardons i took another mans hand for yours if i have acted honestly for this once it was through mistake the matter appeared unfortunately so clear to me that i made no doubt of finding your hand on the same side wherever a loophole offers itself at which probity may make its escape from the trammels of seductive influence it is plain that too much care cannot be taken to leave it open see the section on the cases where the secret mode of taking the votes is the proper one viz chap xiv §   the concealment thus recommended is not that which forms the inconvenience where there is any resulting from the secret mode of voting it is only the will of the seducer that is concealed for the moment from the knowledge of the voter—not the conduct of the voter that is concealed at the long run from the knowledge of the public the result of a decision given in this summary way may it is true come to be done away by another decision given on the same question in the exact and regular mode but this latter opposes or at least may be made to oppose to improbity other checks which are peculiar to itself of which in another place† british practice—the mode of voting pursued in the british practice accords thus far with the recommendation given by this theory in the summary way the voices given on each side are all lifted up promiscuously and at the same instant in the regular mode on a division all the feet move promiscuously and as fast as they can a division is not conceived to be either a procession or a dance in both cases the practice is not free from particular inconveniences which will be represented and remedies proposed for them in another place in both cases the outlines might be better filled up than they are but the outlines themselves are just in point of diminution of undue influence the advantage gained is perhaps no great matter it is out of the question altogether in the regular mode where the part taken by everybody being deliberate and conspicuous must be observed by everybody and in the summary mode it cannot be expected to amount to much on those great questions of national importance where party puts its shoulders to the task and the part to be taken in the house is previously settled by most of the members at private or less public meetings   0 but still there are not wanting a multitude of occasions on which under favour of this part of the discipline probity may make its escape from undue influence let the advantage gained in this way amount to ever so little it is so much got out of the fire french practice—in the french practice the speeches where a man has anything to say are made in a predetermined order as we have seen and as each mans vote comes immediately after or instead of—in short is confounded with—his speech—hence vote follows after vote as speech does after speech speaking with an eye to the statesgeneral i have brought to view the enormous quantity of time which upon this plan of regular succession the mere operation of voting must of itself in an assembly so numerous unavoidably consume but when to this one adds the process of debating and the multitude of speeches which in an assembly of eleven hundred persons all picked men selected for their talents by and out of four and twenty millions of people may be extorted in a manner by the considerations above mentioned the imagination starts at the idea in a company like the provincial assemblies consisting of no more than eight and forty persons this inconvenience might chance well enough not to rise to such a magnitude as to attract notice but even in an assembly like that of the notables of      consisting of one hundred and fortyfour it seems already to have been apprehended for this consideration must at least have been among the number of those in virtue of which such haste was made to break down that assembly into seven committees of twenty or twentytwo each as soon as formed in the course of sixtytwo days the plenum sat but six times and on none of those days do the transactions as represented by the procèsverbal seem to leave any room for a debate in full assembly nothing seems to have been done but hearing papers read and speeches of ceremony pronounced even in the provincial assemblies consisting of but fortyeight members it seems to have been a principle to do the business as much as possible in committees consisting of no more than a dozen members in some of them according to their historiographer a regulation is established not to take into consideration any business in full assembly that has not in its passage from the committee in which it originated gone through the other three this he looks upon as necessary in order to avoid as much as possible the noise and bustle to which debates carried on in numerous assemblies are exposed these observations and many others that might be added seem to bespeak a general apprehension of the impossibility of carrying on business in the french mode in numerous assemblies that is not only in such as would be esteemed numerous in england but in assemblies for example consisting of half a hundred or even so few as a quarter of a hundred persons how must it fare then with the statesgeneral and its eleven hundred members is it to have no general will is it like the first assembly of the notables to sit for no other purpose than to hear papers which would have been better read than heard and speeches which might as well have been neither read nor heard is no business to originate there—nothing to be done but to pronounce definitively and in globo upon some voluminous draught transmitted from some small and select committee it is a fallacy then to speak of its having a will of its own—it is a fallacy to speak of it as possessing the power of the people the real possessors of the power of the people are the members of this oligarchy the select committee but of this more fully in another place observations—the circumstance that served us to account for the usage relative to the fourth point will afford us a means equally natural of accounting for the practice relative to the present head between the practices of speaking in succession voting in succession and confounding speech with vote the connexion is not it is true a necessary one speeches might be made in turn and yet votes given all at once speeches might be made in the order in which persons happened to rise to speak or in any other uncertain order while votes were given in a fixed order but the connexion though not necessary was natural why because it was natural that judicial assemblies should have served as a model and in judicial assemblies it was as natural that the judges should speak in a fixed order determined by the joint influence of rank and seniority as that each man should speak and vote at the same time it was a natural course which as far as judicial practice is concerned is sufficient here whether in the instance of that practice it be of all others the most expedient is a question that belongs not to the present purpose chapter vii of the proposal of measures for adoption there ought to be in every assembly one individual officially charged with the initiative that is bound to commence the operations and to propose the necessary measures for if no member in particular ought to have a     plan respecting the business to be considered it may happen that there will be no plan and that the assembly will remain in a state of inaction it is not only necessary that there should be a plan upon each occasion but there ought to be a train—a connexion between the projects submitted it is not enough to provide for the first sitting there ought to be a general plan embracing all the requisite operations disposing them in the best order and leading them onward to their conclusion this obligatory initiative naturally belongs to those who convoke a political assembly and who are best acquainted with the wants of the state the general distribution of labour is the duty of the administration the ministers should propose—the assembly deliberate and resolve but the right of initiation ought not to be the privilege of the executive exclusively—each member ought equally to possess it there are three principal grounds for this arrangement—   that the intelligence of the whole assembly may be improved for the general good there is as good a chance for obtaining the best advice from one party as from the other to limit the right of proposing is to renounce everything which might be expected from those who are excluded it is to institute a monopoly mischievous in every respect both because it extinguishes the emulation of those whom it reduces to merely a negative part and because it may retain the greatest talents in a state of inaction the most intelligent and clever men may under this exclusive system be enchained by those who are greatly their inferiors in genius and knowledge   that abuses may reformed if the right of proposing belong only to the administration those abuses which are favourable to it would be perpetual the assembly would have no direct method of causing them to cease this arrangement would give to the government a most commodious species of negative as against all measures which were unpleasant to it—a negative without noise and without debate   that the danger arising from the negative right when it exists alone may be prevented the assembly which should possess the power of rejecting alone would be tempted to abuse it that is to say to reject good measures either from a feeling of pride that it might show that it was not a mere nullity that it might exercise its authority or that it might constrain the hand of government and lead it to concede one point that it may obtain another for the right of refusal may be converted into an instrument of offence and may be employed as a positive means of constraint such a system instead therefore of producing harmony would tend to produce discord by creating a necessity on the part of the assembly for the adoption of an artificial conduct towards the executive power but it may be said if the direction of affairs ought to be confided to the officers of the executive power—if they ought to propose those measures which the necessities of the state require—how then can this agree with the desire which all the members may have of making propositions for this right if it be to be efficacious supposes that the assembly has the power of entertaining them but if it thus entertain them the ministerial plan will be liable to be interrupted by incoherent and even entirely subversive motions there will be no longer any regular progress and there may even result from it general confusion in the government i can only answer this objection by supposing in the assembly an habitual disposition to leave to the ministers the ordinary exercise of the right of proposing the general privilege should be reserved for all the members without distinction but the right of priority should be conceded by a tacit convention to the ministerial propositions it is here that it is proper to notice the conduct of the british parliament in the ordinary course of affairs all eyes are fixed upon the minister whether he present a plan or speak in support of it he is listened to with a degree of attention which belongs only to him by a general though tacit arrangemnt important business is not commenced before he arrives he proposes all the principal measures—his opponents confine themselves to attacking them in short he is the director the prime mover the principal personage still he has not by right the slightest preeminence there is no rule which secures to his motions a preference above those of any other member—there is no rule which gives him a right to speak first—it is an arrangement which exists only in virtue of its convenience and its utility whilst the minister possesses the confidence of the majority he is sure to preserve the right of the initiative when he loses this confidence he cannot much longer remain minister but must give place to another it may be well here to attempt to dissipate an error which may justly be called popular both on account of the little reflection which     it discovers and the number of those who adopt it this error consists in concluding that an assembly like the house of commons is corrupt because in its ordinary course it is led by the ministers this pretended proof of the corruption of the assembly or its subjection is on the contrary a real proof of its liberty and its strength why does the minister always take the lead in parliament it is because unless he had the power thus to lead he would no longer be minister the preservation of his place depends upon the duration of his credit with the legislative assembly were we to suppose all the members endowed with the most heroic independence matters could not be better arranged than they are at present chapter viii of the different acts which enter into the formation of a decree those who pay only a superficial regard to a political assembly may think that there is nothing more simple than a motion a debate a decree what is there here which is the object of science or art the ordinary affairs of life call us all to propose to deliberate to decide there are scarcely any notions more familiar than these it is true it is easy to form a conception of these operations but it is difficult to describe them in this respect it is the same with the actions of the mind as with those of the body to move the arms requires but a moment to explain this movement—to describe the muscles which perform it requires great anatomical knowledge let us trace the formation of a decree—the work which serves as its foundation is a simple project proposed by an individual when he presents this project to the assembly according to the prescribed forms he makes what is called a motion the original motion having been made every posterior motion with regard to it can only have one of two objects—either to amend or to suppress it there are therefore two kinds of secondary motions—   emendatory motions   suppressive motions the first include all those which modify the original motion since all these modifications may be considered as amendments—that is to say ameliorations or corrections the second class will include all those which directly or indirectly tend to cause the original motion to be rejected as by demanding priority in favour of some other motion or by proposing an adjournment of the question for an indefinite time c in order to produce a decree only three acts are absolutely necessary—  to make a motion   to vote   to declare the result of the votes but before arriving at the conclusion there are in the ordinary course of things many steps or intermediate acts proper to be taken we shall here set them down in chronological order—   previous promulgation of motions projects of laws and amendments   making the motion which exhibits the project   occasionally ordering it to be printed and published   seconding the motion   deliberating upon it   putting the question   voting summarily   declaring the result of the summary voting   dividing the assembly—that is demanding distinct voting  0 collecting the votes regularly    declaring the result    registering all the proceedings chapter ix of the promulgation of motions—of bills—of amendments and their withdrawment it is proper that the assembly should previously have before its eyes a statement of the business with which it is to be engaged that nothing may be left to chance and that it may not be exposed to surprises it ought to impose on all who wish to present any motions to it the obligation of duly preparing them and making them known a discussion the object of which has been previously made known will be the result of more deliberation and consequently shorter the reasons for and against having been the subjects of ineditation the debaters will have ascertained their strength and taken up their positions accordingly this object may be accomplished by a single regulation let the secretary open three distinct registers—for motions bills or projects of laws and amendments every member being allowed to present to him a motion to be registered and all motions after having been printed in a journal which should only have this object should come before the assembly in the order in which they are registered subject to the reservation of which we shall presently speak the journal of motions being published daily those who wish to propose any amendments should be bound to make them known beforehand by presenting them to the secretary who should transcribe them in his register and cause them to be printed in the journal of amendments     the same steps should be followed with respect to bills they should be inserted in a separate register in the order of their presentation but they ought not to be introduced into the assembly until three months after their inscription unless upon special application this period should be shortened such ought to be the foundation of the arrangement for the table of occupations which might be called as in the british houses of parliament the order of the day but this inflexible order for motions and bills this arrangement founded only upon the circumstance of anterior registration of accidental priority would be liable to the most weighty inconveniences it might prove destructive of real order of that order which belongs to the train and connexion of matters and thus prove incompatible with the liberty of the assembly because one motion has been placed upon the list before another it does not follow that it deserves the preference the last in date may be the first in importance it would even be impracticable to subject all motions to an absolute rule requiring previous registration unexpected incidents demand sudden measures and in the course of its discussion a subject may assume altogether a different appearance a change made in one part of a project may require an alteration in another—an unexpcted breach must be repaired by sudden expedients the influence of a list of motions is therefore reduced to this—it would serve as a guide for the ordinary progress of the debates—it would present a general picture of the labours but it would not restrain the liberty of the assembly which ought to be able at any time to accelerate certain motions or to receive new ones which have not been registered what has been said respecting motions is equally applicable to bills but a bill admits of greater delay than a motion and an interval of three months would not in general be too great between the presentation of a bill to the assembly and its passing into a law if it have been possible to do without a given law during the course of past ages it is possible to do without it at least three months longer besides as soon as a law is proposed the whole of the nation is more or less interested the object is permanent it ought therefore to be known to the public and all the information possessed by the different parties in the kingdom ought to be collected concerning it unless it be pretended that the deputies by a miraculous concentration not only possess all the judgment and knowledge of the whole nation but even of the world itself laws ought to be founded upon facts but inasmuch as the facts are particular they cannot be collected unless the necessary time be allowed to the parties interested to present them to the legislators but in respect of bills as well as motions an inflexible rule is not required latitude must be left for unforeseen cases and especially in favour of the government which is charged to provide for urgent circumstances if after an insurrection or on the eve of an invasion an interval of three months were required after introducing a bill before it were passed into a law the evil might have been consummated before it was possible to consider of the remedy this would be to play the engines when the fire was extinguished it may be remarked that the plan here proposed differs from that of the english parliament every member having here the right to introduce a bill whereas in the english parliament a bill cannot be introduced without leave given by the house—a practice well calculated for preventing the consumption of time upon frivolous or dangerous projects of laws but when a member moves for leave to introduce a bill the house must consider whether it will admit or reject it this power which it now exercises upon the motion i propose that it should exercise over the bill at the moment in which it will be presented that is to say that the assembly should then decide whether it will entertain it or not because it will then decide upon better grounds as the bill will then have been published it is sometimes the custom that bills should be printed before the debate but this is not the case except upon special motion which motion is sometimes rejected—and when printed they are only distributed to members of parliament in this respect there is a fundamental error the printing ought to be the rule and also the public sale of such bills before the invention of printing and when the art of reading was unknown to threefourths of the deputies of the nation to supply this deficiency it was directed that every bill should be read three times in the house at the present day these three readings are purely nominal the clerk confines himself to reading the title and the first words but a most important effect has resulted from this antique regulation these three readings have served to mark three distinct degrees—three epochs—in the passing of a bill at each of which the debate upon it may be recommenced at pleasure motions and bills being thus printed and published in journals destined to these objects alone a regulation should be made that amendments should be printed and published in the same manner why should they not be if i wish to oppose a motion ought my intention to come upon the assembly by surprise—ought its author to be deprived of the knowledge of my objections and of leisure     to prepare an answer to them—ought i to be allowed to take advantage of him by an unforeseen attack if i am only anxious for the success of my own schemes the unforeseen amendment will best suit my purpose but if i only desire the success of reason i ought to make it known before the debate if all the amendments are previously published and presented all together the assembly will have before its eyes a complete picture of the subject of discussion—a picture which will itself be a safeguard against the inconsistencies and contradictions which are so likely to be introduced into a composition of which all the parts are only considered successively the more completely it is possible to present them simultaneously the less is the exposure to this danger this is the grand advantage of synoptic tables the reciprocal dependence and union of all the parts is at once perceived any incoherence strikes the eyes but the rule ought not to extend to the exclusion of amendments arising at the moment for new ideas may spring out of the debate itself and to reject a salutary amendment because its author had not foreseen it would be an absurdity all that can and all that ought to be required of him is to declare that the delay in the announcement of this amendment was not intentional—is not insidious that he did not intend to take the assembly by surprise the nature even of the amendment will indicate the motive which gave rise to it when a member has caused a motion a bill an amendment to be inscribed in the register he should not be allowed to withdraw or abandon it without leave from the assembly a simple prohibition alone is not sufficient in this respect it ought to be an inflexible law if the author of the act in question be not present on the day fixed to support it—unless there be lawful reason for absence he ought to incur the censure of the assembly and his name should be inscribed in a separate book having for its title list of the deserters of motions c this rigorous law is requisite—  in order to prevent thoughtless motions and the confusion which would be produced by the false appearance of a great mass of business which would vanish at the moment in which it was touched   to prevent the destruction of public confidence by accustoming the people to see that the motions which are announced are dropped by neglect   to prevent the abuse which might be made of this instrument by announcing motions which there is no intention to support either for the purpose of spreading alarm or to affect the public funds or for the purpose of preventing other parties from registering their motions or their bills by an apparent monopoly of business and because the evil which an individual could effect in this respect would be susceptible of the most alarming extension by means of combination among the members of a party chapter x of the drawing up of laws we proceed to consider the motions as compositions destined to become laws and be     presented to the examination of the assembly in this respect it is desirable that they should possess that form which will allow them to be discussed in detail and amended regulation cannot prescribe perfection in style but there are certain defects which it may prevent certain conditions which it may impose because every one may be subjected to them the four following points may be prescribed—   brevity in the articles   simplicity in the propositions   the pure expression of will   the complete exhibition of all the clauses which the law ought to contain if these conditions are observed whatever may be the extent of a motion it will be of a manageable and ductile form it will be easy to consider it in all its parts and to amend it   brevity in the articles—what is meant by an article is so much matter as it is intended to put to the vote at one time the longer the articles are the more difficult is it to understand the whole together and distinctly to see all the parts but is it sufficient to recommend brevity no the force of a law ought to be given to this precept by declaring that no project of a law containing more than one hundred words for example should be received unless it were divided into numbered paragraphs no one of which should exceed the above measure this expedient altogether singular as it may at first appear is however the only one of absolute efficacy when it is necessary to present a long train of ideas it is proper to assist the understanding by brevity of style each separate sentence forms a restingplace for the mind the paragraphs in a law ought to be numbered there is no means more convenient and short for citation and reference acts of parliament are exceedingly defective in this respect the divisions into sections and the numbers which designate them in the current editions are not authentic in the parchment original the text of the law—the whole act is of a single piece without distinction of paragraphs without punctuation without figures the word section is not even met with there nor anything which corresponds with it how then is indication made of the termination of one article and the commencement of another always by repeating the same formula the same introductory clause—and it is further enacted by the authority aforesaid or some other phrase to the same effect this is a species of algebra but of an opposite character in algebra one letter supplies the place of a line of words in this a line of words very imperfectly supplies the place of a single figure i say very imperfectly for these words serve for the purpose of division but they are of no use for the purpose of reference is it wished to amend or repeal one section in an act as it is impossible to point out this section by a numerical reference one is obliged to do it by circumlocutions which produce repetitions and obscurity it is partly from this cause that acts of parliament are unintelligible compositions to all those who have not made them the object of long study† the first acts of parliament were passed at a period in which punctuation was not yet in use—in which the arabian figures were not known besides the statutes in their state of primitive simplicity and imperfection were so short and so few in number that the want of division could not produce any sensible inconvenience these things have remained upon the same footing partly from negligence and routine but much more so from a secret interest on the part of the lawyers who have found their advantage in this obscurity of the legal text and who oppose to every reform the bugbear of innovation our forefathers lived for ages without the knowledge of commas stops and figures why should they be adopted now the argument amounts to this—our forefathers lived upon acorns and mast corn is therefore a useless luxury   simplicity in the propositions—this is the principal point the rule prescribed above respecting brevity is established essentially on account of this every article ought to be reduced to a pure and simple proposition or at least an article ought never to include two complete and independent propositions of such nature that the same individual may approve one and reject the other clearness would be carried to the highest point if each article presented a complete sense without reference to any other but in a composition which has many parts this species of perfection is impossible the idea even of arrangement excludes that of independence a mathematical proposition is demonstrated by reference to propositions previously demonstrated and in every series of reasoning the links are multiplied in proportion as they are removed from the first step among conjunctions there are some which afford a mischievous facility for binding together an indefinite number of sentences into one of this kind are in french dautant que considerant que in english whereas in latin quandoquidem the introduction of     these phrases is a principal fault in the style of the laws by means of them a mass of confusion is created objects which it is most desirable to keep apart being thus without reason oftentimes coupled together but if the propositions ought not to be independent one of another they need not be made complex a complex proposition in matters of law is one which includes two propositions one of which may be approved and the other disapproved the following question proposed to the notables in      may serve as an example it referred to the composition of the statesgeneral—ought certain qualifications to be required of the electors and the persons eligible by the form of this phrase two distinct propositions are presented as if they formed only a single one ought certain qualifications to be required of the electors— ought certain qualifications to be required of the eligible— these are two questions so distinct that each ought to be decided by different considerations which may perhaps lead to a negative with regard to one and an affirmative answer as to the other but by uniting them in this manner the mind is led into error it is led to consider them as so connected together that it is proper to give to them one common answer either in the negative or affirmative suppose that a proposition which is presented as a single one really consists of two propositions—that you approve the one that you disapprove the other if it remain undivided whatever may be the decision one proposition will be passed in opposition to your will—if it be divided you are free to choose—you can vote against the one without voting against the other and this which may happen to one individual may happen to the whole assembly by means of complex propositions an assembly free from all exterior constraint may cease to be free by a species of internal constraint a good law may be used as an instrument to compel the passing of a bad one conjunctions may arise in which an assembly may be compelled to sacrifice its most important rights a certain law may be proposed to it not only good in itself but even necessary to its own preservation or the preservation of the state and to this law may be joined another by which it may be deprived of some of its essential prerogatives what can it do it is obliged to submit it is in the situation of the patriarch who pressed with hunger sold his birthright for a mess of pottage this machiavelism it may be said is a gratuitous supposition—a pure fiction but it is not history furnishes numerous examples of it in the ancient republics the initiative of the laws belonged exclusively to a senate the people had no other alternative than that of approving or rejecting the whole together the liberty of choice was not left to them—their chiefs made them purchase a desired law a necessary law at the price of some other law unfavourable to their interests   another principle of composition employ only a pure and simple declaration of will without intermixing therewith reasons opinions or fancies distinct from that same will to assign the reasons for a law is a separate operation which ought never to be confounded with the law itself if it be desirable to instruct the people it may be done in a preamble or in a commentary which accompanies the law but an imperative law ought only to contain the simple expression of the will of the legislator intended to serve as a rule of conduct it cannot be too simple too clear too free from dispute if reasons and opinions are intermingled with it all those are ranged against the law who do not apapprove the reasons or opinions which it expresses instead of becoming stronger it becomes more feeble an instrument of attack is prepared for its adversaries and it is delivered up to their disputes a single epithet is sometimes sufficient to alter the simple expression of the will the same effect may result from the use of a term which implies blame or approbation when it would have been proper to employ a neutral term—heretic for example instead of dissenter—innovation instead of change—usury instead of illegal interest these eulogistic or dyslogistic terms produce all the inconveniences which we have developed above they include complex propositions they not merely state a fact upon which all the world may be agreed but also an opinion which may be received by one party and rejected by another let us give an example—it is decreed that no heretic shall be allowed to sit in this assembly first proposition it is decreed that no man who is not of the established religion of the state shall be admitted to sit in this assembly second preposition this assembly declares that all those who profess any other religious opinions merit the odious denomination of heretics here are two propositions altogether distinct     and foreign to one another the one declares a resolution relative to a fact—the other declares the state of the opinions and affections of those who vote the same individual might adopt the first and reject the second thus to unite into one proposition two different things is to commit a species of falsification and to destroy the freedom of voting from which no benefit can result hence from inserting in the body of a law opinions or reasons foreign to the law the measure may be exposed to rejection although conformable to the general wish of the assembly this may happen because although they may be agreed upon the measure the voters may differ much with regard to the reasons which lead them to adopt it and if the reasons which are assigned are opposed to the opinions of the majority they will experience a very natural and just repugnance to profess opinions which they do not hold to require them to pass such a law is in fact to exact a false declaration and make them tell a lie in the law let us imagine the following proposition—considering that there is no god all penal laws relative to the divinity are abolished even should all the members of the assembly be unanimous in favour of the abolition of these penal laws there might not perhaps be found a single one who would not be shocked by this declaration of atheism and who would not rather choose to reject the measure altogether than to obtain it at this price it would seem that in a free assembly each proposer of a motion ought to observe this rule if it were only as a measure of prudence since an accessary of this nature can only tend to expose the principal motion to be rejected but the spirit of party does not reason thus the more clearly a motion includes any clause offensive to its antagonists the more clearly it proves the strength of those who cause it to pass their triumph increases with the mortification of their antagonists we will give an example of this petty war of parties we shall seek it in a remote period although it would be easy to find specimens nearer to our own times we shall see a motion produced in this spirit of hostility applied in an opposite direction by the insertion of motives and opinions which presented it under an aspect altogether new a motion was made and the question being proposed that it be an instruction to the said committee that in order to restore in some measure the trade of this kingdom they do consider of the proper means to take off the duties upon soap and candles which are so very burthensome to the manufacturers as well as the poor in general the intention of the two phrases included in the parentheses is clear the opposition wished to throw odium upon these two taxes without considering that similar means might be applied to all the taxes without distinction the two clauses were first excluded by two very proper amendments but this triumph was not enough the ministerial party wishing to throw out the motion by appearing to amend it caused the following clause to be inserted— taxes granted and made a security for several large sums of money advanced for the service of the public upon parliamentary credit the greater part of the surplus whereof belong to the sinking fund appropriated to the discharging the national debt it need scarcely be added that the motion thus altered no longer agreeable to the one party or to the other was thrown out by common consent   a bill ought to contain a complete exhibition of all the clauses that the law ought to contain this has reference to certain terms which are liable to be exchanged for terms of the same kind for example one quantity for another quantity one number for another number one portion of time for another portion of time c the imprisonment shall be for a year the fine shall be one tenth part of the parties income the reward shall be twenty pounds sterling† in the projects of bills which were presented to the british parliament the custom was to leave these points in blank between two crotchets thus the imprisonment shall be  the fine shall be  the points thus left in blank were those respecting which there is great latitude of choice the author of the bill has no determinate reason for the choice of one term rather than another the first debate turns rather upon the principle of the measure without regard to these points they are determined in committee upon the motion of some member the journals of the house of commons present many examples of cases in which it has been unwilling to receive bills because the author instead of leaving these blanks had filled them up it was said that liberty was thus better secured so long as no term is fixed there is greater latitude of choice i cannot perceive the force of this reason liberty exists upon this point as well as upon     every other part of the bill it is lawful to propose the smallest number in place of the greatest one place instead of any other place one quantity instead of any other quantity and so of the rest on the other hand the discussion cannot but be improved when it has a determinate foundation upon all points it is necessary at last that the blank should be filled up—that some one should propose a term and who is better able to do this than the author of the motion—from whom can we expect greater knowledge of the subject if no one be obliged to think about the matter is it not to be feared that these blanks will be filled up with indiscreet precipitation as details of trifling importance this custom of leaving blanks most probably arose from the prudence of the framers of the laws if they may have said the term be left blank the ideas of nobody will be hurt but if a specific term be offered which of course will not please everybody the loss of a number of votes is risked upon this point alone this train of reasoning is not unfounded since nothing is more common in political assemblies than that want of candour which fixes upon the first objectionable matter of detail which might easily be remedied and converts it into a radical objection to the measure in which it appears† chapter xi of debates §   of the opening of a debate ought a motion to require to be seconded a motion is not entertained by the house of commons until it is supported by some one beside its author that is to say until it is seconded this regulation is considered proper in order to prevent the introduction of motions which would consume time without producing any fruit before occupying the time of the assembly the proposer should consult a friend if he cannot find a single approver where is the evil of abandoning his motion—what chance has he of persuading the majority if he have not succeeded with the man of his choice but this method has but little efficacy it has none against party motions—none against a man who in the assembly has a civil or an easy friend—none against two fools or two madmen who are determined to support one another besides it is only applicable to original motions and not to incidental motions that is to those which arise in the course of the debate—to those amendments respecting which there is no opportunity of concert with any person it may be objected against this custom that it tends to discourage those who have most need of particular encouragement—of isolated persons jealous of their independence not wishing to connect themselves with any party should a man of this temper after two or three trials find no one to second him this would be sufficient to dishearten him but he ought not to conclude that a motion is frivolous or absurd because at the first glance it has been rejected in this manner how many other reasons beside that of the demerit of the motion may have operated to produce this refusal to second it one may not have chosen to put himself forward another have not liked to act the part of subaltern a third have foreseen that it would not be successful a fourth that it would have made others his enemies many may have refused on grounds altogether foreign to the object of the motion when a rule operates only as a restraint if it be not useful it is mischievous the house of lords has never recognised this rule and no one has found out that any inconvenience has resulted from the want of it before the author of a motion is permitted to speak upon it the motion ought to be read the motion is the only subject to which his speech ought to apply if its subject be unknown the speech will lose a great part of its effect it is impossible to judge of the force or weakness of the arguments unless the object to which they refer is clearly present to the mind there is not a more efficacious rule than this for preventing useless discourses if a member who had no motion to make were to begin to speak he would find himself obliged at the first moment to give a justifying reason for so doing if he had none he would be reduced to silence in the house of commons the rule is not to speak but upon an admitted motion or for the purpose of introducing one but as it is not requisite to begin by presenting a motion it sometimes happens that long speeches are made which are not followed by a motion this is an example of those laws which would be so good so advantageous provided only that they were observed in the english practice the custom is to state beforehand to the house more or less of the object of a motion according to the supposed degree of its importance but this statement is confined to a general indication the whole motion is neither announced nor     reduced to writing is not this a defect is it not stopping half way certainly the same reasons which lead you to require that a motion should be announced beforehand ought to make you desire that it should be presented complete is it not ridiculous to say to an assembly of legislators—divine conjecture imagine what the motion will be of which i have told you the title—and to hold their curiosity in suspense as if it were necessary to excite a dramatic interest or to catch them by surprise the terms of the motion not being previously known it is not possible to prepare amendments hence everything concerning them is a scene of precipitation as they are proposed without plan they are combated under the same disadvantage they too frequently present vague and incoherent ideas and are crude and indigested productions but the greatest evil which arises is that which it is not possible to see or to appreciate—the negative evil the evil of privation that is to say the nonexistence of the useful amendments which would have been offered if leisure for reflection had been afforded by a previous knowledge of the whole motion we have made one step the motion being read its author ought to be allowed the right of preaudience it cannot be presumed that any other person can present the reasons for it with more advantage than himself it is evident that no person ought to be heard against a motion before some one has spoken for it for if there be no argument to be produced in its favour the combating the motion is loss of time the arguments for ought to appear first that those who oppose them may have a fixed point of attack and not wander into vague conjectures in an assembly in which the members sit whilst they speak it would be proper to agree upon a word—for instance dixi—which should mark the close of a speech this final word would prevent that species of preparation that indecent impatience which is manifested in an assembly where those who wish to speak watch all the accidental pauses of the speaker and do not wait till he has finished before they begin if the member stand up whilst he speaks the end of his discourse will be marked by his sitting down and this gesture will more certainly reach the eye than a word reaches the ear the above rule would therefore be more necessary in an assembly in which the members sit whilst speaking than in one in which they stand but it would be useful everywhere as a means of preserving the speaker from the fear of interruptions and of conducting the debate with more propriety in a large assembly the person speaking ought to stand in this attitude his lungs have more force and his voice is more free—he exercises a greater ascendency over the auditory—he more readily perceives the impression he produces but this ought not to be made an absolute rule because it is not possible to fix the limits between a large and small assembly besides there are infirm persons who have sufficient strength for speaking who are not able long to remain standing a wounded officer ought not to be deprived of the right of speaking for his country the last brilliant efforts of his eloquence were uttered by lord chatham when he was feeble and languishing and almost obliged to lie upon his seat §   of free and strict debate there ought to be two kinds of debate in one replies should be allowed in the other not the first of these i should call free every member being allowed to speak as often as he pleases the second i should call strict every member with a single exception which will be shortly noticed being allowed to speak only once the strict method may perhaps be necessary in large assemblies where there are many who wish to speak it becomes necessary upon the principle of equality to secure to each member the right of being heard there would be a kind of injustice in allowing any one to speak twice whilst there were others who had not once been heard if then there be a superfluity of speakers—that is to say more than can be conveniently heard consistently with the speedy progress of business—the exclusion of replies becomes a necessary law but still the free method possesses great advantages in an argument between two persons the discussion is better followed—the reasoning is more connected than when many persons are engaged each reply tends to increase the information received and to fortify the impression made the debate becomes animated and more interesting each one lends his attention to the argument—endeavours to understand it and to foresee the reply it will call forth no movement is either lost or retrograde—every step taken leads on to the conclusion this interest is either weakened or disappointed whenever a new speaker interferes to disturb the thread of the debate and to throw in altogether different ideas hence the first feeling of men their natural instinct is altogether in favour of this manner of debating between two parties who alternately speak pro and con in the british parliament both these methods are employed the one when the assembly is said to meet as the house—the other when it meets in committee when the house is assembled the rule of speaking only once is strictly observed in committee it is the custom to allow of replies and the discussion   0 is frequently confined to a small number of individuals who have paid particular attention to the question at all times this is rather an indulgence than a rule and thus it ought to be for there are some obstinate speakers who will never have done and replies have this inconvenience that they often lead to personalities which might make the debate degenerate into bitter and fruitless contentions in allowing the liberty of replies you expose the debates to a duration incompatible with the transaction of business this is the strongest objection against them but first the cases in which prompt decisions are necessary do not often arise in a legislative assembly and in such cases it is always master of its own rules and always at liberty to act according to circumstances secondly can any time be considered as lost which has been occupied in bona fide discussion how long soever that discussion may have been is rapidity the principal object ought we to avoid a few moments of weariness at the risk of many hours of repentance excess of examination need not be feared bad laws are rather the results of inattention and precipitation the general rule ought to be to reject nothing which may enlighten the assembly but how can it be decided beforehand that an individual who wishes to speak has nothing useful to say in conclusion it is doubtful whether the admission of replies would prolong discussions when a question is quite clear—when the two parties find that their opposition is irremediable the debate has reached its natural conclusion and every one will be desirous of seeing it finished now the liberty of reply has a direct tendency to lead the discussion to this point two antagonists engaged upon a question for which they have made preparation will reply to each other with more strictness—they will go at once to the point without losing time in set phrases exordiums and apologies as is done by each new orator that he may give to his arguments the polish and ornaments of speech after all the free method does not necessarily deprive any individual of the opportunity of speaking it only retards the moment at which he obtains it it is a simple transposition of time which takes nothing from equality after this exposition of the reasons for and against these methods every assembly must decide according to circumstances whether it will be proper to admit the one or the other of these forms of debate but even when replies are not permitted an exception should always be made in favour of the author of the motion he who opens the debate should be allowed to speak last in reply he may naturally be presumed to be best acquainted with the strong and weak points of his cause and if he were not allowed the right of reply objections to which he only could reply might impose upon the assembly in the british parliament this last reply is frequently that which attracts the most attention in this the speaker concentrates all his strength and brings it to bear upon the essential points which ought to determine the judgment videndum præoipue utrique parti ubi sit rei summa nam fere accidit ut in causis multa dicantur de paucis judicetur §   of three debates upon every proposed law† the general rule in the english parliament is that every bill shall be debated three times upon different days and these days oftentimes distant from each other these are called the three readings of the bill the bill may be thrown out on the first the second or the third reading but it is not passed till it has been read three times this is not all between the second and third reading the bill is discussed in a committee of the whole house this general committee which is spoken of elsewhere admits of forms of discussion more free than those allowed in the regular debates a chairman is chosen for the occasion—the details of the measure are discussed—the same persons are permitted to speak several times upon the same subject and the discussion is thus generally carried on by the individuals who possess the greatest knowledge of the particular question with regard to the three readings the first is almost confined to the introduction of the bill and general observations upon it—the second is a debate upon its principles—the third regards it as a whole the terms of which have been considered and settled the advantages of these reiterated debates are—  maturity in the deliberations arising from the opportunities given to a great number of persons of speaking upon different days after they have profited by the information which discussion has elicited   opportunity afforded to the public to make itself heard—and to the members to consult enlightened persons out of doors   prevention of the effects of eloquence by which an orator might obtain votes upon a sudden impulse   protection to the minority of the assembly by securing to it different periods at which to state its opinions   opportunity for members absent during the first debate to attend when they perceive that their presence may influence the fate of the bill every one knows by experience that the     strongest reasons alleged by two parties cannot be estimated at their true value the first time of hearing they make either too much or too little impression—too much if they are developed with all the seduction of authority and eloquence—too little if they are opposed by violent passions interests or prejudices after an interval of a few days the mind becomes calm—public opinion has time to act—the effect of mere eloquence ceases to operate—reason resumes its sway very different views are often brought to the second debate from those which were successful on the first—and the two parties approach each other with arguments matured by reflection and communication with the public parties appear to have a necessary existence if a single debate decide the adoption of a law each party has an extreme interest in employing all its means to secure the victory of the day—and great heat and animosity are produced by the debate but when it is known that a first victory is not sufficient—that the struggle must be renewed a second and a third time with the same antagonists—strength is reserved—it is tempered that it may not injure the cause in which it is employed no one dares to take an unlawful advantage because this would be to supply arms to his adversaries—and the party in the minority which gradually sees that its ultimate defeat approaches gives way to it with the more moderation inasmuch as it has been allowed every opportunity of preventing it in the british parliament independently of the three readings which are necessary there are many other occasions in which it is possible to renew the debate during the progress of a bill—the technical term which comprises all the stages through which it must pass before its completion it must as i have already said be committed—and it may be recommitted it must be engrossed that is written on parchment to become the authentic text it ought at last to be transmitted to the house of lords and it may be sent back again to the commons each of these stages are passed upon motion by a member and each motion may become the occasion of a new debate the opposition very rarely makes use of these different means for retarding the progress of a bill but they are held in reserve for extraordinary occasions when delay may produce important results it may be objected that this plan occasions great delays and that circumstances may imperiously require that a law should be passed with rapidity to this it may be replied that in cases of necessity the houses of parliament can suspend their usual orders and that a bill may be made to pass through all its stages in both houses in one day an example of this kind occurred if i am not mistaken during the mutiny at the nore in      but such extreme measures arise from urgent necessity which overcomes all opposition those who consider the slowness of these forms as objectionable do not perceive that their objection is directed against reflection—against that information which is often the fruit of time and study there may be repetitions but a reasonable conviction is not attained at once the best argument requires to be presented at different times and under many aspects it is by these means that it becomes adapted to different minds and is deposited in the memory those men who are persuaded by a word are lost as easily as they are gained allow of obstinacy in debate and there will result from it perseverance in conduct in france the terrible decrees of urgency the decrees for closing the discussion may well be remembered with dread they were formed for the subjugation of the minority—for the purpose of stifling arguments which were dreaded the more susceptible a people are of excitement and of being led astray so much the more ought they to place themselves under the protection of forms which impose the necessity of reflection and prevent surprises a more direct answer may be given to this objection on the ground of delay—three debates necessarily require intervals but they do not tend to render the discussion longer upon the whole—they have rather a contrary effect indeed these three debates have different objects and divide the deliberations in the most suitable manner in the first the question is shall the subjectmatter be considered at all if its consideration be refused there is a great saving of time because no one has been engaged in the consideration of the details at the second reading the question is shall the principle of the bill introduced be adopted if its principle be admitted it is then taken into consideration in committee and each clause is considered by itself and amendments if necessary proposed in it when the whole has been thus considered the bill is reported to the house at the time appointed the project of the law as thus prepared undergoes a third debate the whole of its parts and bearings being thoroughly understood all are prepared to consider it in its principles and details whilst those who wish again to propose their amendments can do so if they hope to obtain the concurrence of the majority §   of the exclusion of written discourses the rule for the exclusion of written discourses is strictly observed in the british     parliament it ought to be so in all deliberative assemblies the principal inconvenience of written discourses consists in their want of connexion—they have no relation to one another it is easily perceived that a political assembly is not a society of academicians that the principal advantage of a national senate and of public discussion arises from that activity of mind from that energy of feeling from that abundance of resources which results from a large assembly of enlightened men who animate and excite each other who attack without sparing each other and who feeling themselves pressed by all the forces of their antagonists display in their defence powers which were before unknown to themselves attention is like the mirror which concentrates the rays of the sun into one focus and produces increase both of heat and light but attention cannot be sustained except by connected discourse and the kind of dramatic interest which results from it when attention is excited nothing passes without examination every truth tells—every error provokes refutation a fortunate word a happy expression is more effective than a long speech—and as these weapons cannot be wielded in debate except by the cleverest men the assembly is spared from ennui and saves its time there is nothing useful in the plan of reading except it be to procure for mediocrity the consolations of selflove at the expense of the public good will it be said that these prepared discourses will commonly have greater maturity greater depth—that the assembly by this means is less exposed to hear dangerous and illconsidered opinions the effect is precisely opposite it requires longer preparation and deeper meditation to be able to speak extempore than to write at leisure to have completely mastered his subject—to have studied it under all its aspects—to have foreseen all objections—to be ready to answer every one such are the conditions necessary for a public speaker but what ordinary man is not able to write upon a given subject any number of pages one person employs writing for the purpose of facilitating meditation to relieve his memory to prevent the fatigue of retaining a series of ideas another writes that he may dismiss from his mind what he has committed to paper it may therefore easily happen that a man does not understand the subject upon which he has written but he must always understand his subject if he will speak well upon it if all those who have exhibited the talent of speaking in the national assembly had been asked why they were reduced to the reading of memoirs upon difficult and complicated subjects they would have accused the shortness of the time the premature questions the number and variety of the subjects but they would thus have confirmed the opinion that the plan of written discourses is bad in itself it will never form powerful minds in a political assembly it favours idleness of thought and like the habit of being carried produces torpor and indolence in england as elsewhere the distinguished talent for public speaking is concentered among a small number of individuals but the plan of reading is not tolerated there which multiplies speeches without multiplying ideas does it appear that there is any want of arguments in their discussion—is there less vigour among their political combatants as soon as the defender of a motion ceases to speak does not the opposite party furnish an orator who seeks by his opposite arguments to efface the impression which the first has made those who do not possess the talent of public speaking may communicate facts and arguments to the habitual speakers this is the best method of making them useful these communications—these contributions of ideas continually take place in the british parliament† §   other rules relative to debate the rules we are about to exhibit are not of the same importance as the preceding but they all tend to prevent inconveniences and to produce a better debate the former were dictated by necessity these by prudence   address the president and not the assembly in general this custom constantly followed in the house of commons is well adapted to a numerous assembly it gives those who speak a fixed point of direction and a common centre for all the speeches it is also natural that each should address himself to the individual who is officially to judge if he wander from the question or if he fall into any irregularity prohibited by the rules of the assembly a speech addressed to the president of the assembly will be more grave and temperate     than if it were addressed to the whole assembly an excited individual addressing himself to an impartial magistrate to a respected president will feel the necessity of measuring his expressions and repressing the movements of his indignation and wrath if the members speak directly to each other the discussion will more easily degenerate into personalities there is no custom more useful in a political assembly than that of treating the president with deference and respect and there is nothing more likely to form this habit than the considering him as the centre of the deliberations—as the assembly personified   avoid designating the members of the assembly by their proper names this rule strictly followed in the house of commons renders it necessary to recur to circumlocutions in designating a member the honourable member on my right or on my left—the gentleman in the blue ribbon—the noble lord—my learned friend c most of these expressions are polite without being insipid the proper names would often be accompanied with a catalogue of complimentary epithets of which we may see many examples in the speeches of cicero pronounced in the roman senate but the real inconvenience is that the mention of the name in debate is a stronger appeal to selflove than every other designation it is less offensive to say the honourable member who spoke last has fallen into a gross mistake than to call him by his name it is as though an abstraction were made of the individual that he might be considered only in his political character the observation of this rule is troublesome and when the debaters are warm it requires an effort to submit to it—but this very circumstance proves that it is necessary   never impute bad motives this also is an absolute rule in british debate you are at liberty to impute ignorance to a previous speaker—to tell him of his mistakes his false representations of facts—but not to say one word inculpating his motives direct your energy against the mischievous effects of his opinions or the measures he supports show that they are fatal—that they tend to establish tyranny or anarchy but never suppose that he foresaw or designed these consequences this rule is strictly founded on justice for if it be difficult always to know our own true and secret motives there is much more temerity in pretending to develope those of others—and from our own experience we ought to know how easy it is to be deceived in this respect the reserve which this rule imposes is useful to all it is favourable to the freedom of opinion in political debate as in war you ought not to employ any means which you would wish should not be employed against you but this maxim is especially conformable with prudence is your antagonist in error—he may receive the truth you skilfully present to him but if you impugn his motives you offend him—you provoke him—you do not leave him the quiet necessary for listening to you with attention he becomes opposed to you the fire communicates from one to another—his friends make common cause with him and oftentimes resentments which are prolonged beyond the debates carry into political opposition all the asperity of personal quarrels it is not enough to exclude personalities it also is proper to proscribe all violent and bitter expressions it is proper to proscribe them as signs of awkwardness still more than as traits of passion all who have watched political assemblies know that improper expressions are the sources of the most tumultuous incidents and of the most obstinate wanderings   never mention the wishes of the sovereign or the executive power this wish in itself proves nothing in regard to the fitness or unfitness of the measure it can have no good effect and can only be productive of evil the admission of this instrument would be incompatible with the liberty of the assembly not only upon the particular occasion but upon every other for if it may be alleged at one time it will be alleged at all times and if the least value be granted to a consideration of this nature the power of the assembly is reduced to nothing there is substituted for its will the will of a superior if this wish when announced by one party should be disputed or condemned by another party it would follow that the head of the executive power would become the personal object of the debates—that its dignity would be compromised and there would result a most fatal species of discord—that which leads on to civil war this rule has been long established and strictly followed in the parliamentary debates the kings speech at the opening of the session     only contains general recommendations and besides this it is only considered as an act of the minister it is therefore freely discussed without mention of the king and the opposition attack it as they do any other ministerial measure   never quote any justificatory piece or means of proof which has not been presented to the assembly in consequence of a motion made to that effect omnis demonstratio ex præcognitis et præconcessis this rule is founded upon two manifest reasons—   to secure the authenticity of the matter which is taken as a foundation for the decision   to give every member an opportunity of being acquainted with it and informed of the use which it is desired to make of it in consequence of neglecting this rule the highest bodies in the state in france have sometimes fallen into errors with which the lowest official persons cannot be reproached in england the parliament of paris in its famous remonstrances of the   th and   th july      enumerated charles v and henry iv among the kings who had assembled the statesgeneral which is not true either of the one or the other how often has the national assembly passed decrees upon mere hearsay—upon facts said to be of public notoriety—without thinking that there is nothing more deceitful than popular rumour and that the more widely a fact was known so much the more easily might proof be collected of it the legislative assembly transmitted articles of accusation against m de lessart to the high national court which contained only vague and declamatory imputations without stating a single fact and without having heard the accused†   do not permit any motion which has been rejected to be presented afresh during the same session or before an interval of three months this rule has for its object the repression of the obstinacy of parties which would never leave off repeating questions which had been already decided against them either from a hope of thereby keeping up the zeal of their partisans or from a desire to embarrass the operations of the assembly this rule can only be strictly applied to motions which are identical a party will never allow itself to be restricted by the prohibition to reproduce its motion if it see any chance of success it will not fail to present it again under a new form it is however always well to insert this article in the regulations it will follow from it in ordinary cases that a motion once rejected will not reappear in the same session a rule which should permit the definitive rejection of motions without return would be the greatest possible attack upon liberty it would be to seek to enchain ones self or ones successors §   of the election of debaters i proceed to point out a mode of reducing the number of orators in an assembly too numerous to allow the right of discussion to all it would however only be applicable to democratic constitutions for with good regulations six hundred persons at least might exercise the right of speaking without any occasion to limit it to a certain number the most simple method would be to elect in the first instance twentyfour orators by name  dly to choose one hundred other persons by lot in order to give a chance to all parties  dly to permit each of these to waive his right in favour of any other member of the assembly at pleasure those who did not possess the talent or inclination to speak would then voluntarily surrender their places to such members of their own party as seemed best fitted to fill them but it would be proper to reserve for all the members the right of making a motion—that is to say a principal motion—and of explaining it     chapter xii of amendments at first sight it would appear scarcely possible to class amendments since they may embrace every modification which the human mind can conceive with respect to a given motion upon calling analysis however to our assistance we shall discover that this difficulty vanishes all amendments are necessarily relative to the choice of terms or to the mode of their connexion amendments which relate to terms can only have for their object one or other of these three objects—to suppress to add or to substitute this last operation is effected by the union of the two first amendments with reference to the connexion of ideas can only have for their object—their division their union or their transposition does the original proposition appear to me too complicated i demand that it be divided with the intention of allowing the assembly the power of rejecting one part without rejecting the other does it appear proper that two propositions which are separated in the original project should be considered together or one following the other i demand their union amendments which consist in transposing a certain word or phrase may have the effect of entirely changing the project the word only for example placed in different situations will produce a meaning totally different amendments are thus reduced to six kinds and are capable of receiving clear and precise denominations— amendment  suppressive  additive  substitutive amendment  divisive  unitive  transpositive these technical terms appear necessary to prevent the confounding of ideas which only differ from each other by very slight shades things which are not classified and which have no proper names are always ill understood and cannot be designated but by periphrases which are often obscure a proper name is a great assistance to the understanding to the memory and to the communication of ideas the greatest difficulty which can be alleged against new words is that they are difficult to be understood but those derived from more familiar terms are perfectly intelligible it frequently happens that many amendments are offered upon one motion and even amendments which refer to a previous amendment this is what is called a subamendment in what order ought they to be discussed it is very difficult to give positive rules in this respect each party will support the importance of his own and seek to obtain priority if a debate were always necessary to decide the matter the principal question would be lost sight of and the attention of the assembly exhausted upon these accessories these contests may be rendered more rare and short by laying down as a general principle that amendments upon the connexion shall always be taken into consideration first what is their object to place the objects to be discussed in the most suitable order but this order once formed is that which most tends to produce a good discussion among this class of amendments the divisive ought to have the priority complex questions are the occasion of the most obscure and obstinate debates among amendments as to the choice of terms it might also be laid down as a general principle that suppressive amendments ought to have the priority over the two others of the same kind the suppression of a single term may remove the strongest objections and that which is omitted is no longer the subject of debate on the other hand additive or substitutive amendments may be productive of subamendments of the same species the value of these observations will only be fully apprehended by those who have had experience in political assemblies they will be aware how much confusion is produced by multiplied amendments and how happy it would be if without absolute rules some thread could be found which would lead out of the labyrinth there remain many more difficulties upon this subject when there are many additive amendments in concurrence in what order should they be submitted to the vote ought they to be presented singly or all at once if they are presented singly by deciding according to priority you do not give the others an equal chance it is the same in elections if you have to choose among many candidates you do not treat them with equality if you put them to the vote one after another he who is presented first will in general have a great advantage and if he be elected the others would be rejected without having any chance of success it is proper therefore to vote for rival amendments after the elective manner i see no other inconvenience than the length of the process it would be proper always to have recourse to this in cases of great importance in ordinary cases it may be allowed to the president to put amendments to the vote in the order     which appears to him most suitable it being understood that if objection be made it belongs to the assembly to decide it is scarcely necessary to say that amendments are only trials which ought to admit of every possible variation if the amendment pass it does not follow that the clause amended shall be adopted the motion thus modified becomes the object of debate and may be rejected that which has been suppressed may be reestablished that which has been added may be struck out words may be placed and displaced as in the corrections of style without deciding upon the value of the composition which after this labour may be condemned or destroyed one rule which ought to be absolute with respect to amendments is—not to admit any which are insidious i call those pretended amendments insidious which instead of improving the motion represent it as ridiculous or absurd and which cannot be adopted without making the motion fall by means of the amendment itself ridicule is useful for the overthrow of an absurdity which does not deserve to be seriously attacked but an epigram in the shape of an amendment is a piece of wit which is unbecoming the gravity and the design of a political assembly to propose an amendment is to declare that one seeks to improve the motion that it may become worthy of approbation to propose an amendment which renders the motion ridiculous is a species of fraud and insult resembling that particular kind of impertinence which in society is called jeering besides these insidious amendments are altogether useless they cannot pass unless the majority of the assembly be already disposed to reject the motion itself it is therefore to go round about in order to reach the end which may be attained by direct means you only render necessary two operations instead of one you begin by receiving the amendment which renders the motion absurd and then reject the motion thus amended let us apply these observations to the celebrated vote of the house of commons in     —a vote which served as the foundation of a kind of revolution in the government— it is declared that the influence of the crown has increased is increasing and that it ought to be diminished let us suppose that one of the opponents of the motion had proposed that it be adopted upon the insertion of the word necessary before influence here would be an example of the amendment insidious since the insertion of this word would have rendered the motion contradictory and even criminal and the amendment having been admitted the motion ought to be rejected another example—a motion having been made for the production of all letters written by the lords of the admiralty to an officer of marines—it was proposed to add as an amendment the words which letters may contain orders or relate to orders not executed and still subsisting the amendment having been adopted the whole motion was rejected without a division this mode of procedure united both the inconveniences i have mentioned insult and derision were its object—cunning and tergiversation were its means it was entirely opposed to the maxim—suaviter in modo fortiter in re chapter xiii of dilatory motions or motions of adjournment a motion made and its proposer heard it is lawful for any member from this moment to the conclusion of the debate provided he does not interrupt any speech to propose a dilatory motion and this shall take precedence of the previous motion there are three kinds of dilatory motions— indefinite adjournment sine die fixed adjournment in diem relative adjournment post quam this latter motion consists in proposing to adjourn till after a future event for example till after the discussion of another motion or of some bill already upon the orderbook—or till after the presentation of a report which ought to be made by a committee c—or a communication from the king or expected petitions all these motions ought to be permitted in order to secure to the assembly the exercise of its will which would not be completely free if any one of these modifications were excluded the relative adjournment or post quam is necessary as a preservative against the danger of coming to an unsuitable decision in the absence of the necessary documents fixed adjournment or in diem may have the same object the procuring of new documents upon a question which does not appear sufficiently clear or it may be for the purpose of arresting a discussion which assumes too lively and passionate a character precipitation may arise from two causes from ignorance when a judgment is formed without the collection of all the information required—from passion when there is not the necessary calm for considering the question in all its aspects what may happen to an individual may     happen to an assembly the individual may feel that in the actual conjuncture he is not so sufficiently master of his passion as to form a prudent determination but he may be sufficiently so not to form any— quos ego sed motos præstat componere fluctus æn i     i would beat you said the philosopher to his slave if i were not angry this faculty of doubting and suspending our operations is one of the noblest attributes of man these two species of adjournment decide nothing as to the merit of the motion but to demand an indefinite adjournment is to cut short the debate by rejecting the motion itself ordinarily the partisans of the original motion will be opposed to this adjournment and they will employ all the arguments which they can advance in its favour in opposition to the adjournment in this case the debate will be less direct but not shorter but it may happen that they may themselves favour the indefinite adjournment if they judge by the complexion of the debate that the chances of success are unfavourable and that they can attempt their object with more success at a future time when an indefinite adjournment is adopted it is probable that the original motion would have been rejected the prompt termination of the debate is then an economy of time chapter xiv of voting §   general observations this subject is both difficult and important the freedom of an assembly resides in the expression of its will it is necessary therefore so to proceed that every one may give his vote in conformity with his real wishes and that in the result we may be sure to have obtained the general wish the processes of voting are susceptible of divisions derived from many sources—   voting upon questions or voting respecting persons the first takes place with reference to the adoption or rejection of a motion the second with reference to the election of a person to an office there is no real difference between these two cases to vote upon an election is to vote upon the question whether a certain individual shall be elected to vote upon a question is to vote upon an election whether the project shall be chosen or rejected   a simple or a compound vote the simple vote occurs when the question is so reduced that it is only necessary to say yes or no—such a project shall be adopted or shall not—such person shall be elected or shall not the compound vote occurs when many operations are to be performed—when it is necessary to decide among many projects to choose one person from among many candidates or to nominate to many places with regard to motions it is proper to reduce the question to the simple form in which one side may vote by yes and the other side by no with regard to elections the compound mode is often necessary when a committee of twentyfour persons is to be chosen from among   00 there will be   00 persons eligible for each place and twentyfour places for each of which it is necessary to choose out of   00   with reference either to motions or elections the votes may be given secretly or openly the secret mode is called ballot   the mode employed for obtaining a decision may be either dependent or independent of human will hence a new distinction—election by choice—election by lot   in conclusion there is also regular and summary voting in the regular mode all the votes are counted and the exact number on each side known in the summary mode the president puts the question and calls upon the assembly to express its will by sitting down or rising up or by holding up the hand c the president judging which party has the majority and his decision being valid unless objected to §   of open and secret voting in general it is very desirable that the voting should be open rather than secret publicity is the only means of subjecting the voters to the tribunal of public opinion and of holding them to their duty by the restraint of honour this supposes that publicity is in accordance with the public welfare in general this supposition is well founded the opinion formed by the public is always conformable to what appears to be its interest and in the ordinary course of things it sees its own interest whatever it may be it is always opposed to misconduct it always respects the probity the fidelity the firmness of its governors and judges still however the opinion of the public may be incorrect since all the members of this tribunal are men if there be measures upon which the wisest men are not agreed how is it possible that the public should agree who are not all wise if there be errors in morals and legislation which have led the noblest minds astray how can the multitude over whom prejudices have so great an empire be secured it may therefore be said that in those cases in which public opinion is erroneous it is     desirable that the legislators should vote in secret that they may be withdrawn from unjust censure and rendered more free in their votes this argument is unsound for upon what is it founded upon the presumption that the opinion of a small number is more correct than the united opinions of a large number this may be true but a wise and modest man will be always unwilling to attribute to himself this superiority over his fellows—to pretend to make his opinion triumph over the general opinion he will choose rather to submit his opinion to that which generally prevails in the nation and especially will he not desire a victory obtained by clandestine votes of which he knows the danger it follows therefore that recognizing the fallibility of the public it is proper to act as though it were infallible and that we ought never under pretence of this fallibility to establish a system which would withdraw the representatives of the public from its influence but may it not be apprehended that this publicity will render men too feeble—that is to say disposed to sacrifice their real opinions to the general opinion no this plan tends in the long run to give greater strength and elevation to their characters experience will soon disclose the great difference between the opinion which arises out of a particular circumstance and that which is formed after mature reflection—between the clamour of the multitude which is dissipated in noise and the enlightened opinion of the wise which survives transitory errors freedom of opinion conciliates the respect even of those whom it opposes and mental courage is no less honoured in free states than military bravery it is therefore in a correct knowledge of public opinion that the means must be found for resisting it when it is considered ill founded the appeal lies to itself—as from philip misinformed to philip correctly informed it is not always according to public opinion that an enlightened and virtuous man will decide—but he will presume in consulting general utility that public opinion will take the same course and there is no stronger moral probability in a country where discussion is free such are the principles which may be advanced for the establishment of the general rule with regard to the publicity of voting this rule must be subject at all times to widely extended exceptions the cases in which publicity would be dangerous are those in which it exposes the voters to the influence of seductive motives more powerful than the tutelary motives which it furnishes in judging whether a motive ought to be referred to the class of seductive or tutelary motives it is necessary to examine whether in the case in question it tend to produce more good or more evil—whether it tend to favour the greatest or the smallest number if for example a nobleman be called to decide between his own personal interest and the interest of the body of the nobility—the motive whatever it may be which leads him to prefer this interest to his own deserves to be called tutelary if this same nobleman be called to decide between the interest of the body of the nobility and that of the total mass of the citizens—this same motive loses its tutelary quality and can only be considered as a seductive motive hence lesprit de corps a social principle when it leads to the sacrifice of the interest of the individual to that of the particular society becomes antisocial when it leads to the sacrifice of the great interests of the public the same observation is applicable to friendship if this motive lead me to serve my friend at the expense of my own interest it is social and tutelary if it lead me to serve him at the expense of the general good the same motive becomes antisocial and seductive from these considerations it is proper to add to the general rule respecting publicity a limiting clause— votes ought to be given secretly in all cases in which there is more to fear from the influence of particular wills than to hope from the influence of public opinion what are these cases to answer this question it is necessary to distinguish two species of interest the one factitious—the other natural interest is purely factitious when the voter has nothing to gain or to lose in consequence of his vote except when his vote is known interest is natural when the voter may lose or gain in consequence of his vote even should it remain unknown for example the interest which results from the contract whereby i engage to sell my vote to a stranger is a factitious interest secret voting destroys the influence of factitious interest it has no effect upon the influence of natural interest under the régime of secresy the buyer could have no sufficient security that the contract would be faithfully executed by the seller an individual may be sufficiently dishonest to commit a fraud but not to commit treason the lesser crime is always more probable than the greater the system of secresy has therefore a useful tendency in those circumstances in which publicity exposes the voter to the influence of a particular interest opposed to the public interest secresy is therefore in general suitable in elections are the votes given openly—no     one can tell to what extent friendship hope or fear may take away the freedom of voting it would be a great evil if in elections especially popular elections the effect of secresy were to destroy all influence this idea of absolute independence in the voters is absurd those whose situation does not permit them to acquire political knowledge have need of guidance from more enlightened persons but happily the secret mode of election does not diminish the influence of mind on mind all other things being equal the most deserving individual in elective assemblies will have the ascendency over the more obscure member—the man distinguished by his services will have more votes than he who does not rise above the common level the opulent proprietor the employment of whose fortune presents a spectacle to the observation of the multitude will be more readily taken as a model for imitation than the individual who moves in a narrower circle this preponderance of the aristocracy is as natural as it is just and necessary the advantages of wealth and rank suffice in case of equilibrium in other respects to turn the balance but if the one of the candidates had exposed himself to public contempt whilst the other rising from obscurity had acquired the general favour the illusion would be broken—and if the votes were free merit would be preferred to fortune it is proper to observe that the secret mode does not prevent those who desire it from making known their sentiments a constrained and universal secresy in elections would be a bad measure this servile silence would be in contradiction to freedom of action each candidate ought to have his friends—his defenders—to cause his claims to be duly estimated by the assembly to dissipate false imputations—in a word to enlighten the decision of his judges since to proceed to an election is to proceed to try the candidates with the intention of bestowing a reward—to exclude previous vivâ voce discussion is to decide the cause of the candidates and that of the public without allowing the interested parties an opportunity of being heard it is true that these public debates—these manifestations of party—may sometimes in popular elections produce a tumultuous ferment but this is a small evil compared with that of restraining the expression of the public feeling it is by this freedom that the people are interested in persons and things and that the firmest bonds are formed between the electors and the elected even in england where these periods rarely return the fear of this species of popular assize exercises a marked influence over those who devote themselves to the career of politics with this mixture of publicity secret voting appears to me then most suitable for elections that is to say the most suited to prevent venality and to secure the independence of the electors in political matters i do not see any other case in which it can be recommended as a general rule but it is proper to observe here that a nation may find itself in particular circumstances which will demand the same system upon other points it may be for example that at the period when secret suffrages were introduced at rome the change was desirable cicero though otherwise the adoption however of one of these methods does not exclude the other there are cases in which it is advantageous to combine them by making them follow upon the same question the result of these two operations whether they coincide or whether they differ would always furnish very instructive indications i find a very singular example in the latter days of poland when she made a last and generous effort to withdraw herself from the dominant influence of russia the permanent council the depositary of the executive power exercised the supreme power during the interval of the diets this council intimidated or corrupted was only the instrument of the will of russia it was proposed to raise an army to cause the territory to be respected—it was proposed to place this army under the orders of a commission independent of this council on the   th october      they voted upon this proposition—publicly collected the votes showed a majority of  0 against  0 for the negative the secret vote reduced this majority to   on the  d of november the same proposition was discussed again—the open vote gave for the independence of the commission     against it     but the secret vote turned the majority on the other side—for the independence   0 against it     thus among     votes this change of method had made a difference of   † when secret voting is established it ought only to be when circumstances render a hidden influence suspected and even then it is proper that it should be preceded by open voting publicity ought to be the ordinary plan secresy ought only to be admitted as a kind of appeal to demand a ballot is to appeal from the apparent to the real wish of the assembly to take the opposite direction—that is to say to proceed from secret voting to open voting—would be wrong the natural order is to pass from the false or what is suspected   0 to be false to the true the real wish once ascertained what good purpose would be served by taking another vote which would not be the real vote if it differed from the former that these two methods may have their highest effect they ought to be carried to the highest possible pitch in secret voting the secresy cannot be too profound in public voting the publicity can never be too great the most detrimental arrangement would be that of demipublicity—as if the votes should be known to the assembly and should remain unknown to the public individuals would thus be exposed in all their votes to every seductive influence and would be withdrawn from the principal tutelary influences this is the system which it would be proper to establish if we would secure punishment to probity and reward to prevarication in governments in which there are public assemblies acting in conjunction with a powerful monarch whose influence is feared it has been thought that the secret mode ought to be the ordinary plan that the members might be withdrawn from the factitious interest which the monarch might create by his threats or his rewards if the monarch can act upon the assembly by means of force imprisonments or depositions—security does not exist—liberty is but a name the intimidated members would find in secret voting an asylum against public opinion in relation to the modes of seduction those which are public may be arrested by laws excluding from the assembly those individuals who hold certain employments at the nomination of the sovereign with regard to clandestine favours or what may be called corruption—the danger can never be equal in a numerous assembly to the grand antiseptic effect of publicity the number of persons who could be reduced to dependence by such means will never be large the majority will be restrained by the dread of shame a still larger number by the fear of being removed in an assembly liable to change should a sovereign grant perpetual favours—he would most frequently purchase ingratitude should he grant his favours periodically—these secret negotiations would be too disgraceful and perilous to be frequent does one kind of honour enjoin the observation of a clandestine bargain—another kind of honour directs the breach of it at least in the case when it cannot be observed without openly offending public opinion §   of summary and distinct voting every numerous political assembly which has many operations to perform has soon been led by the necessity of economizing time to ascertain its votes in a summary manner—contenting itself with knowing them by approximation in cases in which the result is manifest or in which it is not of importance to ascertain the respective numbers with precision this is the case with regard to the greater number of motions relative to current affairs it is better to takes the votes by a visible sign rather than by acclamation especially if the assembly be numerous the sense of sight is a more correct judge than that of hearing the raised hands or the persons standing up are always distinct voices are more easily mistaken are the proportions doubtful—the operation by standing up and sitting down may be repeated or prolonged without inconvenience prolonged or reiterated exclamations would be equally ridiculous and inconvenient besides the voice is a deceptive witness strength of lungs or party feeling may give to a small number an apparent majority or at least render the result more often doubtful and distinct voting necessary acclamations ought to be avoided for another reason they have a contagious quality which tends to inflame the mind and to produce quarrels in matters which excite a lively interest in the parties they are a sort of warcry the plan of rising and sitting down discovers the voters—the plan of acclamation hides them in a crowd it may be employed for stifling all opposition for oppressing liberty and causing falsehood to triumph indeed to say that anything has passed by acclamation is to wish to make it be believed that it has passed unanimously but if this unanimity were real more would be gained by proving it by distinct voting the votes should not be taken successively but all at once as far as it is possible reference is here made to those cases in which the votes are taken openly this mode of taking the votes simultaneously is not only recommended as summary—it is also recommended as tending to weaken the influence of party and authority at least in those cases in which there has been no preconcerted arrangement distinct or regular voting is that in which all the votes are taken and counted—this operation is called dividing the assembly it may be effected by various methods by lists upon which each member inscribes his vote—or by counters—or by a simple change of place on the part of the voters the choice depends on circumstances or the nature of the assemblies precautions ought to be taken against all possible frauds either on the part of the voters lest they should give many votes or on that of the scrutineers lest they should falsify the votes     each member ought to have the right of demanding it by a simple formula delivered to the president—i require the division for it is not proper to deprive any member of the right of knowing whether the decision be really conformable to the wish of the assembly or of that of appealing to public opinion by making known those who vote for or against a measure he who demands a division can only have the one or other of two objects in view is the disproportion manifest—he desires to make known the relative force of the two parties—or he wishes to subject the voters to the law of publicity in this case it is a species of appeal to the people against the decision of the majority—or to speak more strictly it is a demonstration of the votes if this privilege were abused by the frequency of divisions for slightly important objects it might be remedied by requiring the concurrence of a certain number of individuals in a requisition for distinct voting but such an abuse is scarcely probable one individual would not often desire to divide the assembly solely to show that he alone was opposed to all the rest the mode used in the house of commons appears to me liable to several inconveniences all business is suspended—the assembly is in a state of confusion whilst the account is taken of the votes of those who leave the house and of those who remain this tumultuous movement of parties and this interruption which often last half an hour has none of the dignity which ought to characterize a legislative assembly but this is the least evil as this derangement is agreeable to no one a regular division is often foregone in order to prevent the inconvenience and as it is particularly disagreeable to those who are subjected to temporary expulsion it is often a subject of controversy to determine upon whom the inconvenience ought to fall for determining this controversy a rule has been required but this rule itself has furnished a crop of the most abstruse metaphysical questions a volume might be filled with the difficulties which have arisen from this branch of parliamentary jurisprudence this great assembly has been occupied in discussing points altogether as clear in themselves as the famous question of the schoolmen utrum chimæra bombilons in vacuo posset comedere secundas intentiones† these useless creations of science have for their common effect the restraint of liberty and the concealment of truth the majority of individuals recoil with affright from the aspect of this labyrinth and allow themselves implicitly to be led by those who are willing to purchase at the price of a dry and disgustful study the privilege of domination here as elsewhere mystery opens the door to imposture to create the world out of nothing was the work of divine power to create a science out of nothing and for nothing has often been the employment of human folly from a train of these subtleties one circumstance still more extraordinary has arisen in english voting it is that a member may be forced to vote against his will and that the legislative assembly should commit an act of falsehood if the members have from inattention or any other circumstance neglected to go out before the door is shut it is no longer at their option to vote as they wish—they are counted as voting with those who remain in the house although it be known that their vote is contrary to their known and avowed inclination—hatsell edit      ii     this mode of voting is an ancient custom established when printing was not invented and when the art of writing was not common in ancient rome the senate voted nearly in the same manner—manibus pedibusque descendo in sententiam vestram‡ i shall only say one word concerning the french practice—it has been spoken of elsewhere in the national assembly the summary mode takes place by sitting and standing the regular mode takes place by calling over the names—a method so long so fatiguing so     little favourable to individual independence that one is almost tempted to believe that the governing party has preserved it as a means of intimidating the weak it is true that silence is imposed upon the galleries—that signs of approbation or disapprobation are prohibited but the sovereign people often mutiny against these prohibitions in regular voting every member ought to be required to give his vote this obligation is founded upon the nature of his office as we have seen more in detail in treating of absence he cannot as appears to me neglect this duty except from indifference pusillanimity or corruption no says a wise man i shall not vote because i am not sufficiently enlightened upon the question i am equally afraid of error in declaring myself for or against indecision is a possible state the mind is as susceptible of this modification as of the two others to require an affirmative or negative answer from a man who is in doubt is to substitute constraint for liberty—is to oblige him to tell a lie the ancient romans in penal matters had seized the distinction of these three states of the mind and had found formulas for their expression absolvo—condemno—non liquet the jurisconsults and legislators who have drawn so many absurd and atrocious laws from roman jurisprudence have never thought of adopting this simple arrangement—this religious homage to truth i propose therefore a new form of voting there have hitherto been only two lists or two ballots—the one for the ayes the other for the noes i would establish a third for the neuters but it may be asked why require a man to vote whilst he is permitted to give a vote which will have effect neither on the one side nor the other it is replied that a neuter vote subjects the individual who gives it to the judgment of public opinion by abstaining from voting he may escape observation or he may excuse himself upon divers grounds but admit a neuter vote in a case in which the public interest is manifest the voter cannot withdraw himself from censure—it will exhibit either his crime or his incapacity in as clear a manner as if he had decidedly taken the wrong side in cases which admit of honest doubts the number of neuter votes would serve to enlighten the assembly by showing that its deliberations had not yet reached maturity chapter xv of committees §   of special committees the more numerous an assembly is the less is it fitted for certain labours by dividing itself into committees it multiplies itself—it resolves itself into many parts each one of which is better calculated to attain a certain object than the whole body would be each committee may be engaged with a different matter the labour is distributed—progress is accelerated—a degree of attention may be given to all the details of each new project of which a large assembly would be incapable this formation of committees or bureaux is absolutely necessary for the collection of documents—for engaging in those preparatory researches which require that a great number of persons should be heard—for the verification of accounts—c c it is there frequently that the preparation of a law is completed—a species of labour for which a large assembly is very ill adapted and which if attempted in such an aseembly would be attended with a considerable loss of time ought these committees to be named for the whole session or upon each occasion the correct answer will depend upon the circumstances and the object in view in matters of finance of commerce of political economy there will be in a permanent committee greater coherency in their proceedings more experience and special knowledge occasional committees have the advantage of being composed of members who having made the object in question their particular study may be considered as better acquainted with it and who as they are only charged with a single operation may give more application to it that they may better justify the choice of the assembly the great difficulty lies in the manner of naming committees the best mode perhaps would be to begin by a free nomination—each member being allowed to name a certain individual as a candidate and from this list to make nomination according to the relative majority of suffrages     but whatever may be the merit of these committees it is not proper that the assembly should so far rely upon them as to dispense with any one of its opportunities of debate by so doing it would be in danger of insensibly transferring the power of the whole body to a small body of individuals naturally exposed to secret influences §   of committees of the whole house in relation to all legislative measures the two houses of parliament are accustomed to resolve themselves into committees of the whole house that there measures may be discussed more freely than in the course of a regular debate the following are the points of difference between these two methods— in the house in committee   the motion or bill is considered as a whole   the motion or bill is considered article by article   a member can only speak once except for purposes of explanation   upon each article each member may speak as often as he pleases   the speaker is the president in the house   the committee has its own president chosen for the occasion   each motion requires to be seconded   a motion does not require to be seconded   upon a division one of the parties remains in the house the other goes into the lobby   upon a division the two parties go to different sides of the house   the motion may be avoided by moving the previous question   the previous question is not admissible  upon a division both parties now leave the house—ed some of these distinctions appear useful others are altogether arbitrary—   it is highly proper that bills and motions composed of a series of articles should undergo two different discussions—first as a whole and afterwards article by article this subject has already been considered in chapter xi §   of three debates   it is highly proper that upon important subjects there should be two forms of debate the strict debate in which each member may speak but speak only once—and the free debate in which he has the liberty of replying   with regard to the change of the president the inconveniences of allowing the president of the assembly to take part in its discussions have been elsewhere pointed out he is a judge and as a judge ought not to be exposed to the danger of being infected with party spirit chapter xvi of formulas formulas are models of what ought to be said upon each occasion by the individual to whom it is prescribed that he should express himself in a certain manner it can scarcely be determined beforehand how many formulas an assembly may require they will be many or few according to the number of the members and according to the nature of its powers it is proper for example that the president always take the votes in the same manner employing the same expressions—that the members make use of the same terms in presenting their motions in requiring the exercise of any of their rights—c c everything unnecessary in such formulas is pernicious clearness and brevity—such are the essential qualities to attempt to ornament them at the expense of precision is to disfigure them formulas not only save words they have a superior utility—they prevent variations which may have a concealed object—and above all they prevent disputes in england the royal sanction is always expressed by the same words le roi le veut and if he reject a bill the formula of refusal is equally determined le roi savisera judicial formulas have too often merited the reproach which has been almost everywhere thrown upon them of being at the same time vague and prolix—of sinning by omission and by excess their prolixity is easily accounted for in all cases in which lawyers have been able to find in the multiplication of words a pretext for their services and the increase of their price and when the spirit of revenue has been introduced into procedure and a traffic has been made of words increase of length has been given to the formulas that more profit might be derived from them it has in certain cases been thought right to proportion the number of words to the importance of the subject to dismiss a grave matter in two or three words it has been considered was not to form a sufficiently high idea of it—not to treat it with a sufficient dignity this is the error of a little mind the most sublime thoughts are often expressed by a single word         the book of fallacies from unfinished papers of jeremy bentham edited by a friend originally printed in          preface by the editor of the original edition the substance of this treatise drawn up from the most unfinished of all mr benthams manuscripts has already been published in french by m dumont and considering the very extensive diffusion of that tongue the present work but for one consideration might seem almost superfluous the original papers contain many applications of the writers principles to british institutions and british interests which with a view to continental circulation have been judiciously omitted by m dumont to the english reader the matter thus omitted cannot but be highly important and instructive with the view of enabling him to supply the deficiency and to obtain separately a treatise of general importance which in the french work has somewhat unfortunately been appended to one of more limited interest—namely that on the mode of conducting business in legislative assemblies—the editor has made the present attempt to have done justice to the original matter the whole ought to have been rewritten this the editors other pursuits did not allow him leisure to accomplish and he has been able to do little more than arrange the papers and strike out what was redundant in preparing the work for the press mr bentham has had no share—for whatever therefore may be esteemed defective in the matter or objectionable in the manner the editor is solely responsible still he thought it better that the work should appear even in its present shape than not appear at all and having devoted to it such portion of his time as could be spared from the intervals of a life of labour he hopes he shall not be without acknowledgment from those who are competent to appreciate the value of whatsoever comes from the great founder of the science of morals and legislation m dumonts work contains an examination of the declaration of the rights of man as proclaimed by the french constituent assembly this forms no part of the present volume to the subject of which indeed—fallacies employed in debate—it is not strictly pertinent but in fact the original papers have been mislaid and they seemed to lose so much of their spirit in a translation from the french that the contents of the additional chapter would not compensate for the additional bulk and expense of the book         the book of fallacies introduction section i a fallacy what by the name of fallacy it is common to designate any argument employed or topic suggested for the purpose or with a probability of producing the effect of deception—of causing some erroneous opinion to be entertained by any person to whose mind such argument may have been presented section ii fallacies by whom treated of heretofore the earliest author extant in whose works any mention is made on the subject of fallacies is aristotle by whom in the course or rather on the occasion of his treatise on logic not only is this subject started but a list of the species of argument to which this denomination is applicable is undertaken to be given upon the principle of the exhaustive method at so early a period employed by that astonishing genius and in comparison of what it might and ought to have been so little turned to account since two is the number of parts into which the whole mass is distributed—fallacies in the diction fallacies not in the diction and thirteen whereof in the diction six not in the diction seven is the number of the articles distributed between those two parts as from aristotle down to locke on the subject of the origination of our ideas deceptious and undeceptious included—so from aristotle down to this present day on the subject of the forms of which such ideas or combinations of ideas as are employable in the character of instruments of deception are susceptible—all is a blank to do something in the way of filling up this blank is the object of the present work in speaking of aristotles collection of fallacies as a stock to which from his time to the present no addition has been made all that is meant is that whatsoever arguments may have had deception for their object none besides those brought to view by aristotle have been brought to view in that character and under that name for between the time of aristotle and the present treatises of the art of oratory or popular argumentation have not been wanting in various languages and in considerable number nor can any of these be found in which by him who may wish to put a deceit upon those to whom he has to address himself instruction in no small quantity may not be obtained what in these books of instruction is professed to be taught comes under this general description—viz how—by means of words aptly employed to gain your point—to produce upon those with whom you have to deal—those to whom you have to address yourself the impression and by means of the impression the disposition most favourable to your purpose whatsoever that purpose may be as to the impression and disposition the production of which might happen to be desired—whether the impression were correct or deceptious—whether the disposition were with a view to the individual or community in question salutary indifferent or pernicious—was a question that seemed not in any of these instances to have come across the authors mind in the view taken by them of the subject had any such question presented itself it would have been put aside as foreign to the subject exactly as in a treatise on the art of war a question concerning the justice of the war   0 dionysius of halicarnassus cicero and quintilian isaac voss and though last and in bulk least yet not the least interesting our own gerard hamilton of whom more will be said are of this stamp between those earliest and these latest of the writers who have written on this subject and with this view others in abundance might be inserted but these are quite enough after so many ages past in teaching with equal complacency and indifference the art of true instruction and the art of deception—the art of producing good effects and the art of producing bad effects—the art of the honest man and the art of the knave—of promoting the purposes of the benefactor and the purposes of the enemy of the human race—after so many ages during which with a view to persuasion disposition action no instructions have been endeavoured to be given but in the same strain of imperturbable impartiality it seemed not too early in the nineteenth century to take up the subject on the ground of morality and to invite common honesty for the first time to mount the bench and take her seat as judge as to aristotles fallacies—unless his petitio principii and his fallacia non causa pro causâ be considered as exceptions—upon examination so little danger would be found in them that had the philosopher left them unexposed to do their worst the omission need not have hung very heavy upon his conscience scarce in any instance will be discovered any the least danger of final deception—the utmost inconvenience they seem capable of producing seems confined to a slight sensation of embarrassment and as to the embarrassment the difficulty will be not in pronouncing that the proposition in question is incapable of forming a just ground for the conclusion built upon it but in finding words for the description of the weakness which is the cause of this incapacity—not in discovering the proposition to be absurd but in giving an exact description of the form in which the absurdity presents itself section iii relation of fallacies to vulgar errors error—vulgar error is an appellation given to an opinion which being considered as false is considered in itself only and not with a view to any consequences of any kind of which it may be productive it is termed vulgar with reference to the persons by whom it is supposed to be entertained and this either in respect of their multitude simply or in respect of the lowness of the station occupied by them or the greater part of them in the scale of respectability in the scale of intelligence fallacy is an appellation applied not exclusively to an opinion or to propositions enunciative of supposed opinions but to discourse in any shape considered as having a tendency with or without design to cause any erroneous opinion to be embraced or even through the medium of erroneous opinion already entertained to cause any pernicious course of action to be engaged or persevered in thus to believe that they who lived in early or old times were because they lived in those times wiser or better than those who live in later or modern times is vulgar error the employing that vulgar error in the endeavour to cause pernicious practices and institutions to be retained is fallacy by those by whom the term fallacy has been employed—at any rate by those by whom it was originally employed—deception has been considered not merely as a consequence more or less probable but as a consequence the production of which was aimed at on the part at least of some of the utterers ελεγχοι σοφιστων arguments employed by the sophists is the denomination by which aristotle has designated his devices thirteen in number to which his commentators such of them as write in latin give the name of fallaciæ from fallere to deceive from which our english word fallacies that in the use of these instruments such a thing as deception was the object of the set of men mentioned by aristotle under the name of sophists is altogether out of doubt on every occasion on which they are mentioned by him this intention of deceiving is either directly asserted or assumed section iv political fallacies the subject of this work the present work confines itself to the examination and exposure of only one class of fallacies which class is determined by the nature of the occasion in which they are employed the occasion here in question is that of the formation of a decision procuring the adoption or rejection of some measure of government including under the notion of a measure of government a measure of legislation as well as of administration—two operations so intimately connected that the drawing of a     boundary line between them will in some instances be matter of no small difficulty but for the distinguishing of which on the present occasion and for the purpose of the present work there will not be any need under the name of a treatise on political fallacies this work will possess the character and in so far as the character answers the design of it have the effect of a treatise on the art of government—having for its practical object and tendency in the first place the facilitating the introduction of such features of good government as remain to be introduced in the next place giving them perpetuation—perpetuation not by means of legislative clauses aiming directly at that object an aim of which the inutility and mischievousness will come to be fully laid open to view in the course of this work but by means of that instrument viz reason by which alone the endeavour can be productive of any useful effect employed in this endeavour there are two ways in which this instrument may be applied one the more direct by showing on the occasion of each proposed measure in what way by what probable consequences it tends to promote the accomplishment of the end or object which it professes to have particularly in view the other the less direct by pointing out the irrelevancy and thus anticipating and destroying the persuasive force of such deceptious arguments as have been in use or appear likely to be employed in the endeavour to oppose it and to dissuade men from concurring in the establishment of it of these two different but harmonizing modes of applying this same instrument to its several purposes the more direct is that of which a sample has ever since the year   0  been before the public in that collection of unfinished papers on legislation published at paris in the french language and which had the advantage of passing through the hands of mr dumont but for whose labours it would scarcely in the authors lifetime at least have seen the light to exhibit the less direct but in its application the more extensive mode is the business of the present work to give existence to good arguments was the object in that instance to provide for the exposure of bad ones is the object in the present instance—to provide for the exposure of their real nature and thence for the destruction of their pernicious force sophistry is a hydra of which if all the necks could be exposed the force would be destroyed in this work they have been diligently looked out for and in the course of it the principal and most active of them have been brought to view section v division or classification of fallacies so numerous are the instruments of persuasion which in the character of fallacies the present work will bring to view that for enabling the mind to obtain any tolerably satisfactory command over it a set of divisions deduced from some source or other appeared to be altogether indispensable to frame these divisions with perfect logical accuracy will be an undertaking of no small difficulty—an undertaking requiring more time than either the author or editor has been able to bestow upon it an imperfect classification however being preferable to no classification at all the author had adopted one principle of division from the situation of the utterers of fallacies especially from the utterers in the british houses of parliament fallacies of the ins—fallacies of the outs—eitherside fallacies a principle of subdivision he found in the quarter to which the fallacy in question applied itself in the persons on whom it was designed to operate the affections the judgment and the imagination to the several clusters of fallacies marked out by this subdivision a latin affix expressive of the faculty or affection aimed at was given not surely for ostentation for of the very humblest sort would such ostentation be but for prominence for impressiveness and thence for clearness—arguments   ad verecundiam   ad superstitionem   ad amicitiam   ad metum   ad odium   ad invidentiam   ad quietem   ad socordiam   ad superbiam  0 ad judicium    ad imaginationem in the same manner locke has employed latin denominations to distinguish four kinds of argument—ad verecundiam ad ignorantiam ad hominem ad judicium mr dumont who some few years since published in french a translation or rather a redaction of a considerable portion of the present work divided the fallacies into three classes according to the particular or special object to which the fallacies of each class appeared more immediately applicable some he supposed destined to repress discussion altogether—others to postpone it—others to perplex when discussion could no longer be avoided the first class he called fallacies of authority the second fallacies of delay and the third fallacies of confusion he has also added to the name of each fallacy the latin affix which points out the faculty or affection to which it is chiefly addressed the present editor has preferred this arrangement to that pursued by the author     and with some little variation he has adopted it in this work in addition to the supposed immediate object of a given class of fallacies he has considered the subjectmatter of each individual fallacy with a view to the comprehending in one class all such fallacies as more nearly resemble each other in the nature of their subjectmatter and the classes he has arranged in the order in which the enemies of improvement may be supposed to resort to them according to the emergency of the moment first fallacies of authority including laudatory personalities the subjectmatter of which is authority in various shapes—and the immediate object to repress on the ground of the weight of such authority all exercise of the reasoning faculty secondly fallacies of danger including vituperative personalities the subjectmatter of which is the suggestion of danger in various shapes—and the object to repress altogether on the ground of such danger the discussion proposed to be entered on thirdly fallacies of delay the subjectmatter of which is an assigning of reasons for delay in various shapes—and the object to postpone such discussion with a view of eluding it altogether fourthly fallacies of confusion the subjectmatter of which consists chiefly of vague and indefinite generalities—while the object is to produce when discussion can no longer be avoided such confusion in the minds of the hearers as to incapacitate them for forming a correct judgment on the question proposed for deliberation in the arrangement thus made imperfections will be found the removal of which should the removal of them be practicable and at the same time worth the trouble must be left to some experter hand the classes themselves are not in every instance sufficiently distinct from each other the articles ranged under them respectively not appertaining with a degree of propriety sufficiently exclusive to the heads under which they are placed still imperfect as it is the arrangement will it is hoped be found by the reflecting reader not altogether without its use section vi nomenclature of political fallacies between the business of classification and that of nomenclature the connexion is most intimate to the work of classification no expression can be given but by means of nomenclature no name other than what in the language of grammarians is called a proper name—no name more extensive in its application than is the name of an individual can be applied but a class is marked out and as far as the work of the mind is creation created still however the two operations remain not the less distinguishable for of the class marked out a description may be given of any length and degree of complication the description given may be such as to occupy entire sentences in any number but a name properly so called consists either of no more than one word and that one a nounsubstantive or at most of no more than a substantive with its adjunct or if of words more than one they must be in such sort linked together as to form in conjunction no more than a sort of compound word occupying the place of a nounsubstantive in the composition of a sentence without prodigious circumlocution and inconvenience a class of objects however well marked out by description cannot be designated unless we substitute for the words constituting the description a word or very small cluster of words so connected as to constitute a name in this case nomenclature is to description what in algebraical operation the substitution of a single letter of the alphabet for a line of any length composed of numerical figures or letters of the alphabet or both together is to the continuing and repeating at each step the complicated matter of that same line the class being marked out whether by description or denomination an operation that will remain to be performed is if no name be as yet given to it the finding for it and giving to it a name if a name has been given to it the sitting in judgment on such name for the purpose of determining whether it presents as adequate a conception of the object as can be wished or whether some other may not be devised by which that conception may be presented in a manner more adequate blessed be he for evermore in whatsoever robe arrayed to whose creative genius we are indebted for the first conception of those tooshortlived vehicles by which as in a nutshell intimation is conveyed to us of the essential character of those awful volumes which at the touch of the sceptre become the rules of our conduct and the arbiters of our destiny—the alien act the turnpike act the middlesex waterworks bill c c how advantageous a substitute in some cases—how useful an additament in all cases would they not make to those authoritative masses of words called titles by which so large a proportion of sound and so small a proportion of instruction are at so large an expense of attention granted to us—an act to explain and amend an act entitled an act to explain and amend c c in two three four or at the outside half a     dozen words information without pretension is given which frequently when pretended is not given out confusion and darkness given instead of it in twice thrice four times or half a dozen times as many lines rouleaus of commodious and significative appellatives are thus issued day by day throughout the session from an invisible though not an unlicensed mint but no sooner has the last newspaper that appeared the last day of the session made its way to the most distant of its stages than all this learning all this circulating medium is as completely lost to the world and buried in oblivion as a french assignat so many yearly strings of words not one of which is to be found in the works of dryden with whom the art of coining words fit to be used became numbered among the lost arts and the art of giving birth to new ideas among the prohibited ones so many words not one of which would have found toleration from the orthodoxy of charles fox let the workshop of invention be shut up for ever rather than that the tympanum of taste should be grated by a new sound rigorous decree—more rigorous if obedience or execution kept pace with design than even the continentblockading and commerce crushing decrees proclaimed by buonaparte so necessary is it that when a thing is talked of there should be a name to call it by—so conducive not to say necessary to the prevalence of reason of common sense and moral honesty that instruments of deception should be talked of and well talked of and talked out of fashion—in a word talked down—that without any other licence than the old one granted by horace and which notwithstanding the acknowledged goodness of the authority men are so strangely backward to make use of—the author had under the spur of necessity struck out for each of these instruments of deception a separate barbarism such as the tools which he had at command would enable him to produce the objections however of a class of readers who under the denomination of men of taste attach much more importance to the manner than to the matter of a composition have induced the editor to suppress for the present some of these characteristic appellations and to substitute for them a less expressive periphrasis section vii contrast between the present work and hamiltons parliamentary logic of this work the general conception had been formed and in the composition of it some little progress made when the advertisements brought under the authors notice the posthumous work intituled parliamentary logic by the late william gerard hamilton distinguished from so many other hamiltons by the name of singlespeech hamilton of finding the need of a work such as the present superseded in any considerable degree by that of the right honourable orator the author had neither hope nor apprehension but his surprise was not inconsiderable on finding scarcely in any part of the two works any the smallest degree of coincidence in respect of practical views and objects it would not indeed be true to say that between the one and the other there exists not any relation for there exists a pretty close one namely the relation of contrariety when under the title of directions to servants swift presented to view a collection of such various faults as servants of different descriptions had been found or supposed by him liable to fall into his object it need scarce be said if he had any serious object beyond that of making his readers laugh was not that compliance but that noncompliance with the directions so humorously delivered should be the practical result taking that work of swifts for his pattern and what seemed the serious object of it for his guidance the author of this work occasionally found in the form of a direction for the framing of a fallacy what seemed the most convenvient vehicle for conveying a conception of its nature as in some instances for conveying a conception of the nature of the figure he is occupied in the description of a mathematician begins with giving an indication of the mode in which it may be framed or as the phrase is generated on these occasions much pains will not be necessary to satisfy the reader that the object of any instructions which may here be found for the composition of a fallacy has been not to promote but as far as possible to prevent the use of it—to prevent the use of it or at any rate to deprive it of its effect such if gerard hamilton is to be believed was not the object with gerard hamilton his book is a sort of school in which the means of advocating what is a good cause and the means of advocating what is a had cause are brought to view with equal frankness and inculcated with equal solicitude for success in a word that which machiavel has been supposed sometimes to aim at gerard hamilton as often as it occurs to him does not only aim at but aim at without disguise whether on this observation any such imputation as that of calumny is justly chargeable the samples given in the course of this work will put the reader in a condition to judge sketched out by himself and finished by     his editor and panegyrist the political character of gerard hamilton may be comprised in a few words he was determined to join with a party he was as ready to side with one party as another and whatever party he sided with as ready to say any one thing as any other in support of it independently of party and personal profit to be made from party—right and wrong good and evil were in his eyes matters of indifference but having consecrated himself to party—viz the party whatever it was from which the most was to be got—that party being of whatever materials composed the party of the ins —that party standing constantly pledged for the protection of abuse in every shape and in so far as good consists in the extirpation of abuse for the opposing and keeping out everything that is good—hence it was to the opposing of whatsoever is good in honest eyes that his powers such as they were were bent and pushed with peculiar energy one thing only he recognised as being malum in se as a thing being to be opposed at any rate and at any price even on any such extraordinary supposition as that of its being brought forward by the party with which at the time being it was his lot to side this was parliamentary reform in the course of his forty years labour in the service of the people one thing he did that was good one thing to wit that in the account of his panegyrist is set down on that side— one use of government in eyes such as his the principal use is to enable men who have shares in it to employ public money in payment for private service— within the view of gerard hamilton there lived a man whose talents and turn of mind qualified him for appearing with peculiar success in the character of an amusing companion in every good house in this character he for a length of time appeared in the house of gerard hamilton finding him an irishman hamilton got an irish pension of £ 00 ayear created for him and sent him back to ireland the man being in dublin and constituting in virtue of his office a part of the lord lieutenants family he appeared in the same character and with equal success in the house of the lord lieutenant†     his grace gave permanence to the sinecure and doubled the salary of it here was liberality upon liberality—here was virtue upon virtue it is by such things that merit is displayed—it is for such things that taxes are imposed it is for affording matter and exercise for such virtues—it is for affording rewards for such merit that the people of every country in so far as any good use is made of them are made to a man in whose eyes public virtue appeared in this only shape no wonder that parliamentary reform should be odious—of parliamentary reform the effect of which—and in eyes of a different complexion one main use—would be the drying up the source of all such virtues here in regard to the matter of fact there are two representations given of the same subject—representations perfectly concurrent in all points with one another though from very different quarters and beginning as well as ending with very different views and leading to opposite conclusions parliament a sort of gaminghouse members on the two sides of each house the players the property of the people—such portion of it as on any pretence may be found capable of being extracted from them—the stakes played for insincerity in all its shapes disingenuousness lying hypocrisy fallacy the instruments employed by the players on both sides for obtaining advantages in the game on each occasion—in respect of the side on which he ranks himself—what course will be most for the advantage of the universal interest a question never looked at never taken into account on which side is the prospect of personal advantage in its several shapes—this the only question really taken into consideration according to the answer given to this question in his own mind a man takes the one or the other of the two sides—the side of those in office if there be room or near prospect of room for him the side of those by whom office is but in expectancy if the future contingent presents a more encouraging prospect than the immediately present to all these distinguished persons—to the selfappointed professor and teacher of political profligacy to his admiring editor to their common and sympathizing friend the bigotryridden preacher of hollow and commonplace morality—parliamentary reform we see in an equal degree and that an extreme one an object of abhorrence how should it be otherwise by parliamentary reform the prey the perpetually renascent prey the fruit and object of the game would have been snatched out of their hands official pay in no case more than what is sufficient for the security of adequate service—no sinecures no pensions for hiring flatterers and pampering parasites—no plundering in any shape or for any purpose—amidst the cries of no theory no theory the example of america a lesson the practice of america transferred to britain the notion of the general predominance of selfregarding over social interest has been held up as a weakness incident to the situation of those whose converse has been more with books than men be it so look then to those teachers those men of practical wisdom whose converse has been with men at least as much as with books look in particular to this right honourable who in the house of commons had doubled the twenty years lucubration necessary for law who had served almost six apprenticeships who in that office had served out five complete clerkships—what says he selfregarding interest predominant over social interest—selfregard predominant no but selfregard sole occupant the universal interest howsoever talked of never so much as thought of—right and wrong objects of avowed indifference of the selfwritten memoirs of bubb dodington how much was said in their day—of gerard hamiltons parliamentary logic how little the reason is not unobvious dodington was all anecdote—hamilton was all theory what hamilton endeavoured to teach with malone and johnson for his bagbearers dodmgton was seen to practise nor is the veil of decorum cast off anywhere from his practice in hamiltons book for the first time has profligacy been seen stark naked in the reign of charles the second sir charles sedley and others were indicted for exposing themselves in a balcony in a state of perfect nudity in gerard hamilton may be seen the sir charles sedley of political morality sedley might have stood in his balcony till he was frozen and nobody the better nobody much the worse but hamiltons selfexposure is most instructive of parliamentary reform were a man to say that it is good because gerard hamilton was averse to it he would fall into the use of one of those fallacies against the influence of which it is one of the objects of the ensuing work to raise a barrier this however may be said and said without fallacy viz that it is the influence exercised by such men and the use to which such their influence is put by them that constitutes no small part of the political disease which has produced the demand for parliamentary reform in the character of a remedy to such men it is as natural and necessary that parliamentary reform should be odious as that botany bay or the hulks should be odious to thieves and robbers above all other species of business the one which gerard hamilton was most apprehensive     of his pupils not being sufficiently constant in the practice of is misrepresentation under the name of action thrice was gesticulation spoken of as the first accomplishment of his profession by the athenian orator by gerard hamilton in a collection of aphorisms     in number—in about  0 vice is recommended without disguise twelve times is misrepresentation i e premeditated falsehood with or without a mask recommended in the several forms of which it presented itself to him as susceptible viz in the way of false addition three times in the way of false substitution twice and in the way of omission seven times he was fearful of deceiving the only persons he meant not to deceive viz the pupils to whom he was teaching the art of deceiving others had he fallen into any such omission as that of omitting in the teaching of this lesson any instruction or example that might contribute to render them perfect in it of a good cause as such—of every cause that is entitled to the appellation of a good cause it is the characteristic property that it does not stand in need—of a bad cause of every cause that is justly designated by the appellation of a bad cause it is the characteristic property that it does stand in need—of assistance of this kind not merely indifference as between good and bad but predilection for what is bad is therefore the cast of mind betrayed or rather displayed by gerard hamilton for the praise of intelligence and active talent—that is for so much of it as constitutes the difference between what is to be earned by the advocation of good causes only and that which is to be earned by the advocation of bad causes likewise—of bad causes in preference to good ones—for this species and degree of praise it is that gerard hamilton was content to forego the merit of probity—of sincerity as a branch of probity and take to himself the substance as well as the shape and colour of the opposite vice this is the work which having been fairly written out by the author and thence by the editor presumed to have been intended for the press had been shown by him to his friend dr johnson this is the work which this same dr johnson if the editor is to be believed considered a very curious and masterly performance this is the work in which that pompous preacher of melancholy moralities saw if the editor is to be believed nothing to object to but the too great conciseness and refinement of some parts of it and the occasion it gave to a wish that some of the precepts had been more opened and expanded so far as concerns sincerity and candour in debate the two friends indeed even to judge of them from the evidence transmitted to us by their respective panegyrists seem to have been worthy to smell at the same nosegay and an expansion and enlargement composed by the hand that suggested it would beyond doubt have been a very curious and masterly as well as amusing addition to this very curious and masterly performance two months before his death when if he himself is to be believed ambition had in such a degree been extinguished in him by age and infirmities that after near forty years of experience a seat in parliament was become an object of indifference to him†—four years after he had been visited by a fit of the palsy‡—he was visited by a fit of virtue and in the paroxysm of that fit hazarded an experiment the object of which was to try whether in a then approaching parliament a seat might not be obtained without a complete sacrifice of independence the experiment was not successful from some lord whose name decorum has suppressed he was as his letter to his lordship testified on the point of receiving a seat and the object of this letter was to learn whether along with the seat the power of thinking for himself might be included in the grant—the question being accompanied with a request that in case of the negative some other nominee     might be the object of his lordships confidence the request was inadmissible and the confidence found some other object it is in the hope of substituting men to puppets and the will of the people to the will of noble lords puppets themselves to ministers or secret advisers that parliamentary reform has of late become once more an object of general desire but parliamentary reform was that sort of thing which he would sooner he said suffer his hand to be cut off than vote for whether it was before or after the experiment that this magnanimity was displayed the editor has not informed us the present which the world received in the publication of this work may on several accounts be justly termed a valuable one the only cause of regret is that the editor should by the unqualified approbation and admiration bestowed upon it have made the principles of the work as it were his own true it is that where instruction is given showing how mischief may be done or aimed at—whether it shall serve as a precept or a prohibition depends in the upshot upon the person on whom it operates with effect many a dehortation that not only has the effect of an exhortation but was designed to have that effect instructions how to administer poisons with success may on the other hand have the effect of enabling a person who takes them up with an opposite view to secure himself the more effectually against the attack of poisons but by the manner in which he writes by the accessory ideas presented by the words in which the instruction is conveyed there can seldom be much difficulty in comprehending in the delivery of his instructions whether the writer wishes that the suggestions conveyed by them should be embraced or rejected if occasionally there can be room for doubt in this respect at any rate no room can there be for any in the case of gerard hamilton as little can there be in the case of his editor and panegyrist qui mihi discipulus puer es cupis atque doceri huc ades hæc animo concipe dicta tuo the object or end in view is on occasion of a debate in parliament—in a supreme legislative assembly—how to gain your point whatever it be the means indicated as conducive to that end are sometimes fair ones sometimes foul ones and be they fair or foul they are throughout delivered with the same tone of seriousness and composure come unto me all ye who have a point to gain and i will show you how bad or good so as it be not parliamentary reform to me it is matter of indifference here then whatever be the influence of authority—authority in general and that of the writer in particular—it is in the propagation of insincerity of insincerity to be employed in the service it is most fit for and in which it finds its richest reward that throughout the whole course of this work and under the name of gerard hamilton not to speak of his editor and panegyrist such authority exerts itself to secure their children from falling into the vice of drunkenness it was the policy we are told of spartan fathers to exhibit their slaves in a state of inebriation that the contempt might be felt to which a man stands exposed when the intellectual part of his frame has been thrown into the disordered state to which it is apt by this means to be reduced an english father if he has any regard for the morals of his son and in particular for that vital part in which sincerity is concerned will perhaps nowhere else find so instructive an example as gerard hamilton has rendered himself by this book in that mirror may be seen to what a state of corruption the moral part of mans frame is capable of being reduced—to what a state of degradation in the present state of parliamentary morality a man is capable of sinking even when sober and without any help from wine and with what deliberate zeal he may himself exert his powers in the endeavour to propagate the infection in other minds part i fallacies of authority the subject of which is authority in various shapes and the object to repress all exercise of the reasoning faculty with reference to any measures having for their object the greatest happiness of the greatest number the course pursued by the adversaries of such measures has commonly been in the first instance to endeavour to repress altogether the exercise of the reasoning faculty by adducing authority in various shapes as conclusive upon the subject of the measure proposed but before any clear view can be given of     the deception liable to be produced by the abuse of the species of argument here in question it will be necessary to bring to view the distinction between the proper and the improper use of it in the ensuing analysis of authority one distinction ought to be borne in mind—it is the distinction between what may be termed a question of opinion or quid faciendum and what may be termed a question of fact or quid factum since it will frequently happen that whilst the authority of a person in respect to a question of fact is entitled to more or less regard it is not so entitled in respect of a question of opinion chapter i §   analysis of authority §   appeal to authority in what cases fallacious i what on any given occasion is the legitimate weight or influence of authority regard being had to the different circumstances in which a person the supposed declaration of whose opinion constitutes the authority in question was placed at the time of the delivery of such declaration  st upon the degree of relative and adequate intelligence on the part of the person whose opinion or supposed opinion constitutes the authority in question—say of the persona cujus— dly upon the degree of relative probity on the part of that same person— dly upon the nearness or remoteness of the relation between the immediate subject of such his opinion and the question in hand— thly upon the fidelity of the medium through which such supposed opinion has been transmitted including correctness and completeness upon such circumstances the legitimately persuasive force of the authority thus constituted seems to depend such are the sources in which any deficiency in respect of such persuasive force is to be looked for deficiency of attention—i e intensity and steadiness of attention—with reference to the influencing circumstances on which the opinion in order to be correct required to be grounded deficiency in respect of opportunity or matter of information with reference to the individual question in hand distance in point of time from the scene of the proposed measure distance in point of place—such again are the sources in which the situation of the person in question being given any deficiency in respect of relative and adequate intelligence is it seems to be looked for it is in the character of a cause of deficiency in relative and adequate information that distance in point of time operates as a cause of deficiency in respect of relative and adequate intelligence and so in regard to distance in point of place as to relative probity any deficiency referable to this head will be occasioned by the exposure of the persona cujus to the action of sinister interest concerning which see part v chapter iii—causes of the utterance of these fallacies the most ordinary and conspicuous deficiency in the article of relative probity is that of sincerity the improbity consisting in the opposition or discrepancy between the opinion expressed and the opinion really entertained but as not only declaration of opinion but opinion itself is exposed to the action of sinister interest—in so far as this is the case the deficiency is occasioned in two ways by the action of the sinister interest either the relevant means and materials are kept out of the mind or if this be not found practicable the attention is kept from fixing upon them with the degree of intensity proportioned to their legitimately persuasive force as to the mass of information received by any person in relation to a given subject the correctness and completeness of such information and thence the probability of correctness on the part of the opinion grounded on it will be in the joint ratio of the sufficiency of the means of collecting such information and the strength of the motives by which he was urged to the employment of those means on both these accounts taken together at the top of the seale of trustworthiness stands that mass of authority which is constituted by what may be termed scientific or professional opinion that is opinion entertained in relation to the subject in question by a person who by special means and motives attached to a particular situation in life may with reason be considered as possessed of such means of insuring the correctness of his opinion as cannot reasonably be expected to have place on the part of a person not so circumstanced as to the special motives in question they will in every case be found to consist of good or evil profit for instance or loss presenting themselves as eventually likely to befall the personin question—profit or other good in case of the correctness of his opinion—loss or other evil in the event of its incorrectness in proportion to the force with which a mans will is operated upon by the motives in question is the degree of attention employed in looking out for the means of information and the use made of them in the way of reflection towards the formation of his opinion thus in the case of every occupation which a man engages in with a view to profit the hope of gaining his livelihood and the fear of not gaining it are the motives by which     he is urged to apply his attention to the collection of whatsoever information may contribute to the correctness of the several opinions which he may have occasion to form respecting the most advantageous method of carrying on the several operations by which such profit may be obtained   the legitimately persuasive force of professional authority being taken as the highest term in the scale the following may be noticed as expressive of so many other species of authority occupying so many inferior degrees in the same scale—   authority derived from power the greater the quantity of power a man has no matter in what shape the nearer the authority of his opinion comes to professional authority in respect of the facility of obtaining the means conducive to correctness of decision   authority derived from opulence opulence—being an instrument of power and to a considerable extent applicable in a direct way to many or most of the purposes to which power is applicable—seems to stand next after power in the scale of instruments of facility as above   authority derived from reputation considered as among the efficient causes of respect by reputation understand on this occasion general reputation not special and relative reputation which would rank the species of authority under the head of professional authority as above note that of all these four species of authority it is only in the case of the first that the presumable advantage which is the efficient cause of its legitimately persuasive force extends to the article of motives as well as means by having the motives that tend to correctness of information the professional man has the means likewise since it is to the force of the motives under the stimulus of which he acts that he is indebted for whatever means he acquires it is from his having the motives that it follows that he has the means but in those other cases whatsoever be the means which a mans situation places within his reach it follows not that he has the motives—that he is actually under the impulse of any motive sufficient to the full action of that desire and that energy by which alone he can be in an adequate degree put in possession of the means on the contrary in proportion as in the scale of power the man in question rises above the ordinary level in that same proportion in respect of motives for exertion be the line of action what it may he is apt to sink below the same level because the greater the quantum of the share of the general mass of objects of desire that a man is already in possession of the greater is the amount of that portion of his desires which is already in a state of saturation and consequently the less the amount of that portion which remaining unsatiated is left free to operate upon his mind in the character of a motive under oriental despotism the person at whose command the means of information exist in a larger proportion than they do in the instance of any other person whatever is the despot but necessary motives being wanting no use is made by him of these means and the general result is a state of almost infantine imbecility and ignorance such in kind varying only in degree is the ease with every hand in which power is lodged unincumbered with obligation or in other words with sense of eventual danger in england the king the peer the opulent boroughholding or countyholding country gentleman should on the above principle present an instance of the sort of double scale in question in which while means decrease motives rise but so long as he takes any part at all in public affairs the sense of that weak kind of eventual responsibility to which notwithstanding the prevailing habits of idolatry the monarch as such stands at all times exposed suffices to keep his intellectual faculties at a point more or less above the point of utter ignorance whereas short of proveable idiotism there is no degree of imbecility that in either of those two other situations can suffice to render it matter of danger or inconvenience to the possessor either to leave altogether unexercised the power annexed to such situation or without the smallest regard for the public welfare to exercise it in whatever manner may be most agreeable or convenient to himself all this while it is only on the supposition of perfect relative probity viz of that branch of probity that consists of sincerity as well as absence of all such sources of delusion as to the person in question are liable to produce the effects of insincerity—in a word it is only on the supposition of the absence of exposure to the action of any sinister interest operating in such direction as to tend to produce either erroneous opinion or misrepresentation of a mans opinion on the subject in question that in so far as it depends on the information necessary to correctness of opinion the title of a mans authority to regard bears any proportion either to motives or to means of information as above on the contrary if either immediately or through the medium of the will a mans understanding be exposed to the dominion of sinister interest the more complete as well as correct the mass of relative information is which he possesses the more completely destitute of all title to regard i e to confidence unless it be in the opposite direction   0 will the authority or pretended or real opinion be hence it is that on the question what is the system of remuneration best adapted to the purpose of obtaining the highest degree of official aptitude throughout the whole field of official service—the authority of any person who here or elsewhere now or formerly was in possession or expectation of any such situation as that of minister of state so far from being greater than that of an average man is not equal to 0 but in the mathematical sense negative or so much below 0 i e so far as it affords a reason for looking upon the opposite opinion as the right and true one so again as to this question—what in so far as concerns cognoscibility or economy and expedition in procedure the state of the law ought to be—in the instance of any person who here or elsewhere recently or formerly but more particularly in this country was in possession or expectation of any situation professional or official the profitableness of which in the shape of pecuniary emolument or in any other shape such as power reputation ease and occasionally vengeance depended upon the incognoscibility the expensiveness the dilatoriness the vexatiousness of the system of judicial procedure—the weight of the authority—the strength of its title to credit on the part of those understandings to which the force of it is applied—is not merely equal to 0 but in the mathematical sense negative or so much below 0 note that where as above the weight or probative force of the authority in question is spoken of as being not positive but negative being rendered so by sinister interest what is taken for granted is that the direction in which the authority is offered is the same as that in which the sinister interest acts for if the direction in which the sinister interest acts lying one way the direction in which the opinion acts lies the other way—in such case the title of the opinion to credit on the part of the understandings to which it is proposed so far from being destroyed or weakened is much increased because the grounds for correctness of opinion the motives and the means which in that case lead to correctness being more completely within the reach of and according to probability present to the minds of this class of men the forces that tend to promote aberration having by this supposition spent themselves in vain the chance for correctness is thereby greater accordant with this and surely enough accordant with experience and common sense is one of the few rational rules that as yet have received admittance among the technicallyestablished rules of evidence in a mans own favour his own testimony is the weakest—in his disfavour the strongest evidence it is on this account that wherever a man is in a superior degree furnished as above with means of and motives for obtaining relevant information the stronger the force of the sinister interest under the action of which his opinion is delivered the stronger is his title to attention in the way of direct and relevant argument applying to the question in hand in a direct and specific way if the question be susceptible of any such arguments in proportion to the efficiency of the motives and means he has for the acquisition of such relevant information is the probability of his bringing such information to view if then instead of bringing to view any such relevant information or by way of supplement and support to such relevant information when weak and insufficient the arguments which he brings to view are of the irrelevant sort the addition of such bad arguments affords a sort of circumstantial evidence and that of no mean degree of probative force of the inability of the side thus advocated to furnish any good ones closeness of the relation between the immediate subject in hand and the subject of the supposed opinion of which the authority is composed has been mentioned as the third circumstance necessary to be considered in estimating the credit due to authority—of this it is evident enough there cannot be any common and generally applicable measure it is that sort of quantity of the amount of which a judgment can only be pronounced in each individual case as to the fidelity of the medium through which the opinion constitutive of the authority in question has been or is supposed to have been transmitted—it is only pro memoria that this topic is here brought to view in the list of the circumstances from which the legitimately persuasive force of an opinion constitutive of authority is liable to experience decrease of its admission into this list the propriety is on the bare mention as manifest as it is in the power of reasoning to make it in this respect the rule and measure as well as cause of such decrease stand exactly on the same ground as the rule with respect to any other evidence authority being to the purpose in question neither more nor less than an article of circumstantial evidence the need for the legitimately persuasive force of authority i e probability of comparatively superior information on the one hand is in the inverse ratio of information on the part of the person on whom it is designed to operate on the other the less the degree in which each man is qualified to form a judgment on any subject on the ground of specific and relevant information—on the     ground of direct evidence—the more cogent the necessity he is under of trusting with a degree of confidence more or less implicit to that species of circumstantial evidence and in proportion to the number of the persons who possess each within himself the means of forming an opinion on any given subject on the ground of such direct evidence the greater the number of the persons to whom it ought to be matter of shame to frame and pronounce their respective decision on no better ground than that of such inconclusive and necessarily fallacious evidence of the truth of this observation men belonging to the several classes whose situation in the community has given to them in conjunction with efficient power a separate and sinister interest opposite to that of the community in general have seldom failed to be in a sufficient degree percipient in this perception in the instance of the fraternity of lawyers may be seen one cause though not the only one of the anxiety betrayed and pains taken to keep the rule of action in a state of as complete incognoscibility as possible on the part of those whose conduct is professed to be directed by it and whose fate is in fact disposed of by it in this same perception in the instance of the clergy of old times in the romish church may be seen in like manner the cause or at least one cause of the pains taken to keep in the same state of incognoscibility the acknowledged rule of action in matters of sacred and supernatural law in this same perception in the instance of the english clergy of times posterior to those of the romish church—in this same perception may be seen one cause of the exertions made by so large a proportion of the governing classes of that hierarchy to keep back and if possible render abortive the system of invention which has for its object the giving to the exercise of the art of reading the highest degree of universality possible to return be the subjectmatter what it may to the account of fallacies cannot be placed any mention made of an opinion to such or such an effect as having been delivered or intimated by such or such a person by name when the sole object of the reference is to point out a place where relevant arguments adduced on a given occasion may be found in a more complete or perspicuous state than they are on the occasion on which they are adduced in the case thus supposed there is no irrelevancy the arguments referred to are by the supposition relevant ones such as if the person by whom they have been presented to view were altogether unknown would not lose anything of their weight the opinion is not presented as constitutive of authority as carrying any weight of itself and independently of the considerations which he has brought to view neither is there any fallacy in making reference to the opinion of this or that professional person in a case to such a degree professional or scientific with relation to the hearers or readers that the forming a correct judgment on such relevant and specific arguments as belong to it is beyond their competence in matters touching medical science chemistry astronomy the mechanical arts the various branches of the art of war c no other course could be pursued §   appeal to authority in what cases fallacious the case in which reference to authority is open to the imputation of fallacy is where in the course of a debate touching a subject lying in such sort within the comprehension of the debaters that argument bearing the closest relation to it would be perfectly within the sphere of their comprehension—authority a sort of argument in the case here in question not relevant is employed in the place of such relevant arguments as might have been adduced on one side or in opposition to irrelevant ones adduced on the other side but the case in which the practice of adducing authority in the character of an argument is in the highest degree exposed to the imputation of fallacy is where the situation of the debaters being such that the forming a correct conception of and judgment on such relevant arguments as the subject admits is not beyond their competency the opinion real or supposed of any person who from his profession or other particular situation derives an interest opposite to that of the public is adduced in the character of an argument in lieu of such relevant arguments as the question ought to furnish—in an appendix to this chapter will be given examples of persons whose declared opinions on a question of legislation are in a peculiar degree liable to be tinged with falsity by the action of sinister interest he who on a question concerning the propriety of any law or established practice with reference to the time being refers to authority as decisive of the question assumes the truth of one or other of two positions viz that the principle of utility—i e that the greatest happiness of the greatest number—is     not at the time in question the proper standard for judging of the merits of the question or that the practice of other and former times or the opinion of other persons ought to be regarded in all cases as conclusive evidence of the nature and tendency of the practice—conclusive evidence superseding the necessity and propriety of any recourse to reason or present experience in the first case being really an enemy to the community that he should be esteemed as such by all to whom the happiness of the community is an object of regard is no more than right and reasonable—no more than what if men acted consistently would uniformly take place in the other case what he does is virtually to acknowledge himself not to possess any powers of reasoning which he himself can venture to think it safe to trust to incapable of forming for himself any judgment by which he looks upon it as safe to be determined he betakes himself for safety to some other man or set of men of whom he knows little or nothing except that they lived so many years ago that the period of their existence was by so much anterior to his own time—by so much anterior and consequently possessing for its guidance so much the less experience but when a man gives this account of himself—when he represents his own mind as labouring under this kind and degree of imbecility—what can be more reasonable than that he should be taken at his word—that he should be considered as a person labouring under a general and incurable imbecility from whom nothing relevant can reasonably be expected he who in place of reasoning deduced if the subject be of a practical nature from the consideration of the end in view employs authority makes no secret of the opinion he entertains of his hearers or his readers he assumes that those to whom he addresses himself are incapable each of them of forming a judgment of their own if they submit to this insult may it not be presumed that they acknowledge the justice of it of imbecility—at any rate of selfconscious and selfavowed imbecility—proportionable humility ought naturally to be the result on the contrary so far from humility—of this species of idolatry—of this worshipping of dead mens bones—all passions the most opposite to humility—pride anger obstinacy and overbearingness—are the frequent not to say the constant accompaniments with the utmost strength of mind that can be displayed in the field of reasoning no reasonable man ever manifests so much heat assumes so much or exhibits himself disposed to bear so little as these men whose title to regard and notice is thus given up by themselves whence this inconsistency—whence this violence from this alone that having some abuse to defend—some abuse in which they have an interest and a profit—and finding it on the ground of present public interest indefensible they fly for refuge to the only sort of argument in which so much as the pretension of being sincere in error can find countenance by authority support the strength of which is proportioned to the number of the persons joining in it is given to systems of opinions at once absurd and pernicious—to the religion of buddh of brama of foh of mahomet and hence it may be inferred that the probative force of authority is not increased by the number of those who may have professed a given opinion—unless indeed it could be proved that each individual of the multitudes who professed the opinion possessed in the highest degree the means and motives for ensuring its correctness even in such a case it would not warrant the substitution of the authority for such direct evidence and arguments as any case in debate might be able to supply supposing the debaters capable of comprehending such direct evidence and arguments but that in ordinary cases no such circumstantial evidence should possess any such legitimately probative force as to warrant the addition much less the substitution of it to that sort of information which belongs to direct evidence will it is supposed be rendered sufficiently apparent by the following considerations—   if in theory any the minutest degree of force were ascribed to the elementary monade of the body of authority thus composed and this theory were followed up in practice the consequence would be the utter subversion of the existing state of things—as for example—if distance in point of time were not sufficient to destroy the probative force of such authority the catholic religion would in england be to be restored to the exclusive dominion it possessed and exercised for so many centuries the toleration laws would be to be repealed and persecution to the length of extirpation would be to be substituted to whatever liberty in conduct and discourse is enjoyed at present—and in this way after the abolished religion had thus been triumphantly restored an inexorable door would be shut against every imaginable change in it and thence against every imaginable reform or improvement in it through all future ages   if distance in point of place were not understood to have the same effect some other religion than the christian—the religion or mahomet for example or the way of thinking     in matters of religion prevalent in china—would have to be substituted by law to the christian religion in authority defence such as it is has been found for every imperfection for every abuse for every the most pernicious and most execrable abomination that the most corrupt system of government has ever husbanded in its bosom— and here may be seen the mischief necessarily attached to the course of him whose footsteps are regulated by the finger of this blind guide what is more from hence may inferences be deduced—nor those illgrounded ones—respecting the probity or improbity the sincerity or insincerity of him who standing in a public situation blushes not to look to this blind guide to the exclusion of or in preference to reason—the only guide that does not begin with shutting his own eyes for the purpose of closing the eyes of his followers as the world grows older if at the same time it grows wiser which it will do unless the period shall have arrived at which experience the mother of wisdom shall have become barren the influence of authority will in each situation and particularly in parliament become less and less take any part of the field of moral science private morality constitutional law private law—go back a few centuries and you will find argument consisting of reference to authority not exclusively but in as large a proportion as possible as experience has increased authority has been gradually set aside and reasoning drawn from facts and guided by reference to the end in view true or false has taken its place of the enormous mass of roman law heaped up in the school of justinian—a mass the perusal of which would employ several lives occupied by nothing else—materials of this description constitute by far the greater part a throws out at random some loose thought b catching it up tells you what a thinks—at least what a said c tells you what has been said by a and b and thus like an avalanche the mass rolls on happily it is only in matters of law and religion that endeavours are made by the favour shown and currency given to this fallacy to limit and debilitate the exercise of the right of private inquiry in as great a degree as possible though at this time of day the exercise of this essential right can no longer be suppressed in a complete and direct way by legal punishment in mechanics in astronomy in mathematics in the newborn science of chemistry—no one has at this time of day either effrontery or folly enough to avow or so much as to insinuate that the most desirable state of these branches of useful knowledge the most rational and eligible course is to substitute decision on the ground of authority to decision on the ground of direct and specific evidence in every branch of physical art and science the folly of this substitution or preference is matter of demonstration—is matter of intuition and as such is universally acknowledged in the moral branch of science religion not excluded the folly of the like receipt for correctness of opinion would not be less universally recognised if the wealth the ease and the dignity attached to and supported by the maintenance of the opposite opinion did not so steadily resist such recognition causes of the employment and prevalence of this fallacy it is obvious that this fallacy in all its branches is so frequently resorted to by those who are interested in the support of abuses or of institutions pernicious to the great body of the people with the intention of suppressing all exercise of reason a foolish or untenable proposition resting on its own support or the mere credit of the utterer could not fail speedily to encounter detection and exposure—the same proposition extracted from a page of blackstone or from the page or mouth of any other person to whom the idle and unthinking are in the habit of unconditionally surrendering their understandings shall disarm all opposition blind obsequiousness ignorance idleness irresponsibility anticonstitutional dependence anticonstitutional independence are the causes which enable this fallacy to maintain such an ascendency in the governing assemblies of the british empire first in this situation one man is on each occasion ready to borrow an opinion of another because through ignorance and imbecility he feels himself unable or through want of solicitude unwilling to form one for himself and he is thus ignorant if natural talent does not fail him because he is so idle knowledge especially in so wide and extensive a field requires study study labour of mind bestowed with more or less energy for a greater or less length of time but secondly in a situation for which the strongest talents would not be more than adequate there is frequently a failure of natural talent because in so many instances admission to that situation depends either on the person admitted or on others to whom whether he has or has not the requisite talents is a matter of indifference that no degree of intellectual deficiency short of palpable idiocy can have the effect of excluding a man from occupying it thirdly the sense of responsibility is in the instance of a large proportion of the members wanting altogether because in so small     a proportion are they at any time in any degree of dependence on the people whose face is in their hands and because in the instance of the few who are in any degree so dependent the efficient cause and consequently the feeling of such dependence endures during so small a proportion of the time for which they enjoy their situations because also while so few are dependent on those on whom they ought to be dependent so many are dependent on those who ought to be dependent on them—those servants of the crown on whose conduct they are commissioned by their constituents to act as judges what share of knowledge intelligence and natural talent is in the house is thus divided between those who are and their rivals who hope to be servants of the crown the consequence is that those excepted in whom knowledge intelligence and talent are worse than useless the house is composed of men the furniture of whose minds is made up of discordant prejudices of which on each occasion they follow that by which the interest or passion of the moment is most promoted then with regard to responsibility so happily have matters been managed by the house—a seat there is not less clear of obligation than a seat in the operahouse in both a man takes his seat then only when he cannot find more amusement elsewhere for both the qualifications are the same—a ticket begged or bought in neither is a man charged with any obligation other than the negative one of not being a nuisance to the company in both the length as well as number of attendances depends on the amusement a man finds except in the case of the house as regards the members dependent on the crown true it is that a selfcalled independent member is not necessarily ignorant and weak if by accident a man possessed of knowledge and intelligence is placed in the house his seat will not deprive him of his acquirements all therefore that is meant is only that ignorance does not disqualify not that knowledge does of the crown and its creatures it is the interest that this ignorance be as thick as possible why because the thicker the ignorance the more completely is the furniture of mens minds made up of those interestbegotten prejudices which render them blindly obsequious to all those who with power in their hands stand up to take the lead but the emperor of morocco is not more irresponsible and therefore more likely to be ignorant and prone to be deceived by the fallacy of authority than a member of the british parliament—the emperor of moroccos power is clear of obligation so is the members—the emperors power it is true is an integer and the members but a fraction of it but no ignorance prevents a man from becoming or continuing emperor of morocco nor from becoming or continuing a member—the emperors title is derived from birth so is that of many a member—to enjoy his despotism no fraud insincerity hypocrisy or jargon is necessary to the emperor much of all to the member—by ascending and maintaining his throne no principle is violated by the emperor by the member if a boroughholder many are violated on his taking and retaining his seat—by being a despot the emperor is not an impostor the member is—the emperor pretends not to be a trustee agent deputy delegate representative lying is not among the accompaniments of his tyranny and insolence the member does pretend all this and if a boroughholder lies a trustholder yes but a trustbreaker—an agent yes but for himself—a representative of the people yes but so as mr kemble is of macbeth—a deputy yes because it has not been in their power to depute to delegate anybody else—deputy—delegate—neither title he assumes but for argument and when he cannot help it deputation being matter of fact the word presents an act with all its circumstances—viz fewness of the electors their want of freedom c representation is a more convenient word—the acts c are kept out of sight by it—it is a mere fiction the offspring of lawyercraft and any one person or thing may be represented by any other by canvass with colours a man is represented by a king the whole people by an ambassador the king and thus the people remedy against the influence of this fallacy for banishing ignorance for substituting to it a constantly competent measure of useful appropriate and general instruction the proper the necessary the only means he not deep beneath the surface the sources of instruction being supposed at command and the quantity of natural talent given the quantity of information obtained will in every case be as the quantity of mental labour employed in the collection of it—the quantity of mental labour as the aggregate strength of the motives by which a man is excited to labour in the existing order of things there is comparatively speaking no instruction obtained because no labour is bestowed no labour is bestowed because none of the motives by which men are excited to labour are applied in this direction the situation being by the supposition an object of desire if the case were such that without labour employed in obtaining instruction there would be no chance of obtaining the situation or but an inferior chance—while     in case of labour so employed there would be a certainty or a superior chance—here instruction would have its motives—here labour applied to the attainment of instruction—here consequently instruction itself—would have its probably efficient cause the quality—i e the relative applicability of the mass of information obtained—is an object not to be overlooked the goodness of the quality will depend on the liberty enjoyed in respect of the choice by prohibitions with penalties attached to the delivery of alleged information relative to a subject in question or any part of it the quality of the whole mass is impaired and an implied certificate is given of the truth and utility of whatsoever portion is thus endeavoured to be suppressed appendix examples of descriptions of persons whose declared opinions upon a question of legislation are peculiarly liable to be tinged with falsity by the action of sinister interest   lawyers oppositeness of their interest to the universal interest the opinions of lawyers in a question of legislation particularly of such lawyers as are or have been practising advocates are peculiarly liable to be tinged with falsity by the operation of sinister interest to the interest of the community at large that of every advocate is in a state of such direct and constant opposition especially in civil matters that the above assertion requires an apology to redeem it from the appearance of trifling the apology consists in the extensively prevailing propensity to overlook and turn aside from a fact so entitled to notice it is the peoples interest that delay vexation and expense of procedure should be as small as possible—it is the advocates that they should be as great as possible viz expense in so far as his profit is proportioned to it—factitious vexation and delay in so far as inseparable from the profityielding part of the expense as to uncertainty in the law it is the peoples interest that each mans security against wrong should be as complete as possible that all his rights should be known to him that all acts which in the case of his doing them will be treated as offences may be known to him as such together with their eventual punishment that he may avoid committing them and that others may in as few instances as possible suffer either from the wrong or from the expensive and vexatious remedy hence it is their interest that as to all these matters the rule of action in so far as it applies to each man should at all times be not only discoverable but actually present to his mind such knowledge which it is every mans interest to possess to the greatest it is the lawyers interest that he possess it to the narrowest extent possible it is every mans interest to keep out of lawyers hands as much as possible—it is the lawyers interest to get him in as often and keep him in as long as possible—and thence that any written expression of the words necessary to keep nonlawyers out of his hand may as long as possible be prevented from coming into existence and when in existence may as long as possible be kept from being present to his mind—and when presented from staying there it is the lawyers interest therefore that people should continually suffer for the nonobservance of laws which so far from having received efficient promulgation have never yet found any authoritative expression in words this is the perfection of oppression yet propose that access to knowledge of the laws be afforded by means of a code lawyers one and all will join in declaring it impossible to any effect as occasion occurs a judge will forge a rule of law to that same effect in any determinate form of words propose to make a law that same judge will declare it impossible it is the judges interest that on every occasion his declared opinion be taken for the standard of right and wrong—that whatever he declares right or wrong be universally received as such how contrary soever such declaration be to truth and utility or to his own declaration at other times—hence that within the whole field of law mens opinions of right and wrong should be as contradictory unsettled and thence as obsequious to him as possible in particular that the same conduct which to others would occasion shame and punishment should to him and his occasion honour and reward that on condition of telling a lie it should be in his power to do what he pleases the injustice and falsehood being regarded with complacency and reverence that as often as by falsehood money or advantage in any other shape can be produced to him it should be regarded as proper for him to employ reward or punishment or both for the procurement of such falsehood consistently with mens abstaining from violences by which the person and property of him and his would be alarmingly endangered it is his interest that intellectual as well as moral depravation should be as intense and extensive as possible that transgressions cognizable by him     should be as numerous as possible that injuries and other transgressions committed by him should be reverenced as acts of virtue that the suffering produced by such injuries should be placed not to his account but to the immutable nature of things or to the wrongdoer who but for the encouragement from him would not have become such his professional and personal interest being thus adverse to that of the public from a lawyers declaration that the tendency of a proposed law relative to procedure c is pernicious the contrary inference may not unreasonably be drawn from those habits of misrepresenting their own opinion i e of insincerity which are almost peculiar to this in comparison with other classes one presumption is that he does not entertain the opinion thus declared—another that if he does he has been deceived into it by sinister interest and the authority of coprofessional men in like manner deceivers or deceived in other words it is the result of interestbegotten prejudice in the case of every other body of men it is generally expected that their conduct and language will be for the most part directed by their own interest that is by their own view of it in the case of the lawyer the ground of this persuasion so far from being weaker is stronger than in any other case his evidence being thus interested evidence according to his own rules his declaration of opinion on the subject here pointed out would not be so much as hearable it is true were those rules consistently observed judicature would be useless and society dissolved accordingly they are not so observed but observed or broken pretty much at pleasure but they are not the less among the number of those rules the excellence and inviolability of which the lawyer is never tired of trumpeting but on any point such as those in question nothing could be more unreasonable nothing more inconsistent with what has been said above than to refuse him a heariny on every such point his habits and experience afford him facilities not possessed by any one else for finding relevant and specific arguments when the nature of the case affords any but the surer he is of being able to find such arguments if any such are to be found the stronger the reason for treating his naked declaration of opinion as unworthy of all regard accompanied by specific arguments it is useless destitute of them it amounts to a virtual confession of their nonexistence so matters stand on the question what ought to be law on the question what the law is so long as the rule of action is kept in the state of common alias unwritten alias imaginary law authority though next to nothing is everything the question is what on a given occasion a the judge is likely to think wait till your fortune has been spent in the inquiry and you will know but forasmuch as it is naturally a mans wish to be able to give a guess what the result will eventually be before he has spent his fortune in the view if possible to avoid spending his fortune and getting nothing in return for it he applies through the medium of b an attorney for an opinion to c a counsel who considering what d a former judge has on a subject supposed to be more or less analogous to the one in question said or been supposed to say deduces therefrom his guess as to what when the time comes judge a he thinks will say and gives it you a shorter way would be to put the question at once to a but for obvious reasons this is not permitted on many cases again as wellgrounded a guess might be had of an astrologer for five shillings as of a counsel for twice or thrice as many guineas but that the lawyer considers the astrologer as a smuggler and puts him down but packwoods opinion on the goodness of his own razors would be a safer guide for judging of their goodness than a judges opinion on the goodness of a proposed law it is packwoods interest that his razors be as good as possible—the judges that the law be as bad yet thought to be as good as possible it would not be the judges interest that his commodity should be thus bad if as in the case of packwood the customer had other shops to go to but in this case even when there are two shops to go to the shops being in confederacy the commodity is equally bad in both and the worse the commodity the better it is said to be in the case of the judges commodity no experience suffices to undeceive men the bad quality of it is referred to any cause but the true one example   churchmen oppositeness of their interest to the universal interest in the lawyers case it has been shown that on the question what on such or such a point ought to be law—to refer to a lawyers opinion given without or against specific reasons is a fallacy—its tendency in proportion to the regard paid to it deceptious—the cause of this deceptious tendency sinister interest to the action of which all advocates and being made from advocates all judges stand exposed to the churchmans case the same reasoning applies as in the lawyers case the objection does not arise on the question what law is but what ought to be law—so in the churchmans case it does not arise as to what in matters of religion is law but as to what in those matters ought to be law on a question not connected with religion reference to     a churchmans opinion as such as authority can scarcely be considered as a fallacy such opinion not being likely to be considered as constitutive of authority to understand how great would be the probability of deception if on the question what in matters of religion ought to be law the unsupported opinion of a churchman were to be regarded as authority we must develope the nature and form of the sinister interest by which any declaration of opinion from such a quarter is divested of all title to regard the sources of a churchmans sinister interest are as follows—   on entering into the profession as condition prevedent to advantage from it in the shape of subsistence and all other shapes he makes of necessity a solemn and recorded declaration of his belief in the truth of    articles framed     years ago—the date of which the ignorance and violence of the time considered should suffice to satisfy a reflecting mind of the impossibility of their being all of them really believed by any person at present   in this declaration is generally understood to be included an engagement or undertaking in case of original belief and subsequent change never to declare but if questioned to deny such change   in the institution thus established he beholds shame and punishment attached to sincerity—rewards in the largest quantity to absurdity and insincerity now the presumptions resulting from such an application of reward and punishment to engage men to declare assent to given propositions are— st that the proposition is not believed by the proposer   thence that it is not true   thence that it is not believed by the acceptor it is impossible by reward or punishment to produce real and immediate belief but the following effects may certainly be produced—  the abstaining from any declaration of disbelief   declaration of belief   the turning aside from all considerations tending to produce disbelief   the looking out for and fastening exclusive attention to all considerations tending to produce belief—authority especially by which a sort of vague and indistinct belief of the most absurd propositions has everywhere been produced on no other part of the field of knowledge are reward or punishment nowadays considered as fit instruments for the production of assent or dissent a schoolmaster would not be looked upon as same who instead of putting euclids demonstrations into the hands of his scholar should without the demonstrations put the propositions into his hand and give him a guinea for signing a paper declarative of his belief in them or lock him up for a couple of days without food on his refusal to sign it and so in chemistry mechanics husbandry astronomy or any other branch of knowledge it is true that in those parts of knowledge in which assent and dissent are left free the importance of truth may be esteemed not so great as here where it is thus influenced but the more important the truth the more flagrant the absurdity and tyranny of employing for the propagation of it instruments the employment of which has a stronger tendency to propagate error than truth   for teaching such religious truths as men are allowed to teach together with such religious error as they are thus forced to teach the churchman sees rewards allotted in larger quantities than are allotted to the most useful services of much of the matter of reward thus bestowed the disposal is in the kings hands with the power of applying it and motives for applying it to the purpose of parliamentary service paying for habitual breach of trust and keeping in corrupt and see et dependence on his agents those agents of the people whose duty it is to sit as judges over the agents of the king in ireland of ninetenths of those on pretence of instructing whom this vast mass of reward is extorted it is known that being by conscience precluded from hearing it is impossible that they should derive any benefit from such instruction in scotland where government reward is not employed in giving support to it churchofenglandism is reduced to next to nothing the opinions which in this state of things interest engages a churchman to support are—  that reward to the highest extent has no tendency to promote insincerity even where practicable to an unlimited extent and without chance of detection   or that money given in case of compliance refused in case of noncompliance is not reward for compliance   or that punishment applied in case of noncompliance withheld in case of compliance is not punishment   or that insincerity is not vice but virtue and as such ought to be promoted   that it is not merely consistent with but requisite to good government to extort money from poor and rich to be applied as reward for doing nothing or for doing but a small part of that which is done by others for a small proportion of the same reward and this on pretence of rendering service which ninetenths of the people refuse to receive it is the interest of the persons thus engaged in a course of insincerity that by the same means perseverance in the same course should be universal and perpetual for suppose in case of the reward being withheld the number annually making the same declaration should be reduced to half this would be presumptive evidence of insincerity on the part of half of those who made it before the more flagrant the absurdity the stronger is each mans interest in engaging     as many as possible in joining with him in the profession of assent to it for the greater the number of such codeclarants the greater the number of those of whose professions the elements of authority are composed and of those who stand precluded from casting on the rest the imputation of insincerity the following then are the abuses in the defence of which all churchmen are enlisted   perpetuation of immorality in the shape of insincerity   of absurdity in subjects of the highest importance   extortion inflicted on the many for the benefit of the few   reward bestowed on idleness and incapacity to the exclusion of labour and ability   the matter of corruption applied to the purposes of corruption in a constant stream   in one of these kingdoms a vast majority of the people kept in degradation avowedly for no other than the above purposes but whoever is engaged by interest in the support of any one government abuse is engaged in the support of all each giving to the others his support in exchange it being the characteristic of abuse to need and receive support from fallacy it is the interest of every man who derives profit from abuse in any shape to give the utmost currency to fallacy in every shape—viz as well to those fallacies which render more particular service to others abuses as those which render such service to his own it being the interest of each person so situated to give the utmost support to abuse and the utmost currency to fallacy in every shape it is also his interest to give the utmost efficiency to the system of education by which men are most effectually divested both of the power and will to detect and expose fallacies and thence to suppress every system of education in proportion as it has a contrary tendency lastly the stronger the interest by which a man is urged to give currency to fallacy and thus to propagate deception the more likely is it that such will be his endeavour the less fit therefore will his opinion be to serve in the character of authority as a standard and model for the opinions of others chapter ii the wisdom of our ancestors or chinese argument—ad verecundiam §   exposition this argument consists in stating a supposed repugnancy between the proposed measure and the opinions of men by whom the country of those who are discussing the measure was inhabited in former times these opinions being collected either from the express words of some writer living at the period of time in question or from laws or institutions that were then in existence our wise ancestors—the wisdom of our ancestors—the wisdom of ages—venerable antiquity—wisdom of old times— such are the leading terms and phrases of propositions the object of which is to cause the alleged repugnance to be regarded as a sufficient reason for the rejection of the proposed measure §   exposure this fallacy affords one of the most striking of the numerous instances in which under the conciliatory influence of custom—that is of prejudice—opinions the most repugnant to one another are capable of maintaining their ground in the same intellect this fallacy prevalent as it is in matters of law is directly repugnant to a principle or maxim universally admitted in almost every other department of human intelligence and which is the foundation of all useful knowledge and of all rational conduct experience is the mother of wisdom is among the maxims handed down to the present and all future ages by the wisdom such as it has been of past ages no says this fallacy the true mother of wisdom is not experience but inexperience an absurdity so glaring carries in itself its own refutation and all that we can do is to trace the causes which have contributed to give to this fallacy such an ascendency in matters of legislation among the several branches of the fallacies of authority the cause of delusion is more impressive in this than in any other   from inaccuracy of conception arises incorrectness of expression from which expression conception being produced again error from having been a momentary cause comes to be a permanent effect in the very denomination commonly employed to signify the portion of time to which the fallacy refers is virtually involved a false and deceptious proposition which from its being employed by every mouth is at length without examination received as true what in common language is called old time ought with reference to any period at which the fallacy in question is employed to be called young or early time as between individual and individual living at the same time and in the same situation he who is old possesses as such more experience than he who is young—as between generation and generation the reverse of this is true if as in ordinary language a preceding generation be with reference to a succeeding generation called old the old or preceding generation could not have had so much experience as the succeeding with respect to such of the materials or sources of wisdom which have come under the cognizance of their own senses the two are on a par—with respect to such of those materials     and sources of wisdom as are derived from the reports of others the later of the two possesses an indisputable advantage in giving the name of old or elder to the earlier generation of the two the misrepresentation is not less gross nor the folly of it less incontestable than if the name of old man or old woman were given to the infant in its cradle what then is the wisdom of the times called old is it the wisdom of gray hairs no it is the wisdom of the cradle the learned and honourable gentlemen of thibet do homage to superior wisdom—superiority raised to the degree of divinity—in the person of an infant lying and squalling in his cradle the learned and honourable gentlemen of westminster set down as impostors the lamas of thibet and laugh at the folly of the deluded people on whom such imposture passes for sincerity and wisdom but the worship paid at thibet to the infant body of the present day is if not the exact counterpart the type at least of the homage paid at westminster to the infant minds of those who have lived in earlier ages   another cause of delusion which promotes the employment of this fallacy is the reigning prejudice in favour of the dead—a prejudice which in former times contributed more than anything else to the practice of idolatry the dead were speedily elevated to the rank of divinities the superstitious invoked them and ascribed a miraculous efficacy to their relics this prejudice when examined will be seen to be no less indefensible than pernicious—no less pernicious than indefensible by propagating this mischievous notion and acting accordingly the man of selfishness and malice obtains the praise of humanity and social virtue with this jargon in his mouth he is permitted to sacrifice the real interests of the living to the imaginary interests of the dead thus imposture in this shape finds in the folly or improbity of mankind a neverfailing fund of encouragement and reward de mortuis nil nisi bonum—with all its absurdity the adage is but too frequently received as a leading principle of morals of two attacks which is the more barbarous—on a man that does feel it or on a man that does not on the man that does feel it says the principle of utility on the man that does not says the principle of caprice and prejudice—the principle of sentimentalism—the principle in which imagination is the sole mover—the principle in and by which feelings are disregarded as not worth notice the same man who bepraises you when dead would have plagued you without mercy when living thus as between pitt and fox while both were living the friends of each reckoned so many adversaries in the friends of the other on the death of him who died first his adversaries were converted into friends at what price this friendship was paid for by the people is no secret† see the statute book see the debates of the times and see defence of economy against burke and rose‡ the cause of this so extensivelyprevalent and extensivelypernicious propensity lies not very deep a dead man has no rivals—to nobody is he an object of envy in whosesoever way he may have stood when living—when dead he no longer stands in anybodys way if he was a man of genius those who denied him any merit during his life—even his very enemies changing their tone all at once assume an air of justice and kindness which costs them nothing and enables them under pretence of respect for the dead to gratify their malignity towards the living another class of persons habitually exalt the past for the express purpose of depressing and discouraging the present generation it is characteristic of the same sort of persons as well as of the same system of politics to idolize under the name of wisdom of our ancestors the wisdom of untaught inexperienced generations and to undervalue and cover with every expression of contempt that the language of pride can furnish the supposed ignorance and folly of the great body of the people∥ so long as they keep to vague generalities—so long as the two objects of comparison are each of them taken in the lump—wise ancestors in one lump ignorant and foolish mob of modern times in the other—the weakness of the fallacy may escape detection let them but assign for the period of superior wisdom any determinate period whatsoever not only will the groundlessness of the notion be apparent class being compared with class in that period and the present one but unless the antecedent period be comparatively speaking a very modern one so wide will be the disparity and to such an amount in favour of modern times that in comparison of the lowest class of the people in modern times  00 always supposing them proficients in the art of reading and their proficiency employed in the reading of newspapers the very highest and best informed class of these wise ancestors will turn out to be grossly ignorant take for example any year in the reign of henry the eighth from   0  to      at that time the house of lords would probably have been in possession of by far the larger proportion of what little instruction the age afforded in the house of lords among the laity it might even then be a question whether without exception their lordships were all of them able so much as to read but even supposing them all in the fullest possession of that useful art political science being the science in question what instruction on the subject could they meet with at that time of day on no one branch of legislation was any book extant from which with regard to the circumstances of the then present times any useful instruction could be derived distributive law penal law international law political economy so far from existing as sciences had scarcely obtained a name in all those departments under the head of quid faciendum a mere blank the whole literature of the age consisted of a meagre chronicle or two containing short memorandums of the usual occurrences of war and peace battles sieges executions revels deaths births processions ceremonies and other external events but with scarce a speech or an incident that could enter into the composition of any such work as a history of the human mind—with scarce an attempt at investigation into causes characters or the state of the people at large even when at last little by little a scrap or two of political instruction came to be obtainable the proportion of error and mischievous doctrine mixed up with it was so great that whether a blank unfilled might not have been less prejudicial than a blank thus filled may reasonably be matter of doubt it we come down to the reign of james the first we shall find that solomon of his time eminently eloquent as well as learned not only among the crowned but among uncrowned heads marking out for prohibition and punishment the practices of devils and witches and without any the slightest objection on the part of the great characters of that day in their high situations consigning men to death and torment for the misfortune of not being so well acquainted as he was with the composition of the godhead passing on to the days of charles the second even after bacon had laid the foundations of a sound philosophy we shall find lord chiefjustice hale to the present hour chief god of the man of laws idolatry unable to tell so he says himself what theft was but knowing at the same time too well what witchcraft was hanging men with the most perfect complacency for both crimes amidst the applauses of all who were wise and learned in that blessed age under the name of exorcism the catholic liturgy contains a form of procedure for driving out devils—even with the help of this instrument the operation cannot be performed with the desired success but by an operator qualified by holy orders for the working of this as so many other wonders in our days and in our country the same object is attained and beyond comparison more effectually by so cheap an instrument as a common newspaper before this talisman not only devils but ghosts vampires witches and all their kindred tribes are driven out of the land never to return again the touch of holy water is not so intolerable to them as the bare smell of printers ink if it is absurd to rely on the wisdom of our ancestors it is not less so to vaunt their probity they were as much inferior to us in that point as in all others and the further we look back the more abuses we shall discover in every department of government nothing but the enormity of those abuses has produced that degree of comparative amendment on which at present we value ourselves so highly till the human race was rescued from that absolute slavery under which ninetenths of every nation groaned not a single step could be made in the career of improvement and take what period we will in the lapse of preceding ages there is not one which presents such a state of things as any rational man would wish to see entirely reestablished undoubtedly the history of past ages is not wanting in some splendid instances of probity and selfdevotion but in the admiration which these excite we commonly overrate their amount and become the dupes of an illusion occasioned by the very nature of an extensive retrospect such a retrospect is often made by a single glance of the mind in this glance the splendid actions of several ages as if for the very purpose of conveying a false estimate of their number and contiguity present themselves as it were in a a lump leaving the intervals between them altogether unnoticed thus groves of trees which at a distance present the appearance of thick and impenetrable masses turn out on nearer approach to consist of trunks widely separated from each other would you then have us speak and act as if we had never had any ancestors would you because recorded experience and along with it wisdom increases from year to year annually change the whole body of our laws by no means such a mode of reasoning and acting would be more absurd even than that which has just been exposed and provisional adherence to existing establishments is grounded on considerations much more rational  0  than a reliance on the wisdom of our ancestors though the opinions of our ancestors are as such of little value their practice is not the less worth attending to that is in so far as their practice forms part of our own experience however it is not so much from what they did as from what they underwent good included as well as evil that our instruction comes independently of consequences what they did is no more than evidence of what they thought nor yet in legislation is it evidence of what they thought best for the whole community but only of what the rulers thought would be best for themselves in periods when every species of abuse prevailed unmitigated by the existence of either public press or public opinion from the facts of their times much information may be derived—from the opinions little or none as to opinions it is rather from those which were foolish than from those which were well grounded that any instruction can be derived from foolish opinions comes foolish conduct from the most foolish conduct the severest disaster and from the severest disaster the most useful warning it is from the folly not from the wisdom of our ancestors that we have so much to learn and yet it is to their wisdom and not to their folly that the fallacy under consideration sends us for instruction it seems then that our ancestors considering the disadvantages under which they laboured could not have been capable of exercising so sound a judgment on their interests as we on ours but as a knowledge of the facts on which a judgment is to be pronounced is an indispensable preliminary to the arriving at just conclusions and as the relevant facts of the later period must all of them individually and most of them specifically have been unknown to the man of the earlier period it is clear that any judgment derived from the authority of our ancestors and applied to existing affairs must be a judgment pronounced without evidence and this is the judgment which the fallacy in question calls on us to abide by to the exclusion of a judgment formed on the completest evidence that the nature of each case may admit causes of the propensity to be influenced by this fallacy wisdom of ancestors being the most impressive of all arguments that can be employed in defence of established abuses and imperfections persons interested in this or that particular abuse are most forward to employ it but their exertions would be of little avail were it not for the propensity which they find on the part of their antagonists to attribute to this argument nearly the same weight as those by whom it is relied on this propensity may be traced to two intimatelyconnected causes—  both parties having been trained up alike in the school of the english lawyers headed by blackstone and   their consequent inability for want of practice to draw from the principle of general utility the justificative reason of everything that is susceptible of justification in the hands of a defender of abuse authority answers a double purpose by affording an argument in favour of any particular abuse which may happen to call for protection and by causing men to regard with a mingled emotion of hatred and terror the principle of general utility in which alone the true standard and measure of right and wrong is to be found in no other department of the field of knowledge and wisdom unless that which regards religion be an exception do leading men of the present times recommend to us this receipt for thinking and acting wisely by no gentleman honourable or right honourable are we sent at this time of day to the wisdom of our ancestors for the best mode of marshalling armies navigating ships attacking or defending towns for the best modes of cultivating and improving land and preparing and preserving its products for the purposes of food clothing artificial light and heat for the promptest and most commodious means of conveyance of ourselves and goods from one portion of the earths surface to another for the best modes of curing alleviating or preventing disorders in our own bodies and those of the animals which we contrive to apply to our use why this difference only because in any other part of the field of knowledge legislation excepted and religion in so far as it has been taken for the subject of legislation leading men are not affected with that sinister interest which is so unhappily combined with power in the persons of those leading men who conduct governments as they are generally at present established sir h davy has never had anything to gain either from the unnecessary length the miscarriage or the unnecessary part of the expenses attendant on chemical experiments he therefore sends us either to his own experiments or to those of the most enlightened and fortunate of his contemporaries and not to the notions of stahl van helmont or paracelsus chapter iii   fallacy of irrevocable laws   fallacy of vows—ad superstitionem the two fallacies brought to view in this chapter are intimately connected and require to be considered together the object in view  0  is the same in both—the difference lies only in the instrument employed and both of them are in effect the fallacy of the wisdom of our ancestors pushed to the highest degree of extravagance and absurdity the object is to tie up the hands of future legislators by obligations supposed to be indissoluble in the case of the fallacy derived from the alleged irrevocable nature of certain laws or to speak briefly the fallacy of irrevocable laws the instrument employed is a contract—a contract entered into by the ruling powers of the state in question with the ruling powers of some other party this other party may be either the sovereign of some other state or the whole or some part of the people of the state in question in the case of the fallacy derived from vows a supernatural power is called in and employed in the character of guarantee fallacy of irrevocable laws exposition—a law no matter to what effect is proposed to a legislative assembly and no matter in what way it is by the whole or a majority of the assembly regarded as being of a beneficial tendency the fallacy in question consists in calling upon the assembly to reject it notwithstanding upon the single ground that by those who in some former period exercised the power which the present assembly is thus called on to exercise a regulation was made having for its object the precluding for ever or to the end of a period not yet expired all succeeding legislators from enacting a law to any such effect as that now proposed what will be tolerably clear to every man who will allow himself to think it so is—that notwithstanding the profound respect we are most of us so ready to testify towards our fellowcreatures as soon as the moment has arrived after which it can be of no use to them the comforts of those who are out of the way of all the comforts we can bestow as well as of all the sufferings we can inflict are not the real objects to which there has been this readiness to sacrifice the comforts of present and future generations and that therefore there must be some other interest at the bottom exposure—  to consider the matter in the first place on the ground of general utility at each point of time the sovereign for the time possesses such means as the nature of the case affords for making himself acquainted with the exigencies of his own time with relation to the future the sovereign has no such means of information it is only by a sort of vague anticipation—a sort of rough and almost random guess drawn by analogy that the sovereign of this year can pretend to say what will be the exigencies of the country this time ten years here then to the extent of the pretended immutable law is the government transferred from those who possess the best possible means of information to those who by their very position are necessarily incapacitated from knowing anything at all about the matter instead of being guided by their own judgment the men of the nineteenth century shut their own eyes and give themselves up to be led blindfold by the men of the eighteenth century the men who have the means of knowing the whole body of the facts on which the correctness and expediency of the judgment to be formed must turn give up their own judgment to that of a set of men entirely destitute of any of the requisite knowledge of such facts men who have a century more of experience to ground their judgments on surrender their intellect to men who had a century less experience and who unless that deficiency constitutes a claim have no claim to preference if the prior generation were in respect of intellectual qualification ever so much superior to the subsequent generation—if it understood so much better than the subsequent generation itself the interest of that subsequent generation—could it have been in an equal degree anxious to promote that interest and consequently equally attentive to those facts with which though in order to form a judgment it ought to have been it is impossible that it should have been acquainted in a word will its love for that subsequent generation be quite so great as that same generations love for itself not even here after a moments deliberate reflection will the assertion be in the affirmative and yet it is their prodigious anxiety for the welfare of their posterity that produces the propensity of these sages to tie up the hands of this same posterity for evermore to act as guardians to its perpetual and incurable weakness and take its conduct for ever out of its own hands if it be right that the conduct of the   th century should be determined not by its own judgment but by that of the   th it will be equally right that the conduct of the  0th century should be determined not by its own judgment but by that of the   th the same principle still pursued what at length would be the consequence that in process of time the practice of legislation would be at an end the conduct and fate of all men would be determined by those who neither knew nor cared anything about the matter and the aggregate body of the living  0  would remain for ever in subjection to an inexorable tyranny exercised as it were by the aggregate body of the dead this irrevocable law whether good or bad at the moment of its enactment is found at some succeeding period to be productive of mischief—uncompensated mischief—to any amount now of this mischief what possibility has the country of being rid a despotism though it were that of a caligula or a nero might be to any degree less mischievous less intolerable than any such immutable law by benevolence for even a tyrant may have his moments of benevolence by benevolence by prudence—in a word by caprice—the living tyrant might be induced to revoke his law and release the country from its consequences but the dead tyrant who shall make him feel who shall make him hear let it not be forgotten that it is only to a bad purpose that this and every other instrument of deception will in general be employed it is only when the law in question is mischievous and generally felt and understood to be such that an argument of this stamp will be employed in the support of it suppose the law a good one it will be supported not by absurdity and deception but by reasons drawn from its own excellence but is it possible that the restraint of an irrevocable law should be imposed on so many millions of living beings by a few scores or a few hundreds whose existence has ceased—can a system of tyranny be established under which the living are all slaves and a few among the dead their tyrants the production of any such effect in the way of constraint being physically impossible—if produced in any degree it must be by force of argument—by the force of fallacy and not by that of legislative power the means employed to give effect to this device may be comprised under two heads the first of them exhibiting a contrivance not less flagitious than the position itself is absurd   in speaking of a law which is considered as repugnant to any law of the pretended immutable class the way has been to call it void but to what purpose call it void only to excite the people to rebellion in the event of the legislators passing any such void law in speaking of a law as void either this is meant or nothing it is a sophism of the same cast as that expressed by the words rights of man though played off in another shape by a different set of hands and for the benefit of a different class are the people to consider the law void they are then to consider it as an act of injustice and tyranny under the name of law—as an act of power exercised by men who have no right to exercise it they are to deal by it as they would by the command of a robber they are to deal by those who having passed it take upon them to enforce the execution of it as they would deal whenever they found themselves strong enough by the robber himself   the other contrivance for maintaining the immutability of a given law is derived from the notion of a contract or engagement the faithful observance of contracts being one of the most important of the ties that bind society together an argument drawn from this source cannot fail to have the appearance of plausibility but be the parties interested who they may a contract is not itself an end—it is but a means toward some end and in cases where the public is one of the parties concerned it is only in so far as that end consists of the happiness of the whole community taken in the aggregate that such contract is worthy to be observed let us examine the various kinds of contract to which statesmen have endeavoured to impart this character of perpetuity—  treaties between state and foreign state by which each respectively engages its government and people   grant of privileges from the sovereign to the whole community in the character of subjects   grant of privileges from the sovereign to a particular class of subjects   new arrangement of power between different portions or branches of the sovereignty or new declaration of the rights of the community   incorporative union between two sovereignties having or not having a common head take then for the subject and substance of the contract any one of these arrangements so long as the happiness of the whole community taken in the aggregate is in a greater degree promoted by the exact observance of the contract than it would be by any alteration exact ought to be the observance—on the contrary if by any given change the aggregate of happiness would be in a greater degree promoted than by the exact observance such change ought to be made true it is that considering the alarm and danger which is the natural result of every breach of a contract to which the sovereignty is party in case of any change with respect to such contract the aggregate of public happiness will be in general rather diminished than promoted unless in case of disadvantage produced to any party by the change such disadvantage be made up by adequate compensation  0  let it not be said that this doctrine is a dangerous doctrine because the compensation supposed to be stipulated for as adequate may prove but a nominal or at best but an inadequate compensation reality and not pretence probity not improbity veracity not mendacity are supposed alike on all sides—the contract a real contract the change a real change the compensation an adequate as well as real compensation instead of probity suppose improbity in the sovereignty it will be as easy to deny the existence or explain away the meaning of the contract or to deny or explain away the change as instead of a real to give a nominal instead of an adequate to give an inadequate compensation to apply the foregoing principles to the cases above enumerated one by one—   in the case of the contract or treaty between state and foreign state the dogma of immutability has seldom been productive of any considerable practical inconvenience the ground of complaint has arisen rather from a tendency to change than a too rigid adherence to the treaty however some commercial treaties between state and state entered into in times of political ignorance or error and pernicious to the general interests of commerce are frequently upheld under a pretence of regard for the supposed inviolability of such contracts but in reality from a continuance of the same ignorance error antipathy or sinister interest which first occasioned their existence it can seldom or never happen that a forced direction thus given to the employment of capital can ultimately prove advantageous to either of the contracting parties and when the pernicious operation of such a treaty on the interests of both parties has been clearly pointed out there can be no longer any pretence for continuing its existence notice however of any proposed departure from the treaty ought to be given to all the parties concerned sufficient time should be afforded to individuals engaged in traffic under the faith of the treaty to withdraw if they please their capitals from such traffic and in case of loss compensation as far as possible ought to be afforded   grant of privilege from the sovereign to the whole community in the character of subjects—if by the supposed change privileges to equal value be given in the room of such as are abrogated adequate compensation is made if greater privileges are substituted there is the greater reason for supporting the measure   grant of privileges from the sovereign to a particular class of subjects no such particular privilege ought to have been granted if the aggregate happiness of the community was likely to be thereby diminished but unless in case of a revocation adequate compensation be here also made the aggregate happiness of the community will not be increased by the change the happiness of the portion of the community to be affected by the change being as great a part of the aggregate happiness as that of any other portion of equal extent under this head are included all those more particular cases in which the sovereign contracts with this or that individual or assemblage of individuals for money or moneys worth to be supplied or service otherwise to be rendered   new arrangement or distribution of powers as between different portions or branches of the sovereignty or new declaration of the rights of the community let the supposition be that the result will not be productive of a real addition to the aggregate stock of happiness on the part of the whole community—it ought not to be made let the supposition be the reverse—then notwithstanding the existence of the contract the change is such as it is right and fitting should be made the first of these can never furnish a case for compensation unless in so far as without charge or disadvantage to the people the members of the sovereignty can contrive to satisfy one another such members of the sovereignty being as to the rest of the community not proprietors but trustees the frame or constitution of the several american united states so far from being declared immutable or imprescriptible contains an express provision that a convention shall be holden at intervals for the avowed object of revising and improving the constitution as the exigencies of succeeding times may require in europe the effect of declaring this or that article in a new distribution of powers or in the original frame of a constitution immutable has been to weaken the sanction of all laws the article in question turns out to be mischievous or impracticable instead of being repealed it is openly or covertly violated and this violation affords a precedent or pretext for the nonobservance of arrangements clearly calculated to promote the aggregate happiness of the community   case of an incorporative union between two sovereignties having or not having a common head of all the cases upon the list this is the only one which is attended with difficulty this is the case in which at the same time that a contract with detailed clauses is at once likely and fit to be insisted on compensation that compensation without which any change would not be consistent with general utility in the shape of justice or in any other shape is an operation attended with more difficulty than in any other of these cases distressing indeed would be the difficulty  0  were it not for one circumstance which happily is interwoven in the very nature of the case at the time of the intended union the two states not to embarrass the case by taking more than two at a time are with relation each to the other in a greater or less degree foreign and independent states of the two uniting states one will generally be more the other less powerful if the inequality be considerable the more powerful state naturally speaking will not consent to the union unless after the union the share it possesses in the government of the newframed compound state be greater by a difference bearing some proportion to the difference in prosperity between the two states on the part of the less powerful state precautions against oppression come of course wherever a multitude of human beings are brought together there is but too much room for jealousy suspicion and mutual illwill in the apprehension of each the others if they obtain possession of the powers exercised by the common government will be supposed to apply them unjustly in men or in money in labour or in goods in a direct way or in some indirect one it may be the study of the new compound government under the influence of that part of the quondam government which is predominant in it to render the pressure of the contributions proportionably more severe upon the one portion of the new compounded state than upon the other or to force upon it new customs new religious ceremonies new laws let the hands of the new government remain altogether loose one of the two compound nations may be injured and oppressed by the other tie up the hands of the government in such degree as is requisite to give to each nation a security against injustice at the hands of the other sooner or later comes the time in which the inconveniences resulting from the restriction will become intolerable to one or other or to both but sooner or later the very duration of the union produces the natural remedy sooner or later having for such or such a length of time been in the habit of acting in subjection to one government the two nations will have become melted into one and mutual apprehensions will have been dissipated by conjunct experience all this while in one or both of the united states the individuals will be but too numerous and too powerful who by sinister interest and interestbegotten prejudice will stand engaged to give every possible countenance and intensity to those fears and jealousies—to oppose to the entire composure of them every degree of retardation if in either of the united communities at the time of the union there existed a set of men more or less numerous and powerful to whom abuse or imperfection in any shape was a source of profit whatsoever restrictions may have been expressed in the contract these restrictions will of course be laid hold of by the men thus circumstanced and applied as far as possible to the giving protection and continuance to a state of things agreeable or beneficial to themselves at the time of the union between england and scotland the tory party of whom a large proportion were jacobites and all or most of them highchurchmen had acquired an ascendant in the house of commons here then a favourable occasion presented itself to these partisans of episcopacy for giving perpetuity to the triumph they had obtained over the english presbyterians by the act of uniformity proclaimed in the time of charles the second in treaties between unconnected nations where an advantage in substance is given to one for the purpose of saving the honour of the other it has been the custom to make the articles bear the appearance of reciprocity upon the face of them as if the facilitating the vent of french wines in england being the object of a treaty provision were made in it that wine of the growth of either country might be imported into the other duty free by the combined astutia of priestcraft and lawyercraft advantage was taken of this custom to rivet for ever those chains of ecclesiastical tyranny which in the precipitation that attended the restoration had been fastened upon the people of england for securing the    scotch members from being outnumbered by the     english ones provision had been made in favour of the church of scotland therefore on the principle of reciprocity for securing the     english members from being outnumbered by the    scotch ones like provision was made in favour of the church of england blackstone avails himself of this transaction for giving perpetuity to whatever imperfections may be founded in the ecclesiastical branch of the law and the official establishment of england on a general account which he has been giving† of the articles and act of union he grounds three observations—   that the two kingdoms are now so inseparably united that nothing can ever disunite them again except the mutual consent of both or the successful resistance of either upon apprehending an infringement of those points which when they were separate and independent nations it was mutually stipulated should be fundamental and essential conditions of the union  0    that whatever else may be deemed fundamental and essential conditions the preservation of the two churches of england and scotland in the same state that they were in at the time of the union and the maintenance of the acts of uniformity which establish our common prayer are expressly declared so to be   that therefore any alteration in the constitution of either of those churches or in the liturgy of the church of england unless with the consent of the respective churches collectively or representatively given would be an infringement of these fundamental and essential conditions and greatly endanger the union on the original device an improvement has we see been made by the ingenuity of the orthodox and learned commentator if—as for example by the alteration of any of the    articles—if by the abolition of any of the english ecclesiastical sinecures or by any efficient measure for ensuring the performance of duty in return for salary the ecclesiastical branch of the english official establishment were brought so much the nearer to what it is in scotland the scotch fired by the injury done to them would cry out a breach of faith and call for a dissolution of the union to obviate this danger—a great one he denominates it—his ingenuity in concert with his piety has however furnished us with an expedient—the consent of the church collectively or representatively given is to be taken by which is meant if anything that by the revival of the convocation or some other means the clergy of england are to be erected into a fourth estate what is evident is that unless the sinister influence of the crown could be supposed to become felo de se and employ itself in destroying a large portion of itself nothing but a sincere persuasion of the utility of a change in relation to any of the points in question and that entertained by a large proportion of the english members in each house could ever be productive of any such change—that in any attempt to force the discipline of the church of scotland upon the church of england the    scotch members in the house of commons supposing them all unanimous would have to outnumber or somehow or other to subdue the     english ones—that in the house of lords the    scotch members supposing all the lay lords indifferent to the fate of the church of england would in like manner have to outnumber the    bishops and archbishops but the tories who were then in vigour feared that they might not always be so and seized that opportunity to fetter posterity by an act which should be deemed irrevocable the administration of justice in scotland this forms the subject of the   th article which has for its avowed object the securing the people of scotland against any such encroachments as might otherwise be made by the lawyers of england by the use of those fictions and other frauds in the use of which they had been found so expert but throughout the whole course of this long article the most rational and uniform care is taken to avoid all such danger as that of depriving the people of scotland of such benefit as from time to time they might stand a chance of receiving at the hands of the united parliament by improvements in the mode of administering justice subject to such regulations as shall be made by the parliament of great britain is a clause over and over again repeated it would have been better for scotland if on the subject of the next article viz heritable offices including heritable jurisdictions the like wisdom had presided by that short article those public trusts together with others therein mentioned are on the footing of rights of property reserved to the owners yet still without any expression of that fanatic spirit which on the field of religion had in the same statute occupied itself in the endeavour to invest the conceits of mortal man with the attribute of immortality nineandthirty years after came the act† for abolishing these same heritable jurisdictions here was an act made in the very teeth of the act of union mark now the sort of discernment or of sincerity that is to be learnt from blackstone in a pointblank violation of the articles of union in the abolition of those heritable jurisdictions which it was the declared object of one of its articles  0 to preserve he saw nothing to endanger the union but suppose any such opinion to prevail as that it is not exactly true that by the mere act of being born every human being merits damnation‡ if by damnation be meant everlasting torment or punishment in any other shape and a corresponding alteration were made in the set of propositions called the thirtynine articles the union would be greatly endangered between twenty and thirty years afterwards at the suggestion of an honest member of the court of session came upon the carpet for the first time the idea of applying remedies to some of the most flagrant imperfections in the administration of scottish justice and thereupon came out a pamphlet from james  0  boswell declaiming in the style of schoolboy declamation on the injury that would be done to the people of scotland by rendering justice or what goes by that name a little less inaccessible to them and the breach that would be made in the faith plighted by that treaty which to judge from what he says of it he had never looked at again in   0  when another demonstration was made of applying a remedy to the abuses and imperfections of the system of judicature in scotland everything that could be done in that way was immediately reprobated by the scotch lawyers as an infringement of that most sacred of all sacred bonds—the union nor for the support of the brotherhood on the other side of the tweed was a second sight of the matter in the same point of view wanting in england as to any such design as that of oppressing their fellowsubjects in scotland nothing could be further from the thoughts of the english members neither for good nor for evil uses was any expense of thought bestowed upon the matter the ultimate object as it soon became manifest was the adding an item or two to the list of places upon the whole the following is the conclusion that seems to be dictated by the foregoing considerations every arrangement by which the hands of the sovereignty for the time being are attempted to be tied up and precluded from giving existence to a fresh arrangement is absurd and mischievous and on the supposition that the utility of such fresh arrangement is sufficiently established the existence of a prohibitive clause to the effect in question ought not to be considered as opposing any bar to the establishment of it true it is that all laws all political institutions are essentially dispositions for the future and the professed object of them is to afford a steady and permanent security to the interests of mankind in this sense all of them may be said to be framed with a view to perpetuity but perpetual is not synonymous with irrevocable and the principle on which all laws ought to be and the greater part of them have been established is that of defeasible perpetuity a perpetuity defeasible only by an alteration of the circumstances and reasons on which the law is founded to comprise all in one word—reason and that alone is the proper anchor for a law for everything that goes by the name of law at the time of passing his law let the legislator deliver in the character of reasons the considerations by which he was led to the passing of it this done so long as in the eyes of the succeeding legislators the state of facts on which the reasons are grounded appears to continue without material change and the reasons to appear satisfactory so long the law continues but no sooner do the reasons cease to appear satisfactory or the state of the facts to have undergone any such change as to call for an alteration in the law than an alteration in it or the abrogation of it takes place accordingly a declaration or assertion that this or that law is immutable so far from being a proper instrument to insure its permanency is rather a presumption that such law has some mischievous tendency the better the law the less is any such extraneous argument likely to be recurred to for the support of it the worse the law and thence the more completely destitute of all intrinsic support the more likely is it that support should be sought for it from this extraneous source but though it is the characteristic tendency of this instrument to apply itself to bad laws in preference to good ones there is another the tendency of which is to apply itself to good ones in preference to bad this is what may be termed justification the practice of annexing to each law the considerations by which in the character of reasons the legislator was induced to adopt it† a a practice which if rigidly pursued must at no distant interval put an exclusion on all bad laws to the framing of laws so constituted that being good in themselves an accompaniment of good and sufficient reasons should also be given for them there would be requisite in the legislator a probity not to be diverted by the action of sinister interest and intelligence adequate to an enlarged comprehension and close application of the principle of general utility in other words the principle of the greatest happiness of the greatest number but to draw up laws without reasons and laws for which good reasons are not in the nature of the case to be found requires no more than the union of will and power the man who should produce a body of good laws with an accompaniment of good reasons would feel an honest pride at the prospect of holding thus in bondage a succession of willing generations his triumph would be to leave them the power but to deprive them of will to escape but to the champions of abuse by whom amongst other devices the conceit of immutable laws is played off against reform in whatever shape it presents itself every use of reason is as  0  odious as the light of the sun to moles and burglars   vows or promissory oaths the object in this fallacy is the same as in the preceding but to the absurdity involved in the notion of tying up the hands of generations yet to come is added in this case that which consists in the use sought to be made of supernatural power the arm pressed into the service is that of the invisible and supreme ruler of the universe the oath taken the formularies involved in it being pronounced—is or is not the almighty bound to do what is expected of him of the two contradictory propositions which is it that you believe if he is not bound then the security the sanction the obligation amounts to nothing if he is bound then observe the consequence—the almighty is bound and by whom bound of all the worms that crawl about the earth in the shape of men there is not one who may not thus impose conditions on the supreme ruler of the universe and to what is he bound to any number of contradictory and incompatible observances which legislators tyrants or madmen may in the shape of an oath be pleased to assign eventual it must be acknowledged and no more is the power thus exercised over the task thus imposed upon the almighty so long as the vow is kept there is nothing for him to do true but no sooner is the vow broken than his task commences—a task which consists in the inflicting on him by whom the vow is broken a punishment which when it is inflicted is of no use in the way of example since nobody ever sees it the punishment it may be said when inflicted will be such exactly as in the judgment of the almighty and infallible judge will be best adapted to the nature of the offence yes but what offence not the act which the oath was intended to prevent for that act may be indifferent or even meritorious and if criminal ought to be punished independently of the oath the only offence peculiar to this case is the profanation of a ceremony and the profanation is the same whether the act by which the profanation arises be pernicious or beneficial it is in vain to urge in this or that particular instance in proof of the reasonableness of the oath the reasonableness of the prohibition or command which it is thus employed to perpetuate the objection is to the principle itself to any idea of employing an instrument so unfit to be employed no sort of security is given or can be given for the applying it to the most beneficial purpose rather than to the most pernicious on the contrary it is more likely to be applied to a pernicious than to a beneficial purpose because the more manifestly and undeniably beneficial the observance of the prohibition in question would be in the eyes of future generations the more likely is the prohibition to be observed independently of the oath as on the other hand the more likely the prohibition is not to be observed otherwise the greater is the demand for a security of this extraordinary complexion to enforce the observance we come now to the instance in which by the operation of the fallacy here in question the ceremony of an oath has been endeavoured to be applied to the perpetuation of misrule among the statutes passed in the first parliament of william and mary is one entitled an act for establishing the coronation oath the form in which the ceremony is performed is as follows—by the archbishop or bishop certain questions are put to the monarch and it is of the answers given to these questions that the oath is composed of these questions the third is as follows—will you to the utmost of your power maintain the laws of god the true profession of the gospel and the protestant reformed religion established by law and will you preserve unto the bishops and clergy of this realm and to the churches committed to their charge all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain unto them or any of them answer all this i promise to do after this anno   0  comes the act of union in the concluding article of which it is said that after the demise of her majesty     the sovereign next succeeding to her majesty in the royal government of the kingdom of great britain and so for ever hereafter every king or queen succeeding and coming to the royal government of the kingdom of great britain at his or her coronation shall in the presence c take and subscribe an oath to maintain and preserve inviolably the said settlement of the church and the doctrine worship discipline and government thereof as by law established within the kingdoms of england and ireland the dominion of wales and town of berwickupontweed and the territories thereunto belonging† a notion was once started and upon occasion may but too probably be broached again that by the above clause in the coronation oath the king stands precluded from joining in the putting the majority of the irish upon  0  an equal footing with the minority as well as from affording to both together relief against the abuses of the ecclesiastical establishment of that country in relation to this notion the following propositions have already it is hoped been put sufficiently out of doubt—   that it ought not to be in the power of the sovereignty to tie up its own hands or the hands of its successors   that on the part of the sovereignty no such power can have existence either here or anywhere else   that therefore all attempts to exercise any such power are in their own nature to use the technical language of lawyers null and void   another which will it is supposed appear scarcely less clear is that no such anarchical wish or expectation was entertained by the framers of the oath the proposition maintained is that to any bills to the effect in question the monarch is by this third and last clause in the oath precluded from giving his assent if so he is equally precluded from giving his assent to any bills to any proposed laws whatever it is plainly in what is called his executive and not in his legislative capacity that the obligation in question was meant to attach upon the monarch so loose are the words of the act that if they were deemed to apply to the monarch in his legislative capacity he might find in them a pretence for refusing assent to almost anything he did not like if by this third clause he stands precluded from consenting to any bill the effect of which would be to abolish or vary any of the rights or privileges appertaining to the bishops or clergy or any of them then by the first clause he stands equally precluded from giving his concurrence to any law the effect of which would be to abolish or change any other rights for by this first clause he is made solemnly to promise and swear to govern the people     according to the statutes in parliament agreed on and the laws and customs of the same after this governing according to any new law he could not govern according to the old law abrogated by it if by any such ceremony misrule in this shape could be converted into a duty or a right so might it in any other if henry viii at his coronation had sworn to maintain that catholic religion which for so many centuries was established by law and by fire and sword to keep out the protestant religion and had been considered bound by such oath he could never have taken one step towards the reformation and the religion of the state must have been still catholic but would you put a force upon the conscience of your sovereign by any construction which in your judgment may be the proper one would you preclude him from the free exercise of his most assuredly not—even were it as completely within as it is out of my power all i plead for is that on so easy a condition as that of pronouncing the word conscience it may not be in his power either to make himself absolute or in any shape to give continuance to misrule let him but resign his power conscience can never reproach him with any misuse of it it seems difficult to say what can be a misuse of it if it be not a determinate and persevering habit of using it in such a manner as in the judgment of the two houses is not conducive but repugnant to the utility of the subjects with reference to whom and whose utility alone either laws or kings can be of any use according to the form in which it is conceived any such engagement is in effect either a check or a licence—a licence under the appearance of a check and for that very reason but the more efficiently operative chains to the man in power yes but such as he figures with on the stage—to the spectators as imposing to himself as light as possible modelled by the wearer to suit his own purposes they serve to rattle but not to restrain suppose a king of great britain and ireland to have expressed his fixed determination in the event of any proposed law being tendered to him for his assent to refuse such assent and this not on the persuasion that the law would not be for the utility of the subjects but that by his coronation oath he stands precluded from so doing—the course proper to be taken by parliament the course pointed out by principle and precedent would be a vote of abdication—a vote declaring the king to have abdicated his royal authority and that as in case of death or incurable mental derangement now is the time for the person next in succession to take his place in the celebrated case in which a vote to this effect was actually passed the declaration of abdication was in lawyers language a fiction—in plain truth a falsehood—and that falsehood a mockery not a particle of his power was it the wish of james to abdicate to part with but to increase it to a maximum was the manifest object of all his efforts but in the case here supposed with respect to a part and that a principal part of the royal authority the will and purpose to abdicate is actually declared and this being such a part without which the remainder cannot to the utility of the subjects be   0 exercised the remainder must of necessity be on their part and for their sake added chapter iv noprecedent argument—ad verecundiam exposition—the proposition is of a novel and unprecedented complexion the present is surely the first time that any such thing was ever heard of in this house whatsoever may happen to be the subject introduced above is a specimen of the infinite variety of forms in which the opposing predicate may be clothed to such an observation there could be no objection if the object with which it were made was only to fix attention to a new or difficult subject deliberate well before you act as you have no precedent to direct your course exposure—but in the character of an argument as a ground for the rejection of the proposed measure it is obviously a fallacy whether or no the alleged novelty actually exists is an inquiry which it can never be worth while to make that it is impossible that it should in any case afford the smallest ground for the rejection of the measure—that the observation is completely irrelevant in relation to the question whether or no it is expedient that such a measure should be adopted—is a proposition to which it seems difficult to conceive how an immediate assent can be refused if no specific good is indicated as likely to be produced by the proposed measure this deficiency is itself sufficient to warrant the rejection of it if any such specific good is indicated it must be minute indeed if an observation of this nature can afford a sufficient ground for the rejection of the measure if the observation presents a conclusive objection against the particular measure proposed so it would against any other that ever was proposed including every measure that ever was adopted and therein every institution that exists at present if it proves that this ought not to be done it proves that nothing else ought ever to have been done it may be urged that if the measure had been a fit one it would have been brought upon the carpet before but there are several obstacles besides the inexpediency of a measure which for any length of time may prevent its being brought forward—   if though beyond dispute promotive of the interest of the many there be anything in it that is adverse to the interests the prejudices or the humours of the ruling few the wonder is not that it should not have been brought forward before but that it should be brought forward even now   if in the complexion of it there be anything which it required a particular degree of ingenuity to contrive and adapt to the purpose this would of itself be sufficient to account for the tardiness of its appearance in legislation the birth of ingenuity is obstructed and retarded by difficulties beyond any which exist in other matters besides the more general sinister interest of the powerful few in whose hands the functions of government are lodged the more particular sinister interest affecting the body of lawyers is one to which any given measure in proportion to the ingenuity displayed in it is likely to be adverse measures which come under the head of     indirect legislation and in particular those which have the quality of executing themselves are the measures which as they possess most efficiency when established so they require greater ingenuity in the contrivance now in proportion as laws execute themselves—in other words are attended with voluntary obedience—in that proportion are they efficient but it is only in proportion as they fail of being efficient that to the man of law they are beneficial and productive because it is only in proportion as they stand in need of enforcement that business makes its way into the hands of the man of law chapter v   selfassumed authority—ad ignorantiam ad verecundiam   the selftrumpeters fallacy this fallacy presents itself in two shapes—  an avowal made with a sort of mock modesty and caution by a person in exalted station that he is incapable of forming a judgment on the question in debate such incapacity being sometimes real sometimes pretended   open assertion by a person so situated of the purity of his motives and integrity of his life and the entire reliance which may consequently be reposed on all he says or does i the first is commonly played off as follows—an evil or defect in our institutions is pointed out clearly and a remedy proposed to which no objection can be made up starts a man high in office and instead of stating any specific objection says i am not prepared to do so and so i am not prepared to say c the meaning evidently intended to be conveyed is if i who am so dignified and supposed to be so capable of forming a judgment avow myself incompetent to do so what presumption what folly must there be in the conclusion formed by any one else in truth this is nothing else but an indirect way of browbeating—arrogance under a thin veil of modesty if you are not prepared to pass a judgment you are not prepared to condemn and ought not therefore to oppose the utmost you are warranted in doing if sincere is to ask for a little time for consideration supposing the unpreparedness real the reasonable and practical inference is—say nothing take no part in the business a proposition for the reforming of this or that abuse in the administration of justice is the common occasion for the employment of this fallacy in virtue of his office every judge every lawofficer is supposed and pronounced to be profoundly versed in the science of the law yes of the science of the law as it is probably as much as any other man but law as it ought to be is a very different thing and the proposal in question has for its avowed and commonly for its real object the bringing law as it is somewhat nearer to law as it ought to be but this is one of those things for which the great dignitary is sure to be at all times unprepared—unprepared to join in any such design everything of this sort having been at all times contrary to his interest—unprepared so much as to form any judgment concerning the conduciveness of the proposed measure to such its declared object in any such point of view it has never been his interest to consider it a mind that from its first entrance upon this subject has been applying its whole force to the inquiry as to what are the most effectual means of making its profit of the imperfections of the system—a mind to which of consequence the profit from these sources of affliction has been all along an object of complacency and the affliction itself at best but an object of indifference—a mind which has throughout the whole course of its career been receiving a correspondent bias and has in consequence contracted a correspondent distortion—cannot with reason be expected to exert itself with much alacrity or facility in a track so opposite and so new for the quiet of his conscience if at the outset of his career it were his fortune to have one he will naturally have been feeding himself with the notion that if there be anything that is amiss in practice it cannot be otherwise which being granted and accordingly that suffering to a certain amount cannot but take place whatsoever profit can be extracted from it is fair game and as such belongs of right to the first occupant among persons duly qualified the wonder would not be great if an officer of the military profession should exhibit for a time at least some awkwardness if forced to act in the character of a surgeons mate to inflict wounds requires one sort of skill—to dress and heal them requires another telephus is the only man upon record who possessed an instrument by which wounds were with equal dispatch and efficiency made and healed the race of telephus is extinct and as to his spears if ever any of them found their way into pompeii or herculaneum they remain still among the ruins unfortunately in this case were the ability to form a judgment ever so complete the likelihood of cooperation would not be increased none are so completely deaf as those who will not hear—none are so completely unintelligent as those who will not understand call upon a chiefjustice to concur in a measure for giving possibility to the recovery of a debt—the recovery of which is in his own     court rendered impossible by costs which partly go into his own pocket—as well might you call upon the pope to abjure the errors of the church of rome if not hard pressed he will maintain a prudent and easy silence if hard pressed he will let fly a volley of fallacies—he will play off the argument drawn from the imputation of bad motives and tell you of the profit expected by the party by whom the bill was framed and petition procured to form a ground for it if that be not sufficient he will transform himself in the first place into a witness giving evidence upon a committee in the next place after multiplying himself into the number of members necessary to hear and report upon that evidence he will make a report accordingly he will report in that character that when in any town a set of tradesmen have on their petition obtained a judicatory in which the recovery of a debt under  0s or £  is not attended with that obstruction of accumulated expense by which the relief which his judicatory professes to afford is always accompanied it has been with no other effect than that of giving in the character of judges effect to claims which in the character of witnesses it was originally their design and afterwards their practice to give support to by perjury ii the second of these two devices may be called the selftrumpeters fallacy by this name it is not intended to designate those occasional impulses of vanity which lead a man to display or overrate his pretensions to superior intelligence against the selflove of the man whose altar to himself is raised on this ground rival altars from every one of which he is sure of discouragement raise themselves all around but there are certain men in office who in discharge of their functions arrogate to themselves a degree of probity which is to exclude all imputations and all inquiry their assertions are to be deemed equivalent to proof their virtues are guarantees for the faithful discharge of their duties and the most implicit confidence is to be reposed in them on all occasions if you expose any abuse propose any reform call for securities inquiry or measures to promote publicity they set up a cry of surprise amounting almost to indignation as if their integrity were questioned or their honour wounded with all this they dexterously mix up intimations that the most exalted patriotism honour and perhaps religion are the only sources of all their actions such assertions must be classed among fallacies because—  they are irrelevant to the subject in discussion   the degree in which the predominance of motives of the social or disinterested cast is commonly asserted or insinuated is by the very nature of man rendered impossible   the sort of testimony thus given affords no legitimate reason for regarding the assertion in question to be true for it is no less completely in the power of the most profligate than in that of the most virtuous of mankind nor is it in a less degree the interest of the profligate man to make such assertions be they ever so completely false not any the least danger of punishment does he see himself exposed to at the hands either of the law or of public opinion for ascribing to any one of these selftrumpeters the smallest possible particle of that virtue which they are so loud in the profession of there is no more rational cause than for looking upon this or that actor as a good man because he acts well the part of othello or bad because he acts well the part of iago   on the contrary the interest he has in trying what may be done by these means is more decided and exclusive than in the case of the man of real probity and social feeling the virtuous man being what he is has that chance for being looked upon as such whereas the selftrumpeter in question having no such ground of reliance beholds his only chance in the conjunct effect of his own effrontery and the imbecility of his hearers these assertions of authority therefore by men in office who would have us estimate their conduct by their character and not their character by their conduct must be classed among political fallacies if there be any one maxim in politics more certain than another it is that no possible degree of virtue in the governor can render it expedient for the governed to dispense with good laws and good institutions chapter vi laudatory personalities—ad amicitiam personalities of this class are the opposites and in some respects the counterparts of vituperative personalities which will be treated of next in order at the commencement of the ensuing book laudatory personalities are susceptible of the same number of modifications as will be shown to exist in the case of vituperative personalities but in this case the argument is so     much weaker than in the other that the shades and modifications of it are seldom resorted to and are therefore not worth a detailed exposition the object of vituperative personalities is to effect the rejection of a measure on account of the alleged bad character of those who promote it and the argument advanced is—the persons who propose or promote the measure are bad therefore the measure is bad or ought to be rejected the object of laudatory personalities is to effect the rejection of a measure on account of the alleged good character of those who oppose it and the argument advanced is—the measure is rendered unnecessary by the virtues of those who are in power their opposition is a sufficient authority for the rejection of the measure the argument indeed is generally confined to persons of this description and is little else than an extension of the selftrumpeters fallacy in both of them authority derived from the virtues or talents of the persons lauded is brought forward as superseding the necessity of all investigation the measure proposed implies a distrust of the members of his majestys government but so great is their integrity so complete their disinterestedness so uniformly do they prefer the public advantage to their own that such a measure is altogether unnecessary—their disapproval is sufficient to warrant an opposition precautions can only be requisite where danger is apprehended here the high character of the individuals in question is a sufficient guarantee against any ground of alarm the panegyric goes on increasing in proportion to the dignity of the functionary thus panegyrized subordinates in office are the very models of assiduity attention and fidelity to their trust ministers the perfection of probity and intelligence and as for the highest magistrate in the state no adulation is equal to describe the extent of his various merits there can be no difficulty in exposing the fallacy of the argument attempted to be deduced from these panegyrics—   they have the common character of being irrelevant to the question under discussion the measure must have something extraordinary in it if a right judgment cannot be founded on its merits without first estimating the character of the members of the government   if the goodness of the measure be sufficiently established by direct arguments the reception given to it by those who oppose it will form a better criterion for judging of their character than their character as inferred from the places which they occupy for judging of the goodness or badness of the measure   if this argument be good in any one case it is equally good in every other and the effect of it if admitted would be to give to the persons occupying for the time being the situation in question an absolute and universal negative upon every measure not agreeable to their inclinations   in every public trust the legislator should for the purpose of prevention suppose the trustee disposed to break the trust in every imaginable way in which it would be possible for him to reap from the breach of it any personal advantage this is the principle on which public institutions ought to be formed and when it is applied to all men indiscriminately it is injurious to none the practical inference is to oppose to such possible and what will always be probable breaches of trust every bar that can be opposed consistently with the power requisite for the efficient and due discharge of the trust indeed these arguments drawn from the supposed virtues of men in power are opposed to the first principles on which all laws proceed   such allegations of individual virtue are never supported by specific proof—are scarce ever susceptible of specific disproof and specific disproof if offered could not be admitted viz in either house of parliament if attempted elsewhere the punishment would fall not on the unworthy trustee but on him by whom the unworthiness had been proved part ii fallacies of danger the subjectmatter of which is danger in various shapes and the object to repress discussion altogether by exciting alarm chapter i vituperative personalities—ad odium to this class belongs a cluster of fallacies so intimately connected with each other that they may first be enumerated and some observations be made upon them in the lump by seeing their mutual relations to each other—by observing in what circumstances they agree and in what they differ—a much more     correct as well as complete view will be obtained of them than if they were considered each of them by itself the fallacies that belong to this cluster may be denominated—   imputation of bad design   imputation of bad character   imputation of bad motive   imputation of inconsistency   imputation of suspicious connexions—noscitur ex sociis   imputation founded on identity of denomination—noscitur ex cognominibus of the fallacies belonging to this class the common character is the endeavour to draw aside attention from the measure to the man and this in such sort as from the supposed imperfection on the part of the man by whom a measure is supported or opposed to cause a correspondent imperfection to be imputed to the measure so supported or excellence to the measure so opposed the argument in its various shapes amounts to this—in bringing forward or supporting the measure in question the person in question entertains a bad design therefore the measure is bad—he is a person of a bad character therefore the measure is bad—he is actuated by a bad motive therefore the measure is bad—he has fallen into inconsistencies on a former occasion he either opposed it or made some observation not reconcilable with some observation which he has advanced on the present occasion therefore the measure is bad—he is on a footing of intimacy with this or that person who is a man of dangerous principles and designs or has been seen more or less frequently in his company or has professed or is suspected of entertaining some opinion which the other has professed or been suspected of entertaining therefore the measure is bad—he bears a name that at a former period was borne by a set of men now no more by whom bad principles were entertained or bad things done therefore the measure is bad in these arguments thus arranged a sort of anticlimax may be observed the fact intimated by each succeeding argument being suggested in the character of evidence of the one immediately preceding it or at least of some one or more of those which precede it and the conclusion being accordingly weaker and weaker at each step the second is a sort of circumstantial evidence of the first the third of the second and so on if the first is inconclusive the rest fall at once to the ground exposure—various are the considerations which concur in demonstrating the futility of the fallacies comprehended in this class and not to speak of the improbity of the utterers the weakness of those with whom they obtain currency—the weakness of the acceptors—   in the first place comes that general character of irrelevancy which belongs to these in common with the several other articles that stand upon the list of fallacies   in the next place comes the complete inconclusiveness whatsoever be their force as applied to a bad measure—to the worst measure that can be imagined they would be found to apply with little less force to all good measures—to the best measures that can be imagined among     or any such large number of persons taken at random there will be persons of all characters if the measure is a good one will it become bad because it is supported by a bad man if it is bad will it become good because supported by a good man if the measure be really inexpedient why not at once show that it is so your producing these irrelevant and inconclusive arguments in lieu of direct ones though not sufficient to prove that the measure you thus oppose is a good one contributes to prove that you yourselves regard it as a good one after these general observations let us examine more in detail the various shapes the fallacy assumes §   to begin with the imputation of bad design the measure in question is not charged with being itself a bad one for if it be and in so far as it is thus charged the argument is not irrelevant and fallacious the bad design imputed consists not in the design of carrying this measure but some other measure which is thus by necessary implication charged with being a bad one here then     four things ought to be proved viz   that the design of bringing forward the supposed bad measure is really entertained   that this design will be carried into effect   that the measure will prove to be a bad one   that but for the actually proposed measure the supposed bad one would not be carried into effect this is in effect a modification of the fallacy of distrust which will shortly be treated of but on what ground rests the supposition that the supposed bad measure will as such a consequence be carried into effect the persons by whom if at all it will be carried into effect will be either the legislators for the time being or the legislators of some future contingent time as to the legislators for the time being observe the character and frame of mind which the orator imputes to these his judges—give not your sanction to this measure for though there may be no particular harm in it yet if you do give your sanction to it the same man by whom this is proposed will propose to you others that will be bad and such is your weakness that however bad they may be you will want either the discernment necessary to enable you to see them in their true light or the resolution to enable you to put a negative upon measures of the mischief of which you are fully convinced the imbecility of the persons thus addressed in the character of legislators and judges—their consequent unfitness for the situation—such it is manifest is the basis of this fallacy on the part of these legislators themselves the forbearance manifested under such treatment on the part of the orator—the confidence entertained of his experiencing such forbearance—afford no inconsiderable presumption of the reality of the character so imputed to them §   imputation of bad character the inference meant to be drawn from an imputation of bad character is either to cause the person in question to be considered as entertaining bad designs—i e about to be concerned in bringing forward future contingent and pernicious measures—or simply to destroy any persuasive force with which in the character of authority his opinion is likely to be attended in this last case it is a fallacy opposed to a fallacy of the same complexion played off on the other side to employ it is to combat the antagonist with his own weapons in the former case it is another modification of the fallacy of distrust—of which hereafter in proportion to the degree of efficiency with which a man suffers these instruments of deception to operate upon his mind he enables bad men to exercise over him a sort of power the thought of which ought to cover him with shame allow this argument the effect of a conclusive one you put it into the power of any man to draw you at pleasure from the support of every measure which in your own eyes is good—to force you to give your support to any and every measure which in your own eyes is bad is it good—the bad man embraces it and by the supposition you reject it is it bad—he vituperates it and that suffices for driving you into its embrace you split upon the rocks because he has avoided them—you miss the harbour because he has steered into it give yourself up to any such blind antipathy you are no less in the power of your adversaries than by a correspondently irrational sympathy and obsequiousness you put yourself into the power of your friends §   imputation of bad motive the proposer of the measure it is asserted is actuated by bad motives from whence it is inferred that he entertains some bad design this again is no more than a modification of the fallacy of distrust but one of the very weakest—  because motives are hidden in the human breast   because if the measure is beneficial it would be absurd to reject it on account of the motives of its author but what is peculiar to this particular fallacy is the falsity of the supposition on which it is grounded viz the existence of a class or species of motives to which any such epithet as bad can with propriety be applied what constitutes a motive is the eventual expectation either of some pleasure or exemption from pain but forasmuch as in itself there is nothing good but pleasure or exemption from pain it follows that no motive is bad in itself though every kind of motive may according to circumstances occasion good or bad actions and motives of the dissocial cast may aggravate the mischief of a pernicious act but if the act itself to which the motive gives birth—if in the proposed measure in question there be nothing pernicious—it is not in the motives being of the dissocial class—it is not in its being of the selfregarding class—that there is any reason for calling it a bad one upon the influence and prevalence of motives of the selfregarding class depends the preservation not only of the species but of each individual belonging to it when from the introduction of a measure a man beholds the prospect of personal advantage in any shape whatever to himself—say for example a pecuniary advantage as being the most ordinary and palpable or dyslogistically speaking the most gross—it is certain that the contemplation of this advantage must have had some share in causing the conduct he pursues     it may have been the only cause the measure itself being by the supposition not pernicious is it the worse for this advantage on the contrary it is so much the better for of what stuff is public advantage composed but of private and personal advantage §   imputation of inconsistency admitting the fact of the inconsistency the utmost can amount to in the character of an argument against the proposed measure is the affording a presumption of bad design in a certain way or of bad character in a certain way and to a certain degree on the part of the proposer or supporter of the measure of the futility of that argument a view has been already given and this again is a modification of the fallacy of distrust that inconsistency when pushed to a certain degree may afford but too conclusive evidence of a sort of relatively bad character is not to be denied if for example on a former occasion personal interest inclining him one way say against the measure arguments have been urged by the person in question against the measure while on the present occasion personal interest inclining him the opposite way arguments are urged by him in favour of the measure—or if a matter of fact which on a former occasion was denied be now asserted or vice versâ—and in each case if no notice of the inconsistency is taken by the person himself—the operation of it to his prejudice will naturally be stronger than if an account more or less satisfactory is given by him of the circumstances and causes of the variance but be the evidence with regard to the cause of the change what it may no inference can be drawn from it against the measure unless it be that such inconsistency if established may weaken the persuasive force of the opinion of the person in question in the character of authority and in what respect and degree an argument of this complexion is irrelevant has been already brought to view §   imputation of suspicious connexions—noscitur ex sociis the alleged badness of character on the part of the alleged associate being admitted the argument now in question will stand upon the same footing as the four preceding the weakness of which has been already exposed and will constitute only another branch of the fallacy of distrust but before it can stand on a par even with those weak ones two ulterior points remain to be established—   one is the badness of character on the part of the alleged associate   another is the existence of a social connexion between the person in question and his supposed associate   a third is that the influence exercised on the mind of the person in question is such that in consequence of the connexion he will be induced to introduce and support measures and those mischievous ones which otherwise he would not have introduced or supported as to the two first of these three supposed facts their respective degrees of probability will depend on the circumstances of each case of the third the weakness may be exposed by considerations of a general nature in private life the force of the presumption in question is established by daily experience but in the case of a political connexion such as that which is created by an opposition to one and the same political measure or set of measures the presumption loses a great part sometimes the whole of its force few are the political measures on the occasion of which men of all characters men of all degrees in the scale of probity and improbity may not be seen on both sides the mere need of information respecting matters of fact is a cause capable of bringing together in a state of apparent connexion some of the most opposite characters §   imputation founded on identity of denomination—noscitur ex cognominibus the circumstances by which this fallacy is distinguished from the last preceding is that in this case between the person in question and the obnoxious persons by whose opinions and conduct he is supposed to be determined or influenced neither personal intercourse nor possibility of personal intercourse can exist in the last case his measures were to be opposed because he was connected with persons of bad character—in the present because he bears the same denomination as persons now no more but who in their own time were the authors of pernicious measures in so far as a community of interest exists between the persons thus connected by community of denomination the allegation of a certain community of designs is not altogether destitute of weight community of denomination however is but the sign not the efficient cause of community of interest what have the romans of the present day in common with the romans of early times do they aspire to recover the empire of the world but when evil designs are imputed to men of the present day on the ground that evil designs were entertained and prosecuted by their namesakes in time past whatsoever may be the community of interest one circumstance ought never to be out of mind—this is the gradual melioration of character from the most remote and barbarous down to the present time the consequence of which is that in many particulars the same ends which were formerly pursued by persons of the same denomination are not now pursued and if     in many others the same ends are pursued they are not pursued by the same bad means if this observation pass unheeded the consequences may be no less mischievous than absurd that which has been is unalterable if then this fallacy be suffered to influence the mind and determine human conduct whatsoever degree of depravity be imputed to preceding generations of the obnoxious denomination—whatsoever opposition may have been manifested towards them or their successors—must continue without abatement to the end of time be my friendship immortal my enmity mortal is the sentiment that has been so warmly and so justly applauded in the mouth of a sage of antiquity but the fallacy here in question proposes to maintain its baneful influence for ever it is in matters touching religious persuasion and to the prejudice of certain sects that this fallacy has been played off with the greatest and most pernicious effect in england particularly against measures for the relief of the catholics those of our ancestors who professing the same branch of the christian religion as that which you now profess were thence distinguished by the same name entertained pernicious designs that for some time showed themselves in pernicious measures therefore you entertaining the same pernicious designs would now had you but power enough carry into effect the same pernicious measures—they having the power destroyed by fire and faggot those who in respect of religious opinions and ceremonies differed from them therefore had you but power enough so would you upon this ground in one of the three kingdoms a system of government continues which does not so much as profess to have in view the welfare of the majority of the inhabitants—a system of government in which the interest of the many is avowedly so long as the government lasts intended to be kept in a state of perpetual sacrifice to the interest of the few in vain is it urged these inferences drawn from times and measures long since past are completely belied by the universal experience of all present time in the saxon kingdom in the austrian empire in the vast and everflourishing empire of france though the sovereign is catholic whatsoever degree of security the government allows of is possessed alike by catholics and protestants in vain is it observed not that to this purpose this or any other part of the history of the   th century is worth observing—in vain is it observed and truly observed the church of england continued her fires after the church of rome had discontinued hers it is only in the absence of interest that experience can hope to be regarded or reason heard in the character of sinecurists and overpaid placemen it is the interest of the members of the english government to treat the majority of the people of ireland on the double footing of enemies and subjects and such is the treatment which is in store for them to the extent of their endurance §   cause of the prevalence of the fallacies belonging to this class whatsoever be the nature of the several instruments of deception by which the mind is liable to be operated upon and deceived the degree of prevalence they experience—the degree of success they enjoy depends ultimately upon one common cause viz the ignorance and mental imbecility of those on whom they operate in the present instance besides this ultimate cause or root they find in another fallacy and the corresponding propensity of the human mind a sort of intermediate cause this is the fallacy of authority the corresponding propensity is the propensity to save exertion by resting satisfied with authority derived from and proportioned to the ignorance and weakness of the minds to which political arguments are addressed is the propensity to judge of the propriety or impropriety of a measure from the supposed character or disposition of its supporters or opposers in preference to or even in exclusion of its own intrinsic character and tendency proportioned to the degree of importance attached to the character and disposition of the author or supporter of the measure is the degree of persuasive force with which the fallacies belonging to this class will naturally act besides nothing but laborious application and a clear and comprehensive intellect can enable a man on any given subject to employ successfully relevant arguments drawn from the subject itself to employ personalities neither labour nor intellect is required in this sort of contest the most idle and the most ignorant are quite on a par with if not superior to the most industrious and the most highlygifted individuals nothing can be more convement for those who would speak without the trouble of thinking the same ideas are brought forward over and over again and all that is required is to vary the turn of expression close and relevant arguments have very little hold on the passions and serve rather to quell than to inflame them while in personalities there is always something stimulant whether on the part of him who praises or him who blames praise forms a kind of connexion between the party praising and the party praised and vituperation gives an air of courage and independence to the party who blames     ignorance and indolence friendship and enmity concurring and conflicting interest servility and independence—all conspire to give personalities the ascendency they so unhappily maintain the more we lie under the influence of our own passions the more we rely on others being affected in a similar degree a man who can repel these injuries with dignity may often convert them into triumph strike me but hear says he and the fury of his antagonist redounds to his own discomfiture chapter ii §   the hobgoblin argument or no innovation—ad metum exposition—the hobgoblin the eventual appearance of which is denounced by this argument is anarchy which tremendous spectre has for its forerunner the monster innovation the forms in which this monster may be denounced are as numerous and various as the sentences in which the word innovation can be placed here it comes exclaims the barbarous or unthinking servant in the hearing of the affrighted child when to rid herself of the burthen of attendance such servant scruples not to employ an instrument of terror the effects of which may continue during life here it comes is the cry and the hobgoblin is rendered but the more terrific by the suppression of its name of a similar nature and productive of similar effects is the political device here exposed to view as an instrument of deception the device is generally accompanied by personalities of the vituperative kind—imputation of bad motives bad designs bad conduct and character c are ordinarily cast on the authors and advocates of the obnoxious measure whilst the term employed is such as to beg the question in dispute thus in the present instance innovation means a bad change presenting to the mind besides the idea of a change the proposition either that change in general is a bad thing or at least that the sort of change in question is a bad change exposure—allcomprehensiveness of the condemnation passed by this fallacy this is one of the many cases in which it is difficult to render the absurdity of the argument more glaring than it is upon the face of the argument itself whatever reason it affords for looking upon the proposed measure be it what it may as about to be mischievous it affords the same reason for entertaining the same opinion of everything that exists at present to say all new things are bad is as much as to say all things are bad—or at any event at their commencement for of all the old things ever seen or heard of there is not one that was not once new whatever is now establishment was once innovation he who on this ground condemns a proposed measure condemns in the same breath whatsoever he would be most averse to be thought to disapprove—he condemns the revolution the reformation the assumption made by the house of commons of a part in the penning of the laws in the reign of henry vi the institution of the house of commons itself in the reign of henry iii—all these he bids us regard as sure forerunners of the monster anarchy but particularly the birth and first efficient agency of the house of commons—an innovation in comparison of which all others past or future are for efficiency and consequently mischievousness but as grains of dust in the balance §   apprehension of mischief from change—what foundation it has in truth a circumstance that gives a sort of colour to the use of this fallacy is that it can scarcely ever be found without a certain degree of truth adhering to it supposing the change to be one which cannot be effected without the interposition of the legislature even this circumstance is sufficient to attach to it a certain quantity of mischief the words necessary to commit the change even to writing cannot be put into that form without labour importing a proportional quantity of vexation to the head employed in it which labour and vexation if paid for is compensated by and productive of expense when disseminated by the operation of the press as it always must be before it can be productive of whatever effect is aimed at it becomes productive of ulterior vexation and expense here then is so much unavoidable mischief of which the most salutary and indispensable change cannot fail to be productive to this natural and unavoidable portion of mischief the additions that have been made in the shape of factitious and avoidable mischief of the same kind are such as have sufficient claim to notice but to a notice not proper for this place here then we have the minimum of mischief which accompanies every change and in this minimum of mischief we have the minimum of truth with which this fallacy is accompanied and which is sufficient to protect it against exposure from a flat and undiscriminating demal it is seldom however that the whole of the mischief with the corresponding portion of truth is confined within such narrow bounds wheresoever any portion however great or small of the aggregate mass of the objects of desire in any shape—matter of wealth power dignity or even reputation—and     whether in possession or only in prospect and that ever so remote and contingent—must in consequence of the change pass out of any hand or hands that are not willing to part with it viz either without compensation or with no other than what in their estimation is insufficient—here we have in some shape or other a quantity of vexation uncompensated—so much vexation so much mischief beyond dispute but in one way or other whether from the total omission of this or that item or from the supposed inadequacy of the compensation given for it or from its incapacity of being included in any estimate as in case of remote and but weakly probable as well as contingent profits it will not unfrequently happen that the compensation allotted in this case shall be inadequate not only to the desires but to the imagined rights of the party from whom the sacrifice is exacted in so far as such insufficiency appears to himself to exist he will feel himself urged by a motive the force of which will be in proportion to the amount of such deficiency to oppose the measure and in so far as in his eyes such motive is fit to be displayed it will constitute what in his language will be reason and what will be received in that character by all other persons in whose estimate any such deficiency shall appear to exist so far as any such deficiency is specifically alleged in the character of a reason it forms a relevant and specific argument and belongs not to the account of fallacies and if well founded constitutes a just reason if not for quashing the measure at any rate for adding to the compensation thus shown to be deficient and in this shape viz in that of a specific argument will a man of course present his motive to view if it be susceptible of it but when the alleged damage and eventual injury will not even in his own view of it bear the test of inquiry then this specific argument failing him he will betake himself to the general fallacy in lieu of it he will set up the cry of innovation innovation hoping by this watchword to bring to his aid all whose sinister interest is connected with his own and to engage them to say and the unreflecting multitude to believe that the change in question is of the number of those in which the mischief attached to it is not accompanied by a preponderant mass of advantage §   time the innovatorgeneral a counterfallacy among the stories current in the profession of the law is that of an attorney who when his client applied to him for relief against a forged bond advised him as the shortest and surest course to forge a release thus as a shorter and surer course than that of attempting to make men sensible of the imposture this fallacy has been every now and then met by what may be termed its counterfallacy time itself is the archinnovator the inference is the proposed change branded as it has thus been by the odious appellative of innovation is in fact no change its sole effect being either to prevent a change or to bring the matter back to the good state in which it formerly was this counterfallacy if such it may be termed has not however any such pernicious properties or consequences attached to it as may be seen to be indicated by that name two circumstances however concur in giving it a just title to the appellation of a fallacy one is that it has no specific application to the particular measure in hand and on that score may be set down as irrelevant the other that by a sort of implied concession and virtual admission it gives colour and countenance to the fallacy to which it is opposed—admitting by implication that if the appellation of a change belonged with propriety to the proposed measure it might on that single account with propriety be opposed a few words then are now sufficient to strip the mask from this fallacy no specific mischief as likely to result from the specific measure is alleged if it were the argument would not belong to this head what is alleged is nothing more than that mischief without regard to the amount would be among the results of this measure but this is no more than can be said of every legislative measure that ever did pass or ever can pass if then it be to be ranked with arguments it is an argument that involves in one common condemnation all political measures whatsoever past present and to come it passes condemnation on whatsoever in this way ever has been or ever can be done in all places as well as in all times delivered from an humble station from the mouth of an old woman beguiling by her gossip the labours of the spinningwheel in her cottage it might pass for simple and ordinary ignorance—delivered from any such exalted station as that of a legislative house or judicial bench—from such a quarter if it can be regarded as sincere it is a mark of drivelling rather than ignorance but it may be said—my meaning is not to condemn all change—not to condemn all new institutions all new laws all new measures—only violent and dangerous ones such as that is which is now proposed the answer is neither drawing or attempting to draw any line you do by this indiscriminating appellative pass condemnation on all change—on everything to which any such epithet as new can with propriety be applied draw any such line and the reproach of insincerity or imbecility shall be withholden draw your line but remember that whenever   0 you do draw it or so much as begin to draw it you give up this your argument alive to possibleimaginable evils dead to actual ones—eagleeyed to future contingent evils blind and insensible to all existing ones—such is the character of the mind to which a fallacy such as this can really have presented itself in the character of an argument possessing any the smallest claim to notice to such a mind—that by denial and sale of justice anarchy in so far as concerns ninetenths of the people is actually by force of law established and that it is only by the force of morality—of such morality as all the punishments denounced against sincerity and all the reward applied for the encouragement of insincerity have not been able to banish—that society is kept together—that to draw into question the fitness of great characters for their high situations is in one man a crime while to question their fitness so that their motives remain unquestioned is lawful to another—that the crime called libel remains undefined and undistinguishable and the liberty of the press is defined to be the absence of that security which would be afforded to writers by the establishment of a licenser—that under a show of limitation a government shall be in fact an absolute one while pretended guardians are real accomplices and at the nod of a king or a minister by a regular trained body of votes black shall be declared white—miscarriage success—mortality health—disgrace honour—and notorious experienced imbecility consummate skill—to such a mind these with other evils boundless in extent and number are either not seen to be in existence or not felt to be such in such a mind the horror of innovation is as really a disease as any to which the body in which it is seated is exposed and in proportion as a man is afflicted with it he is the enemy of all good which how urgent soever may be the demand for it remains as yet to be done nor can he be said to be completely cured of it till he shall have learnt to take on each occasion and without repugnance general utility for the general end and to judge of whatever is proposed in the character of a means conducive to that end §   sinister interests in which this fallacy has its source could the wand of that magician be borrowed at whose potent touch the emissaries of his wicked antagonist threw off their several disguises and made instant confession of their real character and designs—could a few of those ravens by whom the word innovation is uttered with a scream of horror and the approach of the monster anarchy denounced—be touched with it we should then learn their real character and have the true import of these screams translated into intelligible language   i am a lawyer would one of them be heard to say—a feefed judge—who considering that the money i lay up the power i exercise and the respect and reputation i enjoy depend on the undiminished continuance of the abuses of the law the factitious delay vexation and expense with which the few who have money enough to pay for a chance of justice are loaded and by which the many who have not are cut off from that chance—take this method of deterring men from attempting to alleviate those torments in which my comforts have their source   i am a sinecurist cries another who being in the receipt of £  000 ayear public money for doing nothing and having no more wit than honesty have never been able to open my mouth and pronounce any articulate sound for any other purpose—yet hearing a cry of no sinecures am come to join in the shout of no innovation down with the innovators in hopes of drowning by these defensive sounds the offensive ones which chill my blood and make me tremble   i am a contractor cries a third who having bought my seat that i may sell my votes—and in return for them being in the habit of obtaining with the most convenient regularity a succession of good jobs foresee in the prevalence of innovation the destruction and the ruin of this established branch of trade   i am a country gentleman cries a fourth who observing that from having a seat in a certain assembly a man enjoys more respect than he did before on the turf in the dogkennel and in the stable and having tenants and other dependents enough to seat me against their wills for a place in which i am detested and hearing it said that if innovation were suffered to run on unopposed elections would come in time to be as free in reality as they are in appearance and pretence—have left for a day or two the cry of tallyho and hark forward to join in the cry of no anarchy no innovation   i am a priest says a fifth who having proved the pope to be antichrist to the satisfaction of all orthodox divines whose piety prays for the cure of souls or whose health has need of exoneration from the burthen of residence and having read in my edition of the gospel that the apostles lived in palaces which innovation and anarchy would cut down to parsonagehouses though grown hoarse by screaming out no reading no writing no lancaster and no popery—for fear of coming change am here to add what remains of my voice to the full chorus of no anarchy no innovation     chapter iii fallacy of distrust or whats at the bottom—ad metum exposition—this argument may be considered as a particular modification of the noinnovation argument an arrangement or set of arrangements has been proposed so plainly beneficial and at the same time so manifestly innoxious that no prospect presents itself of bringing to bear upon them with any effect the cry of no innovation is the antiinnovationist mute no he has this resource—in what you see as yet says he there may perhaps be no great mischief but depend upon it in the quarter from whence these proposed innoxious arrangements come there are more behind that are of a very different complexion if these innoxious ones are suffered to be carried others of a noxious character will succeed without end and will be carried likewise exposure—the absurdity of this argument is too glaring to be susceptible of any considerable illustration from anything that can be said of it—   in the first place it begins with a virtual admission of the propriety of the measure considered in itself and thus containing within itself a demonstration of its own futility it cuts up from under it the very ground which it is endeavouring to make yet from its very weakness it is apt to derive for the moment a certain degree of force by the monstrosity of its weakness a feeling of surprise and thereupon of perplexity is apt to be produced and so long as this feeling continues a difficulty of finding an appropriate answer continues with it for that which is itself nothing what answer says a man can i find if two measures—g and b—were both brought forward at the same time g being good and b bad—rejecting g because b is bad would be quite absurd enough and at first view a man might be apt to suppose that the force of absurdity could go no further but the present fallacy does in effect go much further—two measures both of them brought upon the carpet together both of them unobjectionable are to be rejected not for anything that is amiss in either of them but for something that by possibility may be found amiss in some other or others that nobody knows of and the future existence of which without the slightest ground is to be assumed and taken for granted in the field of policy as applied to measures this vicarious reprobation forms a counterpart to vicarious punishment in the field of justice as applied to persons the measure g which is good is to be thrown out because for aught we can be sure of some day or other it may happen to be followed by some other measure b which may be a bad one a man a against whom there is neither evidence nor charge is to be punished because for aught we can be sure of some time or other there may be some other man who will have been guilty if on this ground it be right that the measure in question be rejected so ought every other measure that ever has been or can be proposed for of no measure can anybody be sure but that it may be followed by some other measure or measures of which when they make their appearance it may be said that they are bad if then the argument proves anything it proves that no measure ought ever to be carried or ever to have been carried and that therefore all things that can be done by law or government and therefore law and government themselves are nuisances this policy is exactly that which was attributed to herod in the extermination of the innocents and the sort of man by whom an argument of this sort can be employed is the sort of man who would have acted as herod did had he been in herods place but think not only what sort of man he must be who can bring himself to employ such an argument but moreover what sort of men they must be to whom he can venture to propose it—on whom he can expect it to make any impression but such a one as will be disgraceful to himself such drivellers says he to them in effect such drivellers are you so sure of being imposed upon by any one that will attempt it that you know not the distinction between good and bad and when at the suggestion of this or that man you have adopted any one measure good or bad let but that same man propose any number of other measures whatever be their character ye are such idiots and fools that without looking at them yourselves or vouchsafing to learn their character from others you will adopt them in a lump such is the compliment wrapt up in this sort of argument chapter iv official malefactors screen—ad metum attack us you attack government exposition—the fallacy here in question is employed almost as often as in speaking of the persons by whom or of the system on which the business of the government is conducted any expressions importing condemnation or censure are uttered the fallacy consists in affecting to consider such condemnation or censure as being if not in design     at least in tendency pregnant with mischief to government itself—oppose us you oppose government disgrace us you disgrace government bring us into contempt you bring government into contempt and anarchy and civil war are the immediate consequences such are the forms it assumes exposure—not illgrounded most assuredly is the alleged importance of this maxim to the class of persons by or for whom it is employed it must be admitted to be well worth whatsoever pains can be employed in decking it out to the best advantage let but this notion be acceded to all persons now partaking or who may at any time be likely to partake in the business and profit of misrule must in every one of its shapes be allowed to continue so to do without disturbance all abuses as well future as present must continue without remedy the most industrious labourers in the service of mankind will experience the treatment due to those to whose dissocial or selfish nature the happiness of man is an object of aversion or indifference punishment or at least disgrace will be the reward of the most exalted virtue perpetual honour as well as power the reward of the most pernicious vices punishment will be and so by english libellaw it is at this day—let but the criminal be of a certain rank in the state and the mischief of the crime upon a scale to a certain degree extensive—punishment will be not for him who commits a crime but for him who complains of it so long as the conduct of the business of the government contains anything amiss in it—so long as it contains in it anything that could be made better—so long in a word as it continues short of a state of absolute perfection—there will be no other mode of bringing it nearer to perfection—no other means of clearing it of the most mischievous abuses with which government can be defiled than the indication of such points of imperfection as at the time being exist or are supposed to exist in it which points of imperfection will always be referable to one or other of two heads the conduct of this or that one of the individuals by whom in such or such a department the business of government is conducted or the state of the system of administration under which they act but neither in the system in question nor in the conduct of the persons in question can any imperfection be pointed out but that as towards such persons or such system in proportion to the apparent importance and extent of that imperfection aversion or contempt must in a greater or less degree be produced in effect this fallacy is but a mode of intimating in other words that no abuse ought to be reformed—that nothing ought to be uttered in relation to the misconduct of any person in office which may produce any sentiment of disapprobation in this country at least few if any persons aim at any such object as the bringing into contempt any of those offices on the execution of which the maintenance of the general security depends—any such office for example as that of king member of parliament or judge as to the person of the king if the maxim the king can do no wrong be admitted in both its senses there can be no need of imputing blame to him unless in the way of defence against the imprudence or the improbity of those who by groundless or exaggerated eulogiums on the personal character of the individual monarch on the throne seek to extend his power and to screen from censure or scrutiny the misconduct of his agents but in the instance of any other office to reprobate everything the tendency of which is to expose the officer to hatred or contempt is to reprobate everything that can be said or done either in the way of complaint against past or for the purpose of preventing future transgressions—to reprobate everything the tendency of which is to expose the office to hatred or contempt is to reprobate everything that can be said or done towards pointing out the demand for reform how needful soever in the constitution of the office if in the constitution of the office in respect of mode of appointment mode of remuneration c there be anything that tends to give all persons placed in it an interest acting in opposition to official duty or to give an increased facility to the effective pursuit of any such sinister interest everything that tends to bring to view such sinister interest or such facility contributes it may be said to bring the office itself into contempt that under the existing system of judicature so far as concerns its higher seats the interest of the judge is throughout the whole field of his jurisdiction in a state of constant and diametrical opposition to the line of his duty—that it is his interest to maintain undiminished and as far as possible to increase every evil opposite to the ends of justice viz uncertainty delay vexation and expense—that the giving birth to these evils has at all times been more or less an object with every judge the present ones excepted of whom we say nothing that ever sat on a westminsterhall bench—and that under the present constitution of the office it were weakness to expect at the hands of a judge anything better—whilst that of the abovementioned evils the load which is actually endured by the people of this country is as to a very small part only the natural and unavoidable     lot of human nature—are propositions which have already in this work been made plain to demonstration and in the belief of which the writer has been confirmed by the observations of nearly sixty years—propositions of the truth of which he is no more able to entertain a doubt than he is of his own existence but in these sentiments has he any such wish as to see enfeebled and exposed to effectual resistance the authority of judges—of any established judicatory—of any one occupier of any such judicial seat no the most strenuous defender of abuse in every shape would not go further than he in wishes and upon occasion in exertion for its support for preventing remedying or checking transgression on the part of the members of government or preventing their management of the business of government from becoming completely arbitrary the nature of things affords no other means than such the tendency of which as far as they go is to lower either these managing hands or the system or both in the affection and estimation of the people which effect when produced in a high degree may be termed bringing them into hatred and contempt but so far is it from being true that a mans aversion or contempt for the hands by which the powers of government or even for the system under which they are exercised is a proof of his aversion or contempt towards government itself that even in proportion to the strength of that aversion or contempt it is a proof of the opposite affection what in consequence of such contempt or aversion he wishes for is not that there be no hands at all to exercise these powers but that the hands may be better regulated—not that those powers should not be exercised at all but that they should be better exercised—not that in the exercise of them no rules at all should be pursued but that the rules by which they are exercised should be a better set of rules all government is a trust—every branch of government is a trust and immemorially acknowledged so to be it is only by the magnitude of the scale that public differ from private trusts i complain of the conduct of a person in the character of guardian—as domestic guardian having the care of a minor or insane person in so doing do i say that guardianship is a bad institution does it enter into the head of any one to suspect me of so doing i complain of an individual in the character of a commercial agent or assignee of the effects of an insolvent in so doing do i say that commercial agency is a bad thing—that the practice of vesting in the hands of trustees or assignees the effects of an insolvent for the purpose of their being divided among his creditors is a bad practice does any such conceit ever enter into the head of man as that of suspecting me of so doing i complain of an imperfection in the state of the law relative to guardianship in stating this supposed imperfection in the state of the law itself do i say that there ought to be no law on the subject—that no human being ought to have any such power as that of guardian over the person of any other does it ever enter into the head of any human being to suspect me so much as of entertaining any such persuasion not to speak of endeavouring to cause others to entertain it nothing can be more groundless than to suppose that the disposition to pay obedience to the laws by which security in respect of person property reputation and condition in life is afforded is influenced by any such consideration as that of the fitness of the several functionaries for their respective trusts or even so much as by the fitness of the system of regulations and customs under which they act the chief occasions in which obedience on the part of a member of the community in his character of subject is called upon to manifest itself are the habitual payment of taxes and submission to the orders of courts of justice the one an habitual practice the other an occasional and eventual one but in neither instance in the disposition to obedience is any variation produced by any increase or diminution in the good or ill opinion entertained in relation to the official persons by whom the business of those departments is respectively carried on or even in relation to the goodness of the systems under which they act were the business of government carried on ever so much worse than it is still it is from the power of government in its several branches that each man receives whatsoever protection he enjoys either against foreign or domestic adversaries it is therefore by his regard for his own security and not by his respect either for the persons by whom or the system according to which those powers are exercised that his wish to see obedience paid to them by others and his disposition to pay obedience to them himself are produced were it even his wish to withhold from them his own obedience that wish cannot but be altogether ineffectual unless and until he shall see others in sufficient number disposed and prepared to withhold each of them his own obedience—a state of things which can only arise from a common sense of overwhelming misery and not from the mere utterance of complaint there is no freedom of the press no power to complain in turkey yet of all countries it is that in which revolts and revolutions are the most frequent and the most violent here and there a man of strong appetites     weak understanding and stout heart excepted it might be affirmed with confidence that the most indigent and most ignorant would not be foolish enough to wish to see a complete dissolution of the bonds of government in such a state of things whatsoever he might expect to grasp for the moment he would have no assured hope of keeping were he ever so strong his strength he could not but see would avail him nothing against a momentarily confederated multitude nor in one part of his field against a swifter individual ravaging the opposite part nor during sleep against the weakest and most sluggish and for the purpose of securing himself against such continuallyimpending disasters let him suppose himself entered into an association with othersfor mutual security—he would then suppose himself living again under a sort of government even the comparatively few who for a source of subsistence prefer depredation to honest industry are not less dependent for their wretched and ever palpitating existence than the honest and industrious are for theirs on that general security to which their practice creates exceptions be the momentary object of his rapacity what it may what no one of them could avoid having a more or less distinct conception of is that it could not exist for him further than it is secured against others so far is it from being true that no government can exist consistently with such exposure no good government can exist without it unless by open and lawless violence by no other means than lowering in the estimation of the people the hands by which the powers of government are exercised if the cause of the mischief consist in the unfitness of the hands—or the system of management under which they act if the cause of the mischief lie in the system—be the hands ever so unfit or the system ever so illconstructed—can there be any hope or chance of beneficial change there being no sufficient reason for ascribing even to the worstdisposed any wish so foolish as that of seeing the bonds of government dissolved nor on the part of the bestdisposed any possibility of contributing to produce change either in any ruling hands deemed by them unfit for their trust or of the system deemed by them ill adapted to those which are or ought to be its ends otherwise than by respectively bringing into general disesteem these objects of their disapprobation—there cannot be a more unfounded imputation or viler artifice if it be artifice or grosser error if it be error than that which infers from the disposition or even the endeavour to lessen in the estimation of the people the existing rulers or the existing system any such wish as that of seeing the bands of government dissolved in producing a local or temporary debility in the action of the powers of the natural body in many cases the honest and skilful physician beholds the only means of cure and from the act of the physician who prescribes an evacuant or a sedative it would be as reasonable to infer a wish to see the patient perish as from the act of a statesman whose endeavours are employed in lowering the reputation of the official hands in whom or the system of management in which he beholds the cause of what appears to him amiss—to infer a wish to see the whole frame of government either destroyed or rendered worse in so far as a mans feeling and conduct are influenced and determined by what is called public opinion by the force of the popular or moral sanction and that opinion runs in conformity with the dictates of the principles of general utility—in proportion to the value set upon reputation and the degree of respect entertained for the community at large his conduct will be the better the more completely the quantity of respect he enjoys is dependent upon the goodness of his behaviour it will be the worse the more completely the quantity of respect he is sure of enjoying is independent of it thus whatsoever portion of respect the people at large are in the habit of bestowing upon the individual by whom on any given occasion the office in question is filled this portion of respect may so long as the habit continues be said to be attached to the office just as any portion of the emolument is which happens to be attached to the office but as it is with emolument so is it with respect the greater the quantity of it a man is likely to receive independently of his good behaviour the less good in so far as depends upon the degree of influence with which the love of reputation acts upon his mind is his behaviour likely to be if this be true it is in so far the interest of the public that that portion of respect which along with the salary is habitually attached to the office should be as small as possible if indeed the notion which it is the object of the fallacy in question to inculcate were true viz that the stability of the government or its existence at each given point of time depends upon the degree of respect bestowed upon the several individuals by whom at that point of time its powers are exercised—if this were true it would not be the interest of the public that the portion of respect habitually attached to the office and received by the official person independently of his good behaviour in it should be as small as possible but in how great a degree this notion is erroneous has been shown already     but while it is the interest of the public that in the instance of each trustee of the public the remuneration received by him in the shape of respect should be as completely dependent as possible upon the goodness of his behaviour in the execution of his trust it is the interest of the trustee himself that as in every other shape so in the shape of respect whatsoever portion of the good things of this world he receives on whatever score whether on the score of remuneration or any other should be as great as possible since by good behaviour neither respect nor anything else can be always earned by him but by sacrifices in some shape or other and in particular in the shape of ease whatsoever therefore be the official situation which the official person in question occupies it is his interest that the quantity of respect habitually attached to it be as great and at the same time as securely attached to it as possible and in the point of view from which he is by his personal and sinister interest led to consider the subject the point of perfection in this line will not be attained until the quantity of respect he receives in consequence of the possession he has of the office be at all times as great as the nature of the office admits—at all times as completely independent of the goodness of his behaviour in his office as possible—as great in the event of his making the worst and least good use as in that of his making the best and the least bad use of the powers belonging to it such being his interest whatsoever be his official situation if as is the case of most if not all official situations it be of such a nature as to have power in any shape attached to it his endeavour and study will be so to order matters as to cause to be attached to it as above and by all means possible the greatest portion of respect possible to this purpose amongst others will be directed whatsoever influence his will can be made to act with on other wills and whatsoever influence his understanding can be made to exert over other understandings if for example his situation be that of a judge—by the influence of will on will it will seldom in any considerable degree be in his power to compel men by force to bestow upon him the sentiment of respect either by itself or in any considerable degree by means of any external mark or token of it but he may restrain men from saying or doing any of those things the effect of which would be to cause others to bestow upon him less respect than they would otherwise if being a judge of the kings bench any man has the presumption to question his fitness for such his high situation he may for so doing punish him by fine and imprisonment with et cæteras if a lord chancellor he may prosecute him before a judge by whom a disposition to attach such punishments to such offences has been demonstrated by practice thus much as to what can and what cannot be done towards attaching respect to office by the influence of will on will what may be done by the influence of understanding on understanding remains to be noticed laying out of the question that influence which in the official situation in question is exercised over the understandings of the people at large independently of any exertions on the part of him by whom it is filled—that which on his part requires exertion and is capable of being exercised by exertion consists in the giving utterance and circulation in the most impressive manner to the fallacy in question together with a few such others as are more particularly connected with it upon the boldness and readiness with which the hands and system are spoken ill of depends the difference between arbitrary and limited government—between a government in which the great body of the people have and one in which they have not a share in respect of the members of the governing body undoubtedly the state of things most to be desired is that the only occasion on which any endeavours should be employed to lower them in the estimation of the public should be those in which inaptitude in some shape or other want of probity or weakness of judgment or want of appropriate talent have justly been imputable to them that on those occasions in which inaptitude has not in any of those shapes been justly imputable no such endeavour should ever be employed unfortunately the state of things hereby supposed is plainly need it be said an impossible one admit no accusation you may and you will exclude all unjust ones admit just ones you must admit unjust ones along with them there is no help for it one of two evils being necessary to be chosen the question is which is the least—to admit all such imputations and thereby to admit of unjust ones or to exclude all such imputations and thereby to exclude all just ones i answer without difficulty—the admission of unjust imputations is beyond comparison the least of the two evils exclude all unjust imputations and with them all just ones—the only check by which the career of deterioration can be stopped being thus removed both hands and system will until they arrive at the extreme of despotism and misrule be continually growing worse and worse the hands themselves will grow worse and worse having nothing to counteract the force of that separate and sinister interest to the action of which they remain constantly exposed and the system itself will grow worse and worse     it being all along the interest and by the supposition within the power of the hands themselves to make it so admit just imputations though along with them you admit unjust ones—so slight is the evil as scarcely to bear that name along with unjust imputations are not defences admitted in respect of motives and of means have not the defendants in this case beyond all comparison the advantage of the complainants as far as concerns motives in the instance of every person included in the attack and in an attack made upon any one member of the government as such who does not know how apt all are to feel themselves included the principle of selfpreservation is stronger than the exciting cause productive of the disposition to attack can be in any instance as far as concerns means of defence if the person against whom the attack is principally levelled wants time or talent to defend himself scarce a particle of the immense mass of the matter of reward—which in all manner of shapes for the purpose of carrying on the ordinary business of government lies constantly at the disposal of the members of the government—but is applicable even without any separate expense to the extraordinary purpose of engaging defending advocates let it not be said—this is a persecution to which an honourable man ought not to be exposed—a persecution which though to some honourable men it may be tolerable will to others be intolerable—intolerable to such a degree as to deprive the public of the benefit of their services a notion to any such effect will scarcely be advanced with a grave face that censure is the tax imposed by nature upon eminence is the a b c of common place who is there to whom it can be a doubt that exposure to such imputations is among the inevitable appendages of office if it were an office which in no shape whatever had any adequate allowance of the matter of reward annexed to it—if it were a situation into which men were pressed—the observation would have some better ground but in the class of office here in question exists there any such a selfcontradiction is involved in the observation itself the subject of which sensibility thus morbid is predicated is an honourable man but to an honourable man to any man to whom the attribute honourable can with truth and justice be applied such sensibility cannot be attributed the man who will not accept an office but upon condition that his conduct in it shall remain exempt from all imputation intends not that his conduct shall be what it ought to be—the man to whom the idea of being subject to those imputations to which he sees the best are exposed is intolerable—is in his heart a tyrant—and to become so in practice wants nothing but to be seated on one of those thrones or on one of those benches in which by the appearance of chains made for show and not for use a man is enabled with the greater dignity as well as safety to act the part of the tyrant and glut himself with vengeance to a man who in the civil line of office accepts a commission it is not less evident that by so doing he exposes himself to imputations some of which may happen to be unjust than to a man in the military line it is evident that by acceptance of a commission in that line he exposes himself to be shot at and of a military office with about equal truth might it be said that an honourable man will not accept it on such condition as of a civil office that an honourable man will not accept it if his conduct is to stand exposed to such imputations in such circumstances it is not easy to see how it should happen to a public man to labour at the longrun under an imputation that is not just in so far as any such incident does take place evil does in truth take place but even in this case the evil will not be unaccompanied with concomitant good operating in compensation for it on the part of men in office it contributes to keep up the habit of considering their conduct as exposed to scrutiny—to keep up in their minds that sense of responsibility on which goodness of conduct depends in which good behaviour finds its chief security on the part of the people at large it serves to keep alive the expectation of witnessing such attacks—the habit of looking out for them and when any such attack does come it prevents the idea of hardship which is apt to attach upon any infliction how necessary soever of which it can be said that it is unprecedented or even rare and hinders the public mind from being set against the attack and him who finds exertion and courage enough to make it when in support of such imputations false facts are alleged the act of him by whom such false allegations are made not only ought to be regarded as pernicious but ought to be and is consistently with justice and utility punishable—punishable even when advanced through temerity without consciousness of the falsity and more so when accompanied with such dishonest consciousness but by a sort of law of which the protection of highseated official delinquency is at least the effect not to say the object a distinction thus obvious as well as important has been carefully overlooked and whenever to the prejudice of the reputation of a man especially if he be a man in office a fact which has with more or less confidence been asserted or insinuated turns out to be false     the existence of dishonest consciousness whether really existing or not is assumed in so far as public men trustees and agents for the people in possession or expectancy are the objects a general propensity to scrutinize into their conduct and thereby to cast imputations on it at the hazard of their being more or less unmerited is a useful propensity—it is conducive to good behaviour on their part and for the opposite and corresponding reason the habit of general laudation—laudation without specific grounds—is a mischievous propensity being conducive to ill behaviour on their part render all such endeavours hopeless you take from a bad state of things all chance of being better allow to all such endeavours the freest range you do no injury to the best state of things imaginable whatsoever facilities the adversaries of the existing state of things have for lowering it in the estimation of the people equal facilities at least if not greater have its friends and supporters for keeping and raising it up under the english constitution at any rate the most strenuous defenders of the existing set of managing hands as well as of the existing system of management are not backward in representing an opposition as being no less necessary a power among the springs of government than the regulator in a watch but in what way is it that opposition be it what it may ever acts or ever can act but by endeavouring to lower either the managing hands or in this or that part of it the system of management in the estimation of the people and from a watchmakers putting a regulating spring into the watch he is making it would be just as reasonable and fair to infer that his meaning is to destroy the watch as from the circumstance of a man seeking in this or that instance to lower in the estimation of the people the managing hands or this or that part of the system of management to infer a desire on his part to destroy the government under the english constitution at least not only in point of fact is the disposition to pay that obedience by which the power of government is constituted and on which the existence of it depends independent of all esteem for the hands by which this power is exercised unaffected by any disesteem for this or that part of the system of management according to which it is executed but under such a constitution at least the more complete this independence the better for the stability and prosperity of the state being as it is it suffices for carrying on at all times the business of government viz upon that footing in point of skill and prosperity which is consistent with the aptitude probity and intelligence of the managing hands and the goodness of the system of management under which they act but if on each occasion it depended on the degree of estimation in which the conduct and character of the managing hands and the structure of the system of management under which they act happened at that time to be held by the majority of the people this power would be seen strong and perhaps too strong at one time weak to any degree of weakness—insufficient to any degree of insufficiency—at another among the peculiar excellencies of the english constitution one is that the existence of the government and even the good conduct of it depends in a less degree than under any other monarchy upon the personal qualifications of the chief ruler and upon the place he occupies in the estimation of the people conceive the character of the chief ruler perfect to a certain degree of perfection all checks upon his power would be a nuisance on the other hand under a constitution of government into which checks upon that power are admitted the stronger and more efficient those checks the worse the personal character of the chief ruler may be and the business of government still go on without any fatal disturbance on recent occasions as if the endeavour had been new and altogether anomalous to the constitution great were the outcries against the audacity of those parliamentary electors and other members of the community who in the character of petitioners were using their endeavours to lower the house of commons in the estimation of the people or in stronger terms to bring it and its authority into contempt that by the individuals in question an endeavour of this nature should be regarded as a cause of personal inconvenience and as such be resisted is natural enough but as to its being on the part of the authors of those exertions blameable—or on the part of the constitution dangerous—surely no further observation need here be added but what was complained of as an abuse was the existence of that state of things—of that system of management under which in a number sufficient on ordinary occasions to constitute or secure a majority the members of that governing body have a sinister interest separate from and opposite to that of the people for whom they profess to serve that being independent as towards those to whom they ought to be dependent as to those whom it is their duty to controul and towards whom they ought to be independent they are dependent and that by means by which though altogether out of the reach of punishment the dependence is rendered beyond comparison more constant and effectual than it would be by acts of punishable bribery     in this state of things if any alteration in it be desirable it is impossible that such alteration should be brought about by other means than lowering in the estimation of the people not only the system itself but all those who act willingly under it and use their endeavours to uphold it without this means and by any other means how is it that by possibility any such change should be produced supposing them assured of possessing in the event of a refusal of all such change as high a place in the estimation of the people as they hold at present anything done by them in furtherance of such a change would be an effect without a cause in their personal capacities they have all or most of them little to gain while they have much to lose by any proposed change true it may be said—to be remedied an imperfection be it what it may must be pointed out but what we complain of as dangerous to government is not the indication of such imperfections with their supposed remedies but the mode in which they are apt to be pointed out—the heat the violence with which such indication is accompanied this we object to not merely as dishonest but as unwise—as tending to irritate the very persons at whose hands the remedy thus pleaded for is sought to this the answer is as follows—   whatsoever may be the terms most decorous and upon the supposition the best adapted to the obtaining of the relief desired it is not possible to comprise them in any such scheme of description as will enable a man to satisfy himself beforehand what terms will be considered exposed to what exempt from censure   the cause of irritation is not so properly in the terms of the application as in the substance and nature of the application itself so that the greatest irritation would be produced by that mode of application whichever it were that appeared most likely to produce the effect in question—the effect the production of which is on the one part an object of desire on the other of aversion the least irritation by that which in whatever terms couched afforded the fairest pretence for noncompliance   the imperfection in question being by the supposition one of a public nature the advantages of which are enjoyed by a few while the interest which the many each taken individually have in the removal of the imperfection is commonly comparatively small and remote no little difficulty is commonly experienced by any one whose endeavour it should be to persuade the many to collect amongst them a degree of impressive force sufficient to operate upon the ruling powers with effect on the part of the many the natural interest being in each case commonly but weak it requires to bring it into effective action whatsoever aids can be afforded it strong arguments how strong soever will of themselves be scarcely sufficient for at the utmost they can amount to no more than the indication of that interest which in the case of the greater part of the many whose force it is necessary to bring to bear upon the point in question is by the supposition but weak in aid of the utmost strength of which the argument is susceptible strength of expression will therefore be necessary or at least naturally and generally regarded as necessary and as such employed but in proportion as this strength of expression is employed the mode of application stands exposed to the imputation of that heat and violence and acrimony the use of which it is the object of the alleged fallacy to prevent   it is only on the supposition of its being in effect and being felt to be conducive or at least not repugnant to the interest of the ruling powers addressed that the simple statement of the considerations which in the character of reasons prove the existence of the supposed imperfection and if a remedy be proposed the aptitude of the proposed remedy can with reason be expected to operate on them with effect but the fact is that on the part of those ruling powers this sort of repugnance in a degree more or less considerable is no other than what on every such occasion ought in reason to be expected if the imperfection in question be of the nature of those to which the term abuse is wont to be applied these ruling powers have some or all of them by the supposition a special profit arising out of that abuse—a special interest consequently in the preservation and defence of it even if there be no such special interest there exists in that quarter at all times and in more shapes than one a general and constant interest by which they are rendered mutually averse to applications of that nature in the first place in addition to their ordinary labours they find themselves called upon to undertake a course of extraordinary labour which it was not their design to undertake and for which it may happen to some or all of them to feel themselves but indifferently prepared and qualified and thus the application itself finds it self opposed by the interest of their case in the next place to the extent of the task thus imposed upon them they find the business of government taken out of their hands to that same extent their conduct is determined by a will which originated not among themselves and if the measure being carried into effect the promoters of it would obtain reputation respect and affection—of those rewards a share more or less considerable     falls into other hands and thus the application in question finds an opponent in the interest of their pride chapter v accusationscarers device—ad metum infamy must attach somewhere exposition—this fallacy consists in representing the imputation of purposed calumny as necessarily and justly attaching upon him who having made a charge of misconduct against any person or persons possessed of political power or influence fails of producing evidence sufficient for conviction its manifest object accordingly is as far as possible to secure impunity to crimes and transgressions in every shape on the part of persons so situated viz by throwing impediments in the way of accusation and in particular by holding out to the eyes of those persons who have in view the undertaking the functions of accusers in case of failure in addition to disappointment the prospect of disgrace exposure—infamy must attach somewhere to this effect was a dictum ascribed in the debates to the right honourable george canning on the occasion of the inquiry into the conduct of the duke of york in his office of commanderinchief in principle insinuation to this effect has an unlimited application it applies not only to all charges against persons possessed of political power but with more or less force to all criminal charges in form of law against any persons whatsoever and not only to all charges in a prosecution of the criminal cast but to the litigants on both sides of the cause in a case of a purely nonpenal or as it is called a civil nature if taken as a general proposition applying to all public accusations nothing can be more mischievous as well as fallacious supposing the charge unfounded the delivery of it may have been accompanied with mâla fides consciousness of its injustice temerity only or it may have been perfectly blameless it is in the first case alone that infamy can with propriety attach upon him who brings it forward a charge really groundless may have been honestly believed to be well founded i e believed with a sort of provisional credence sufficient for the purpose of engaging a man to do his part towards the bringing about an investigation but without sufficient reasons but a charge may be perfectly groundless without attaching the smallest particle of blame upon him who brings it forward suppose him to have heard from one or more presenting themselves to him in the character of percipient witnesses a story which either in toto or perhaps only in circumstances though in circumstances of the most material importance should prove false and mendacious—how is the person who hears this and acts accordingly to blame what sagacity can enable a man previously to legal investigation—a man who has no power that can enable him to insure correctness or completeness on the part of this extrajudicial testimony—to guard against deception in such a case mrs c states to the accuser that the duke of york knew of the business stating a conversation as having passed between him and herself on the occasion all this suppose is perfectly false but the falsity of it how was it possible for one in the accusers situation to be apprised of the tendency of this fallacy is by intimidation to prevent all true charges whatever from being made—to secure impunity to delinquency in every shape but the conclusion that because the discourse of a witness is false in one particular or on one occasion it must therefore be false in toto—in particular that because it is false in respect of some fact or circumstance spoken to on some extrajudicial occasion it is therefore not credible on the occasion of a judicial examination—is a conclusion quite unwarranted if this argument were consistently and uniformly applied no evidence at all ought ever to be received or at least to be credited for where was ever the human being of full age by whom the exact line of truth had never been in any instance departed from in the whole course of his life the fallacy consists not in the bringing to view as lessening the credit due to the testimony of the witness this or that instance of falsehood as indicated by inconsistency or counterevidence but in speaking of them as conclusive and as warranting the turning a deaf ear to everything else the witness has said or if suffered might have said under the pressure of some strong and manifest falsehoodexciting interest suppose falsehood has been uttered by the witness be it so does it follow that falsehood will on every occasion—will on the particular occasion in question—be uttered by him without any such excitement under the pressure of terror the apostle peter when questioned whether he were one of the adherents of jesus who at that time was in the situation of a prisoner just arrested on a capital charge—denied his being so and in so doing uttered a wilful falsehood and this falsehood he thrice repeated within a short time—does it follow that the testimony of the apostle ought not on any occasion to have been considered as capable of being true if any such rule were consistently pursued what judge who had ever acted in the profession   0 of an advocate could with propriety be received in the character of a witness again with respect to the object of the charge so far from receiving less countenance where the object is a public than where he is a private man accusation whether it be at the bar of an official judicatory or at the bar of the public at large ought to receive beyond comparison more countenance in case of the truth of the accusation the mischief is greater—the demand for appropriate censure as a check to it correspondently greater on the other hand in case of nondelinquency the mischief to the groundlesslyaccused individual is less power in whatever hands lodged is almost sure to be more or less abused the check in all its shapes so as it does not defeat the good purposes for which the power has been given or suffered to be exercised can never be too strong that against a man who by the supposition has done nothing wrong it is not desirable whether his situation be public or private that accusation should have been preferred—that he should have been subjected to the danger and alarm and evil in other shapes attached to it is almost too plainly true to be worth saying but in the case of a public accusation though by the supposition it turns out to be groundless it is not altogether without its use—the evil produced is not altogether without compensation for by the alarm it keeps up in the breasts in which a disposition to delinquency has place such accusation acts as a check upon it and contributes to the prevention or repression of it on the other hand in the situation of the public man the mischief in the case of his having been the object of an unfounded accusation is less as we have shown in the preceding chapter than in the case of a private man in the advantages that are attached to his situation he possesses a fund of compensation which by the supposition has no place in the other case and apprised as he ought to be and but for his own fault is of the enmity and envy to which according to the nature of it his situation exposes him and not the private man he ought to be and but for his own fault will be proportionably prepared to expect it and less sensibly affected by it when it comes part iii fallacies of delay the subjectmatter of which is delay in various shapes—and the object to postpone discussion with a view of eluding it chapter i the quietist or no complaint—ad quietem exposition—a new law or measure being proposed in the character of a remedy for some incontestable abuse or evil an objection is frequently started to the following effect—the measure is unnecessary nobody complains of disorder in that shape in which it is the aim of your measure to propose a remedy to it even when no cause of complaint has been found to exist especially under governments which admit of complaints men have in general not been slow to complain much less where any just cause of complaint has existed the argument amounts to this—nobody complains therefore nobody suffers it amounts to a veto on all measures of precaution or prevention and goes to establish a maxim in legislation directly opposed to the most ordinary prudence of common life—it enjoins us to build no parapets to a bridge till the number of accidents has raised an universal clamour exposure—the argument would have more plausibility than it has if there were any chance of complaints being attended to—if the silence of those who suffer did not arise from despair occasioned by seeing the fruitlessness of former complaints the expense and vexation of collecting and addressing complaints to parliament being great and certain complaint will not commonly be made without adequate expectation of relief but how can any such expectation be entertained by any one who is in the slightest degree acquainted with the present constitution of parliament members who are independent of and irresponsible to the people can have very few and very slight motives for attending to complaints the redress of which would affect their own sinister interests again how many complaints are repressed by the fear of attacking powerful individuals and incurring resentments which may prove fatal to the complainant the most galling and the most oppressive of all grievances is that complicated mass of evil which is composed of the uncertainty delay expense and vexation in the administration of justice of this all but a comparatively minute proportion is clearly factitious—factitious     as being the work originally and in its foundation of the man of law latterly and in respect of a part of its superstructure of the man of finance in extent it is such that of the whole population there exists not an individual who is not every moment of his life exposed to suffer under it and few advanced in life who in some shape or other have not actually been sufferers from it by the price that has been put upon justice or what goes by the name of justice a vast majority of the people to some such amount as   0ths or    0ths are bereft altogether of the ability of putting in for a chance for it and to those to whom instead of being utterly denied this sort of chance is sold it is sold at such a price as to the poorest of such as have it still in their power to pay the price is utter ruin—and even to the richest matter of serious and sensible inconvenience in comparison of this one scourge all other political scourges put together are feathers and in so far as it has the operations of the man of finance for its cause if instead of onetenth upon income a property tax amounted to ninetenths still an addition to the property tax would in comparison of the affliction produced by the sum assessed on lawproceedings be a relief for the incometax falls upon none but the comparatively prosperous and increases in proportion to the prosperity—in proportion to the ability to sustain it whereas the tax upon lawproceedings falls exclusively upon those whom it finds labouring under affliction—under that sort of affliction which so long as it lasts operates as a perpetual blister on the mind here then is matter of complaint for every british subject that breathes—here injustice oppression and distress are all extreme complaint there is none why because by unity of sinister interest and consequent confederacy between lawyer and financier relief is rendered hopeless chapter ii fallacy of false consolation—ad quietem exposition—a measure having for its object the removal of some abuse i e of some practice the result of which is on the part of the many a mass of suffering more than equivalent to the harvest of enjoyment reaped from it by the few being proposed—this argument consists in pointing to the general condition of the people in this or that other country under the notion that in that other country either in the particular respect in question or upon the whole the condition of the people is not so felicitous as notwithstanding the abuse it is in the country in and for which the measure of reform is proposed what is the matter with you what would you have look at the people there and there think how much better off you are than they are your prosperity and liberty are objects of envy to them—your institutions are the models which they endeavour to imitate assuredly it is not to the disposition to keep an eye of preference turned to the bright side of things where no prospect of special good suggests the opposite course—it is not to such a disposition or such a habit that by the word fallacy it is proposed to affix a mark of disapprobation when a particular suffering produced as it appears by an assignable and assigned cause has been pointed out as existing a man instead of attending to it himself or inviting to it the attention of others employs his exertions in the endeavour to engage other eyes to turn themselves to any other quarter in preference he being of the number of those whose acknowledged duty it is to contribute their best endeavours to the affording to every affliction within their view whatsoever relief may be capable of being afforded to it without preponderant inconvenience—then and then only is it that the endeavour becomes a just ground for censure and the means thus employed present a title to be received upon the list of fallacies exposure—the pravity as well as fallaciousness of this argument can scarcely be exhibited in a stronger or truer light than by the appellation here employed to characterize it   like all other fallacies upon this list it is nothing to the purpose   in his own case no individual in his senses would accept it take any one of the orators by whom this argument is tendered or of the sages on whom it passes for sterling with an observation of the general wealth and prosperity of the country in his mouth instead of a halfyears rent in his hand let any one of his tenants propose to pay him thus in his own coin—will he accept it   in a court of justice in an action for damages—to learned ingenuity did ever any such device occur as that of pleading assets in the hand of a third person or in the hands of the whole country in bar to the demand what the largest wholesale trade is to the smallest retail such and more in point of magnitude is the relief commonly sought for at the hands of the legislator to the relief commonly sought for at the hands of the judge—what the largest wholesale trade is to the smallest retail trade such in point of magnitude yea and more is the injustice endeavoured at by this argument when employed in the seat of legislative power in     comparison of the injustice that would be committed by deciding in conformity to it in a court of justice no country so wretched so poor in every element of prosperity in which matter for this argument might not be found were the prosperity of the country ever so much greater than at present—take for the country any country whatsoever and for present time any time whatsoever—neither the injustice of the argument nor the absurdity of it would in any the smallest degree be diminished seriously and pointedly in the character of a bar to any measure of relief—no nor to the most trivial improvement can it ever be employed suppose a bill brought in for converting an impassable road anywhere into a passable one would any man stand up to oppose it who could find nothing better to urge against it than the multitude and goodness of the roads we have already no when in the character of a serious bar to the measure in hand be that measure what it may an argument so palpably inapplicable is employed it can only be for the purpose of creating a diversion—of turning aside the minds of men from the subject really in hand to a picture which by its beauty it is hoped may engross the attention of the assembly and make them forget for the moment for what purpose they came there chapter iii procrastinators argument ad socordiam wait a little this is not the time exposition—to the instrument of deception here brought to view the expressions that may be given are various to an indefinite degree but in its nature and conception nothing can be more simple to this head belongs every form of words by which speaking of a proposed measure of relief an intimation is given that the time whatever it be at which the proposal is made is too early for the purpose and given without any proof being offered of the truth of such intimation—such as for instance the want of requisite information or the convenience of some preparatory measure exposure—this is the sort of argument or observation which we so often see employed by those who being in wish and endeavour hostile to a measure are afraid or ashamed of being seen to be so they pretend perhaps to approve of the measure—they only differ as to the proper time of bringing it forward but it may be matter of question whether in any one instance this observation has been applied to a measure by a man whose wish it was not that it should remain excluded for ever it is in legislation the same sort of quirk which in judicial procedure is called a plea in abatement it has the same object being never employed but on the side of a dishonest defendant whose hope it is to obtain ultimate impunity and triumph by overwhelming his injured adversary with despair impoverishment and lassitude a serious refutation would be ill bestowed upon so frivolous a pretence the objection exists in the will not in the judgment of the objector is it lawful to do good on the sabbath day was the question put by jesus to the official hypocrites which is the properest day to do good—which is the properest day to remove a nuisance answer the very first day that a man can be found to propose the removal of it and whosoever opposes the removal of it on that day will if he dare oppose the removal on every other the doubts and fears of the parliamentary procrastinator are the conscientious scruples of his prototype the pharisece and neither the answer nor the example of jesus has succeeded in removing these scruples to him whatsoever is too soon today be assured that tomorrow if not too soon it will be too late true it is that the measure being a measure of reform or improvement an observation to this effect may be brought forward by a friend to the measure and in this case it is not an instrument of deception but an expedient of unhappily necessary prudence whatsoever it may be some centuries hence hitherto the fault of the people has been not groundless clamour against imaginary grievances but insensibility to real ones—insensibility not to the effect—the evil itself for that if it were possible far from being a fault would be a happiness—but to the cause—to the system or course of misrule which is the cause of it what therefore may but too easily be—what hitherto ever has been—the fact and that throughout a vast proportion of the field of legislation is that in regard to the grievances complained of the time for bringing forward a measure of effectual relief is not yet come why because though groaning under the effect the people by the artifice and hypocrisy of their oppressors having been prevented from entertaining any tolerably adequate conception of the cause would at that time regard either with indifference or with suspicion the healing hand that should come forward with the only true and effectual remedy thus it is for example with that pandoras box of grievances and misery the contents of which are composed of the evils opposite to the ends of justice     chapter iv snailspace argument—ad socordiam one thing at a time not too fast slow and sure exposition—the proposed measure being a measure of reform requiring that for the completion of the beneficial work in question a number of operations be performed capable all or some of them of being carried on at the same time or successively without intervals or at short intervals the instrument of deception here in question consists in holding up to view the idea of graduality or slowness as characteristic of the course which wisdom would dictate on the occasion in question for more effectual recommendation of this course to the epithet gradual are commonly added some such eulogistic epithets as moderate and temperate whereby it is implied that in proportion as the pace recommended by the word gradual is quickened such increased pace will justly incur the censure expressed by the opposite epithets immoderate violent precipitate extravagant intemperate exposure—this is neither more nor less than a contrivance for making out of a mere word an excuse for leaving undone an indefinite multitude of things which the arguer is convinced and cannot forbear acknowledging ought to be done suppose half a dozen abuses which equally and with equal promptitude stand in need of reform—this fallacy requires that without any reason that can be assigned other than what is contained in the pronouncing or writing of the word gradual all but one or two of them shall remain untouched or what is better suppose that to the effectual correction of some one of these abuses six operations require to be performed—six operations all of which must be done ere the correction can be effected—to save the reform from the reproach of being violent and intemperate to secure to it the praise of graduality moderation and temperance you insist that of these halfadozen necessary operations some one or some two only shall be talked of and proposed to be done—one by one bill to be introduced this session if it be not too late which you contrive it shall be another the next session which time being come nothing more is to be said about the matter—and there it ends for this abandonment no one reason that will bear looking at can be numbered up in the instance of any one of the five measures endeavoured to be laid upon the shelf for if it could that would be the reason assigned for the relinquishment and not this unmeaning assemblage of three syllables a suit which to do full justice to it requires but six weeks or six days or six minutes in one day—has it been made to last six years that your caution and your wisdom may not be questioned by a first experiment reduce the time to five years then if that succeeds in another parliament should another parliament be in a humour which it is hoped it will not reduce it to four years then again to three years and if it should be the lot of your grandchildren to see it reduced to two years they may think themselves well off and admire your prudence justice—to which in every eye but that of the plunderer and oppressor rich and poor have an equal right—do ninetenths of the people stand excluded from all hope of by the load of expense that has been heaped up you propose to reduce this expense the extent of the evil is admitted and the nature of the remedy cannot admit of doubt but by the magic of the three syllables gradual you will limit the remedy to the reduction of about onetenth of the expense some time afterwards you may reduce another tenth and go on so that in about two centuries justice may perhaps become generally accessible importance of the business—extreme difficulty of the business—danger of innovation—need of caution and circumspection—impossibility of foreseeing all consequences—danger of precipitation—everything should be gradual—one thing at a time—this is not the time—great occupation at present—wait for more leisure—people well satisfied—no petitions presented—no complaints heard—no such mischief has yet taken place—stay till it has taken place—such is the prattle which the magpie in office who understanding nothing understands that he must have something to say on every subject shouts out among his auditors as a succedaneum to thought transfer the scene to domestic life and suppose a man who his fortune not enabling him without running into debt to keep one racehorse has been for some time in the habit of keeping six to transfer to this private theatre the wisdom and the benefit of the gradual system what you would have to recommend to your friend would be something of this sort—spend the first year in considering which of your six horses to give up the next year if you can satisfy yourself which it shall be give up some one of them by this sacrifice the sincerity of your intention and your reputation for economy will be established which done you need think no more about the matter as all psychological ideas have their necessary root in physical ones one source of delusion in psychological arguments consists in giving an improper extension to some me taphor which has been made choice of     it would be a service done to the cause of truth if some advocate for the gradual system would let us into the secret of the metaphor or physical image if any which he has in view and in the same language give us the idea of some physical disaster as the result of precipitation a patient killed by rapid bleeding—a chariot dashed in pieces by runaway steeds—a vessel overset by carrying too much sail in a squall—all these images suppose a degree of precipitation which if pursued by the proposers of a political measure would be at once apparent and the obvious and assignable consequence of their course would afford unanswerable arguments against them all this while though by a friend to the measure no such word as above will be employed in the character of argument yet cases are not wanting in which the dilatory course recommended may be consented to or even proposed by him suppose a dozen distinct abuses in the seat of legislative power each abuse having a set of members interested in the support of it—attack the whole body at once all these parties join together to a certainty and oppose you with their united force attack the abuses one by one and it is possible that you may have but one of these parties or at least less than all of them to cope with at a time possible yes but of probability little can be said to each branch of the public service belongs a class of public servants each of which has its sinister interest the source of the mass of abuses on which it feeds and in the person and power of the universal patron the fountain of all honour and of all abuse all those sinister interests are joined and embodied into one this is a branch of science in which no man is ever deficient this is what is understood—understood to perfection by him to whom nothing else ever was or can be clear—hoc discunt omnes unto alpha et beta puelli if there be a case in which such graduality as is here described can have been consented to and with a reasonable prospect of advantage it must have been a case in which without such consent the whole business would be hopeless under the existing system by which the door of the theatre of legislation is opened by opulence to members in whose instance application of the faculty of thought to the business about which they are supposed to occupy themselves would have been an effect without a cause so gross is the ignorance and in consequence even where good intention is not altogether wanting so extreme the timidity and apprehension that on their part without assurance of extreme slowness no concurrence to a proposal for setting one foot before another at even the slowest pace would be obtained at all their pace the only pace at which they can be persuaded to move is that which the traveller would take whose lot it should be to be travelling in a pitchdark night over a road broken and slippery edged with precipices on each side time is requisite for quieting timidity why because time is requisite for instructing ignorance lawyers their interest in the employment of this fallacy in proportion to the magnitude of their respective shares in the general fund of abuse the various fraternities interested in the support of abuses have each of them their interest in turning to the best account this as well as every other article in the list of fallacies but it is the fraternity of lawyers who if they have not decidedly the most to gain by the dexterous management of this or of other fallacies have from the greatest quantity of practice derived the greatest degree of dexterity in the management of it judicature requiring reflection and the greater the complication of the case the greater the degree and length of reflection which the case requires under favour of this association they have succeeded in establishing a general impression of a sort of proportion in quantity as well as necessity of connexion between delay and attention to justice not that in fact a hundredth part of the established delay has had any origin in a regard for justice but—for want of sufficient insight into that state of things by which in persons so circumstanced in power and interest the general prevalence of any such regard has been rendered physically impossible—in his endeavours to propagate the notion of a sort of general proportion between delay and regard for justice the man of law has unhappily been but too successful and it is perhaps to this error in respect to matters of fact that the snailspace fallacy is indebted more than to any other cause for its dupes be this as it may sure it is that in no track of reform has the rate of progress which it is the object of this fallacy to secure been adhered to with greater effect by the statutebook if run over and little more than the titles would be necessary in this view a curious exemplification of the truth of this observation is afforded an abuse so monstrons that on the part of the judicial hands by which it was manufactured the slightest doubt of the mischievousness of it was absolutely impossible—generation after generation groaning under this abuse—and at length when by causes kept of course as much as possible out of sight the support of the abuse has been deemed no longer practicable     comes at length a remedy and what remedy never anything better than a feeble pailiative chapter v fallacy of artful diversion—ad verecundiam exposition and exposure—the device here in question may be explained by the following direction or receipt for the manufacture and application of it— when any measure is proposed which on any account whatsoever it suits your interest or your humour to oppose at the same time that in consideration of its undeniable utility or on any other account you regard it unadvisable to pass direct condemnation on it—hold up to view some other measure such as whether it bear any relation or none to the measure on the carpet will in the conception of your hearers present itself as superior in the order of importance your language then is—why that meaning the measure already proposed—why not this or this mentioning some other which it is your hope to render more acceptable and by means of it to create a diversion and turn aside from the obnoxious measure the affections and attention of those whom you have to deal with one case there is in which the appellation of fallacy cannot with justice be applied to this argument and that is where the effectuation or pursuit of the measure first proposed would operate as a bar or an obstacle to some other measure of a more beneficial character held up to view by the argument as competitor with it and what in the way of exposure will be said of the sort of expedient just described will not apply to this case however where the measure first proposed is of unquestionable utility and you oppose it merely because it is adverse to your own sinister interest you must not suggest any relevant measure of reform in lieu of it except in a case in which in the shape of argument every mode of opposition is considered as hopeless for unless for the purpose of forestalling the time and attention that would be necessary to the effectuation of the proposed beneficial measure a measure altogether irrelevant and foreign to it is set up a risk is incurred that something however inferior in degree may be effected towards the diminution of the abuse or imperfection in question in the character of an irrelevant countermeasure any measure or accidental business whatever may be made to serve so long as it can be made to preoccupy a sufficient portion of the disposable time and attention of the public men on whose suffrages the effectuation or frustration of the measure depends but supposing the necessity for a relevant countermeasure to exist and that you have accordingly given introduction to it the first thing then to be done is to stave off the undesirable moment of its effectuation as long as possible according to established usage you have given notice of your intention to propose a measure on the subject and to the effect in question the intention is of too great importance to be framed and carried into act in the compass of the same year or session you accordingly announce your intention for next session when the next session comes the measure is of too great importance to be brought on the carpet at the commencement of the session at that period it is not yet mature enough if it be not advisable to delay it any longer you oring it forward just as the session closes time is thus gained and without any decided loss in the shape of reputation for what you undertook has to the letter been performed when the measure has been once brought in you have to take your choice in the first place between operations for delay and operations for rejection operations for delay exhibit a manifest title to preference so long as their effect can be made to last they accomplish their object and no sacrifice either of design or of reputation has been made the extreme importance and extreme difficulty are themes on which you blow the trumpet and which you need not fear the not hearing sufficiently echoed when the treasury of delay has been exhausted you have your choice to take between trusting to the chapter of accidents for the defeat of the measure or endeavouring to engage some friend to oppose it and propose the rejection of it but you must be unfortunate indeed if you can find no opponents no tolerably plausible opponents unless among friends and friends specially commissioned for the purpose a sort of confidence more or less dangerous must in that case be reposed upon the whole you must however be singularly unfortunate or unskilful if by the countermeasure of diversion any considerable reduction of the abuse or imperfection be spite of your utmost endeavours effected or any share of reputation that you need care about sacrificed     part iv fallacies of confusion the object of which is to perplex when discussion can no longer be avoided chapter i questionbegging appellatives—ad judicium petitio principii or begging the question is a fallacy very well known even to those who are not conversant with the principles of logic in answer to a given question the party who employs the fallacy contents himself by simply affirming the point in debate why does opium occasion sleep because it is soporiferous begging the question is one of the fallacies enumerated by aristotle but aristotle has not pointed out what it will be the object of this chapter to expose the mode of using the fallacy with the greatest effect and least risk of detection—namely by the employment of a single appellative exposition and exposure—among the appellatives employed for the designation of objects belonging to the field of moral science there are some by which the object is presented singly unaccompanied by any sentiment of approbation or disapprobation attached to it—as desire labour disposition character habit c with reference to the two sorts of appellatives which will come immediately to be mentioned appellatives of this sort may be termed neutral there are others by means of which in addition to the principal object the idea of general approbation as habitually attached to that object is presented—as industry honour piety generosity gratitude c these are termed eulogistic or laudatory others there are again by means of which in addition to the principal object the idea of general disapprobation as habitually attached to that object is presented—as lust avarice luxury covetousness prodigality c these may be termed dyslogistic or vituperative among pains pleasures desires emotions motives affections propensities dispositions and other moral entities some but very far from all are furnished with appellatives of all three sorts—some with none but eulogistic others and in a greater number with none but those of the dyslogistic cast by appellatives i mean here of course singleworded appellatives for by words take but enough of them anything may be expressed originally all terms expressive of any of these objects were it seems reasonable to think neutral by degrees they acquired some of them an eulogistic some a dyslogistic cast this change extended itself as the moral sense if so loose and delusive a term may on this occasion be employed advanced in growth but to return as to the mode of employing this fallacy it neither requires nor so much as admits of being taught a man falls into it but too naturally of himself and the more naturally and freely the less he finds himself under the restraint of any such sense as that of shame the great difficulty is to unlearn it in the case of this as of so many other fallacies by teaching it the humble endeavour here is to unteach it in speaking of the conduct the behaviour the intention the motive the disposition of this or that man—if he be one who is indifferent to you of whom you care not whether he be well or ill thought of you employ the neutral term—if a man whom on the occasion and for the purpose in question it is your object to recommend to favour especially a man of your own party you employ the eulogistic term—if he be a man whom it is your object to consign to aversion or contempt you employ the dyslogistic term to the proposition of which it is the leading term every such eulogistic or dyslogistic appellative secretly as it were and in general insensibly slips in another proposition of which that same leading term is the subject and an assertion of approbation or disapprobation the predicate the person act or thing in question is or deserves to be or is and deserves to be an object of general approbation or the person act or thing in question is or deserves to be or is and deserves to be an object of general disapprobation the proposition thus asserted is commonly a proposition that requires to be proved but in the case where the use of the term thus employed is fallacious the proposition is one     that is not true and cannot be proved and where the person by whom the fallacy is employed is conscious of its deceptive tendency the object in the employment thus given to the appellative is by means of the artifice to cause that to be taken for true which is not so by appropriate eulogistic and dyslogistic terms so many arguments are made by which taking them altogether misrule in all its several departments finds its justifying arguments and these in but too many eyes conclusive take for instance the following eulogistic terms—   in the war department—honour and glory   in international affairs—honour glory and dignity   in the financial department liberality it being always at the expense of unwilling contributors that this virtue for among the virtues it has its place in aristotle is exercised—for liberality depredation may in perhaps every case and without any impropriety be substituted   in the higher parts of all official departments dignity—dignity though not in itself depredation operates as often as the word is used as a pretence for and thence as a cause of depredation wherever you see dignity be sure that money is requisite for the support of it and that in so far as the dignitarys own money is regarded as insufficient public money raised by taxes imposed on all other individuals on the principle of liberality must be found for the supply of it exercised at a mans own expense liberality may be or may not be according to circumstances a virtue—exercised at the expense of the public it never can be anything better than vice exercised at a mans own expense whether it be accompanied with prudence or no—whether it be accompanied or not with beneficence it is at any rate disinterestedness—exercised at the expense of the public it is pure selfishness it is in a word depredation money or moneys worth is taken from the public to purchase for the use of the liberal man respect affection gratitude with its eventual fruits in the shape of services of all sorts—in a word reputation power when you have a practice or measure to condemn find out some more general appellative within the import of which the obnoxious practice or measure in question cannot be denied to be included and to which you or those whose interests and prejudices you have espoused have contrived to annex a certain degree of unpopularity in so much that the name of it has contracted a dyslogistic quality—has become a bad name take for example improvement and innovation under its own name to pass censure on any improvement might be too bold applied to such an object any expressions of censure you could employ might lose their force employing them you would seem to be running on in the track of selfcontradiction and nonsense but improvement means something new and so does innovation happily for your purpose innovation has contracted a bad sense it means something which is new and bad at the same time improvement it is true in indicating something new indicates something good at the same time and therefore if the thing in question be good as well as new innovation is not a proper term for it however as the idea of novelty was the only idea originally attached to the term innovation and the only one which is directly expressed in the etymology of it you may still venture to employ the word innovation since no man can readily and immediately convict your appellation of being an improper one upon the face of it with the appellation thus chosen for the purpose of passing condemnation on the measure he by whom it has been brought to view in the character of an improvement is not it is true very likely to be well satisfied but of this you could not have had any expectation what you want is a pretence which your own partisans can lay hold of for the purpose of deducing from it a colourable warrant for passing upon the improvement that censure which you are determined and they if not determined are disposed and intend to pass on it of this instrument of deception the potency is most deplorable it is but of late years that so much as the nature of it has in any way been laid before the public and now that it has been laid before the public the need there is of its being opposed with effect and the extreme difficulty of opposing it with effect are at the same time and in equal degree manifest in every part of the field of thought and discourse the effect of language depends upon the principle of association—upon the association formed between words and those ideas of which in that way they have become the signs but in no small part of the field of discourse one or other of the two censorial and reciprocally correspondent and opposite affections—the amicable and the hostile—that by which approbation and that by which disapprobation is expressed—are associated with the word in question by a tie little less strong than that by which the object in question be it person or thing—be the thing a real or fictitious entity—be it operation or quality is associated with that     same articulate audible sign and its visible representations to diminish the effect of this instrument of deception for to do it away completely to render all minds without exception at all times insensible to it seems scarcely possible must at any rate be a work of time but in proportion as its effect on the understanding and through that channel on the temper and conduct of mankind is diminished the good effect of the exposure will become manifest by such of these passionkindling appellatives as are of the eulogistic cast comparatively speaking no bad effect is produced but by those which are of the dyslogistic prodigious is the mischievous effect produced considered in a moral point of view by a single word or two of this complexion what hostility has been produced how intense the feeling of it how wide the range of it how full of mischief in all imaginable shapes the effects chapter ii impostor terms—ad judicium exposition—the fallacy which consists in the employment of impostor terms in some respects resembles that which has been exposed in the preceding chapter but it is applied chiefly to the defence of things which under their proper name are manifestly indefensible instead therefore of speaking of such things under their proper name the sophist has recourse to some appellative which along with the indefensible object includes some other—generally an object of favour or at once substitutes an object of approbation for an object of censure for instance persecutors in matters of religion have no such word as persecution in their vocabulary zeal is the word by which they characterize all their actions in the employment of this fallacy two things are requisite—   a fact or circumstance which under its proper name and seen in its true colours would be an object of censure and which therefore it is necessary to disguise—res tegenda   the appellative which the sophist employs to conceal what would be deemed offensive or even to bespeak a degree of favour for it by the aid of some happier accessary—tegumen† exposure—example influence of the crown—the sinister influence of the crown is an object which if expressed by any peculiar and distinctive appellation would comparatively speaking find perhaps but few defenders but which so long as no other denomination is employed for the designation of it than the generic term influence will rarety meet with indiscriminating reprobation corruption—the term which in the eyes of those to whom this species of influence is an object of disapprobation is the appropriate and only singleworded term capable of being     employed for the expression of it—is a term of the dyslogistic cast this then by any person whose meaning it is not to join in the condemnation passed on the practice or state of things which is designated is one that cannot possibly be employed in speaking of this practice and state of things he is therefore obliged to go upon the lookout and find some term which at the same time that its claim to the capacity of presenting to view the object in question cannot be contested shall be of the eulogistic or at least of the neutral cast and to one or other of these classes belongs the term influence under the term influence when the crown is considered as the possessor of it are included two species of influence the one of them such that the removal of it could not without an utter reprobation of the monarchical form of government be by any person considered as desirable nor without the utter destruction of monarchical government be considered as possible—the other such—that in the opinion of many persons the complete destruction or removal of it would if possible be desirable—and that though consistently with the continuance of the monarchical government the complete removal of it would not be practicable yet the diminution of it to such a degree as that the remainder should not be productive of any practically pernicious effects would not be impracticable influence of will on will—influence of understanding on understanding in this may be seen the distinction on which the utility or noxiousness of the sort of influence in question depends in the influence of understanding on understanding may be seen that influence to which by whomsoever exercised on whomsoever exercised and on what occasion soever exercised the freest range ought to be left—left although as for instance exercised by the crown and on the representatives of the people not that to this influence it may not happen to be productive of mischief to any amount but that because without this influence scarce any good could be accomplished and because when it is left free disorder cannot present itself without leaving the door open at least for the entrance of the remedy the influence of understanding on understanding is in a word no other than the influence of human reason—a guide which like other guides is liable to miss its way or dishonestly to recommend a wrong course but which is the only guide of which the nature of the case is susceptible under the british constitution to the crown belongs either the sole management or a principal and leading part of the management of the public business and it is only by the influence of understanding on understanding or by the influence of will on will that by any person or persons except by physical force immediately applied anything can be done to the execution of the ordinary mass of duties belonging to the crown the influence of will on will so long as the persons on whom it is exercised are the proper persons is necessary on all persons to whom it belongs to the crown to give orders this species of influence is necessary for it is only in virtue of this species of influence that orders considered as delivered from a superordinate to a subordinate—considered in a word as orders in contradistinction to mere suggestions or arguments operating by the influence of understanding on understanding—can be productive of any effect thus far then in the case of influence of will on will as well as in the case of influence of understanding on understanding no rational and consistent objection can be made to the use of influence in either case its title to the epithet legitimate influence is above dispute the case among others in which the title of the influence of the crown is open to dispute—the case in which the epithet sinister or any other mark of disapprobation may be bestowed upon it bestowed upon the bare possession and without need of reference to the particular use and application which on any particular occasion may happen to be made of it—is that where being of that sort which is exercised by will on will the person on whom on the occasion in question it is exercised is either a member of parliament or a person possessed of an electoral vote with reference to a seat in parliament the ground on which this species of influence thus exercised is by those by whom it is spoken of with disapprobation represented as sinister and deserving of that disapprobation is simply this—viz that in so far as this influence is efficient the will professed to be pronounced is not in truth the will of him whose will it professes to be but the will of him in whom the influence originates and from whom it proceeds in so much that if for example every member of parliament without exception were in each house under the dominion of the influence of the crown and in every individual instance that influence were effectual—the monarchy instead of being the limited sort of monarchy it professes to be would be in effect an absolute one—in form alone a limited one nor so much as in form a limited one any longer than it happened to be the pleasure of the monarch that it should continue to be so the functions attached to the situation of a member of parliament may be included most or all of them under three denominations—the legislative the judicial and the   0 inquisitorial the legislative in virtue of which in each house each member that pleases takes a part in the making of laws the judicial which whether penal cases or cases nonpenal be considered is not exercised to any considerable extent but by the house of lords and the inquisitorial the exercise of which is performed by an inquiry into facts with a view to the exercise either of legislative authority or of judicial authority or both whichever the case may be found to require to the exercise of either branch may be referred what is done when on the ground of some defect either in point of moral or intellectual fitness or both application is made by either house for the removal of any member or members of the executive branch of the official establishment—any servant or servants of the crown but for arguments sake suppose the abovementioned extreme case to be realized all these functions are equally nugatory whatever law is acceptable to the crown will be not only introduced but carried no law that is not acceptable to the crown will be so much as introduced every judgment that is acceptable to the crown will be pronounced no judgment that is not acceptable to the crown will be pronounced every inquiry that is acceptable to the crown will be made no inquiry that is not acceptable to the crown will be made and in particular let on the part of the servants of the crown any or all of them misconduct in every imaginable shape be ever so enormous no application that is not acceptable to the crown will ever be made for their removal that is no such application will ever be made at all for in this state of things supposing it in the instance of any servant of the crown to be the pleasure of the crown to remove him he will be removed of course nor can any such application be productive of anything better than needless loss of time raised to the pitch supposed in this extreme case there are not it is supposed many men in the country by whom the influence of the crown of that sort which is exercised by the will of the crown on the wills of members of parliament would not be really regarded as coming under the denomination of sinister influence not so much as a single one by whom its title to that denomination would be openly denied but among members of parliament many there are on whom beyond possibility of denial this sort of influence—influence of will on will—is exerted since no man can be in possession of any desirable situation from which he is removable without its being exerted on him say rather without its exerting itself on him for to the production of the full effect of influence no act no express intimation of will on the part of any person is in any such situation necessary here then comes the grand question in dispute in some opinions of that sort of influence of will on will exercising itself from the crown on a member of parliament or at any rate on a member of the house of commons composed of the elected representatives of the people not any the least particle is necessary—not any the least particle is in any way beneficial—not any the least particle in so far as it is operative can be other than pernicious in the language of those by whom this opinion is held every particle of such influence is sinister influence corrupt or corruptive influence or in one word corruption others there are in whose opinion or at any rate if not in their opinion in whose language of that influence thus actually exercising itself the whole or some part at any rate is not only innoxious but beneficial and not only beneficial but—to the maintenance of the constitution in a good and healthful state—absolutely necessary and to this number must naturally be supposed to belong all those on whom this obnoxious species of influence is actually exercising itself chapter iii vague generalities—ad judicium exposition—vague generalities comprehend a numerous class of fallacies resorted to by those who in preference to the most particular and determinate terms and expressions which the nature of the case in question admits of employ others more general and indeterminate as expression is vague and ambiguous when it designates by one and the same appellative an object which may be good or bad according to circumstances and if in the course of an inquiry touching the qualities of such an object such an expression is employed without a recognition of this distinction the expression operates as a fallacy take for instance the terms government laws morals religion the genus comprehended in each of these terms may be divided into two species—the good and bad for no one can deny that there have been and still are in the world bad governments bad laws bad systems of morals and bad religions the bare circumstance therefore of a mans attacking government or law morals or religion does not of itself afford the slightest presumption that he is engaged in anything blameable if his attack is only directed against that which is bad in each his efforts may be productive of good to any extent this essential distinction the defender of abuse takes care to keep out of sight and boldly imputes to his antagonist an intention to subvert all governments laws morals or religion     but it is in the way of insinuation rather than in the form of direct assertion that the argument is in this case most commonly brought to bear propose anything with a view to the improvement of the existing practice in relation to government at large to the law or to religion he will treat you with an oration on the utility and necessity of government of law or of religion to what end to the end that of your own accord you may draw the inference which it is his desire you should draw even that what is proposed has in its tendency something which is prejudicial to one or other or all of these objects of general regard of the truth of the intimation thus conveyed had it been made in the form of a direct assertion or averment some proof might naturally have been looked for by a direct assertion a sort of notice is given to the hearer or reader to prepare himself for something in the shape of proof but when nothing is asserted nothing is on the one hand offered nothing on the other expected to be proved   order exposure—among the several cloudy appellatives which have been commonly employed as cloaks for misgovernment there is none more conspicuous in this atmosphere of illusion than the word order the word order is in a peculiar degree adapted to the purpose of a cloak for tyranny—the word order is more extensive than law or even than government but what is still more material the word order is of the eulogistic cast whereas the words government and law howsoever the things signified may have been taken in the lump for subjects of praise the complexion of the signs themselves is still tolerably neutral just as is the case with the words constitution and institutions thus whether the measure or arrangement be a mere transitory measure or a permanent law—if it be a tyrannical one be it ever so tyrannical in the word order you have a term not only wide enough but in every respect better adapted than any other which the language can supply to serve as a cloak for it suppose any number of men by a speedy death or a lingering one destroyed for meeting one another for the purpose of obtaining a remedy for the abuses by which they are suffering—what nobody can deny is that by their destruction order is maintained for the worst order is as truly order as the best accordingly a clearance of this sort having been effected suppose in the house of commons a lord castlereagh or in the house of lords a lord sidmouth to stand up and insist that by a measure so undeniably prudential order was maintained with what truth could they be contradicted and who is there that would have the boldness to assert that order ought not to be maintained to the word order and the word good the strength of the checks if any there were that were thus applied to tyranny would be but little if at all increased by the word good no other idea is brought to view than that of the sentiment of approbation as attached by the person by whom it is employed to the object designated by the substantive to which this adjunct is applied order is any arrangement which exists with reference to the object in question—good order is that order be it what it may which it is my wish to be thought to approve of take the state of things under nero under caligula with as indisputable propriety might the word order be applied to it as to the state of things at present in great britain or the american united states what in the eyes of bonaparte was good order that which it had been his pleasure to establish by the adjunct social the subject order is perhaps rendered somewhat the less fit for the use of tyrants but not much among the purposes to which the word social is employed is indeed that of bringing to view a state of things favourable to the happiness of society but a purpose to which it is also employed is that of bringing to view a state of things no otherwise considered than as having place in society by the war which in the roman history bears the name of the social war no great addition to the happiness of society was ever supposed to be made yet it was not the less a social one as often as any measure is brought forward having for its object the making any the slightest defalcation from the amount of the sacrifice made of the interest of the many to the interest of the few social is the adjunct by which the order of things to which it is pronounced hostile is designated by a defalcation made from any part of the mass of factitious delay vexation and expense out of which and in proportion to which lawyers profit is made to flow—by any defalcation made from the mass of needless and worse than useless emolument to office with or without service or pretence of service—by any addition endeavoured to be made to the quantity or improvement in the quality of service rendered or time bestowed in service rendered in return for such emolument—by every endeavour that has for its object the persuading the people to place their fate at the disposal of any other agents than those in whose hands breach of trust is certain due fulfilment of it morally and physically impossible—social order is said to be endangered and threatened to be destroyed proportioned to the degree of clearness with which the only true and justifiable end     of government is held up to view in any discourse that meets the public eye is the danger and inconvenience to which those rulers are exposed who for their own particular interest have been engaged in an habitual departure from that only legitimate and defensible course hence it is that when compared with the words order maintenance of order the use even of such words as happiness welfare wellbeing is not altogether free from danger wideextending and comparatively indeterminate as the import of them is to the single word happiness substitute the phrase greatest happiness of the greatest number the description of the end becomes more determinate and even instructive the danger and inconvenience to misgovernment and its authors and its instruments still more alarming and distressing for then for a rule whereby to measure the goodness or badness of a government men are referred to so simple and universally apprehensible a standard as the numeration table by the pointing mens attentions to this end and the clearness of the light thus cast upon it the importance of such words as the word order which by their obscurity substitute to the offensive light the useful and agreeable darkness is more and more intimately felt   establishment in the same way again establishment is a word in use to protect the bad parts of establishments by charging those who wish to remove or alter them with the wish to subvert all establishments or all good establishments   matchless constitution the constitution has some good points it has some bad ones it gives facility and until reform—radical reform—shall have been accomplished security and continual increase to waste depredation oppression and corruption in every department and in every variety of shape now in their own name respectively waste depredation oppression corruption cannot be toasted gentlemen would not cry waste for ever depredation for ever oppression for ever corruption for ever but the constitution for ever this a man may cry and does cry and makes a merit of it of this instrument of rhetoric the use is at least as old as aristotle as old as aristotle is even the receipt for making it for aristotle has himself given it and of how much longer standing the use of it may have been may baffle the sagacity of a mitford to determine how sweet are gall and honey how white are soot and snow matchless constitution theres your sheetanchor theres your true standard—rally round the constitution—that is rally round waste rally round depredation rally round oppression rally round corruption rally round election terrorism rally round imposture—imposture on the hustings imposture in honourable house imposture in every judicatory connected with this toasting and this boasting is a theory such as a westminster or eton boy on the sixth form aye or his grandmother might be ashamed of for among those who are loudest in crying out theory as often as any attempt is made at reasoning any appeal made to the universally known and indisputable principles of human nature always may some silly sentimental theory be found the constitution—why must it not be looked into—why is it that under pain of being ipso facto anarchist convict we must never presume to look at it otherwise than with shut eyes because it was the work of our ancestors—of ancestors of legislators few of whom could so much as read and those few had nothing before them that was worth the reading first theoretical supposition wisdom of barbarian ancestors when from their ordinary occupation their order of the day the cutting of one anothers throats or those of welchmen scotchmen or irishmen they could steal now and then a holiday how did they employ it in cutting frenchmens throats in order to get their money this was active virtue—leaving frenchmens throats uncut was indolence slumber inglorious ease second theoretical supposition virtue of barbarian ancestors thus fraught with habitual wisdom and habitual virtue they sat down and devised and setting before them the best ends and pursuing those best ends by the best means they framed—in outline at any rate—they planned and executed our matchless constitution—the constitution as it stands and may it for ever stand planned and executed on what occasion on none at what place at none by whom by nobody     at no time oh yes says everythingasitshouldbe blackstone oh yes says whig after whig after the charming commentator anno domini    0 then it is that it was in its perfection about fourteen years before james the second mounted the throne with a design to govern in politics as they do in morocco and in religion as they do at rome to govern without parliament or in spite of parliament a state of things for which at this same era of perfection a preparation was made by a parliament which being brought into as proper a state of corruption as if lord castlereagh had had the management of it was kept on foot for several years together and would have been kept afoot till the whole system of despotism had been settled but for the sham popish plot by which the fortunate calumny and subornation of the whigs defeated the bigotry and tyranny of the tories what then says the only true theory—that theory which is uniformly confirmed by all experience on no occasion in no place at no time by no person possessing any adequate power has any such end in view as the establishing the greatest happiness of the greatest number been hitherto entertained on no occasion on the part of any such person has there been any endeavour any wish for any happiness other than his own and that of his own connexions or any care about the happiness or security of the subjectmany any further than his own has been regarded as involved in it among men of all classes from the beginning of those times of which we have any account in history—among all men of all classes an universal struggle and contention on the part of each individual for his own security and the means and instruments of his own happiness—for money for power for reputation natural and factitious for constant ease and incidental vengeance in the course of this struggle under favourable circumstances connected with geographical situation this and that little security has been caught at obtained and retained by the subjectmany against the conjoined tyranny of the monarch and his aristocracy no plan pursued by anybody at any time—the good established as well as the bad remaining the result of an universal scramble carried on in the storm of contending passions under favour of opportunity—at each period some advantages which former periods had lost others which they had not gained but the only regular and constant means of security being the influence exercised by the will of the people on the body which in the same breath admit themselves and deny themselves to be their agents and that influence having against it and above it the corruptive and counterinfluence of the ruling few the servants of the monarchy and the members of the aristocracy—and the quantity of the corruptive matter by which that corruptive influence operates being every day on the increase hence it is that while all names remain unchanged the whole state of things grows every day worse and worse and so will continue to do till even the forms of parliament are regarded as a useless incumbrance and pure despotism unless arrested by radical reform takes up the sceptre without disguise while the matter of waste and corruption is continually accumulating—while the avalanche composed of it is continually rolling on—that things should continue long in their present state seems absolutely impossible three states of things contend for the ultimate result—despotic monarchy undisguised by form representative democracy under the form of monarchy representative democracy under its own form in this as in every country the government has been as favourable to the interests of the ruling few and thence as unfavourable to the general interests of the subjectmany—or in one word as bad—as the subjectmany have endured to see it—have persuaded themselves to suffer it to be no abuse has except under a sense of necessity been parted with—no remedy except under the like pressure applied but under the influence of circumstances in a great degree peculiar to this country at one time or another the ruling few have found themselves under the necessity of sacrificing this or that abuse—of instituting or suffering to grow up this or that remedy it is thus that under favour of the contest between whigs and tories the liberty of the press the foundation of all other liberties has been suffered to grow up and continue but this liberty of the press is not the work of institution it is not the work of law what there is of it that exists exists not by means but in spite of law it is all of it contrary to law by law there is no more liberty of the press in england than in spain or morocco it is not the constitution of the government it is not the force of the law it is the weakness of the law we have to thank for it it is not the whigs that we have to thank for it any more than the tories the tories—that is the supporters of monarchy—would destroy it simply assured of their never being in a condition to have need of it the whigs would with equal readiness destroy it or concur in destroying it could they possess that same comfortable assurance but it has never been in their power and to that impotence is it that we are indebted for their zeal for the liberty of the press and the support they have given to the people in the exercise of     it without this arm they could not fight their battles without this for a trumpet they could not call the people to their aid such corruption was not in the head of any original framer of the constitution the work of design but were this said without explanation an opinion that would naturally be supposed to be implied in it is that the constitution was originally in some one head the whole or the chief part of it the work of design the evil consequence of a notion pronouncing it the work of design would be that such a design being infinitely beyond the wisdom and virtue of any man in the present times a planner would be looked out for in the most distant age that could be found—thus the ancestorwisdom fallacy would be the ruling principle and the search would be fruitless and endless but the nonexistence of any determinate design in the formation of the constitution may be proved from history the house of commons is the characteristic and vital principle anno      the man by whom the first germ was planted was simon de montfort earl of leicester a foreigner and a rebel in this first call to the people there was no better nor steadier design than that of obtaining momentary support for rebellion the practice of seeing and hearing deputies from the lower orders before money was attempted to be taken out of their pockets having thus sprung up in the next reign edward the first saw his convenience in conforming to it from this time till henry the sixths instances in which laws were enacted by kings sometimes without consulting commons—sometimes without consulting them or lords are not worth looking out henry the sixths was the first reign in which the house of commons had really a part in legislation till then they had no part in the penning of any laws no law was penned till after they were dissolved here then so late as about    0 between      and      the house of commons as a branch of the legislature was an innovation till then anno    0 constitution if the house of commons be a part of it there was none parliament yes consisting of king and lords legislators deputies of commons petitioners even of this aristocratical parliament the existence was precarious indigence or weakness produced its occasional reproduction more prudence and good fortune would have sufficed for throwing it into disuse and oblivion like the obsolete legislative bodies of france and spain it would have been reduced to a possibility all this while and down to the time when the reassembling of parliaments was imperfectly secured by indeterminate laws occasioned by the temporary nature of pecuniary supplies and the constant cravings of royal paupers had the constitution been a tree and both houses branches either or both might have been lopped off and the tree remain a tree still after the bloody reigns of henry the eighth and mary and the too short reign of edward the sixth comes that of elizabeth who openly made a merit of her wish to govern without parliament members presuming to think for themselves and to speak as they thought were sent to prison for repentance after the short parliaments produced in the times of james the first and charles the first by profusion and distress came the first long parliament where is now the constitution where the design—the wisdom the king having tried to govern without lords or commons failed the commons having extorted from the kings momentary despair the act which converted them into a perpetual aristocracy tried to govern without king or lords and succeeded in the time of charles the second no design but the kings design of arbitrary government executed by the instrumentality of seventeen years long parliament as yet for the benefit of the people no feasible design but in the seat of supreme power and there conception of any such design scarce in human nature the circumstance to which the cry of matchless constitution is in a great degree indebted for its pernicious efficiency is—that there was a time in which the assertion contained in it was incontrovertibly true till the american colonies threw off the yoke and became independent states no political state possessed of a constitution equalling it or approaching it in goodness was anywhere to be found but from this its goodness in a comparative state no wellgrounded argument could at any time be afforded against any addition that could at any time be made to its intrinsic goodness persons happier than myself are not to be found anywhere in this observation supposing it true what reason is there for my forbearing to make myself as much happier than i am at present as i can make myself this preeminence is therefore nothing to the purpose for of the pains taken in this way to hold it up to view the design can be no other than to prevent it from being ever greater than it is but another misfortune is that it is every day growing less and less so that while men     keep on vaunting this spurious substitute to positive goodness sooner or later it will vanish altogether the supposition always is that it is the same one day as another but never for two days together has this been true since the revolution took place never for two days together has it been the same every day it has been worse than the preceding for by every day in some way or other addition has been made to the quantity of the matter of corruption—to that matter by which the effect of the only efficient cause of good government the influence of the people has been lessened a pure despotism may continue in the same state from the beginning to the end of time by the same names the same things may be always signified but a mixed monarchy such as the english never can continue the same the names may continue in use for any length of time but by the same names the same state of things is never for two days together signified the quantity of the matter of corruption in the hands of the monarch being every day greater and greater the practice in the application of it to its purpose and thence the skill with which application is made of it on the one hand and the patience and indifference with which the application of it is witnessed being every day greater and greater the comparative quantity of the influence of the people and of the security it affords is every day growing less and less while the same names continue no difference in the things signified is ever perceived but by the very few who having no interest in being themselves deceived nor in deceiving others turn their attention to the means of political improvement hence it was that with a stupid indifference or acquiescence the roman people sat still while their constitution a bad and confused mixture of aristocracy and democracy was converted into a pure despotism with the title of representatives of the people the people behold a set of men meeting in the house of commons originating the laws by which they are taxed and concurring in all the other laws by which they are oppressed only in proportion as these their nominal representatives are chosen by the free suffrages of the people and in case of their betraying the people are removable by them can such representatives be of any use but except in a small number of instances—too small to be on any one occasion soever capable of producing any visible effect—neither are these pretended representatives ever removable by them nor have they ever been chosen by them if instead of a house of commons and a house of lords there were two houses of lords and no house of commons the ultimate effect would be just the same if it depended on the vote of a reflecting man whether instead of the present house of commons there should be another house of lords his vote would be for the affirmative the existing delusion would be completely dissipated and the real state of the nation be visible to all eyes and a deal of time and trouble which is now expended in those debates which for the purpose of keeping on foot the delusion are still suffered would be saved as to representation no man can even now be found so insensible to shame as to affirm that any real representation has place but though there is no real representation there is it is said a virtual one and with this those who think it worth their while to keep up the delusion and those who are or act and speak as if they were deluded are satisfied if those who are so well satisfied with a virtual representation which is not real would be satisfied with a like virtual receipt of taxes on the one part and a virtual payment of taxes on the other all would be well but this unfortunately is not the case the payment is but too real while the falsity of the only ground on which the exaction of it is so much as pretended to be justified is matter of such incontestable verity and such universal notoriety that the assertion of its existence is a cruel mockery   balance of power in general those by whom this phrase has been used have not known what they means by it it has had no determinate meaning in their minds should any man ever find for it any determinate meaning it will be this—that of the three branches between which in this constitution the aggregate powers of government are divided it depends upon the will of each to prevent the two others from doing anything—from giving effect to any proposed measure how by such arrangement evil should be produced is easy enough to say for of this state of things one sure effect is—that whatsoever is in the judgment of any one of them contrary to its own sinister interest will not be done on the other hand notwithstanding the supposed security whatsoever measure is by them all seen or supposed to be conducive to the aggregate interest of them all will be carried into effect how plainly soever it may be contrary to the universal interest of the people no abuse in the preservation of which they have each an interest will ever so long as they can help it be removed—no improvement in the prevention of which any one of them has an interest will ever be made the fact is that wherever on this occasion the word balance is employed the sentence is mere nonsense by the word balance in its original import is meant a pair of scales in     an arithmetical account by an ellipsis to which harsh as it is custom has given its sanction it is employed to signify that sum by which the aggregate of the sums that stand on one side of an account exceeds the aggregate of the sums that stand on the other side of that same account to the idea which on the sort of occasion in question the word balance is employed to bring to view this word corresponds not in any degree in either of these senses to accord with the sort of conception which if any it seems designed to convey the word should be not balance but equipoise when two bodies are so connected that whenever the one is in motion the other is in motion likewise and that in such sort that in proportion as one rises the other falls and yet at the moment in question no such motion has place the two bodies may be said to be in equipoise one weighs exactly as much as the other but of the figure of speech here in question the object is not to present a clear view of the matter but to prevent any such view of it from being taken to this purpose therefore the nonsensical expression serves better than any significant one the ideas belonging to the subject are thrown into confusion—the minds eye in its endeavours to see into it is bewildered and this is what is wanted it is by a series of simultaneous operations that the business of government is carried on—by a series of actions action ceasing the bodypolitic like the bodynatural is at an end by a balance if anything is meant a pair of scales with a weight in each the scales being even if the weights are uneven that in which is the heaviest weight begins to move it moves downward and at the same time the other scale with the weight in it moves upwards all the while this motion is going on no equipoise has place—the two forces do not balance each other if the wish is that they should balance each other then into the scale which has in it the lighter weight must be put such other weight as shall make it exactly equal to the heavier weight or what comes to the same thing a correspondent weight taken from that scale which has in it the heavier weight the balance is now restored the two scales hang even neither of the two forces preponderates over the other but with reference to the end in view or which ought to be in view—the use to be derived from the machine—what is the consequence—all motion is at an end in the case in question instead of two as in a common pair of scales there are three forces which are supposed or said to be antagonizing with one another but were this all the difference no conclusive objection to the metaphor could be derived from it for from one and the same fulcrum or fixed point you might have three scales hanging with weights in them if there were any use in it in the expression the image would be more complicated but in substance it would be still the same preeminently indeterminate indistinct and confused on every occasion is the language in which to the purpose in question application is made to this image of a balance and on every occasion when thus steadily looked into it will be found to be neither better nor worse than so much nonsense nothing can it serve for the justification of—nothing can it serve for the explanation of the fallacy often assumes a more elaborate shape—the constitution is composed of three forces which antagonizing with each other cause the business of government to be carried on in a course which is different from the course in which it would be carried on if directed solely by any one and is that which results from the joint influence of them all each one of them contributing in the same proportion to the production of it composition and resolution of forces this image though not so familiar as the other is free from the particular absurdity which attaches upon the other but upon the whole the matter will not be found much mended by it in proportion as it is well conducted the business of government is uniformly carried on in a direction tending to a certain end—the greatest happiness of the greatest number—in proportion as they are well conducted the operations of all the agents concerned tend to that same end in the case in question here are three forces each tending to a certain end take any one of these forces take the direction in which it acts suppose that direction tending to the same exclusively legitimate end and suppose it acting alone undisturbed and unopposed the end will be obtained by it add now another of these forces suppose it acting exactly in the same direction the same end will be attained with the same exactness and attained so much the sooner and so again if you add the third but that second force—if the direction in which it acts be supposed to be ever so little different from that exclusively legitimate direction in which the first force acts the greater the difference the further will the aggregate or compound force be from attaining the exact position of that legitimate end but in the case in question how is it with the three forces so far from their all tending to that end the end they tend to is in each instance as opposite to that end as possible true it is that amongst these three several forces that sort of relation really has place by which the sort of compromise in question is produced a sort of direction which is not exactly the same as that which would be     taken on the supposition that any one of the three acted alone clear of the influence of both the others but with all this complication what is the direction taken by the machine not that which carries it to the only legitimate end but that which carries it to an end not very widely distant from the exact opposite one in plain language here are two bodies of men and one individual more powerful than the two bodies put together—say three powers—each pursuing its own interest each interest a little different from each of the two others and not only different from but opposite to that of the greatest number of the people of the substance of the people each gets to itself and devours as much as it can each of them were it alone would be able to get more of that substance and accordingly would get more of that substance than it does at present but in its endeavours to get that more it would find itself counteracted by the two others each therefore permits the two others to get their respective shares and thus it is that harmony is preserved balance of forces—a case there is in which this metaphor this image may be employed with propriety this is the case of international law and international relations supposing it attainable what is meant by a balance of forces or a balance of power is a legitimate object—an object the effectuation of which is beneficial to all the parties interested what is that object it is in one word rest—rest the absence of all hostile motion together with the absence of all coercion exercised by one of the parties over another—that rest which is the fruit of mutual and universal independence here then as between nation and nation that rest which is the result of wellbalanced forces is peace and prosperity but on the part of the several official authorities and persons by whose operations the business of government in its several departments is carried on is it prosperity that rest has for its consequence no on the contrary of universal rest in the forces of the bodypolitic as in those of the bodynatural the consequence is death no action on the part of the officers of government no money collected in their hands—no money no subsistence no subsistence no service—no service everything falls to pieces anarchy takes the place of government government gives place to anarchy the metaphor of the balance though so far from being applicable to the purpose in question is in itself plain enough it presents an image the metaphor of the composition of forces is far from being so it presents not any image to all but the comparatively few to whom the principles of mechanics together with those principles of geometry that are associated with them are thus far familiar they present no conception at all the conversion of the two tracts described by two bodies meeting with one another at an angle formed by the two sides of a parallelogram into the tract described by the diagonal of the parallelogram is an operation never performed for any purpose of ordinary life and incapable of being performed otherwise than by some elaborate mechanism constructed for this and no other purpose when the metaphor here in question is employed the three forces in question—the three powers in question are according to the description given of them the power of the monarch the power of the house of lords and the power of the people even according to this statement no more than as to a third part of it would the interest of the people be promoted as to two thirds it would be sacrificed for example out of every £ 00 raised upon the whole people one hundred would be raised for the sake and applied to the use of the whole people the two other thirds for the sake and to the use of the two confederative powers—to wit the monarch and the house of lords not very advantageous to the majority of the people not very eminently conducive to good government would be this state of things in a prodigious degree however more conducive would it be than is the real state of things for in the respect in question what is this real state of things the power described as above by the name of the power of the people is instead of being the power of the people the power of the monarch and the power of the house of lords together with that of the rest of the aristocracy under that other name   glorious revolution this is a whigs cry as often as it is a time to look bold and make the people believe that he had rather be hanged than not stand by them what a revolution for the people no but what is so much better a revolution for the whigs—a revolution of      there is your revolution—the only one that should ever be thought of without horror a revolution for discarding kings no only a revolution for changing them there would be some use in changing them—there would be something to be got by it when their forefathers of      changed james for william and mary william got a good slice of the cake and they got the rest among them if instead of being changed kings were discarded what would the whigs get by it they would get nothing—they would lose not a little they would lose their seats unless they really sat and did the business they were sent to do and then they would lose their ease     the real uses of this revolution were the putting an end to the tyranny political and religious of the stuarts—the political governing without parliament and forcing the people to pay taxes without even so much as the show of consenting to them by deputies chosen by themselves—the religious forcing men to join in a system of religion which they believed not to be true but the deficiencies of the revolution were leaving the power of governing and in particular that of taxing in the hands of men whose interest it was to make the amount of the taxes excessive and to exercise misrule to a great extent in a great variety of other ways so far as by security given to all and thence by check put to the power of the crown the particular interest of the aristocratical leaders in the revolution promised to be served such security was established such check was applied but where security could not be afforded to the whole community without trenching on the power of the ruling few there it was denied freedom of election as against the despotic power of the monarch was established—freedom of election as against the disguised despotism of the aristocracy tories and whigs together remained excluded chapter iv allegorical idols—ad imaginationem exposition—the use of this fallacy is the securing to persons in office respect independent of good behaviour this is in truth only a modification of the fallacy of vague generalities exposed in the preceding chapter it consists in substituting for mens proper official denomination the name of some fictitious entity to whom by customary language and thence opinion the attribute of excellence has been attached examples—  government for members of the governing body   the law for lawyers   the church for churchmen the advantage is the obtaining for them more respect than might be bestowed on the class under its proper name exposure—i government in its proper sense in which it designates the set of operations it is true and universally acknowledged that everything valuable to man depends upon it security against evil in all shapes from external adversaries as well as domestic ii law execution of the law—by this it is that men receive whatsoever protection they receive against domestic adversaries and disturbers of their peace by government—law—the law—are therefore brought to view the naturalest and worthiest objects of respect and attachment within the sphere of a mans observance and for conciseness and ornament not to speak of deception the corresponding fictitious entities are feigned and represented as constantly occupied in the performance of the abovementioned allpreserving operations as to the real persons so occupied if they were presented in their proper character whether collectively or individually they would appear clothed in their real qualities good and bad together but as presented by means of this contrivance they are decked out in all their good and acceptable qualities divested of all their bad and unacceptable ones under the name of the god æsculapius alexander the impostor his selfconstituted high priest received to his own use the homage and offerings addressed to his god acquired as it is believed comparatively within late years this word government has obtained a latitude of import in a peculiar degree adapted to the sinister purpose here in question from abstract the signification has become as the phrase is concrete from the system in all its parts taken together it has been employed to denote the whole assemblage of the individuals employed in the carrying on of the system—of the individuals who for the time being happen to be members of the official establishment and of these more particularly and even exclusively such of them as are members of the administrative branch of that establishment for the designation either of the branch of the system or of the members that belong to it the language had already furnished the word administration but the word administration would not have suited the purpose of this fallacy accordingly by those who feel themselves to have an interest in the turning it to account to the proper word administration the too ample and thence improper word government has been probably by a mixture of design and accident commonly substituted this impropriety of speech being thus happily and successfully established the fruits of it are gathered in every day point out an abuse—point to this or that individual deriving a profit from the abuse up comes the cry you are an enemy to government then with a little news in advance your endeavour is to destroy government thus you are a jacobin an anarchist and so forth and the greater the pains you take for causing government to fulfil to the greatest perfection the professed ends of its institution the greater the pains taken to persuade those who wish or are content to be deceived that you wish and endeavour to destroy it iii church—this is a word particularly well adapted to the purpose of this fallacy to the elements of confusion shared by it with government and law it adds divers proper     to itself the significations indifferently attachable to the word church are—  place of worship   inferior officers engaged by government to take a leading part in the ceremonies of worship   all the people considered as worshippers   the superior officers of government by whom the inferior as above are engaged and managed   the rules and customs respecting those ceremonies the use of this fallacy to churchmen is the giving and securing to them a share of coercive power their sole public use and even original destination being the serving the people in the capacity of instructors—instructing them in a branch of learning now more thoroughly learnt without than from them† in the phrase church and state churchmen are represented as superior to all nonchurchmen by church and king churchmen are represented as superior to the king fox and norfolk were struck off the the list of privy councillors for drinking the sovereignty of the people the reduction would be greater were all struck off who have ever drank church and king according to bishop warburtons alliance the people in the character of the church meeting with all themselves in the character of the state agreed to invest the expounders of the sacred volume with a large share of the sovereignty against this system the lawyers their only rivals were estopped from pleading its seditiousness in bar in catholic countries the churchmen who compose holy mother church possess one beautiful female by whom the people are governed in the field of spiritual law within which has been inclosed as much as possible of profane law by protestants on holy mother church the title of whore of babylon has been conferred they recognise no holy mother church but in england churchmen a large portion of them compose two almæ matres academiæ—kind mother academies or universities by ingenuity such as this out of lubberly postmasters boys in any number one sweet mrs anne page is composed fit to be decked out in elements of amiability to any extent the object and fruit of this ingenuity is the affording protection to all abuses and imperfections attached to this part of the official establishment church being so excellent a being none but a monster can be an enemy a foe to her monster i e anarchist jacobin leveller c to every question having reform or improvement in view as to this part of the official establishment the answer is one and the same you are an enemy to the church for instance among others to such questions as follow—  what does this part of the official establishment do but read or give further explanation to one book of which more explanation has been given already than the longest life would suffice to hear   does not this suppose a people incapable of being taught to read   would it not be more read if each of them being able to read had it constantly by him to read all through than by their being at liberty some of them to go miles to hear small parts of it suppose it admitted that by the addition of other services conducive to good morals and good government business for offices not much inferior to the existing ecclesiastical offices might be found then go on and ask—  as to the connexion between reward and service do not the same rules apply to these as to profane offices   pay unconditionedfor service—is it more effectual in producing service here than there   here more than there—can a man serve in a place without being there   here as there is not a mans relish for the business proved the greater the smaller the factitious reward he is content to receive for doing it   the stronger such his relish is not his service likely to be the better   over and above what if anything is necessary to engage him to render the service does not every penny contribute to turn him aside to other and expensive occupations by furnishing him with the means   in scotland where there is less pay is not residence more general and clerical service more abundant and efficient answer enemy—and if englishbred apostate   in scotland does any evil arise from the nonexistence of bishops   in the house of lords any good   is not nonattendance there more general than even nonresidence elsewhere   in judiciali does any bishop ever attend who is not laid hold of after reading prayers   in legislatura ever except where personal interest wears the mask of gratitude   such nonattendance is it not felt rather as a relief than as a grievance answer enemy to the church   in ireland what is the use of protestant priests to catholics who will neither hear nor see them to whom they are known but as plunderers   by such exemption from service is not value of preferment increased   by patrons as by incumbents are not bishopricks thus estimated   is it not there a maxim that service and pay should be kept in separate hands   in eyes not less religious than gracious is not the value of religion inversely as the labour as well as directly as the profit   is not this estimate the root of those scruples by which oaths imposed to protect protestantism from being oppressed are employed in securing to it the pleasure of oppressing answer enemy to the church   0 chapter v sweeping classifications—ad judicium exposition—the device of those who employ in the way of fallacy sweeping classifications is that of ascribing to an individual object person or thing any properties of another only because the object in question is ranked in the class with that other by being designated by the same name in its nature this fallacy is equally applicable to undeserved eulogy as to undeserved censure but it is more frequently applied to the purpose of censure its efficiency being greater in that direction exposure—example   kings—crimes of kings—in the heat of the french revolution when the lot of louis xvi was standing between life and death among the means employed for bringing about the catastrophe that ensued was the publication of a multitude of inflammatory pamphlets one of which had for its title the crimes of kings kings being men and all men standing exposed to those temptations by which some of them are led into crimes matter could not be wanting for a book so entitled and if there are some crimes to the temptation of which men thus elevated stand less exposed than the inferior orders there are other crimes to which perhaps that elevation renders them but the more prone but of the man by whom on that occasion a book with such a title was published the object it is but too probable was to compose out of it this argument criminals ought to be punished—kings are criminals—and louis is a king therefore louis ought to be punished example   catholics—cruelties of catholics—not long ago in the course and for the purpose of the controversy on the question whether that part of the community which is composed of persons of the catholic persuasion ought or ought not to be kept any longer in a state of degradation under the predominant sect a book made its appearance under the title of cruelties of the catholics of any such complete success as the consigning in a body to the fate in which that catholic king was with so many of his nearest connexions involved all such british subjects as participate with him in that odious name there could not be much hope but whatsoever could by the species of fallacy here in question be done towards the promoting of it was done by that publication the object of it was to keep them still debarred from whatsoever relief remains yet to be administered to the oppressions under which they labour either it had this object or it had none to the complexion of this argument and of the mind that could bring it forward justice will not be done unless an adequate conception be formed of the practical consequences to which if to anything it leads of the catholics of the present and of all future time whatsoever be the character the cruelties and other enormities committed by persons who in former times were called by the same indefinitely comprehensive name will still remain what they were whatsoever harsh treatment therefore this argument warrants the bestowing on these their namesakes at the present time the same harsh treatment will from the same argument continue to receive the same justification so long as there remains one individual who consistently with truth is capable of being characterized by the same name be they what they may the barbarities of the catholics of those times had their limits but of this abhorrer of catholic barbarities the barbarity has in respect of the number of intended victims no limits other than those of time of the man who to put an end to the cruelties of kings did what depended upon him towards extirpating the class of kings the barbarity so far as regarded this object was comparatively speaking confined within a very narrow range all europe would not have sufficed to supply his scaffold with a dozen victims but after crushing as many millions of the vermin whom his piety and his charity marked out for sacrifice the zeal of the abhorrer of catholic cruelties would have been in the condition of the tiger whom in the plains of southern africa a traveller depicted to us as lying breathless with fatigue amidst a flock of antelopes in the same injurious device the painter of the crimes of kings might by a no less conclusive argument have proved the necessity of crushing the english form of the protestant religion and consigning to the fate of louis xvi the present head of it by order of king james i two men whose misfortune it was not to be able to form in relation to some inexplicable points of technical theology the same conception that was entertained or professed to be entertained by the royal ruler and instructor of his people were burnt alive george iv not only bears in common with james i the two different denominations—viz protestant of the church of england and king of great britain—but as far as marriage can be depended on for proof of filiation is actually of the same blood and lineage with that royal and triumphant champion of local orthodoxy if indeed in the authentic and generally received doctrines of the religion in question there were anything that compelled its professors     to burn or otherwise to destroy or illtreat all or any of those that differed from them and if by any recent overtact an adherence to those dissocial doctrines had appeared in practice in such case the adherence to such dissocial doctrines would afford a just ground for whatsoever measures of security were deemed necessary to guard other men from the effect of such doctrines and such practice but by no doctrines of their religion are catholics compelled to burn or otherwise illtreat those who differ from them any more than by the doctrines of the church of england james i was compelled to burn those poor anabaptists if from analogy any sincere and instructive use had on this occasion been intended to be derived from different countries professing the same persuasion—in these our times a much more instructive lesson would be afforded than any that could be derived from even the same country at such different times if in ireland where threefourths or more of the population is composed of catholics no illtreatment has within the memory of man been bestowed by catholics as such upon protestants as such while in the same country so much illtreatment has on other accounts been bestowed by each of these persuasions upon the other it is it may be said because the power of doing so with impunity is not in their hands but in countries where the catholic religion is the predominant religion and in which at the same time as in our islands barbarity on the score of heresy was by catholics exercised according to law and in the countries in which the exercise of those barbarities was at those times most conspicuous—of no such barbarities has any instance occurred for a long course of years chapter vi sham distinctions—ad judicium exposition—of the device here in view the nature may be explained by the following direction for the use of it— when any existing state of things has too much evil in it to be defensible in toto or proposals for amendment are too plainly necessary to be rejectible in toto the evil and the good being nominally distinguished from each other by two corresponding and opposite terms eulogistic and dyslogistic but in such sort that to the nominal line of distinction thus drawn there corresponds not any determinate real difference—declare your approbation of the good by its eulogistic name and thus reserve to yourself the advantage of opposing it without reproach by its dyslogistic name and so vice versa declare your disapprobation of the evil c exposure—example   liberty and licentiousness of the press—take for example the case of the press the press including under this denomination every instrument employed or employable for the purpose of giving diffusion to the matter of human discourse by visible signs—the press has two distinguishable uses—viz moral and political moral consisting in whatsoever check it may be capable of opposing to misconduct in private life—political in whatsoever check it may be capable of opposing to misconduct in public life that is on the part of public men—men actually employed or aspiring to be employed in any situation in the public service opposing viz by pointing on the persons to whom such misconduct is respectively imputable a portion more or less considerable of disapprobation and consequent illwill on the part of the public at large—a portion more or less considerable according to the nature of the case if to such misconduct there be no such check at all opposed as that which it is the nature of the press to apply the consequence is that of such misconduct whatsoever is not included in the prohibitions and eventual punishment provided by law will range uncontrouled in which case so far as concerns the political effect of such exemption from controul the result is power uncontroulable arbitrary despotism in the hands whatsoever they are in which the powers and functions of government happen to be reposed and moreover in the instance of such misconduct as is included in that system of prohibition and eventual punishment the controul will be without effect in so far as by delay vexation and expense natural or factitious the individual who would be led to call for the application is prevented from making such demand at the same time on the other hand the use of the press cannot be altogether free but that on pretence of giving indication of misconduct that has actually taken place supposed misconduct that never did actually take place will to this or that individual be imputed     in so far as the imputation thus conveyed happens to be false the effects of the liberty in question will so far as concerns any individual person thus unjustly accused be of the evil cast and by whomsoever they are understood so to be the dyslogistic appellation licentiousness will naturally be applied here then comes the dilemma—the two evils between which a choice must absolutely be made leave to the press its perfect liberty along with the just imputations which alone are the useful ones will come and in an unlimited proportion unjust imputations from which in so far as they are unjust evil is liable to arise but to him whose wish it really is that good morals and good government should prevail the choice need not be so difficult as at first sight it may seem to be let all just imputations be buried in utter silence—what you are sure of is that misconduct in every part of the field of action moral and political private and public will range without controul—free from all that sort of controul which can be applied by the press and not by anything else on the other hand let all unjust imputations find through this channel an unobstructed course—still of the evil—the personal suffering threatened by such infliction—there is neither certainty nor in general any near approach to it open to accusation that same channel is not less open to defence he therefore who has truth on his side will have on his side all that advantage which it is in the nature of truth to give that advantage—is it an inconsiderable one on the contrary supposition is founded whatsoever is done in the reception and collection of judicial evidence—whatsoever is intended by the exercise of judicial authority by the administration of whatsoever goes by the name of justice meantime if any arrangements there be by which the door may be shut against unjust imputations without incurring to an equal amount that sort of evil which is liable to result from the exclusion of just ones so much the better but unless and until such arrangements shall have been devised and carried into effect the tendency and effect of all restrictions having for their object the abridging of the liberty of the press cannot but be evil on the whole to shut the door against such imputations as are either unjust or useless leaving it at the same time open to such as are at the same time just and useful would require a precise a determinate a correct and complete definition of the appellative whatsoever it be by which the abuse—the improper use—the supposed preponderantly pernicious use—of the press is endeavoured to be brought to view to establish this definition belongs to those and to those alone in whose hands the supreme power of the state is vested of this appellative no such definition has ever yet been given—of this appellative no such definition can reasonably be expected at the hands of any person so situated since by the establishing of such definition their power would be curtailed their interest prejudiced while this necessary definition remains unestablished there remains with them the faculty of giving continuance and increase to the several points of abuse and misgovernment by which their interest in its several shapes is advanced till that definition is given the licentiousness of the press is every disclosure by which any abuse from the practice of which they draw any advantage is brought to light and exposed to shame—whatsoever disclosure it is or is supposed to be their interest to prevent the liberty of the press is such disclosure and such only from which no such inconvenience is apprehended no such definition can be given but at their expense—at the expense of their arbitrary power—of their power of misconduct in the exercise of the functions of government—at the expense of their power of misgovernment—of their power of sacrificing the public interest to their own private interest should that line have ever been drawn then it is that licentiousness may be opposed without opposing liberty while that line remains undrawn opposing licentiousness is opposing liberty thus much being understood in what consists the device here in question it consists in employing the sham approbation given to the species of liberty here in question under the name of liberty as a mask or cloak to the real opposition given to it under the name of licentiousness it is in the licentiousness of the press that the judge pretends to see the downfall of that government the corruption of which he is upholding by inflicting on all within his reach those punishments which by his predecessors have been provided for the suppression of all disclosures by means of which the abuses which he profits by might be checked example  —reform temperate and intemperate—for the designation of the species or degree of political reform which by him who speaks of it is meant to be represented as excessive or pernicious the language affords no such singleworded appellative as     in the case of liberty—the liberty of the press for making the nominal and pretended real distinction and marking out on the object of avowed reprobation the pernicious or excessive species or degree recourse must therefore be had to epithets or adjuncts such for instance as violent intemperate outrageous theoretical speculative and so forth if with the benefit of the subterfuge afforded by any of these dyslogistic epithets a man indulges himself in the practice of reprobating reform in terms thus vague and comprehensive and without designating by any more particular and determinate word the species or degree of reform to which he means to confine his reprobation or the specific objections he may have to urge you may in general venture to conclude it is not to any determinate species or degree that his real disapprobation and intended opposition confines itself but that it extends itself to every species or degree of reform which according to his expectation would be efficient that is by which any of the existing abuses would find a corrective for between all abuses whatsoever there exists that connexion—between all persons who see each of them any one abuse in which an advantage results to himself there exists in point of interest that close and sufficiently understood connexion of which intimation has been given already to no one abuse can correction be administered without endangering the existence of every other if then with this inward determination not to suffer so far as depends upon himself the adoption of any reform which he is able to prevent it should seem to him necessary or advisable to put on for a cover the profession or appearance of a desire to contribute to such reform—in pursuance of the device or fallacy here in question he will represent that which goes by the name of reform as distinguishable into two species one of them a fit subject for approbation the other for disapprobation that which he thus professes to have marked for approbation he will accordingly for the expression of such approbation characterize by some adjunct of the eulogistic cast—such as moderate for example or temperate or practical or practicable to the other of these nominally distinct species he will at the same time attach some adjunct of the dyslogistic cast—such as violent intemperate extravagant outrageous theoretical speculative and so forth thus then in profession and to appearance there are in his conception of the matter two distinct and opposite species of reform—to one of which his approbation to the other his disapprobation is attached but the species to which his approbation is attached is an empty species—a species in which no individual is or is intended to be contained the species to which his disapprobation is attached is on the contrary a crowded species a receptacle in which the whole contents of the genus—of the genus reform—are intended to be included chapter vii popular corruption—ad superbiam exposition—the instrument of deception of which the argument here in question is composed may be thus expressed—the source of corruption is in the minds of the people so rank and extensively seated is that corruption that no political reform can ever have any effect in removing it exposure—this fallacy consists in giving to the word corruption when applied to the people a sense altogether indeterminate—a sense in and by which all that is distinctly expressed is the disaffection of the speaker as towards the persons spoken of imputing to them a bad moral character or cast of mind but without any intimation given of the particular nature of it it is the result of a thick confusion of ideas whether sincere or affected for the purpose in the case of a parliamentary election each elector acts as a trustee for himself and for all the other members of the community in the exercise of the branch of political power here in question if by the manner in which his vote is received from him he is precluded as by ballot from the possibility of promoting his own particular interest to the prejudice of the remainder of the universal interest—the only interest of his which he can entertain a prospect of promoting by such his vote is his share of the universal interest and for     doing this he sees before him no other possible means than the contributing to place the share of power attached to the seat in question in the hands of that candidate who is likely to render most service to the universal interest now how inconsiderable soever may be in his eyes this his share in the universal interest still it will be sufficient to turn the scale where there is nothing in the opposite scale and by the supposition the emptiness of the opposite scale has been secured in the mode of election by ballot where the secresy thereby endeavoured at is accomplished as to so complete a certainty it may be if then to continue the allusion the value of his share in the universal interest in his eyes is such as to overcome the love of ease—the aversion to labour—he will repair to the place and give his vote to that candidate who in his eyes is likely to do most service to the universal interest if it be not sufficient to overcome that resisting force he will then forbear to give his vote and though he will do no good to the universal interest he will do no harm to it thus it is that under an apposite system of election procedure supposing them in the account of selfregarding prudence equal the least benevolent set of men will on this occasion render as much service to the universal interest as the most benevolent the least benevolent if that be what is meant by the most corrupt and if that is not meant nothing which is to the purpose nor in short anything which is determinate is meant on the other hand in so far as the system of election is so ordered that by the manner in which he gives his vote a man is enabled to promote his own separate interest what is sufficiently notorious is that no ordinary portion of benevolence in the shape of public spirit will suffice to prevent the breach of trust in question from being committed in the case therefore of the subjectmany to whom exclusively it was applied the word corruption has no determinate and intelligible application but to the class of the ruling few it has a perfectly intelligible application—application in a sense in which the truth of it is as notorious as the existence of the sun at noonday pretending to be all of them chosen by the subjectmany—chosen in fact a very small proportion of them in that manner—the rest by one another—they act in the character of trustees for the subjectmany bound to support the interest of the subjectmany instead of so doing being with money exacted from the subjectmany bribed by one another acting under the ruling one they act in constant breach of such their trust serving in all things their own particular and sinister interests at the expense and to the sacrifice of that interest of the subjectmany which together with that of the ruling few composes and constitutes the universal interest corrupt corruption corruptors corruptionist applied to conduct such as hath been just described—the meaning given to these terms wants assuredly nothing of being sufficiently intelligible a circumstance that renders this fallacy in a peculiar degree insidious and dangerous is a sort of obscure reference made by it to certain religious notions—to the doctrine of original sin as delivered in the compendium of church of england faith termed the    articles into that doctrine considered in a religious point of view it is not necessary on this occasion to make any inquiry the field here in question is the field of politics and applied to this field the fallacy in question seeks to lay the axe to the root of all government it applies not only to this but to all other remedies against that preponderance of selfregarding over social interest and affection which is essential to mans existence but which for the creation and preservation of political society and thence for his wellbeing in it requires to be checked—checked by a force formed within itself it goes to the exclusion of all laws and in particular of all penal laws for if for remedy to what is amiss nothing is to be attempted by arrangements which such as those relative to the principle and mode of election as applied to rulers bring with them no punishment—no infliction—how much less should the accomplishment of any such object be attempted by means so expensive and afflictive as those applied by penal laws by the employment given to this fallacy the employer of it afforded himself a double gratification he afforded an immediate gratification to his own antisocial pride and insolence while he afforded to his argument a promise of efficiency by the food it supplied to the same appetite in the breasts of his auditors bound to him as he saw them to be by a community of sinister interest out of the very sink of immorality was this fallacy drawn a sentiment of hatred and contempt of which not only all the mans fellowcountrymen were the declared but all mankind in at least equal degree were the naturally supposable object—so bad are they in themselves no matter how badly they are treated they cannot be treated worse than they deserve of a bad bargain says the proverb make the best of so bad a crew let us make the best for ourselves no matter what they suffer be it what it may they deserve it if nero had thought it worth his while to look out for a justification he could not have found a more apt one than this an argument which while it harmonized so entirely with the worst passions of the     worst men screened its true nature in some measure from the observation of better men by the cloud of confusion in which it wrapped itself in regard to corruption and uncorruption—or to speak less ambiguously in regard to vice and virtue—how then stands the plain and real truth that in the ruling few there is most vice and corruption because in their hands has been the power of serving their own private and sinister interest at the expense of the universal interest and in so doing they have in the design and with the effect of making instruments of one another for the accomplishment of that perpetual object been the disseminators of vice and corruption—that in the subjectmany there has been least of vice and corruption because they have not been in so large a degree partakers in that sinister interest and have thus been left free to pursue the track pointed out to them partly by men who have found a personal interest in giving to their conduct a universally beneficial direction—partly by discerning and uncorrupted men who lovers of their country and mankind have not been in the way of having that generous affection overpowered in their breasts by any particular selfregarding interest nearly akin to the cry of popular corruption is language commonly used to the following effect—instead of reforming others—instead of reforming your betters instead of reforming the state the constitution the church everything that is most excellent—let each man reform himself—let him look at home he will find there enough to do and what is in his power without looking abroad and aiming at what is out of his power c c language to this effect may at all times be heard from antireformists—always as the tone of it manifests accompanied with an air of triumph—the triumph of superior wisdom over shallow and presumptuous arrogance one feature which helps to distinguish it from the cry of popular corruption is the tacit assumption that between the operation condemned and the operation recommended incompatibility has place than which when once brought clearly to view nothing it will be seen can be more groundless certain it is that if every mans time and labour is exclusively employed in the correcting of his own personal imperfections no part of it will be employed in the endeavour to correct the imperfections and abuses which have place in the government and thus the mass of those imperfections and abuses will go on never diminishing but perpetually increasing with the torments of those who suffer by them and the comforts of those who profit by them which is exactly what is wanted chapter viii observations on the seven preceding fallacies in the seven preceding fallacies and in others of a similar nature the device resorted to is uniformly the same and consists in entirely avoiding the question in debate by substituting general and ambiguous terms in the place of clear and particular appellatives in other fallacies the argument advanced is generally irrelevant but argument of some kind they do contain in these argument there is none sunt verba et voces prætereàque nihil to find the only word that will suit his purpose the defender of corruption is obliged to make an ascent in the scale of generalization—to soar into the region of vague generalities till he comes to a word by the extensiveness of whose import he is enabled so by confounding language to confound conceptions as without general and immediate fear of detection to defend with a chance of success an object of the defence of which there would under its proper and peculiar name be no hope when of two terms—viz a generic term and a special term included under it—the specific term alone is proper i e the proposition into the composition of which it enters true the generic term if substituted to it is ambiguous and of the ambiguity if the effect of it is not perceived the consequence is error and deception opposite to this aërial mode of contestation is the mode already known and designated by the appellation of close reasoning in proportion as a mans mode of reasoning is close always supposing his intention honest for the designation of every object which he has occasion to bring to view he employs in preference the most particular expression that he can find—that which is best adapted to the purpose of bringing to view everything which it is its object to bring to view as clear as possible from everything which the purpose does not require to be brought and which in consequence it is his endeavour to avoid bringing to view in proportion as a man is desirous of contributing on every occasion to the welfare of the community and at the same time skilled in the means that most directly and certainly lead to the attainment of that end he will on the occasion of the language employed by him in the designation of each measure look out for that plan of nomenclature and classification by which the degree and mode of its conduciveness or repugnancy to that end may be the more easily and correctly judged of thus in regard to offences—acts which on account of their adverseness to the general     welfare are objects meet for discouragement—for prohibition—and in case of necessity for punishment—not content with the employing for the designation of each such act in particular that mode of expression by which every individual act partaking of the common nature indicated by the generic term may be brought to view to the exclusion of every act not partaking of that common nature he will for the designation of the relation it bears to other offences and of the place which it occupies in the aggregate assemblage of these obnoxious acts find for it and assign to it some such more general and extensive appellation as shall give intimation of the mode in which the wound given by it to the general welfare is perceptible   offences against individuals other than a mans self and those assignable individuals   against a mans self   against this or that particular class of the community   against the whole community without distinction in the case of individuals—offences against person against reputation against property against condition in life—and so on through the other classes above designated for the opposite reason—in proportion as without regard to and to the sacrifice of the general welfare a man is desirous of promoting his own personal or any other private interest he will on the occasion of the language employed in the designation of each measure look out for that plan of nomenclature and classification by which the real tendency of the measure to which he proposes to give birth or support shall be as effectually masked as possible—rendered as difficult as possible to be comprehended and judged of in the english law under the principle of arrangement—which till comparatively of late years was the only one and which is still the predominant one—such were the groupes into which by the classical denominations employed they were huddled together that by those denominations not any the slightest intimation was given of the nature and mischief of the offences respectively contained under them treasons felonies unclergyable felonies clergyable premunires misdemeanors by the four first of these five denominations what is designated is not the offence itself but the treatment given to the offender in respect of it in the way of punishment by the other denomination not so much as even that—only that the act is treated on the footing of an offence and on that score made punishable it is the miscellaneous class the contents of which are composed of all such offences as are not comprised under any of the others to what cause can a scheme of arrangement so incompatible with clear conception and useful instruction be ascribed its creation may be traced to one source its continuance to another for its creation such is its antiquity the weakness of the public intellect presents an adequate cause of treason and felony—terms imported at the norman conquest with the rest of the nomenclature of the feudal system—the origin is lost in the darkness of primæval barbarism religion—a perversion of the christian religion gave birth after a hard and long labour to the distinction between clergyable and unclergyable religion by a further perversion gave birth to premunires in the reign of edward iii to the designs of those whose interest it is that misrule in all its shapes should be perpetuated and thence that useful information by which it might be put to shame and in time to flight should as long as possible be excluded nothing could be more serviceable than this primæval imbecility under these denominations in general and in particular under felony acts of any description are capable of being ranked with equal propriety or rather with equal absence of impropriety acts of any description whatsoever and consequently acts altogether pure from any of those mischievous consequences from which alone any sufficient warrant for subjecting the agents to punishment can be found and offences thus clear of every really mischievous quality have accordingly been created and still continue in existence in convenient abundance by this contrivance the open tyranny of the lawyerled legislator and the covert tyranny of the lawmaking judge are placed at the most perfect ease the keenest eye cannot descry the felonies destined to be created by the touch of the sceptre upon the pattern of the old the liveliest imagination cannot pourtray to itself the innoxious acts destined to be fashioned or swollen into felonies analogous to this ancient english system—correspondent and analogous both as to the effect itself and as to its cause is the system lately brought out by the legislators of france and their forced imitators in germany faute contravention dêlit crime—classes rising one above another in a climax of severity—all of them designative how indeterminately soever rather of the treatment to which at the hands of the judge the agent is subjected than of the sort of act for which he is subjected to that treatment—much less of the ground or reason on which regard being had to the quality and quantity of mischief it is thought fit he shall be so dealt with lawyercraft in alliance with political tyranny may be marked out as the source of this confusion in the english case lawyercraft in subjection to political tyranny in the french case     in england it is the interest of the man of law that the rule of action should be and continue in a state of as general uncertainty and incognoscibility as possible that on condition of pronouncing on each occasion a portion of the flash language adapted to that purpose he may in his state of lawadviser and advocate be master of mens purses in his state of judge—of purse reputation condition in life and life itself to as complete a degree and with as little odium and suspicion as possible this is the state of things which it always has been and will be his interest to perpetuate and this is the state of things which hitherto it has been in his power to continue and which accordingly does to this day continue in existence in france where the man of law is not the ally of the politician but his slave that which it is not the interest of the politician to keep out of the view of the subject is—what the law is—that which it is his interest to keep nor even that in all parts out of the view of the subject is—what it is for the interest of the subject that the law should be—what in a word the law ought to be having brought the rule of action within a compass the narrowness of which in respect of the quantity of words has never regard being had to the amplitude of the matter yet been equalled the tyrant of france has by this one act of charity displayed a quantity of merit ample enough of itself to form a covering to no inconsiderable a portion of his sins but the exemplifications of vague generalities afforded by these systems of classification are sufficiently striking to save the authors of the systems from ranking any one of the offences in question under a denomination which would be manifestly inapplicable to it and from the discredit which would attach to them from such a source—ascending to a superior height in the logical scale—in the scale of genera and species—they provide a set of denominations so boundless in their extent as to be capable without impropriety of including any objects whatsoever on which it might be found convenient to stamp the factitious quality desired noxiousness to other individuals in this or that way—noxiousness to a person himself in this or that way—noxiousness to a particular class of the community in this or that way—noxiousness to the whole community in this or that way—these are qualities which it is not in the power of despotism to communicate to any act of any sort but to cause such persons as it is performed by to be punished with such or such a punishment—these are effects which be the sort of act what it may it is but too easy for supreme power in whatsoever hands reposed to annex to it here then are so many instances where the turn of the man in power not being capable of being served or at least so well served by giving to an object that which is at once its most particular and most proper name a name of more general and extensive import is employed for the purpose of favouring that deception which by the designating of it by such its proper name would have been dissipated and thus giving to an exercise of power which if rightly denominated would have been seen to be improper and mischievous the chance of not appearing in such its true light chapter ix antirational fallacies—ad verecundiam exposition—when reason is found or supposed to be in opposition to a mans interests his study will naturally be to render the faculty itself and whatsoever issues from it an object of hatred and contempt so long as the government contains in it any sort of abuse from which the members of the government or any of them derive in any shape a profit and in the continuance of which they possess a proportionable interest reason being against them persons so circumstanced will be in so far against reason instead of reason we might here say thought reason is a word that implies not merely the use of the faculty of thinking but the right use of it but sooner than fail of its object the sarcasm and other figures of speech employed upon the occasion are directed not merely against reason but against thought itself as if there were something in the faculty of thought that rendered the exercise of it incompatible with useful and successful practice   sometimes a plan the adoption of which would not suit the official persons interest is without more ado pronounced a speculative one and by this observation all need of rational and deliberate discussion—such as objection to the end proposed as not a fit one—objection to the means employed as not being fit means—is considered as being superseded to the word speculative for further enforcement are added or substituted in a number more or less considerable other terms as nearly synonymous to it and to one another as it is usual for words called synonymous to be viz theoretical visionary chimerical romantic utopian   sometimes a distinction is taken and thereupon a concession made the plan is good in theory but it would be bad in practice i e its being good in theory does not hinder its being bad in practice       sometimes as if in consequence of a further progress made in the art of irrationality the plan is pronounced to be too good to be practicable and its being so good as it is is thus represented as the very cause of its being bad in practice   in short such is the perfection at which this art is at length arrived that the very circumstanee of a plans being susceptible of the appellation of a plan has been gravely stated as a circumstance sufficient to warrant its being rejected rejected if not with hatred at any rate with a sort of accompaniment which to the million is commonly felt still more galling—with contempt looking at the house of commons with these views says a writer on the subject of parliamentary reform my object would be to find out its chief defects and to attempt the remedy of these one by one to propose no system no great project nothing which pretended even to the name of a plan but to introduce in a temperate and conciliatory manner     one or two separate bills in this strain were these men proposed to be addressed anno    0 by mr brougham in this strain were they addressed anno      by sir james mackintosh in moving for a committee on the penal laws to give a man any chance of doing anything with them in this same way they have ever been addressed and must ever be addressed till by radical reform for it cannot be by anything less the house shall have been purged of a class of men of whom the most complete inaptitude in respect of every element of appropriate aptitude is an essential characteristic in the scale of appropriate probity—in the scale of appropriate intellectual aptitude to find their level a man must descend below that of the very dregs of the people oh what a picture is here drawn of them and by so experienced a hand how cutting yet how unquestionably just the perhaps unintended perhaps intended satire to avoid awakening the real terrors of some the sham terrors of others all consistency all comprehensive acquaintance with the field of action must be abjured when idolatry in all its shapes shall have become extinct and the words wise ancestors no longer an instrument of deception but a byword with what scorn will not ancestors such as these be looked back upon by their posterity intimate as is the connexion between all these contrivances there is however enough of distinction to render them in this or that point of view susceptible of a separate exposure §   abuse of the words speculative theoretical c exposure—on the occasion of these epithets and the propositions of which they constitute the leading terms what will be held up to view in the character of a fallacy is—not the use of them but merely the abuse it may be placed to the account of abuse as often as in a serious speech without the allegation of any specific objection an epithet of this class bestowed upon the measure is exhibited as containing the expression of a sufficient reason for rejecting it by putting upon it a mark of reprobation thus contemptuous what is altogether out of dispute is that many and many a measure has been proposed to which this class of epithets or some of them would be justly applicable but a mans conceptions must be wofully indistinct or his vocabulary deplorably scanty if be the bad measure what it may he cannot contrive to give intimation of what in his view there is bad in it without employing an epithet the effect of which is to hold out as an object of contempt the very act of thinking—the operation of thought itself the fear of theory has to a certain extent its foundation in reason there is a general propensity in those who adopt this or that theory to push it too far i e to set up a general proposition which is not true until certain exceptions have been taken out of it—to set it up without any of those exceptions—to pursue it without regard to the exceptions—and thence pro tanto in cases in which it is false fallacious repugnant to reason and utility the propensity thus to push theory too far is acknowledged to be almost universal but what is the just inference not that theoretical propositions—i e propositions of considerable extent—should from such their extent be concluded to be false in toto but only that in the particular case inquiry should be made whether supposing the proposition to be in the character of a general rule generally true there may not be a case in which to reduce it within the limits of truth reason and utility an exception ought to be taken out of it every mans knowledge is in its extent proportioned to the extent as well as number of those general propositions of the truth of which they being true he has the persuasion in his own mind in other words the extent of these his theories comprises the extent of his knowledge if indeed his theories are false then in proportion as they are extensive he is the more deeply steeped in ignorance and error but from the mere circumstances of its being theoretical by these enemies to knowledge     its falsehood is inferred as if it were a necessary consequence—with as much reason as if from a mans speaking it were inferred as a necessary consequence that what he speaks must be false one would think that in thinking there were something wicked or else unwise every body feels or fancies a necesity of disclaiming it i am not given to speculation—i am no friend to theories speculation—theory—what is it but thinking can a man disclaim speculation can he disclaim theory without disclaiming thought if they do not mean thought they mean nothing for unless it be a little more thought than ordinary theory speculation mean nothing to escape from the imputation of meditating destruction to mankind a man must disclaim everything that puts him above the level of a beast a plan proposes a wrong end—or the end being right proposes a wrong set of means if this be what a man means can he not say so would not what he says have somewhat more meaning—be a little more consistent with the principles of common sense with common honesty than saying of it that it is theoretical—that it is speculative §   utopian as to the epithet utopian the case in which it is rightly applied seems to be that in which in the event of the adoption of the proposed plan felicitous effects are represented as about to take place no causes adequate to the production of such effects being to be found in it in sir thomas mores romance from which the epithet utopian has its origin a felicitous state of things is announced by the very name considering the age in which he lived even without adverting to the sort of religion of which he was so honest and pertinacious an adherent we may be sufficiently assured that the institutions spoken of by him as having been productive of this effect had taking them altogether very little tendency to produce it such in general is likely enough to be the case with the portion of political felicity exhibited in any other romance and thus far the epithet romantic is likely enough though not certain to be found well applied to any political plan in the conveyance of which to the notice of the public any such vehicle is employed causes and effects being alike at the command of this species of poet in prose the honour of any felicitous event is as easily ascribed to uninfluencing circumstances or even to obstacles as to causes if the established state of things including the abuse which in so many shapes is interwoven in it were anything like what the undiscriminating defenders of it represent it as being—viz a system of perfection—in this actually established system real in so far as abuse and imperfection are ascribed to it—imaginary in so far as exemption from such abuse and imperfection is ascribed to it—might indeed be seen an utopia—a felicitous result flowing from causes not having it in their nature to be productive of any such effects but having it in their nature to be productive of contrary effects in every department of government say the advocates of reform abuses and imperfections are abundant because the hands in which the powers of government are reposed have partly by their own artifice partly by the supineness of the people been placed in such circumstances that abuse in every shape is a source of profit to themselves under these circumstances if any expectation were really entertained that by these hands any considerable defalcation from the aggregate mass of abuse will ever be made—to no other expectation can the charge of utopianism be with more propriety applied effects so produced would be produced against the force of irresistible obstacles as well as absolutely without a cause but in that same system there has all along been preserved by the many a faculty—and that a faculty every now and then though much too seldom and too weakly exercised—of creating and without very considerable inconvenience or danger to themselves uneasiness more or less considerable to these their rulers in the state of things thus described there is nothing of utopianism for it is matter of universally notorious fact and in this faculty on the part of the many of creating uneasiness in the bosoms of the few—in this faculty on the part of those who suffer by the abuses of creating uneasiness in the bosoms of those who profit by them—in this invaluable and except in america unexampled faculty—rests the only chance the only source of hope §   good in theory bad in practice even in the present stage of civilization it is almost a rare case that by reason looking to the end in view matters of government are determined and the cause is the existence of so many institutions which being adverse to the only proper end the greatest happiness of the greatest number are maintained because favourable to the interests of the ruling few custom blind custom established under the dominion of that separate and sinister interest is the guide by which most operations have been conducted in so far as the interest of the many has appeared to the governing few to coincide with their own separate interests in so far it has been pursued—in so far as it has appeared incompatible   0 with those interests it has been neglected or opposed one consequence is that when by accident a plan comes upon the carpet in the formation of which the only legitimate end of government has been looked to if the beaten track of custom has in ever so slight a degree been departed from the practical man the man of routine knows not what to make of it its goodness if it be good—its badness if it be bad are alike removed out of the sphere of his observance if it be conducive to the end it is more than he can see for the end is what he has not been used to look to in the consideration of any plan what he has not been used to is to consider what in the department in question is the proper end of every plan that can be presented and whether the particular plan in question be conducive to that end what he has been used to is to consider whether in the matter and form it be like what he has practised if in a certain degree unlike it throws him into a sort of perplexity if the plan be a good one and in the form of reasons the points of advantage whereby it is conducive to the proper end in view have been presented—and in such sort that he sees not any the existence of which he feels himself able to contest nor at the same time any disadvantages which he can present in the character of preponderant ones—he will be afraid so far to commit himself as to pronounce it a bad one by way of compounding the matter and to show his candour if he be on good terms with you he will perhaps admit it to be good—viz in theory but this concession made—it being admitted and undeniable that theory is one thing and practice another he will take a distinction and to pay him for his concession propose to you to admit that it is not the thing for practice in a word that it is good in theory bad in practice that there have been plans in abundance which have been found bad in practice and many others which would if tried have proved bad in practice is altogether out of dispute that of each description there have been many which in theory have appeared and with reference to the judgment of some of the persons by whom they have been considered have been found plausible is likewise out of dispute what is here meant to be denied is that a plan which is essentially incapable of proving good in practice can with propriety be said to be good in theory whenever out of a number of circumstances the concurrence of all of which is necessary to the success of a plan any one is in the calculation of the effects expected from it omitted any such plan will in proportion to the importance of the omitted circumstance be defective in practice and if such be the degree of importance bad—upon the whole a bad one the disadvantageous effects of the plan not finding a compensation in the advantageous ones when the plan for the illumination of the streets by gaslights was laid before the public by the person who considered himself or gave himself out for the inventor one of the items in the article of expense—one capital article viz that of the pipes was omitted on the supposition that the pipes might all of them have been had for nothing and that in the plan so exhibited no other such imperfections were to be found the plan would to the persons engaged in the undertaking be not merely advantageous but advantageous in the prodigious degree therein represented if on the contrary the expense of this omitted article were such as to more than countervail the alleged balance on the side of profit then would the plan with reference to the undertakers prove disadvantageous upon the whole and in one word a bad one but whatever it prove to be in practice in theory having so important an omission in it it cannot but be pronounced a bad one for every plan in which in the account of advantages and disadvantages—of profit and losses any item is on the side of disadvantage or loss omitted is in proportion to the magnitude of such loss a bad one how advantageous soever upon trial the result may prove upon the whole in the line of political economy most plans that have been adopted and employed by government for enriching the community by money given to individuals have been bad in practice but if they have been bad in practice it is because they have been bad in theory in the account taken of profit and loss some circumstance that has been necessary to render the plan in question advantageous upon the whole has been omitted this circumstance has been the advantage which from the money employed would have been reaped either in the way of addition to capital by other means or in the way of comfort by expenditure of the matter of wealth portions that by these operations were but transferred from hand to hand and commonly with a loss by the way were erroneously considered as having been created §   too good to be practicable there is one case in which in a certain sense a plan may be said to be too good to be practicable—and that case a very comprehensive one it is where without adequate inducement in the shape of personal interest the plan requires for its accomplishment that some individual or class of individuals shall     have made a sacrifice of his or their personal interest to the interest of the whole where it is only on the part of some one individual or very small number of individuals that a sacrifice of this sort is reckoned upon the success of the plan is not altogether without the sphere of moral possibility because instances of a disposition of this sort though extremely rare are not altogether without example by religious hopes and fears by philanthropy by secret ambition such miracles have now and then been wrought but when it is on the part of a body of men or a multitude of individuals taken at random that any such sacrifice is reckoned upon then it is that in speaking of the plan the term utopian may without impropriety be applied in this case—if neglecting the question of practicability—on the mere consideration of the nature of the results the production of which is aimed at by the plan it can with propriety be termed a good one the observation too good to be practicable cannot justly be accused of want of truth but it is not any such intimation that by those in whose mouths this observation is most in use is meant to be conveyed the description of persons by whom chiefly if not exclusively it is employed are those who regarding a plan as being adverse to their interests and not finding it on the ground of general utility exposed to any preponderant objection have recourse to this objection in the character of an instrument of contempt in the view of preventing those from looking into it who might otherwise have been so disposed it is by the fear of seeing it practised that they are drawn to speak of it as impracticable in the character of opposers of a plan of the goodness of which—that is of its conduciveness to the welfare of the whole community taken together—they are themselves persuaded it cannot be their intention or wish to exhibit themselves it is not therefore in any such property of the plan that it can be their aim to engage those on whom it depends to look for the cause of the impracticability which they impute to it under favour of such observation as may have been made of the instances in which plans—the goodness of which supposing them carried into effect has been beyond dispute—have failed of success what they aim at is the producing in superficial minds the idea of a universal and natural connexion between extraordinary and extensive goodness and impracticability that so often as upon the face of any plan the marks of extraordinary and extensive utility are discernible these marks may as it were by a signal have the effect of inducing a man to turn aside from the plan and whether in the way of neglect and nonsupport or in the way of active opposition to bestow on it the same treatment that he would be justified in bestowing upon a bad one upon the face of it it carries that air of plausibility that if you were not upon your guard might engage you to bestow more or less of your attention upon it but were you to take the trouble you would find that as it is with all these plans that promise so much practicability would at last be wanting to it to save yourself from this trouble the wisest course you can take is therefore to put the plan aside and think no more about the matter there is a particular sort of grin—a grin of malicious triumph—a grin made up of malicious triumph with a dash of concealed foreboding and trepidation at the bottom of it—that forms a natural accompaniment of this fallacy when vented by any of the sworn defenders of abuse and milton instead of cramming all his angels of the african complexion into the divinity school disputing about predestination should have employed part of them at least in practising this grin with the corresponding fallacy before a lookingglass proportioned to the difficulty of persuading men to regard a plan as otherwise than beneficial supposing it carried into effect is the need of all such arguments or phrases as present a chance of persuading them to regard it as impracticable and according to the sort of man you have to deal with you accompany it with the grin of triumph or with the grimace of regret and lamentation there is a class of predictions the tendency and object of which is to contribute to their own accomplishment and in the number of them is the prediction involved in this fallacy when objections on the ground of utility are hopeless or have been made the most of objections on the ground of practicability still present an additional resource by these men who being convinced of the utility of the plan are in ever so great a degree wellwishers to it may be turned aside from it and the best garb to assume for the purpose of the attempt is that of one who is a wellwisher likewise till the examples are before his eyes it will not be easy for a man who has not himself made the observation to conceive to what a pitch of audacity political improbity is capable of soaring—how completely when an opportunity that seems favourable presents itself the mask will sometimes be taken off—what thorough confidence there is in the complicity or in the imbecility of hearers or readers if to say a good thing is a good thing is nugatory and as such foolish language—what shall we say of him who stands up boldly and says to aim at doing good is a bad thing     in so many words it may be questioned whether any such thing has yet been said but what is absolutely next to it scarce distinguishable from it and in substance the same thing has actually been said over and over to aim at perfection has been pronounced to be utter folly or wickedness and both or either at the extreme to say that man the species called man has so much as a tendency to better himself and that the range of such tendency has no certain limits—this has been—speculation propositions or observations to that effect have also been set down as a mark of wickedness by priestley an observation to this effect has somewhere or other been made by godwin an observation to this effect has somewhere or other been made by condorcet or some other frenchman or frenchmen of the class of those who for the purpose of holding them up to execration are called philosophers an observation to this effect has somewhere or other been made by this mark with or without the aid of any other these men together with other men of the same leaven have proved themselves the enemies of mankind and you too whosoever you are if you dare to maintain the same heresy you also are an enemy to mankind in vain would you reply to him if he be an official man—sir mr chalmers who like yourself was an official man has maintained this tendency and written a book which from beginning to end is a demonstration of it as clear and undeniable as euclids and mr chalmers is neither a madman nor an enemy to mankind in vain would you reply to him if he call himself a christian—sir jesus said to his disciples and to you if you would be one of them be ye perfect even as our father in heaven is perfect and in so doing has not only assumed the tendency but commanded it to be encouraged and carried to its utmost possible length by observations such as these may the sort of man in question be perhaps for a moment silenced but neither by this nor anything nor anybody though one rose from the dead would he be converted to various descriptions of persons over and above those who are in the secret a fallacy of this class is in a singular degree acceptable and conciliating—   to all idle men—all haters of business a considerable class where a share in the sovereignty of an empire such as ours is parcelled out into portions which are private property—where electors votes are free in appearance only and scarcely in appearance—and where the votes that are sold for money are in fact among the freest that are to be found   all ignorant men—all who for want of due and appropriate instruction feeling themselves incapable of judging on any question on its own merits look out with eagerness for such commodious and reputationsaving grounds   all dull and stupid men—in whose instance information—reading—such as has fallen to their lot has not yet been sufficient to enable them to determine a question on its own merits when a train of argument—when but a single argument is presented that requires thought—an operation so troublesome and laborious as that which goes by the name of thought—an expression of scorn levelled at the author or supposed author of this trouble is as far as it goes a just howsoever scanty and inadequate punishment for the disturbance attempted to be given to honourable repose under the name of theory c what is it that to men of this description is so odious what but reference to the end—to that which on that part of the field of thought and action which is in question is or at any rate ought to be the end pursued and thence in every case the end in view—how often must it and ever in vain be repeated—the greatest happiness of the greatest number but were reference made to this end—to this inflexible standard—everything almost they do—everything almost they support—would stand condemned what then shall be the standard custom—custom custom being their own practice blindly imitating the practice of men in the same situations put in motion and governed by the same sinister interests chapter x paradoxical assertion—ad judicium   dangerousness of the principle of utility   uselessness of classification   mischievousness of simplification   disinterestedness a mark of profligacy exposition—when of any measure practice or principle the utility is too far above dispute to be capable of being impeached by reasoning a rhetorician to whose interests or views it has appeared adverse has in some instances in a sort of fit of desperation made this attack upon it taking up the word or set of words commonly employed for the designation of it without any such attempt as that of opposing it by any specific objection he has assailed it with some vehement note of reprobation or strain of invective in which the mischievousness or folly of it has been taken for granted as if it were undeniable exposure is a sort of process of which the device in question is scarce susceptible but for the purpose of exposition an example or two may have its use utility method simplification reason sincerity     by a person unexperienced in the arts of political and verbal warfare it would not readily be imagined that entities like these should by any man laying claim to the distinguishing attribute of man be pointed out as fit objects of hatred and contempt yet so it is   as to utility—already has been named a great character in a high situation by whom the principle of utility was pronounced a dangerous one a book might be mentioned and one of no small celebrity† in which the same principle—the principle of utility—has been pronounced useless—the principle itself and consequently every investigation in which to the purposes of legislation or common life application is endeavoured to be made of it what must be acknowledged is that to make a right and effectual use of it requires the concurrence of those requisites which are not always found in company—invention discernment patience sincerity—each in no inconsiderable degree while for the pronouncing of decisions without consulting it decisions in the ipse dixit style nothing is required but boldness not that on any occasion on which it promises to suit his purpose and he feels in himself a capacity to apply it to that purpose the most decided scorner of it ever fails to make use of it it is only when if consulted its decisions would be against him or he feels himself awkward at consulting it that he ever takes upon him to do without it and to prove anything to be right or wrong thinks it sufficient for himself to say so   classification a bad thing—good method a bad thing on the same occasion in which a convenience was found in pronouncing the principle of utility useless the like convenience was found in professing the like contempt for that quality in discourse which goes by the name of good method or simply method and that sort of operation called good classification or simply classification when the subject a man undertakes to write upon is to a certain degree extensive—as for example the science of morals or that of legislation—whether what a man says be clear or not of falsehood will depend upon the goodness of the method in which the parts of it have been cast—  if for example snow and charcoal were both classed under the same name and neither of them had any other—if the question were asked whether the thing known by that name were white or black no inconsiderable difficulty would be found in answering it either by a yes or no   and if under favour of the identity of denomination sugar of lead were to be used in a pudding instead of any of the sort of sugar usually applied to that purpose practical inconveniences analogous to those which were experienced by thornbury from eating pancake‡ might probably be found to result from the mistake thus exemplified in the tactical branch of the art or science of life call it which you please in the course of an attempt made∥ to cast the whole multitude of pernicious actions into apt classes—as a fruit and proof and test     of the supposed aptitude about a dozen propositions were mentioned as being capable of being without any deviation from the truth of things ascribed to the pernicious acts respectively collected together under one denomination by the names respectively assigned to the four classes to which they were referred on the same occasion intimation was likewise given that in the system of law and law terms in use for the designation of offences among english lawyers no such fair general denomination could be found to the contents of which an equal number and it might perhaps have been added any number at all of common propositions could without error and falsehood be ascribed a system of classification and nomenclature which can never be employed without confounding at every turn objects which to prevent practical and painful accidents require to be distinguished must by every man who has not a decided interest in maintaining the contrary be acknowledged to be very ill adapted to those which are or at least which ought to be its purposes here then was an intimation given that the whole system of english penal law is in an extreme degree ill adapted to what ought to be the purposes of every system of law and an implied invitation to those if any such there were who being conversant in the subject of law had any desire to see it well adapted to its professed purposes to show that the system was not in respect of the points indicated a bad one—the radically bad one it was there represented to be—or else to take measures for making it better but it being the interest of every one who is most conversant with this subject that the whole system instead of being as good as it can be made should be as bad as those who live under it will endure to see it the invitation could not in either branch be accepted in any other branch of science that can be named—medicine chemistry natural history in all its branches the progress made in every other respect is acknowledged to be commensurate to and at once effect and cause in relation to the progress made in the art of classification nor in any one of those branches of science would it perhaps be easy to find a single individual by whom the operation of classification would be spoken of as anything below the highest rank in the order of importance why this difference because in any one of these branches of science there is scarce an individual to whose interest the advancement of the science is opposed whereas among the professors of the law there exists not an individual to whose interest the advancement of the art of legislation is not opposed—is not either immediately detrimental or ultimately dangerous   simplification by the opposite vice complication every evil opposite to the ends of justice—viz uncertainty of the law itself unnecessary delay expense and vexation in respect of the execution—is either produced or aggravated consequently to every one by whom any wish is entertained of seeing the mass of these evils reduced a fervent desire is entertained of seeing the virtue of simplification infused into the system of law and judicial procedure on an occasion that took place not long ago if the account of the debates can be trusted a gentleman was found resolute and frank enough to stand up and rank this virtue—if after that such it may be called—among the worst of vices the use of it was evidence of jacobinism—evidence of the circumstantial kind indeed but sufficiently conclusive if on a declaration to that effect any sentiment of disapprobation were visible in the language or deportment of that honourable house none such are at least recorded and if none such really were perceptible this circumstance alone might afford no inconsiderable ground for the desire expressed by some of seeing the character of that honourable house undergo a thorough change   disinterestedness a mark of profligacy in his pamphlet on his official economy bill to give up official emolument is by edmund burke pronounced in so many words to be a mark of the basest profligacy on somewhat more defensible grounds might this position itself be pronounced as strong a mark as ever was exhibited or ever could be exhibited of the most shameless profligacy an assumption contained in it besides others too numerous to admit of their being detailed here is—that in the eyes of man there is nothing that has any value—nothing that is capable of actuating and giving direction to his conduct but the matter of wealth that the love of reputation and the love of power are themselves both of them without efficient power over the human heart so opposite is this position of his to the truth that the less the quantity of money which in return for his engagement to render official service a man not palpably unfit for the business of it is content to accept the stronger is the proof the presumptive evidence thereby afforded of his aptitude in all points with relation to the business of that office since it is a proof of his relish for the business—of the pleasure he anticipates from the performance of it†     blinded by his rage in this his frantic exclamation wrung from him by the unquenched thirst for lucre—this madman than whom none perhaps was ever more mischievous—this incendiary who contributed so much more than any other to light up the flames of that war under the miseries occasioned by which the nation is still groaning—poured forth the reproach of the basest profligacy on the heads of thousands before whom had he known who they were he would have been ready to bow the knee not to mention the whole magistracy of the empire whose office is that of justice of the peace—among other persons before whom he was in the habit of prostrating himself of the verbal filth he thus casts around him one large mass falls upon the head of the marquess camden and from his rebounds upon those other official heads from which the surrender made of the vast mass of official emolument drew forth the stream of eulogium which the documents of the day present us with   how to turn this fallacy to account to let off a paradox of this sort with any chance of success you must not be anything less than the leader of a party for if you are instead of gaping and staring at you men will but laugh at you or think of something else without so much as laughing at you because there is no laughing at anything without thinking of it moreover a thing of this sort succeeds much better in a speech than in a book or pamphlet—and that for several reasons the use of a speech is to carry the measure of the moment and if the measure be but carried no matter for the means the measure being carried the paradox is seen to be no less absurd and mischievous than it is strange no matter—the measure is carried war is declared or a negotiation for peace broken off peace you will have some time or other but in the meantime the paradox has had its effect a law has passed and that law an absurd and mischievous one some day or other the mischief may receive a remedy but that day may not arrive these two or three hundred years in a speech too it is all profit—no loss your point may be gained or not gained your reputation remains where it was it is your speech or not your speech whichever is most convenient to a who under the notion of its being yours admires it it is your speech to b who because it is yours or because it is an absurd and mischievous one spurns at it it is not your speech if the words of your paradox are ambiguous as they will be if they are well and happly chosen—susceptible of two senses an innoxious and a noxious one—this is exactly what is wanted a who on your credit is ready to take it and to adopt it in the noxious one which suits your purpose is suffered silently to take it in that noxious one but if b taking it in the noxious one attacks you and pushes you too hard then some adherent of yours not you yourself for it would be weak indeed for you to appear in the matter some adherent of yours brings out the innocent sense vows and swears it was that meaning that was yours and belabours poor b with a charge of calumny if in the choice of your expression you have been negligent or unfortunate so that no more than one sense and that one indefensible can with any colour of reason be ascribed to it you thus lose part of your advantage but still no harm can happen to you you disavow—that is your adherent for you disavows—the very words—and thus everything is as it should be thus it is that from speeches—spoken and unminuted speeches—you derive much the same sort of advantage as is derived from that sort of sham law which in so far as it is made by anybody is made by judges and is called common or unwritten law by lawyers thundering all the while the charge of insincerity or folly in all who have the assurance to ascribe to it either a different word or a different meaning to the supposed speech as to the supposed law they give what words they please and then to those words they give what meaning they please the law indeed neither has nor ever had any determinate form of words belonging to it whereas the speech could not have been spoken unless it had had a set and that a complete one of determinate words belonging to it but in the speech—the words never having been committed to writing or if they have been evidence of their being the same words not being producible—the speechmaker is as safe as if he had never uttered any one of those words in the intellectual weakness of those on whom in this form imposition is endeavoured to be practised—in this degrading weakness and in the state of servitude in which they are accordingly held by the shackles of authority† may be seen the cause of that success and thence of the effrontery and insolence which this species of imposition manifests in proportion as intellect is weaker and weaker reason has less and less to hold upon it authority     fortified by the appearance real or fallacious of strong persuasion more and more it is in this way that strange as at first mention it cannot but appear—it is in this way—and when addressed to minds of such a texture the more flagrant and outrageous the absurdity the stronger its persuasive force why because without the strongest ground a persuasion—so strong a persuasion—of the truth of a proposition at first sight at least so adverse to truth it is taken for granted could not have been formed when the terrors of which religion is the source are the instruments employed for inculcating it the strength of the persuasion thus inspired presents little cause for wonder in the intensity of the exertion made for the purpose of believing—the greater the difficulty the greater is in case of success the merit hence that most magnanimous of all conclusions credo quia impossibile est higher than this the force of faith—the force and consequently the merit—cannot go by this one bound the pinnacle is attained and whatsoever reward omnipotence has in store for service of this complexion is placed out of the reach of failure be the absurdity ever so flagrant—the nature of man considered and how absolute the dominion which is exercised over him by the passions of fear and hope—be the absurdity ever so flagrant cause of just wonder can never be afforded by any acceptance which it receives with the support afforded to it by the most irresistible of the passions the understanding is not the source—reason is of itself no spring of action the understanding is but an instrument in the hand of the will it is by hopes and fears that the end of action is determined—all that reason does is to find and determine upon the means but where at the mere suggestion of a set of men with gowns of a certain form on their backs—where at their mere suggestion unsupported by any motive of a nature to act on the will we see men living and acting under the persuasion that in the vice of lying there is virtue to metamorphose into justice the crime of usurpation—here it is not the will that is confounded and overwhelmed it is the understanding that is deluded chapter xi noncausa pro causa or cause and obstacle confounded—ad judicium exposition—when in a system which has good points in it you have a set of abuses or any of them to defend—after a general eulogium bestowed on the system or an indication more or less explicit of the good effects the existence of which is out of dispute take the abuses you have to defend either separately or collectively collectively is the safest course and to them ascribe the credit of having given birth to the good effects cùm hoc ergò propter hoc in every political system which is of long standing and which not having been produced any considerable part of it in prosecution of any comprehensive design good or bad but piecemeal at different and distant times according to the casual and temporary predominance of conflicting interests—whatsoever may be the good or the bad points in the state of things which at any given time constitutes the result of it among the incidents which may be observed as having place in it some upon proper scrutiny and proper distinction made may be seen to have operated in the character of effective or promotive causes—others in the character of obstacles or preventives—others to have been in relation to them in the character of immaterial incidents or inoperative circumstances in such a system whatsoever are the abuses or other imperfections in it and whatsoever are the prosperous results observable in it these prosperous results will have found in the abuses and imperfections not so many efficient or promotive causes but so many obstacles or preventives meantime if so you can order matters that instead of being recognised as having operated in the character of obstacles the abuses in question shall be believed to have operated in the character of efficient or promotive causes nothing can contribute more powerfully to the effect which it is your endeavour to produce if you cannot so far succeed as to cause the prosperous results in question to be referred to the abuses by which they have been obstructed and retarded the next thing you are to endeavour at is to cause them to be     ascribed to some inoperative circumstance or circumstances having in appearance some connexion or other—the nearer the better—with the abuses at any rate you will as far as depends upon you cause the prosperous circumstances in question to be referred to any causes rather than the real ones for in proportion as it becomes manifest of what causes they are the results it will become manifest of what other circumstances they have not been the results whereupon no sooner is any one of the abuses you have to defend considered in this point of view than a question will be apt to occur—well and this—what has been the use of this to which no answer being found the consequence is such as need not be mentioned real knowledge being among the number of your most formidable adversaries your endeavour must of course be to obstruct its advancement and propagation as effectually as possible real knowledge depends in a great degree on the being able on each occasion to distinguish from each other causes obstacles and uninfluencing circumstances—these therefore it must on every occasion be your study to confound as effectually as possible exposure—example  —good government obstacle represented as a cause—the influence of the crown if the superiority of the constitution of the english limited monarchy as compared with all absolute or less limited monarchies be in england a point undisputed and regarded as indisputable and the characteristic by which that limited monarchy is distinguished from all absolute and less limited monarchies is the influence the superior influence of the mass of the people—the influence exercised by the will of the nominees of the people on the wills of the nominees of the king and thence on the conduct of the king himself—a circumstance which in so far as it operates diminishes the efficiency of this influence and on many if not most occasions may be seen to destroy that efficiency altogether cannot with propriety be numbered among the causes of that superiority but must on the contrary be placed to the account of the obstacles that obstructed it in point of fact the members of the house of commons—some really all in supposition nominees of the mass of the people—act as to the nominees of the king viz the members of the executive department with the authority of judges—viz to the purpose of causing punishment to be inflicted under the name of punishment in case of special delinquency not without the concurrence of the house of lords—but to the purpose of causing removal without any such concurrence in so far as over the will of the nominees of the people as above mentioned acting in their abovementioned character of judges an efficient influence is exercised by the king or his nominees the efficiency of this judicial authority is destroyed the nominees of the king in the exercise of their respective functions committing any enormities at pleasure and thereupon in the character though without the name of judges absolving themselves and if such be their pleasure praising themselves for what they have done in this case the fallacy consists in representing defending and supporting in the character of an indispensable cause of the acknowledged prosperous results the sinister and corruptive influence in question—a circumstance which so far from being in any degree a promotive cause is an obstacle in what way it operates in the character of an obstructive and destructive circumstance has already been shown above in what way with relation to the same effect it can operate as a cause has never been so much as attempted to be shown—it has been on every occasion taken for granted and this on no other ground than that of its being a concomitant circumstance example  —effect good government obstacle represented as a cause—station of the bishops in the house of lords to good government neither in the situation of a bishop nor in any other situation can a man be contributory any further than as he takes a part in it in that department of government which is carried on in the house of lords a man cannot bear a part any further than as he takes a part in the debates carried on there or at least attends and gives his vote but of the whole body of bishops including since the union those from ireland a small part upon an average scarce so many as a tenth are seen to attend and give their votes and as for speaking—when any instance of it happens to take place it sets men astaring and talking as if it were a phenomenon how comes it that the number of those who vote and especially of those who speak is so small because a general feeling exists that to that class temporal occupations and politics are not suitable occupations and why not suitable   because in that war of personalities in which in a large proportion the debates in that as well as in the other house consist a man of this class is in a peculiar degree vulnerable the apostles—did they bear any part in had they any seat in the roman senate or so much as in the

their occupations it yours were the same would you not be rather more like them than you are   because there is a general feeling though not expressed in words from a sort of decency and compassion

exception of the scurrilous parts of the review were put together and made into a book a most instructive addition to it might be made by a history of the treatment experienced from this quarter by the inventions of the quaker lancaster in the age of academical and right reverend orthodoxy learning it would there be seen is even to the very first rudiments of it an object of terror and hatred of this quaker though he undertook not to attempt to make converts what is certain is that no school would under his management have been a school of perjury and since in so far as by his means the elementary parts of knowledge made their way among the people intellectual light would take place of intellectual darkness he experienced the hostility that might so naturally have been expected from those who love darkness better than light to wit for a reason which may be seen in that book the knowledge of which it was his object to diffuse as it was theirs to confine and stifle it in virtue and knowledge—in every feature of felicity the empire of montezuma outshines as everybody knows all the surrounding states even the commonwealth of tlascala not excepted where said an inquirer once to the high priest of the temple of vitzlipultzli where is it that we are to look for the true cause of so glorious a preeminence look for it answered the holy pontiff—where shouldst thou look for it blind sceptic but in the copiousness of the streams in which the sweet and precious blood of innocents flows daily down the altars of the great god yes answered in full convocation and full chorus the archbishops bishops deans canons and prebends of the religion of vitzlipultzli—yes answered in semichorus the vicechancellor with all the doctors both the proctors and masters regent and nonregent of the as yet uncatholicized university of mexico—yes in the copiousness of the streams in which the sweet and precious blood of innocents flows daily down the altars of the great god example  —effect national virtue obstacle represented as a cause—opulence of the elergy in several former works it has been shown that be the effect what it may—in so far as money or in any other shape the matter of reward is in the character of an efficient cause employed in the view or under the notion of promoting it—what degree of efficiency shall attend in such case the use made of the instrument depends not so much     upon its magnitude as upon the manner in which and the skill with which it is applied and in particular that in so far as that instrument is composed of public money it is no less possible and in some cases much more frequent so to apply it that the production of that effect shall instead of being promoted be prevented that when as for working a man is paid alike whether he does work or whether he does none to expect work from him is impossible and to pretend to expect it mere mockery that after engaging to render an habitual course of service for the rendering of which no extraordinary degree of talent or alacrity is necessary a fit person has received that which is necessary to obtain his free engagement for the rendering it every penny added has no other tendency than to afford him means and incentives to relinquish his duties for whatever other occupations are more suitable to his taste now if this be true of all men it is true of every man and it is not a mans being called prebend canon dean bishop or even archbishop that will in his case or in any other persons case make it false it is a proposition that be it ever so true is not evident but requires argument deduced from experience to render it so that by such service as is rendered by the english clergy virtue is in any degree promoted it is a proposition that be it to a certain extent ever so true is to a certain extent notoriously not true that to the procurement of such service money from any source is necessary for without a particle of money passing from hand to hand service of this sort is rendered by men one towards another viz among the people called quakers and if for the exhibiting to view the comparative degrees of efficiency with which service of this sort is rendered—work of this sort done—who is there that will take upon him to deny that the highest degree of the scale would be found occupied by the people called quakers or disputed with them by the people called methodists—while the very lowest would be recognised as being occupied without dispute by the members sacred or profane of the established and most opulently endowed church of england it is another proposition that still remains to be proved that admitting that for the procurement of this service—to the whole extent in which for the production of virtue it is wanted—money is necessary it is also necessary that for the raising of the necessary quantity money should by the power of government be forced out of the pockets of unwilling contributors chapter xii partialitypreachers argument—ad judicium from the abuse argue not against the use exposition—from abuse it is an erorr it has been said to argue against use the proposition is an absurd one make the best of it but the degree of absurdity will depend upon the turn that may be given to the sentence whichsoever he the turn given to it the plain and undeniable truth of the case as between use and abuse will alike serve for the exposure of it be the institution what it may whatsoever good effects there are that have resulted from it these constitute as far as experience goes the use of it whatsoever ill effects have resulted from it these in so far at least as they have been the object of foresight and the result of intention constitute the abuse of it thus as to past results and the same observation applies to expected future ones exposure—now then come the fallacies to the propagation of which it may and must have been directed—   in taking an account of the effects of an institution you ought to set down all the good effects and omit all the bad ones this is one of the purposes to which it is capable of being applied this needs not much to be said of it   in taking an account of the effects of an institution good and bad you ought not to argue against it on the supposition that the sum of the bad ones is greater than the sum of the good ones merely from the circumstance that among all its effects taken together there are some that belong to the bad side of the account in this latter sense such is the character of the maxim that nothing can be said against the truth of it as an instruction it is too obvious to be of any use in the way of warning it cannot by possibility do any harm nor is it altogether out of the sphere of possibility that in this or that instance it may have its use applied to a mans pecuniary affairs it amounts to this viz conclude not that a man has no property because he has some debts chapter xiii the end justifies the means—ad judicium in this case surely if in any exposition is of itself exposure the insertion of this article in the list of fallacies was suggested by the use made of it in the courier newspaper of the   th of   0 august      as reported and commented upon in the morning chronicle of the   th the end justifies the means yes but on three conditions any of which failing no such justification has place—   one is that the end be good   that the means chosen be either purely good—or if evil having less evil in them than on a balance there is of real good in the end   that they have more of good in them or less of evil as the case may be than any others by the employment of which the end might have been attained laying out of the case these restrictions note the absurdities that would follow acquisition of a penny loaf is the end i aim at the goodness of it is indisputable if by the goodness of the end any means employed in the attainment of it are justified instead of a penny i may give a pound for it thus stands the justification on the ground of prudence or instead of giving a penny for it i may cut the bakers throat and thus get it for nothing and thus stands the justification on the ground of benevolence and beneficence in politics what is the use of this fallacy in the mouth of one whose station is among the ins it will serve for whatsoever cruelties those by whom power is exercised may at any time find a pleasure in committing on those over whom power is exercised for the purpose of confirming themselves in the power of committing more such cruelties the ins as such have the power to commit atrocities and that power having sinister interest for its spur is never suffered to be idle for the use of this fallacy in so far as it can be worth their while to employ a cloak they have therefore a continual demand the outs acting under the impulse of the same spur sharpened by continual privation and continually repeated disappointment have on their part a still more urgent demand for the same fallacy though the opportunities of making application of it but rarely present themselves to their hands the oracular party adage invented by the whigs—not men but measures—or not measures but men—for according as you complete the sentence you may word it either way—this bold but slippery instrument of fallacy has manifest alliance with the present seating in office fit men being the end every thing depending upon that end and the men in question being the only ones by which it can be attained no means can be imagined which by such an end may not be justified chapter xiv opposergenerals justification—not measures but men or not men but measures—ad invidiam according to the notions commonly entertained of moral duty under the head of probity and in particular under the head of that branch of probity which consists in sincerity whatsoever be the nature and extent of the business in question private or public it is not right for a man to argue against his own opinion—when his opinion is so and so to profess it to be the reverse and in so doing to bend the force of his mind to the purpose of causing others to embrace the opinion thus opposite to his real one that in particular if being a member of the house of commons and in opposition a measure which to him seems a proper one is brought on the carpet on the ministerial side it is not right that he should declare it to be in his opinion pernicious and use his endeavours to have it thought so and treated as such by the house and so again if being on that same side a measure such as to him appears pernicious is brought on the carpet on the side of opposition it is not right that he should declare it to be in his opinion beneficial and fit to be adopted and accordingly use his endeavours to make it generally thought so and as such adopted by the house an aphorism said to have been a favourite one with the late mr charles fox is the proposition at the head of this chapter not men but measures or not measures but men—are the two forms in either of which according as the ellipsis is filled up the aphorism may be couched     not measures but men is the more simple expression of the two it being in that form that the aphorism is marked out for approbation reprobation being the sentiment attached to its opposite not men but measures if you look to speeches then comes the constant and constantly interminable question—what were the words in the speeches the words are in that case on each occasion genuine or spurious the interpretation correct or incorrect according as it suits the purpose of him who is speaking of it and more particularly of him who spoke it that it should be but on one occasion we have the aphorism from the pen of charles fox himself and then if applied to the question of sincerity or insincerity as above it is found to have no direct bearing on it are to be attended to are the words employed on this occasion to complete the proposition how vain how idle how presumptuous says the declaimer in his attempt to put on the historian is the opinion that laws can do everything and how weak and pernicious the maxim founded upon it that measures not men are to be attended to weak enough as thus expressed it must be confessed and abundantly too weak to be by a statesman considered as worth noticing even by so vague and ungrounded a note of reprobation as if any one ever thought of denying that both ought to be attended to and as if even in a debating club words so vague and unmeaning as attended to were a fit subject of debate what must be confessed is that to a man who wishes well to his country and sees a set of men who in his opinion are a bad set conducting the affairs of it few things are more provoking than by this or that comparatively unimportant but so far as it goes beneficial measure to see them obtain a degree of reputation of which one effect may be to confirm them in their seat but what seems not to have been sufficiently attended to is that it is by the badness of their measures that the only warrant for giving to the men the appellation of bad men can be grounded that if they are really the bad men they are supposed to be have a little patience and they will come out with some bad measure against which it being by the supposition bad and by yourself looked upon as such you may without prejudice to your sincerity point your attacks and if no such bad measure ever came from them the imputation of their being bad men is rather premature distressing indeed to a man of real probity must be the alternative to see a set of men fixed in this their allcommanding seat and making a proportionally extensive and pernicious use of it or for the purpose of taking what chance is to be had of precluding them from this advantage to keep on straining every endeavour to make the house and the public look upon as pernicious a measure of the utility of which he is himself satisfied in the abomination of long and regularly corrupt parliaments lies the cause of this distress under this system when the whole system of abuses has a determined patron on the throne and that patron has got a set of ministers that suit this ruling purpose misrule may swell to such a pitch that without any one measure in such sort bad that you can fix upon it and say this is a sufficient ground for punishment or even for dismission the state may be at the brink of ruin—meantime some measure may be introduced against which though good or at least innoxious of itself the people by means of some misrepresentation of matter of fact or some erroneous opinion or other which prevails among them may to the disgrace and expulsion of the ministry be turned against it and then comes the distressing alternative but were the duration of the assembly short and the great and surely effective mass of the matter of corruption expelled and kept out of it no such alternative would ever present itself the chance of ridding the country of a bad set of ministers would be renewed continually the question supposed to be tried on each occasion might be the question really tried whereas at present on each occasion the question tried is but one and the same viz shall the ministry or shall it not continue the question brought on the carpet is like the wager in a feigned issue a mere farce which but for its connexion with the principal question above mentioned would not be deemed worth trying and would not be tried chapter xv rejection instead of amendment—ad judicium exposition—this fallacy consists in urging in the character of a bar or conclusive objection against the proposed measure some consideration which if presented in the character of a proposed amendment might have more or less claim to notice it generally consists of some real or imaginary inconvenience alleged commonly but not necessarily as eventually to result from the adoption of the measure this inconvenience supposing it real will either be preponderant over the promised benefit or not preponderant     in either case it will be either remediable or irremediable if at the same time irremediable and preponderant then it is and then only that in the character of an objection it is of itself conclusive by him in whose mind discernment and candour are combined this distinction will be not only felt but brought to view if in respect of adequate discernment there be a failure it will not be felt if in respect of candour only it will have been felt but it will not be brought to view the occasion by which opportunity is afforded for the working of this fallacy is the creation of any new office including the mass of emolument which without inquiry into the necessity or any means taken for keeping down the quantum of it within the narrowed limits which the good of the service admits of is by the union of habit with the sinister interest that gave birth to it annexed as of course upon their creation to all new offices the fallacy—what there is of fallacy in the case consists in the practice of setting up the two universally applicable objections viz need of economy and mischief or danger from the increase of the influence of the crown in the character of peremptory bars to the proposed measure exposure—the ground on which an objection of this stamp may with propriety be considered and spoken of under the denomination of a fallacy is where the utility of the proposed new establishment is left unimpeached and the sole reason for the rejection proposed to be put upon the proposed measure consists in the above topics or one of them in such case on the part of him by whom any objections so inconclusive in their nature are relied on the reliance placed on them amounts to a virtual acknowledgment of the utility of the proposed new establishment inasmuch as in an address from one rational being to another nothing seems upon the face of the statement at least more unnatural than that if a man could find any objection that would apply to the particular establishment in question in contradistinction to all others he should confine himself to an objection which applies alike to almost all existing establishments that is to almost the whole frame of the existing government such is the case where the two commonplace objections in question or either of them are brought out in the character of objections by themselves and without being accompanied by any specific ones but even when added to specific ones an objection thus inconclusive in its nature if urged in a direct way and dwelt upon with any emphasis can scarcely—at least while there remain any useless places unabolished or any overpaid places from which the overplus of emolument remains undefalcated—be exempted from the imputation of irrelevancy at any rate wherever it happens that a minister at present in office sees opposite to him in the house another person who has at any time been in office it seems an observation not very easy to answer in the character of an argument ad hominem should it be said when you were in office there were such and such offices which were of no manner of use these you never used your endeavours to abolish notwithstanding the use that would have resulted from the abolition in the shape of diminution of needless expenditure and sinister influence yet now when a set of offices is proposed for which you cannot deny but that there is some use your exertions for the benefit of economy are reserved to be directed against these useful ones no doubt but that on the supposition that the two opposite masses of advantage and disadvantage being completely in equilibrio—advantage in the shape of service expected to be rendered in the proposed new offices on the one hand disadvantage in the shape of expense—of the emolument proposed to be attached to them on the other—a weight much less than that of the mischief from the increase of sinister influence would suffice to turn the scale take also another supposition suppose what is not in every case possible that the value of the service expected to be obtained by means of the proposed new offices is capable of being obtained and has accordingly been obtained in figures suppose on the other hand what will very frequently be feasible that the expense of the establishment may with sufficient precision be obtained in figures—and being so obtained on striking the balance found to be less than the advantage so expected from the service suppose lastly what is impossible that the value of the mischief which in the shape of introduction of additional influence were with sufficient precision capable of standing expressed in figures had been so expressed—and being so expressed the quantity of mischief in this shape were found sufficient to turn the scale on the side of disadvantage here would be a sufficient reason for the rejection of the proposed establishment and thence a sufficient warrant for bringing into the field the argument in question commonplace as it is but in regard to this last supposition at any rate how far it is from being capable of being realized is but too evident upon the whole therefore so far at least as concerns the objection drawn from the increase that would result to the sinister influence of the crown it may be said that whatsoever time is spent in descanting upon this topic may be set down to the account of lost time     it is a topic the importance of which is surely sufficient to entitle it to be considered by itself the influence of the crown it ought always to be remembered can no otherwise receive with propriety the epithet sinister than in so far as by being directed to and reaching a member of parliament or a parliamentary elector it affects the purity of parliament but by a system of measures properly directed to that end the constitution of parliament might be effectually guarded against any degree of impurity capable of being productive of any sensible inconvenience whatsoever were the lucrativeness of the utmost number of offices for the creation or preservation of which so much as a plausible reason could be found and were it otherwise the proper remedy would be found not in the refusal to create any new office the service of which was understood to overbalance in any determinate and unquestionable degree the mischief of the expense but in the taking the nomination out of the hands of the crown and vesting it in some other and independent hands the putting all places in these respects upon the same footing—necessary and unnecessary ones—properly paid and overpaid ones—wears out and weakens that energy which should be reserved for and directed with all its force against unnecessary places and the overplus part of the pay of overpaid ones another occasion on which this fallacy is often wont to be applied is the case in which from the mere observation of a profit as likely from any transaction to accrue to this or that individual a censure is grounded pronouncing it a job the error in case of sincerity the fallacy in case of insincerity consists in forgetting that individuals are the stuff of which the public is made that there is no way of benefiting the public but by benefiting individuals and that a benefit which in the shape of pleasure or exemption from pain does not sooner or later come home to the bosom of at least some one individual is not in reality a benefit—is not entitled to that name so far then from constituting an argument in disfavour of the proposed measure every benefit that can be pointed out as accruing or likely to accrue to any determinate individual or individuals constitutes as far as it goes an argument in favour of the measure in no case whatsoever—on no imaginable supposition—can this consideration serve with propriety in the character of an argument in disfavour of any measure in no case whatsoever—on no imaginable supposition—can it so far as it goes fail of serving with propriety in the character of an argument in favour of the measure is the measure good—it adds to the mass of its advantages is the measure upon the whole a bad one—it subtracts by the whole amount of it from the real amount of the disadvantages attached to the measure at the same time in practice there is no argument perhaps which is more frequently employed or on which more stress is laid without doors at any rate if not within doors than this in the character of an argument in disfavour of a proposed measure—no argument which even when taken by itself is with more confidence relied on in the character of a conclusive one to what cause is so general a perversion of the faculty of reason to be ascribed two causes present themselves as acting in this character—   it is apt to be received and that certainly not without reason in the character of evidence—conclusive evidence—of the nature of the motive to the influence of which the part taken by the supporters of the measure or some of them viz all who in any way are partakers of the private benefit in question ought to be ascribed in this character to the justness of the conclusion thus drawn there can in general be nothing to object but the consideration of the motive in which the part taken either by the supporters or the opposers of a measure finds its cause has elsewhere been shown to be a consideration altogether irrelevant and the use of the argument has been shown to be of the number of those fallacies the influence of which is in its natural and general tendency unfavourable to every good cause the other cause is the prevalence of the passion of envy to the man to whom it is an object of envy the good of another man is evil to himself by the envy of the speaker or writer the supposed advantage to the third person is denounced in the character of an evil to the envy of the hearers or the readers—denounced and perhaps without any perception of the mistake so rare is the habit of selfexamination and so gross and so perpetual the errors into which for want of it the human mind is capable of being led in speaking of the passion or affection of envy as being productive of this fallacious argument and of the error but for which shame would frequently restrain a man from the employment of it—it is not meant to speak of this passion or this affection as one of which on the occasion in question the influence ought to be considered as pernicious on the whole so far from being pernicious the more thoroughly it is considered the more closely it will be seen to be salutary upon the whole and not merely salutary at least in the best     state of things that has yet been realized but so necessary that without it society would hardly have been kept together the legislator who resolves not to accept assistance from any but social motives—from none save what in his vocabulary pass under the denomination of pure motives will find his laws without vigour and without use the judge who resolves to have no prosecutors who are brought to him by any but pure motives will not find that part of his emolument which under the present system of abuse is composed of fees and may save himself the trouble of going into court—of sitting on penal causes the judge who should determine to receive no evidence but what was at the same time brought to him and when before him guided by pure motives need scarcely trouble himself to hear evidence the practical inference is—that if he would avoid drawing down disgrace upon himself instead of upon the measure he is opposing a man ought to abstain from employing this argument in confutation of the fallacy since in as far as he employs it he is employing in refutation of one fallacy and that so gross an one that the bare mention of it in that character may naturally be sufficient to reduce the employer to silence—he is employing another fallacy which is of itself susceptible of a refutation no less easy and conclusive it is only by the interests the affections the passions—all these words mean nothing more than the same psychological object appearing in different characters—that the legislator labouring for the good and in the service of mankind can effect his purposes those interests acting in the character of motives may be of the selfregarding class the dissocial or the social—the social he will on every occasion where he finds them already in action endeavour not only to engage in his service but cherish and cultivate the selfregarding and the dissocial though his study will be rather to restrain than encourage them he will at any rate wherever he sees them in action or likely to come into action use his best endeavours to avail himself of directing their influence with whatever force he can muster to his own social purposes part v chapter i characters common to all these fallacies upon the whole the following are the characters which appertain in common to all the several arguments here distinguished by the name of fallacies—   whatsoever be the measure in hand they are with relation to it irrelevant   they are all of them such that the application of these irrelevant arguments affords a presumption either of the weakness or total absence of relevant arguments on the side on which they are employed   to any good purpose they are all of them unnecessary   they are all of them not only capable of being applied but actually in the habit of being applied and with advantage to bad purposes viz to the obstruction and defeat of all such measures as have for their object and their tendency the removal of the abuses or other imperfections still discernible in the frame and practice of the government   by means of their irrelevancy they all of them consume and misapply time thereby obstructing the course and retarding the progress of all necessary and useful business   by that irritative quality which in virtue of their irrelevancy with the improbity or weakness of which it is indicative they possess all of them in a degree more or less considerable but in a more particular degree such of them as consist in personalities they are productive of illhumour which in some instances has been productive of bloodshed and is continually productive as above of waste of time and hindrance of business   on the part of those who whether in spoken or written discourses give utterance to them they are indicative either of improbity or intellectual weakness or of a contempt for the understandings of those on whose minds they are destined to operate   on the part of those on whom they operate they are indicative of intellectual weakness and on the part of those in and by whom they are pretended to operate they are indicative of improbity viz in the shape of insincerity the practical conclusion is that in proportion as the acceptance and thence the utterance of them can be prevented the understanding of the public will be strengthened the morals of the public will be purified and the practice of government improved     chapter ii of the mischief producible by fallacies the first division that presents itself in relation to the mischief of a fallacy may be expressed by the words specific and general the specific mischief of a fallacy consists in the tendency which it has to prevent or obstruct the introduction of this or that useful measure in particular the general mischief consists in that moral or intellectual depravation which produces habits of false reasoning and insincerity—this mischief may again be distinguished into mischief produced within doors and mischief produced withoutl doors under the appellation of mischief within doors is to be understood all that mischief that deception which has its seat in the bosom of any member of the supreme legislative body under the appellation of mischief without doors all that which has its seat in the bosom of any person not included in that body—of any person whose station is among the people at large— chapter iii causes of the utterance of these fallacies the causes of the utterance of these fallacies may it should seem be thus denominated and enumerated—   sinister interest—selfconscious sinister interest   interestbegotten prejudice   authoritybegotten prejudice   selfdefence i e sense of the need of selfdefence against counterfallacies first cause—sinister interest of the operation of which the party affected by it is conscious the mind of every public man is subject at all times to the operation of two distinct interests—a public and a private one his public interest is that which is constituted of the share he has in the happiness and wellbeing of the whole community or of the major part of it his private interest is constituted of or by the share he has in the wellbeing of some portion of the community less than the major part of which private interest the smallest possible portion is that which is composed of his own individual—his own personal—interest in the greater number of instances these two interests are not only distinct but opposite and that to such a degree that if either be exclusively pursued the other must be sacrificed to it take for example pecuniary interest it is the personal interest of every public man at whose disposal public money extracted by taxes from the whole community is placed that as large a share as possible and if possible the whole of it should remain there for his own use it is at the same time the interest of the public including his own portion of the public interest that as small a share as possible and if possible no part at all remain in these same hands for his personal or any other private use taking the whole of life together there exists not nor ever can exist that human being in whose instance any public interest he can have had will not in so far as depends upon himself have been sacrificed to his own personal interest towards the advancement of the public interest all that the most publicspirited which is as much as to say the most virtuous of men can do is to do what depends upon himself towards bringing the public interest—that is his own personal share in the public interest to a state as nearly approaching to coincidence and on as few occasions amounting to a state of repugnance as possible with his private interests were there ever so much reason for regretting it the sort of relation which is thus seen to have place between public and private interest would not be the less true nor would it be the less incumbent on the legislator—nor would the legislator in so far as he finds it reconcilable to his personal interest to pursue the public interest be the less disposed and determined—to act and shape his measures accordingly but the more correct and complete a mans conception of the subject is the more clearly will he understand that in this natural and general predominance of personal over every more extensive interest there is no just cause for regret why because upon this predominance depends the existence of the species and the existence of every individual belonging to it suppose for a moment the opposite state of things—a state in which every one should prefer the public to himself and the consequences—the necessary consequences would be no less ridiculous in idea than disastrous and destructive in reality in the ordinary course and strain of legislation no supposition inconsistent with this only true and rational one is acted upon on this supposition is built whatsoever is done in the application made either of the matter of reward or of the matter of punishment to the purposes of government the supposition is—that on the part of every individual whose conduct it is thus endeavoured to shape and regulate interest and that private interest will be the cause by the operation of which his conduct will be determined not only so but that in case of competition as     between such public and such private interest it is the private interest that will predominate if the contrary supposition were acted upon what would be the consequence that neither in the shape of reward nor in the shape of eventual punishment would the precious matter of good and evil be wasted or exposed to waste but in lieu of requisition with reward or punishment or both for its sanction for securing compliance advice and recommendation would be employed throughout the system of law penal as well as remuneratory thence it is that in so far as in the instance of any class of men the state of the law is such as to make it the interest of men belonging to that body to give rise or continuance to any system of abuse however flagrant a prediction that may be made with full assurance is that the conduct of that body—that is of its several members with few or no exceptions—will be such as to give rise or continuance to that system of abuse and if there be any means which have been found to be or promise to be conducive to any such end such means will accordingly how inconsistent soever with probity in any shape and in particular in the shape of sincerity be employed a common bond of connexion says cicero somewhere has place among all the virtues to the word virtue substitute the word abuse meaning abuse in government and the observation will be no less true among abuses in government besides the logical commune vinculum composed of the common denomination abuse there exists a moral commune vinculum composed of the particular and sinister interest in which all men who are members of a government so circumstanced have a share so long then as any man has any the smallest particle of this sinister interest belonging to him—so long has he an interest and consequently a fellowfeeling with every other man who in the same situation has an interest of the like kind attack one of them you attack all and in proportion as each of them feels his share in this common concern dear to him and finds himself in a condition to defend it he is prepared to defend every other confederates share with no less alacrity than if it were his own but it is one of the characteristics of abuse that it can only be defended by fallacy it is therefore the interest of all the confederates of abuse to give the most extensive currency to fallacies—not only to such as may be serviceable to each individual but also to such as may be generally useful it is of the utmost importance to them to keep the human mind in such a state of imbecility as shall render it incapable of distinguishing truth from error abuses—that is to say institutions beneficial to the few at the expense of the many—cannot openly directly and in their own character be defended if at all it must be in company with and under the cover of other institutions to which this character either does not in fact appertain or is not seen to appertain for the few who are in possession of power the principle the best adapted if it were capable of being set to work would be that which should be applicable to the purpose of giving to the stock of abuses established at each given period an unlimited increase no longer than about a century ago a principle of this cast actually was in force and that to an extent that threatened the whole frame of society with ruin viz under the name of the principle of passive obedience and nonresistance this principle was a primum mobile by the due application of which abuses in all shapes might be manufactured for use to an amount absolutely unlimited but this principle has now nearly if not altogether lost its force the creation of abuses has therefore of necessity been given up the preservation of them is all that remains feasible it is to this work that all exertions in favour of abuse have for a considerable time past and must henceforward be confined institutions—some good some bad—some favourable to both the few and the many—some favourable to the few alone and at the expense of the many—are the ingredients of which the existing system is composed he who protects all together and without discrimination protects the bad to this object the exertions of industry are still capable of being directed with a prospect of success and to this object they actually do continue to be directed and with a degree of success disgraceful to the probity of the few by whom such breach of trust is practised and to the intellect of the many by whom it is endured if the fundamental principle of all good government—viz that which states as being on every occasion the proper and the only proper end in view and object of pursuit the greatest happiness of the greatest number—were on every occasion set up as the mark on each occasion the particular question would be by what particular means can this general object be pursued with the greatest probability of success but by the habit of recurring to and making application of this one principle the eye of the inquirer the tongue of the speaker and the pen of the writer would on every part of the field of legislation be brought to some conclusion—passing condemnation on some or other of those abuses the continuance of     which has this common interest for its support in a word so long as any one of these relatively profitable abuses continues unremedied—so long must there be one such person or more to whose interest the use of reason is prejudicial and to whom not only the particular beneficial measure from which that particular abuse would receive its correction but every other beneficial measure in so far as it is supported by reason will also be prejudicial in the same way it is under the past and still existing state of things—in other words under the dominion of usage custom precedent acting without any such recurrence to this only true principle—that the abuses in question have sprung up custom therefore blind custom in contradiction and opposition to reason is the standard which he will on every occasion endeavour to set up as the only proper safe and definable standard of reference whatever is is right everything is as it should be these are his favourite maxims—maxims which he will let slip no opportunity of inculcating to the best advantage possible having besides his share in the sinister interest his share in the universal and legitimate interest there must to a corresponding extent be laws and institutions which although good and beneficial are no less beneficial to and necessary to his interest than to that of the whole community of which he makes a part of these then in so far as they are necessary to his interest he will be as sincere and strenuous a defender as of those by which any part of the abuses which are subservient to his sinister interest is maintained it is conducive for instance to his interest that the country should be effectually defended against the assault of the common enemy that the persons and properties of the members of the community in general his own included should be as effectually as possible protected against the assaults of internal enemies—of common malefactors but it is under the dominion of custom—blind or at best purblind custom—that such protection has been provided custom therefore being sufficient for his purpose—reason always adverse to it—custom is the ground on which it will be his endeavour to place every institution the good as well as the bad referred to general utility as their standard shown to be conformable to it by the application of reason to the case they would be established and supported indeed on firmer ground than at present but by placing them on the ground of utility by the application of reason he has nothing to gain while as hath been seen above he has every thing to lose and fear from it the principle of general utility he will accordingly be disposed to represent in the character of a dangerous principle for so long as blind custom continues to serve his purpose such with reference to him and his sinister interest the principle of general utility really is against the recognition of the principle of general utility and the habit of employing reason as an instrument for the application of it the leading members of the government in so far as corruption has pervaded the frame of government and in particular the members of all ranks of the profession of the law have the same interest as in the eyes of protestants and other noncatholics the pope and his subordinates had at the time and on the occasion of the change known in england by the name of the reformation at the time of the reformation the opposition to general utility and human reason was conducted by fire and sword at present the war against these powers cannot be completely carried on by the same engines fallacies therefore applied principally to the purpose of devoting to contempt and hatred those who apply the principle of general utility on this ground remain the only instruments in universal use and request for defending the strongholds of abuse against hostile powers these engines we accordingly see applied to this purpose in prodigious variety and with more or less artifice and reserve chapter iv second cause—interest begottenprejudice if by interest in some shape or other—that is by a motive of some sort or other—every act of the will and thence every act of the hand is produced so directly or indirectly must every act of the intellectual faculty though in this case the influence of the interest of this or that motive is neither so perceptible nor in itself so direct as in the other but how it may be asked is it possible that the motive a man is actuated by can be secret to himself nothing is more easy—nothing more frequent indeed the rare case is not that of his not knowing but that of his knowing it it is with the anatomy of the human mind as with the anatomy and physiology of the human body the rare case is not that of a mans being unconversant but that of his being conversant with it the physiology of the body is not without its difficulties but in comparison of those by which the knowledge of the physiology of the mind has been obstructed the difficulties are slight indeed not unfrequently as between two persons     living together in a state of intimacy either or each may possess a more correct and complete view of the motives by which the mind of the other than of those by which his own mind is governed many a woman has in this way had a more correct and complete acquaintance with the internal causes by which the conduct of her husband has been determined than he has had himself the cause of this is easily pointed out—by interest a man is continually prompted to make himself as correctly and completely acquainted as possible with the springs of action by which the minds of those are determined on whom he is more or less dependent for the comfort of his life but by interest he is at the same time diverted from any close examination into the springs by which his own conduct is determined from such knowledge he has not in any ordinary shape anything to gain—he finds not in it any source of enjoyment in any such knowledge he would be more likely to find mortification than satisfaction the purely social motives the semisocial motives and in the case of the dissocial motives such of them as have their source in an impulse given by the purely social or by the semisocial motives—these are the motives the prevalence of which he finds mentioned as matter of praise in the instance of other men it is by the supposed prevalence of these amiable motives that he finds reputation raised and that respect and goodwill in which every man is obliged to look for so large a portion of the comfort of his life in these same amiable and desirable endowments he finds the minds of other men actually abounding and overflowing abounding during their lifetime by the testimony of their friends and after their departure by the recorded testimony enregistered in some monthly magazine with the acclamation of their friends and with scarce a dissenting voice from among their enemies but the more closely he looks into the mechanism of his own mind the less of the mass of effects produced he finds referable to any of those amiable and delightful causes he finds nothing therefore to attract him towards this study—he finds much to repel him from it praise and selfsatisfaction on the score of moral worth being accordingly hopeless it is in intellectual that he will seek for it all men who are actuated by regard for anything but self are fools those only whose regard is confined to self are wise i am of the number of the wise perhaps he is a man with whom a large proportion of the selfregarding motives may be mixed up with a slight tincture of the social motives operating upon the private scale what in this case will he do in investigating the source of a given action he will in the first instance set it down the whole of it to the account of the amiable and conciliatory—in a word the social motives this in the study of his own mental physiology will always be his first step and this will commonly be his last why should he look further—why take in hand the probe—why undeceive himself and substitute a whole truth that would mortify him for a half truth that flatters him the greater the share which the motives of the social class have in the production of the general tenour of a mans conduct the less irksome it seems evident this sort of psychological selfanatomy will be the first view is pleasing and the more virtuous the man the more pleasing is that study which to every man has been pronounced the proper one but the less irksome any pursuit is the greater if the state of faculties intellectual and active permit will be a mans progress in it chapter v third cause—authoritybegotten prejudice prejudice is the name given to an opinion of any sort on any subject when considered as having been embraced without sufficient examination it is a judgment which being pronounced before evidence is therefore pronounced without evidence now at the hazard of being deceived and by deception led into a line of conduct prejudicial either to himself or to some one to whom it would rather be his wish to do service what is it that could lead a man to embrace an opinion without sufficient examination one cause is the uneasiness attendant on the labour of examination he takes the opinion up as true to save the labour that might be necessary to enable him to discern the falsity of it of the propensity to take not only facts but opinions upon trust the universality is matter of universal observation pernicious as it is in some of its applications it has its root in necessity in the weakness of the human mind in the instance of each individual the quantity of opinion which it is possible for him to give acceptance or rejection to on the ground of examination performed by himself bears but a small proportion to that in which such judgment as he passes upon it     cannot have any firmer or other ground than that which is composed of the like judgment pronounced by some other individual or aggregate of individuals the cases in which it is possible for his opinion to be homemade bear but a small proportion to the cases in which if any opinion at all be entertained by him that opinion must necessarily have been imported but in the case of the public man this necessity forms no justification either for the utterance or for the acceptance of such arguments of base alloy as those which are represented under the name of fallacies these fallacies are not less the offspring of sinister interest because the force of authority is more or less concerned where authority has a share in the production of them there are two distinguishable ways in which sinister interest may also have its share a fallacy which in the mouth of a had its root immediately in interest—in selfconscious sinister interest—receiving utterance from his pen or his lips obtains upon the credit of his authority credence among acceptors in any multitude having thus rooted itself in the minds of men it becomes constitutive of a mass of authority under favour of which such fallacies as appear conducive to the planting or rooting in the minds of men in general the erroneous notion in question obtain at the hands of other men utterance and acceptance   having received the prejudice at the hands of authority—viz of the opinion of those whose adherence to it was produced immediately or mediately by the operation of sinister interest—sinister interest operating on the mind of the utterer or acceptor of the fallacy in question prompts him to bestow on it in the character of a rational argument a degree of attention exceeding that which could otherwise have been bestowed on it he fixes accordingly his attention on all considerations the tendency of which is to procure for it utterance or acceptance and keeps at a distance all considerations by which the contrary tendency is threatened chapter vi fourth cause—selfdefence against counterfallacies the opposers of a pernicious measure may be sometimes driven to employ fallacies from their supposed utility as an answer to counterfallacies such is the nature of men they may say that these arguments weak and inconclusive as they are are those which on the bulk of the people upon whom ultimately everything depends make the strongest and most effectual impression the measure is a most mischievous one—it were a crime on our parts to leave unemployed any means not criminal that promise to be contributory to its defeat it is the weakness of the public mind not the weakness of our cause that compels us to employ such engines in the defence of it this defence might indeed be satisfactory where the fallacies in question are employed—not as substitutes but only as supplements to relevant and direct arguments but if employed as supplements to prove their being employed in that character and in that character only and that the use thus made of them is not inconsistent with sincerity two conditions seem requisite—   that arguments of the direct and relevant kind be placed in the front of the battle declared to be the main arguments the arguments and considerations by which the opposition or support to the proposed measure was produced   that on the occasion of employing the fallacies in question an acknowledgment should be made of their true character of their intrinsic weakness and of the considerations which as above seemed to impose on the individual in question the obligation of employing them and of the regret with which the consciousness of such an obligation was accompanied if even when employed in opposition to a measure really pernicious these warnings are omitted to be annexed to them the omission affords but too strong a presumption of general insincerity on the occasion in question a man would have nothing to fear from any avowal made of their true character yet he omits to make this avowal why because he foresees that on some other occasion or occasions arguments of this class will constitute his sole reliance the more closely the above considerations are adverted to the stronger is the proof which the use of such arguments without such warnings will be seen to afford of improbity or imbecility or a mixture of the two on the part of him by whom they are employed of imbecility of mind if the weakness of such arguments has really failed of becoming visible to him of improbity if conscious of their weakness and of their tendency to debilitate and pervert the faculties intellectual and moral of such persons as are swayed by them he gives currency to them unaccompanied by such warning is it of the one or of the other species of imperfection or of a mixture of both that such deceptious argumentation is evidentiary on this occasion as on others the answer is not easy nor fortunately is it material to estimate the connexion between these two divisions of the mental frame so constantly and so materially does each of them exert an   0 influence on the other that it is difficult for either to suffer but the other must suffer more or less along with it on many a wellmeaning man this base and spurious metal has no doubt passed for sterling but if you see it burnished and held up in triumph by the hands of a man of strong as well as brilliant talents—by a very master of the mint—set him down without fear of injuring him upon the list of those who deceive without having any such excuse to plead as that of having been deceived chapter vii use of these fallacies to the utterers and acceptors of them being all of them to such a degree replete with absurdity—many of them upon the face of them composed of nothing else—a question that naturally presents itself is how it has happened that they have acquired so extensive a currency—how it is that so much use has been made and continues to be made of them is it credible it may be asked that to those by whom they are employed the inanity and absurdity of them should not be fully manifest—is it credible that on such grounds political measures should proceed no it is not credible to the very person by whom the fallacy is presented in the character of a reason—of a reason on the consideration of which his opinion has been formed and on the strength of which his conduct is grounded—it has presented itself in its genuine colours but in all assemblies in which shares in power are exercised by votes there are two descriptions of persons whose convenience requires to be consulted—the speakers and the hearers to the convenience of persons in both these situations the class of arguments here in question are in an eminent degree favourable— as to the situation of the speaker—the more numerous and efficient the titles to respect which his argument enables him to produce the more convenient and agreeable is that situation made to him probity in the shape of independence—superiority in the article of wisdom—superiority in the scale of rank of all these qualities the reputation is matter of convenience to a man and of all these qualities the reputation is by these arguments promised to be made secure   as to independence—when a man stands up to speak for the purpose of reconciling men to the vote he purposes to give or for the purpose of giving to the side which he espouses whatsoever weight is regarded by him as attached to his authority—the nature of the purpose imposes on him a sort of necessity of finding something in the shape of a reason to accompany and recommend it though in fact directed and governed by some other will behind the curtain and by the interest by which that other will is governed decency is understood to require that it is from his own understanding not from the will of any other person that his own will should be understood to have received its direction but it is not by the matter of punishment or the matter of reward—it is not by fears or hopes—it is not by threats or promises—it is by something of the nature or in the shape at least of a reason that understanding is governed and determined to show then that it is by the determination of his own judgment that his conduct is determined it is deemed advisable to produce some observation or other in the character of the determinate reason from which on the occasion in question his judgment and thence his will and active faculty have received their direction the argument is accordingly produced and by this exhibition the independent character of his mind is established by irrefragable evidence to this purpose every article in the preceding catalogue may with more or less effect be made to serve according to the nature of the case   next as to superiority in the scale of wisdom—on running over the list different articles will be seen to present in this respect different degrees of convenience some of them will be seen scarcely putting in any special title to this praise in others while the reputation of prudence is secured yet it is that sort of prudence which by the timidity attached to it is rendered somewhat the less acceptable to an erect and commanding mind to this class may be referred the arguments ad metum and ad verecundiam—the hydrophobia of innovation and argument of the ghostseer whose nervous system is kept in a state of constant agitation by the phantom of jacobinism dancing before his eyes—the idolator who beholding in ancestry in authority in allegorical personages of various sorts and sizes in precedents of all sorts in great characters dead and living placed in high situations so many tyrants to whose will real or supposed blind obsequiousness at the hands of the vulgar of all classes may by apt ceremonies and gesticulation be secured makes himself the first prostration in the hope and confidence of finding it followed by much and still more devout prostration on the part of the crew of inferior idolators in whose breasts the required obsequiousness has been implanted by long practice other arguments again there are in and for the delivery of which the wisdom of the orator places itself upon higher ground his acuteness has penetrated to the very bottom     of the subject—his comprehension has embraced the whole mass of it—his adroitness has stripped the obnoxious proposal of the delusive colouring by which it had recommended itself to the eye of ignorance he pronounces it speculative theoretical romantic visionary it may be good in theory but it would be bad in practice it is too good to be practicable the goodness which glitters on the outside is sufficient proof is evidence and that conclusive of the worthlessness that is within its apparent facility suffices to prove it to be impracticable the confidence of the tone in which the decision is conveyed is at once the fruit and the sufficient evidence of the complete command which the glance of the moment sufficed to give him of the subject in all its bearings and dependencies by the experience which his situation has led him to acquire and the use which his judgment has enabled him to make of that experience he catches up at a single glance those features which suffice to indicate the class to which the obnoxious proposal belongs   by the same decision delivered in the same tone superiority of rank is not less strikingly displayed than superiority of talent it is no new observation how much the persuasion or at least the expression given to it is strengthened by the altitude of the rank as constituted or accompanied by the fullness of the purse the labour of the brain no less than that of the hand is a species of drudgery which the man of elevated station sees the propriety and facility of turning over to the baseborn crowd below—to the set of plodders whom he condescends upon occasion to honour with his conversation and his countenance by his rank and opulence he is enabled in this as in other ways to pick and choose what is most congenial to his taste by the royal hand of frederic philosophers and oranges were subjected to the same treatment and put to the same use the sweets the elaboration of which had been the work of years were elicited in a few moments by the pressure of an expert hand the praise of the receiver of wisdom is always inferior to that of the utterer but neither is the receiver so he but make due profit of what he receives without his praise the advantage he acquires from these arguments is—that of being enabled to give the reason of the faith that is or is supposed to be in him in some circumstances in which silence will not serve a man it will and to a certainty be construed into a confession of selfconvicting consciousness—consciousness that what he does is wrong and indefensible—that what he gives men to understand to be his opinion is not really his opinion—that of the supposed facts which he has been asserting to form an apparent foundation for his supposed opinion the existence is not true by a persuasion to any such effect on the part of those with whom he has to do his credit his reputation would be effectually destroyed something therefore must be said of which it may be supposed that how little soever may be the weight properly belonging to it it may have operated on his mind in the character of a reason by this means his reputation for wisdom is all that is exposed to suffer—his reputation for probity is saved thus in the case of this sort of base argument as sometimes in the case of bad money each man passes it off upon his neighbour not as being unconscious of its worthlessness—not so much as expecting his neighbour to be really insensible of its worthlessness—but in the hope and expectation that the neighbour though not insensible of its worthlessness may yet not find himself altogether debarred from the supposition that to the utterer of the base argument the badness of it may possibly not have been clearly understood but the more generally current in the character of an argument any such absurd notion is the greater is the apparent probability of its being really entertained for there is no notion actual or imaginable that a man cannot be brought to entertain if he be but satisfied of its being generally or extensively entertained by others chapter viii particular demand for fallacies under the english constitution two considerations will suffice to render it apparent that under the british constitution there cannot but exist on the one hand such a demand for fallacies—and on the other hand such a supply of them as for copiousness and variety taken together cannot be to be matched elsewhere   in the first place a thing necessary to the existence of the demand is discussion to a certain degree free where there are no such institutions as a popular assembly taking an efficient part in the government and publishing or suffering to be published accounts of its debates—nor yet any free discussion through the medium of the press—there is consequently no demand for fallacies fallacy is fraud and fraud is useless when everything may be done by force the only case which can enter into comparison with the english government is that of the angloamerican united states there on the side of the outs the demand for fallacies stands without any difference     worth noticing on a footing similar to that on which it stands under the english constitution but the side of the outs is that side on which the demand for fallacies is by much the least urgent and abundant on the side of the ins the demand for fallacies depends upon the aggregate mass of abuse its magnitude and urgency depend upon the magnitude of that mass and its variety upon the variety of the shapes in which abuse has manifested itself on crossing the water fortune gave to british america the relief that policy gave to the fox of the vermin by which she had been tormented a part were left behind no deaf auditors of the exchequer—no blind surveyors of melting irons—no nonregistering registrars of the admiralty court or of any other judicatory—no tellers by whom no money is told but that which is received into their own pockets—no judge acting as clerk under himself—no judge pocketing £ 000 ayear for useless work for which men are forced to address his clerks—no judge who in the character of judge over himself sits in one place to protect by storms of fallacy and fury the extortions and oppressions habitually committed in another—no tithegatherers exacting immense retribution for minute or neverrendered service with respect to the whole class of fallacies built upon authority—precedent wisdom of ancestors dread of innovation immutable laws and many others occasioned by ancient ignorance and ancient abuses—what readers soever there may be by whom what is to be found under those several heads has been perused to them it will readily occur that in the american congress the use made of these fallacies is not likely to be so copious as in that august assembly which as the only denomination it can with propriety be called by has been pleased to give itself that of the imperial parliament of great britain and ireland chapter ix the demand for political fallacies—how created by the state of interests in order to have a clear view of the object to which political fallacies will in the greatest number of instances be found to be directed it will be necessary to advert to the state in which with an exception comparatively inconsiderable the business of government ever has been and still continues to be in every country upon earth and for this purpose must here be brought to view a few positions the proof of which if they require any would require too large a quantity of matter for this place—positions which if not immediately assented to will at any rate even by those whom they find most adverse be allowed to possess the highest claim to attention and examination   the end or object in view to which every political measure whether established or proposed ought according to the extent of it to be directed is the greatest happiness of the greatest number of persons interested in it and that for the greatest length of time   unless the united states of north america be virtually an exception in every known state the happiness of the many has been at the absolute disposal either of the one or of the comparatively few   in every human breast—rare and shortlived ebullitions the result of some extraordinary strong stimulus or incitement excepted—selfregarding interest is predominant over social interest each persons own individual interest over the interests of all other persons taken together   in the few instances if any in which throughout the whole tenor or the general tenor of his life a person sacrifices his own individual interest to that of any other person or persons such person or persons will be a person or persons with whom he is connected by some domestic or other private and narrow tie of sympathy not the whole number or the majority of the whole number of the individuals of which the political community to which he belongs is composed   if in any political community there be any individuals by whom for a constancy the interests of all the other members put together are preferred to the interest composed of their own individual interest and that of the few persons particularly connected with them these publicspirited individuals will be so few and at the same time so impossible to distinguish from the rest that to every practical purpose they may without any practical error be laid out of the account   in this general predominance of selfregarding over social interest when attentively considered there will not be found any just subject of regret any more than of contestation for it will be found that but for this predominance no such species as that which we belong to could have existence and that supposing it if possible done away insomuch that all persons or most persons should find respectively some one or more persons whose interest was respectively through the whole of life dearer to them and as such more anxiously and constantly watched over than their own the whole species would necessarily within a very short space of time become extinct   if this be true it follows by the unchangeable constitution of human nature that in every political community by the hands by     which the supreme power over all the other members of the community is shared the interest of the many over whom the power is exercised will on every occasion in case of competition be in act or in endeavour sacrificed to the particular interest of those by whom the power is exercised   but every arrangement by which the interest of the many is sacrificed to that of the few may with unquestionable propriety if the above position be admitted and to the extent of the sacrifice be termed a bad arrangement indeed the only sort of bad arrangement—those excepted by which the interest of both parties is sacrificed   a bad arrangement considered as already established and in existence is or may be termed an abuse  0 in so far as any competition is seen or supposed to have place the interests of the subject many being on every occasion as above in act or in endeavour constantly sacrificed by the ruling few to their own particular interests—hence with the ruling few a constant object of study and endeavour is the preservation and extension of the mass of abuse at any rate such is the constant propensity    in the mass of abuse which because it is so constantly their interest it is constantly their endeavour to preserve is included not only that portion from which they derive a direct and assignable profit but also that portion from which they do not derive any such profit for the mischievousness of that from which they do not derive any such direct and particular profit cannot be exposed but by facts and observations which if pursued would be found to apply also to that portion from which they do derive direct and particular profit thus it is that in every community all men in power—or in one word the ins—are by selfregarding interest constantly engaged in the maintenance of abuse in every shape in which they find it established    but whatsoever the ins have in possession the outs have in expectancy thus far therefore there is no distinction between the sinister interests of the ins and those of the outs nor consequently in the fallacies by which they respectively employ their endeavours in the support of their respective sinister interests    thus far the interests of the outs coincide with the interest of the ins but there are other points in which their interests are opposite for procuring for themselves the situations and mass of advantages possessed by the ins the outs have one and but one mode of proceeding this is the raising their own place in the scale of political reputation as compared with that of the ins for effecting this ascendency they have accordingly two correspondent modes the raising their own and the depreciating that of their successful rivals    in addition to that particular and sinister interest which belongs to them in their quality of ruling members these rivals have their share in the universal interest which belongs to them in their quality of members of the community at large in this quality they are sometimes occupied in such measures as in their eyes are necessary for the maintenance of the universal interest—for the preservation of that portion of the universal happiness of which their regard for their own interests does not seem to require the sacrifice for the preservation and also for the increase of it for by every increase given to it they derive advantage to themselves not only in that character which is common to them with all the other members of the community but in the shape of reputation in that character of ruling members which is peculiar to themselves    but in whatsoever shape the ins derive reputation to themselves and thus raise themselves to a higher level in the scale of comparative reputation it is the interest of the outs as such not only to prevent them from obtaining this rise but if possible and as far as possible to cause their reputation to sink hence on the part of the outs there exists a constant tendency to oppose all good arrangements proposed by the ins but generally speaking the better an arrangement really is the better it will generally be thought to be and the better it is thought to be the higher will the reputation of its supporters be raised by it in so far therefore as it is in their power the better a new arrangement proposed by the ins is the stronger is the interest by which the outs are incited to oppose it but the more obviously and indisputably good it is when considered in itself the more incapable it is of being successfully opposed in the way of argument otherwise than by fallacies and hence in the aggregate mass of political fallacies may be seen the character and general description of that portion of it which is employed chiefly by the outs    in respect and to the extent of their share in the universal interest an arrangement which is beneficial to that interest will be beneficial to themselves and thus supposing it successful the opposition made by them to the arrangement would be prejudicial to themselves on the supposition therefore of the success of such opposition they would have to consider which in their eyes would be the greater advantage—their share in the advantage of the arrangement or the advantage promised to them by the rise of their place in the comparative scale of reputation by the elevation given to themselves and the depression caused to their adversaries     but generally speaking in a constitution such as the english in its present state the chances are in a prodigious degree against the success of any opposition made by the outs to even the most flagrantly bad measure of the ins much more of course to a really good one hence it is that when the arrangement is in itself good if with any prospect of success or advantage any of the fallacies belonging to their side can be brought up against the arrangement and this without prejudice to their own reputation—they have nothing to stand in the way of the attempt    in respect of those bad arrangements which by their sinister interest the ins stand engaged to promote and in the promotion of which the outs have as above a community of interest—the part dictated by their sinister interest is a curious and delicate one by success they would lessen that mass of sinister advantage which being that of their antagonists in possession is theirs in expectancy they have therefore their option to make between this disadvantage and the advantage attached to a correspondent advance in the scale of comparative reputation but their situation securing to them little less than a certainty of failure they are therefore as to this matter pretty well at their ease at the same time seeing that whatsoever diminution from the mass of abuse they were to propose in the situation of outs they could not without loss of reputation unless for some satisfactory reason avoid bringing forward or at least supporting in the event of their changing places with the ins—hence it is that any such defalcation which they can in general prevail upon themselves to propose will in general be either spurious and fallacious or at best inadequate—inadequate—and by its inadequacy and the virtual confession involved in it giving support and confirmation to every portion of kindred abuse which it leaves untouched chapter x different parts which may be borne in relation to fallacies as in the case of bad money so in the case of bad arguments in the sort and degree of currency which they experience different persons acting so many different parts are distinguishable fabricator utterer acceptor these are the different parts acted in the currency given to a bad shilling these are the parts acted on the occasion of the currency given to a bad argument in the case of a bad argument he who is fabricator must be utterer likewise or in general it would not make its appearance but for one fabricator who is an utterer there may be utterers in any number no one of whom was fabricator in the case of the bad argument as in the case of the bad shilling in the instance of each actor the mind is with reference to the nature and tendency of the transaction capable of bearing different aspects which for purposes of practical importance it becomes material to distinguish—   evil consciousness in the language of roman lawyers dolus in the language of roman and thence of english lawyers mala fides   blameable ignorance or inattention say in one word temerity in the same language sometimes culpa sometimes temeritas   blameless agency actus which notwithstanding any mischief that may have been the casual result of it was free of blame—by these several denominations are characterized so many habitudes of which with relation to any pernicious result the mind is susceptible in the case of the argument as in the case of the shilling where the mind is in that state in which the charge of evilconsciousness may with propriety be made that which the man is conscious of is the badness of the article which he has in hand in general it is in the case of the fabricator that the mind is least apt to be free from the imputation of evilconsciousness be it the bad shilling—be it the bad argument—the making of it will have cost more or less trouble which trouble generally speaking the fabricator will not have taken but in the design of utterance and in the expectation of making by means of such utterance some advantage in the instance of the bad shilling it is certain—in the instance of the bad argument it is more or less probable more probable in the case of the fabricator than in the case of the mere utterer—that the badness of it was known and understood it is certainly possible that the badness of the argument may never have been perceived by the fabricator or that the bad argument may have been framed without any intention of applying it to bad purposes but in general the more a man is exposed to the action of sinister interest the more reason there is for charging him with evilconsciousness supposing him to be aware of the action of the sinister interest however the action of the sinister interest may have been either perceived or unperceived—for without a certain degree of attention a man no more perceives what is passing in his own than what is passing in other minds—the book that lies open before him though it be the object nearest to him and though he be ever so much in the habit of reading may even while two eyes are fixed upon it be read or not read according as it happens that circumstances have or have not called his attention to the contents     the action of a sinister interest may have been immediate or unimmediate immediate it may have been perceived or not perceived unimmediate it has almost to a certainty been unperceived sinister interest has two media through which it usually operates these are prejudice and authority and hence we have for the immediate progeny of sinister interest interestbegotten prejudice and authoritybegotten prejudice in what case soever a bad argument has owed its fabrication or its utterance to sinister interest and that interest is not at the time of fabrication or utterance perceived it has for its immediate parent either inbred prejudice or authority of the three operations thus intimately connected—viz fabrication utterance and acceptance—that the two first are capable of having evilconsciousness for their accompaniment is obvious as to acceptance a distinction must be made before an answer can be given to the question whether it is accompanied with evilconsciousness it may be distinguished into interior and exterior where the opinion how false soever is really believed to be true by the person to whom it has been presented the acceptance given to it may be termed internal where whether by discourse by department or other tokens a belief of its having experienced an internal acceptance at his hands is with or without design on his part entertained by other persons in so far may it be said to have experienced at his hands an external acceptance in the natural state of things both these modes of acceptance have place together upon the internal the external mode follows as a natural consequence either of them is however capable of having place without the other feeling the force of an argument i may appear as if i had not felt it not having received any impression from it i may appear as if i had received an impression of greater or less strength whichever best suits my purpose it is sufficiently manifest that evilconsciousness cannot be the accompaniment of internal acceptance but it may be an accompaniment and actually is the accompaniment of external acceptance as often as the external has not for its accompaniment the internal acceptance supposing the argument such that the appellation of fallacy is justly applicable to it whatsoever part is borne in relation to it—viz fabrication utterance or acceptance—may with propriety be ascribed to want of probity or want of intelligence hitherto the distinction appears plain and broad enough but upon a closer inspection a sort of a mixed or a middle state between that of evilconsciousness and that of pure temerity—between that of improbity and that of imbecility—may be observed this is where the persuasive force of the argument admits of different degrees—as when an argument which operates with a certain degree of force on the utterers mind is in the utterance given to it represented as acting with a degree of force to any amount more considerable thus a man who considers his opinion as invested only with a certain degree of probability may speak of it as of a matter of absolute certainty the persuasion he thus expresses is not absolutely false but it is exaggerated and this exaggeration is a species of falsehood the more frequent the trumpeter of any fallacy is in its performance the greater the progress which his mind is apt to make from the state of evilconsciousness to the state of temerity—from the state of improbity to the state of imbecility that is imbecility with respect to the subjectmatter it is said of gamblers that they begin their career as dupes and end as thieves in the present case the parties begin with craft and end with delusion a phenomenon the existence of which seems to be out of dispute is that of a liar by whom a lie of his own invention has so often been told as true that at length it has come to be accepted as such even by himself but if such is the case with regard to a statement composed of words every one of which finds itself in manifest contradiction to some determinate truth it may be imagined how much more easily and consequently how much more frequently it may come to be the case in regard to a statement of such nicety and delicacy as that of the strength of the impression made by this or that instrument of persuasion of which the persuasive force is susceptible of innumerable degrees no one of which has ever yet been distinguished from any other by any externally sensible signs or tokens in the form of discourse or otherwise if substitution of irrelevant arguments to relevant ones is evidence of a bad cause and of consciousness of the badness of that bad cause much more is the substitution of application made to the will to applications made to the understanding—of the matter of punishment or reward to the matter of argument arguments addressed to the understanding may if fallacious be answered and any mischief they had a tendency to produce be prevented by counterarguments addressed to the understanding against arguments addressed to the will those addressed to the understanding are altogether without effect and the mischief produced by them is without remedy     chapter xi uses of the preceding exposure but of these disquisitions concerning the state and character of the mind of those by whom these instruments of deception are employed what it may be asked is the practical use the use is the opposing such check as it may be in the power of reason to apply to the practice of employing these poisoned weapons in proportion as the virtue of sincerity is an object of love and veneration the opposite vice is held in abhorrence—the more generally and intimately the public in general are satisfied of the insincerity of him by whom the arguments in question are employed in that same proportion will be the efficiency of the motives by the force of which a man is withheld from employing these arguments suppose the deceptious and pernicious tendency of these arguments and thence the improbity of him who employs them in such sort held up to view as to find the minds of men sufficiently sensible of it—and suppose that in the public mind in general virtue in the form of sincerity is an object of respect vice in the opposite form an object of aversion and contempt—the practice of this species of improbity will become as rare as is the practice of any other species of improbity to which the restrictive action of the same moral power is in the habit of applying itself with the same force if on this occasion the object were to prove the deceptious nature and inconclusiveness of these arguments the exposure thus given of the mental character of the persons by whom they are employed would not have any just title to be received into the body of evidence applicable to this purpose be the improbity of the persons by whom these arguments are employed ever so glaring the arguments themselves are exactly what they are—neither better nor worse to employ as a medium of proof for demonstrating the impropriety of the arguments the improbity of him by whom they are uttered is an expedient which stands itself upon the list of fallacies and which in the foregoing pages has been brought to view but on the present occasion and for the present purpose the impropriety as well as the mischievousness of these arguments is supposed to be sufficiently established on other and those unexceptionable grounds the object in view now is to determine by what means an object so desirable as the general disuse of these poisonous weapons may in the completest and most effectual degree be attained now the mere utterance of these base arguments is not the only—it is not so much as the principal mischief in the case it is the reception of them in the character of conclusive or influential arguments that constitutes the principal and only ultimate mischief to the object of making men ashamed to utter them must therefore be added the ulterior object of making men ashamed to receive them—ashamed as often as they are observed to see or hear them—ashamed to be known to turn towards them any other aspect than that of aversion and contempt but if the practice of insincerity be a practice which a man ought to be ashamed of so is the practice of giving encouragement to—of forbearing to oppose discouragement to that vice and to this same desirable and useful end does that man most contribute by whom the immorality of the practice is held up to view in the strongest and clearest colours nor upon reflection will the result be found so hopeless as at first sight might be supposed in the most numerous assembly that ever sat in either house perhaps not a single individual could be found by whom in the company of a chaste and wellbred female an obscene word was ever uttered and if the frown of indignation were as sure to be drawn down upon the offender by an offence against this branch of the law of probity as by an offence against the law of delicacy transgression would not be less effectually banished from both those great public theatres than it is already from the domestic circle if of the fallacies in question the tendency be really pernicious—whosoever he be who by lawful and unexceptionable means of any kind shall have contributed to this effect will thereby have rendered to his country and to mankind good service but whosoever he be who to the intellectual power adds the moderate portion of pecuniary power necessary in his power it lies completely to render this good service in any printed report of the debates of the assembly in question supposing any such instruments of deception discoverable in each instance in which any such instrument is discoverable let him at the bottom of the page by the help of the usual marks of reference give intimation of it describing it for instance if it be of the number of those which are included in the present list by the name by which it stands designated in this list or by any more apt and clearly designative denomination that can be found for it the want of sufficient time for adequate discussion when carried on orally in a numerous assembly has in no inconsiderable extent been held out by experience in the character of a real and serious evil to this evil the table of fallacies furnishes to

the french revolution by jeremy bentham   0 advertisement the following papers are now first published in english from mr benthams mss the substance of them has previously been published in french by dumont     an examination of the declaration of the rights of the man and the citizen decreed by the constituent assembly in france preamble the representatives of the french people constituted in national assembly considering that ignorance forgetfulness or contempt of the rights of man are the only causes of public calamities and of the corruption of governments have resolved to set forth in a solemn declaration the natural unalienable and sacred rights of man in order that this declaration constantly presented to all the members of the body social may recall to mind without ceasing their rights and their duties to the end that the acts of the legislative power and those of the executive power being capable at every instant of comparison with the end of every political institution they may be more respected and also that the demands of the citizens hereafter founded upon simple and incontestable principles may always tend to the maintenance of the constitution and to the happiness of all in consequence the national assembly acknowledges and declares in the presence and under the auspices of the supreme being the following rights of the man and the citizen— from this preamble we may collect the following positions—   that the declaration in question ought to include a declaration of all the powers which it is designed should thereafter subsist in the state the limits of each power precisely laid down and every one completely distinguished from the other   that the articles by which this is to be done ought not to be loose and scattered but closely connected into a whole and the connexion all along made visible   that the declaration of the rights of man in a state preceding that of political society ought to form a part of the composition in question and constitute the first part of it   that in point of fact a clear idea of all these stands already imprinted in the minds of every man   that therefore the object of such a draught is not in any part of such a draught to teach the people anything new   but that the object of such a declaration is to declare the accession of the assembly as such to the principles as understood and embraced as well by themselves in their individual capacity as by all other individuals in the state   that the use of this solemn adoption and recognition is that the principles recognised may serve as a standard by which the propriety of the several particular laws that are afterwards to be enacted in consequence may be tried   that by the conformity of these laws to this standard the fidelity of the legislators to their trust is also to be tried   that accordingly if any law should hereafter be enacted between which and any of those fundamental articles any want of conformity in any point can be pointed out such want of conformity will be a conclusive proof of two things   of the impropriety of such law   of error or criminality on the part of the authors and adopters of that law it concerns me to see so respectable an assembly hold out expectations which according to my conception cannot in the nature of things be fulfilled an enterprise of this sort instead of preceding the formation of a complete body of laws supposes such a work to be already existing in every particular except that of its obligatory force no laws are ever to receive the sanction of the assembly that shall be contrary in any point to these principles what does this suppose it supposes the several articles of detail that require to be enacted to have been drawn up to have been passed in review to have been confronted with these fundamental articles and to have been found in no respect     repugnant to them in a word to be sufficiently assured that the several laws of detail will bear this trying comparison one thing is necessary the comparison must have been made to know the several laws which the exigencies of mankind call for a view of all these several exigencies must be obtained but to obtain this view there is but one possible means which is to take a view of the laws that have already been framed and of the exigencies which have given birth to them to frame a composition which shall in any tolerable degree answer this requisition two endowments it is evident are absolutely necessary—an acquaintance with the law as it is and the perspicuity and genius of the metaphysician and these endowments must unite in the same person i can conceive but four purposes which a discourse of the kind proposed under the name of a declaration of rights can be intended to answer—the setting bounds to the authority of the crown—the setting bounds to the authority of the supreme legislative power that of the national assembly—the serving as a general guide or set of instructions to the national assembly itself in the task of executing their function in detail by the establishment of particular laws—and the affording a satisfaction to the people these four purposes seem if i apprehend right to be all of them avowed by the same or different advocates for this measure of the fourth and last of these purposes i shall say nothing it is a question merely local—dependent upon the humour of the spot and of the day of which no one at a distance can be a judge of the fitness of the end there can be but one opinion the only question is about the fitness of the means in the three other points of view the expediency of the measure is more than i can perceive the description of the persons of whose rights it is to contain the declaration is remarkable who are they the french nation no not they only but all citizens and all men by citizens it seems we are to understand men engaged in political society by men persons not yet engaged in political society—persons as yet in a state of nature the word men as opposed to citizens i had rather not have seen in this sense a declaration of the rights of men is a declaration of the rights which human creatures it is supposed would possess were they in a state in which the french nation certainly are not nor perhaps any other certainly no other into whose hands this declaration could ever come this instrument is the more worthy of attention especially of the attention of a foreigner inasmuch as the rights which it is to declare are the rights which it is supposed belong to the members of every nation in the globe as a member of a nation which with relation to the french comes under the name of a foreign one i feel the stronger call to examine this declaration inasmuch as in this instrument i am invited to read a list of rights which belong as much to me as to the people for whose more particular use it has been framed the word men i observe to be all along coupled in the language of the assembly itself with the word citizen i lay it therefore out of the question and consider the declaration in the same light in which it is viewed by m turgot as that of a declaration of the rights of all men in a state of citizenship or political society i proceed then to consider it in the three points of view above announced—   can it be of use for the purpose of setting bounds to the power of the crown no for that is to be the particular object of the constitutional code itself from which this preliminary part is detached in advance   can it be of use for the purpose of setting bounds to the power of the several legislative bodies established or to be established i answer no   not of any subordinate ones for of their authority the natural and necessary limit is that of the supreme legislature the national assembly   not of the national assembly itself—why   such limitation is unnecessary it is proposed and very wisely and honestly to call in the body of the people and give it as much power and influence as in its nature it is capable of by enabling it to declare its sentiments whenever it thinks proper whether immediately or through the channel of the subordinate assemblies is a law enacted or proposed in the national assembly which happens not to be agreeable to the body of the people it will be equally censured by them whether it be conceived or not to bear marks of a repugnancy to this declaration of rights is a law disagreeable to them they will hardly think themselves precluded from expressing their disapprobation by the circumstance of its not being to be convicted of repugnancy to that instrument and though it should be repugnant to that instrument they will see little need to resort to that instrument for the ground of their repugnancy they will find a much nearer ground in some particular real or imaginary inconvenience in short when you have made such provision that the supreme legislature can never carry any point against the general and persevering opinion of the people what would you have more what use in their attempting to bind themselves by a set of phrases     of their own contrivance the peoples pleasure that is the only check to which no other can add anything and which no other can supersede in regard to the rights thus declared mention will either be made of the exceptions and modifications that may be made to them by the laws themselves or there will not in the former case the observance of the declaration will be impracticable nor can the law in its details stir a step without flying in the face of it in the other case it fails thereby altogether of its only object the setting limits to the exercise of the legislative power suppose a declaration to this effect—no mans liberty shall be abridged in any point this it is evident would be an useless extravagance which must be contradicted by every law that came to be made suppose it to say—no mans liberty shall be abridged but in such points as it shall be abridged in by the law this we see is saying nothing it leaves the law just as free and unfettered as it found it between these two rocks lies the only choice which an instrument destined to this purpose can have is an instrument of this sort produced we shall see it striking against one or other of them in every line the first is what the framers will most guard against in proportion to their reach of thought and to their knowledge in this line when they hit against the other it will be by accident and unawares lastly it cannot with any good effect answer the only remaining intention viz that of a check to restrain as well as to guide the legislature itself in the penning of the laws of detail that are to follow the mistake has its source in the current logic and in the want of attention to the distinction between what is first in the order of demonstration and what is first in the order of invention principles it is said ought to precede consequences and the first being established the others will follow of course what are the principles here meant general propositions and those of the widest extent what by consequences particular propositions included under those general ones that this order is favourable to demonstration if by demonstration be meant personal debate and argumentation is true enough why because if you can once get a man to admit the general proposition he cannot without incurring the reproach of inconsistency reject a particular proposition that is included in it but that this order is not the order of conception of investigation of invention is equally undeniable in this order particular propositions always precede general ones the assent to the latter is preceded by and grounded on the assent to the former if we prove the consequences from the principle it is only from the consequences that we learn the principle apply this to laws the first business according to the plan i am combating is to find and declare the principles the laws of a fundamental nature that done it is by their means that we shall be enabled to find the proper laws of detail i say no it is only in proportion as we have formed and compared with one another the laws of detail that our fundamental laws will be exact and fit for service is a general proposition true it is because all the particular propositions that are included under it are true how then are we to satisfy ourselves of the truth of the general one by having under our eye all the included particular ones what then is the order of investigation by which true general propositions are formed we take a number of less extensive—of particular propositions find some points in which they agree and from the observation of these points form a more extensive one a general one in which they are all included in this way we proceed upon sure grounds and understand ourselves as we go in the opposite way we proceed at random and danger attends every step no law is good which does not add more to the general mass of felicity than it takes from it no law ought to be made that does not add more to the general mass of felicity than it takes from it no law can be made that does not take something from liberty those excepted which take away in the whole or in part those laws which take from liberty propositions to the first effect i see are true without any exception propositions to the latter effect i see are not true till after the particular propositions intimated by the exceptions are taken out of it these propositions i have attained a full satisfaction of the truth of how by the habit i have been in for a course of years of taking any law at pleasure and observing that the particular proposition relative to that law was always conformable to the fact announced by the general one so in the other example i discerned in the first instance in a faint way that two classes would serve to comprehend all laws laws which take from liberty in their immediate operation and laws which in the same way destroy in part or in the whole the operation of the former the perception was at first obscure owing to the difficulty of ascertaining what constituted in every case a law and of tracing out its operation by repeated trials i came at last to be able to show of any law which offered itself that it came under one or other of those classes what follows that the proper order is—first to digest the laws of detail and when     they are settled and found to be fit for use then and not till then to select and frame in terminis by abstraction such propositions as may be capable of being given without selfcontradiction as fundamental laws what is the source of this premature anxiety to establish fundamental laws it is the old conceit of being wiser than all posterity—wiser than those who will have had more experience—the old desire of ruling over posterity—the old recipe for enabling the dead to chain down the living in the case of a specific law the absurdity of such a notion is pretty well recognised yet there the absurdity is much less than here of a particular law the nature may be fully comprehended—the consequences foreseen of a general law this is the less likely to be the case the greater the degree in which it possesses the quality of a general one by a law of which you are fully master and see clearly to the extent of you will not attempt to bind succeeding legislators the law you pitch upon in preference for this purpose is one which you are unable to see to the end of ought no such general propositions then to be ever framed till after the establishment of a complete code i do not mean to assert this on the contrary in morals as in physics nothing is to be done without them the more they are framed and tried the better only when framed they ought to be well tried before they are ushered abroad into the world in the character of laws in that character they ought not to be exhibited till after they have been confronted with all the particular laws to which the force of them is to apply but if the intention be to chain down the legislator these will be all the laws without exception which are looked upon as proper to be inserted in the code for the interdiction meant to be put upon him is unlimited he is never to establish any law which shall disagree with the pattern cut out for him—which shall ever trench upon such and such rights such indigested and premature establishments betoken two things—the weakness of the understanding and the violence of the passions the weakness of the understanding in not seeing the insuperable incongruities which have been above stated—the violence of the passions which betake themselves to such weapons for subduing opposition at any rate and giving to the will of every man who embraces the proposition imported by the article in question a weight beyond what is its just and intrinsic due in vain would man seek to cover his weakness by positive and assuming language the expression of one opinion the expression of one will is the utmost that any proposition can amount to ought and ought not can and can not shall and shall not all put together can never amount to anything more no law ought to be made which will lessen upon the whole the mass of general felicity when i a legislator or private citizen say this what is the simple matter of fact that is expressed this and this only that a sentiment of dissatisfaction is excited in my breast by any such law so again—no law shall be made which will lessen upon the whole the mass of general felicity what does this signify that the sentiment of dissatisfaction in me is so strong as to have given birth to a determined will that no such law should ever pass and that determination so strong as to have produced a resolution on my part to oppose myself as far as depends on me to the passing of it should it ever be attempted—a determination which is the more likely to meet with success in proportion to the influence which in the character of legislator or any other my mind happens to possess over the minds of others no law can be made which will do as above what does this signify the same will as before only wrapped up in an absurd and insidious disguise my will is here so strong that as a means of seeing it crowned with success i use my influence with the persons concerned to persuade them to consider a law which at the same time i suppose to be made in the same point of view as if it were not made and consequently to pay no more obedience to it than if it were the command of an unauthorized individual to compass this design i make the absurd choice of a term expressive in its original and proper import of a physical impossibility in order to represent as impossible the very event of the occurrence of which i am apprehensive—occupied with the contrary persuasion i raise my voice to the people—tell them the thing is impossible and they are to have the goodness to believe me and act in consequence a law to the effect in question is a violation of the natural and indefeasible rights of man what does this signify that my resolution of using my utmost influence in opposition to such a law is wound up to such a pitch that should any law be ever enacted which in my eyes appears to come up to that description my determination is to behave to the persons concerned in its enactment as any man would behave towards those who had been guilty of a notorious and violent infraction of his rights if necessary i would corporally oppose them—if necessary in short i would endeavour to kill them just as to save my own life i would endeavour to kill any one who was endeavouring to kill me these several contrivances for giving to an increase in vehemence the effect of an increase in strength of argument may be styled bawling upon paper it proceeds from     the same temper and the same sort of distress as produces bawling with the voice that they should be such efficacious recipes is much to be regretted that they will always be but too much so is much to be apprehended but that they will be less and less so as intelligence spreads and reason matures is devoutly to be wished and not unreasonably to be hoped for as passions are contagious and the bulk of men are more guided by the opinions and pretended opinions of others than by their own a large share of confidence with a little share of argument will he apt to go farther than all the argument in the world without confidence and hence it is that modes of expression like these which owe the influence they unhappily possess to the confidence they display have met with such general reception that they should fall into discredit is if the reasons above given have any force devoutly to be wished and for the accomplishing this good end there cannot be any method so effectual—or rather there cannot be any other method than that of unmasking them in the manner here attempted the phrases can and can not are employed in this way with greater and more pernicious effect inasmuch as over and above physical and moral impossibility they are made use of with much less impropriety and violence to denote legal impossibility in the language of the law speaking in the character of the law they are used in this way without ambiguity or inconvenience such a magistrate cannot do so and so that is he has no power to do so and so if he issue a command to such an effect it is no more to be obeyed than if it issued from any private person but when the same expression is applied to the very power which is acknowledged to be supreme and not limited by any specific institution clouds of ambiguity and confusion roll on in a torrent almost impossible to be withstood shuffled backwards and forwards amidst these three species of impossibility—physical legal and moral—the mind can find no restingplace it loses its footing altogether and becomes an easy prey to the violence which wields these arms the expedient is the more powerful inasmuch as where it does not succeed so far as to gain a man and carry him over to that side it will perplex him and prevent his finding his way to the other it will leave him neutral though it should fail of making him a friend it is the better calculated to produce this effect inasmuch as nothing can tend more powerfully to draw a man altogether out of the track of reason and out of sight of utility the only just standard for trying all sorts of moral questions of a positive assertion thus irrational the natural effect where it fails of producing irrational acquiescence is to produce equally irrational denial by which no light is thrown upon the subject nor any opening pointed out through which light may come i say the law cannot do so and so you say it can when we have said thus much on each side it is to no purpose to say more there we are completely at a stand argument such as this can go no further on either side—or neither yields—or passion triumphs alone—the stronger sweeping the weaker away change the language and instead of cannot put ought not—the case is widely different the moderate expression of opinion and will intimated by this phrase leads naturally to the inquiry after a reason—and this reason if there be any at bottom that deserves the name is always a proposition of fact relative to the question of utility such a law ought not to be established because it is not consistent with the general welfare—its tendency is not to add to the general stock of happiness i say it ought not to be established that is i do not approve of its being established the emotion excited in my mind by the idea of its establishment is not that of satisfaction but the contrary how happens this because the production of inconvenience more than equivalent to any advantage that will ensue presents itself to my conception in the character of a probable event now the question is put as every political and moral question ought to be upon the issue of fact and manking are directed into the only true track of investigation which can afford instruction or hope of rational argument the track of experiment and observation agreement to be sure is not even then made certain—for certainty belongs not to human affairs but the track which of all others bids fairest for leading to agreement is pointed out a clue for bringing back the travellers in case of doubt or difficulty is presented and at any rate they are not struck motionless at the first step nothing would be more unjust or more foreign to my design than taking occasion from anything that has been said to throw particular blame upon particular persons reproach which strikes everybody hurts nobody and common error where it does not according to the maxim of english law produce common right is productive at least of common exculpation     a critical examination of the declaration of rights preliminary observations the declaration of rights—i mean the paper published under that name by the french national assembly in     —assumes for its subjectmatter a field of disquisition as unbounded in point of extent as it is important in its nature but the more ample the extent given to any proposition or string of propositions the more difficult it is to keep the import of it confined without deviation within the bounds of truth and reason if in the smallest corners of the field it ranges over it fail of coinciding with the line of rigid rectitude no sooner is the aberration pointed out than inasmuch as there is no medium between truth and falsehood its pretensions to the appellation of a truism are gone and whoever looks upon it must recognise it to be false and erroneous—and if as here political conduct be the theme so far as the error extends and fails of being detected pernicious in a work of such extreme importance with a view to practice and which throughout keeps practice so closely and immediately and professedly in view a single error may be attended with the most fatal consequences the more extensive the propositions the more consummate will be the knowledge the more exquisite the skill indispensably requisite to confine them in all points within the pale of truth the most consummate ability in the whole nation could not have been too much for the task—one may venture to say it would not have been equal to it but that in the sanctioning of each proposition the most consummate ability should happen to be vested in the heads of the sorry majority in whose hands the plenitude of power happened on that same occasion to be vested is an event against which the chances are almost as infinity to one here then is a radical and allpervading error—the attempting to give to a work on such a subject the sanction of government especially of such a government—a government composed of members so numerous so unequal in talent as well as discordant in inclinations and affections had it been the work of a single hand and that a private one and in that character given to the world every good effect would have been produced by it that could be produced by it when published as the work of government without any of the bad effects which in case of the smallest error must result from it when given as the work of government the revolution which threw the government into the hands of the penners and adopters of this declaration having been the effect of insurrection the grand object evidently is to justify the cause but by justifying it they invite it in justifying past insurrection they plant and cultivate a propensity to perpetual insurrection in time future they sow the seeds of anarchy broadcast in justifying the demolition of existing authorities they undermine all future ones their own consequently in the number shallow and reckless vanity—they imitate in their conduct the author of that fabled law according to which the assassination of the prince upon the throne gave to the assassin a title to succeed him people behold your rights if a single article of them be violated insurrection is not your right only but the most sacred of your duties such is the constant language for such is the professed object of this source and model of all laws—this selfconsecrated oracle of all nations the more abstract—that is the more extensive the proposition is the more liable is it to involve a fallacy of fallacies one of the most natural modifications is that which is called begging the question—the abuse of making the abstract proposition resorted to for proof a lever for introducing in the company of other propositions that are nothing to the purpose the very proposition which is admitted to stand in need of proof is the provision in question fit in point of expediency to be passed into a law for the government of the french nation that mutatis mutandis would have been the question put in england that was the proper question to have been put in relation to each provision it was proposed should enter into the composition of the body of french laws     instead of that as often as the utility of a provision appeared by reason of the wideness of its extent for instance of a doubtful nature the way taken to clear the doubt was to assert it to be a provision fit to be made law for all men—for all frenchmen—and for all englishmen for example into the bargain this medium of proof was the more alluring inasmuch as to the advantage of removing opposition was added the pleasure the sort of titillation so exquisite to the nerve of vanity in a french heart—the satisfaction to use a homely but not the less apposite proverb of teaching grandmothers to suck eggs hark ye citizens of the other side of the water can you tell us what rights you have belonging to you no that you cant its we that understand rights not our own only but yours into the bargain while you poor simple souls know nothing about the matter hasty generalization the great stumblingblock of intellectual vanity—hasty generalization the rock that even genius itself is so apt to split upon—hasty generalization the bane of prudence and of science in the british houses of parliament more especially in the most efficient house for business there prevails a wellknown jealousy of and repugnance to the voting of abstract propositions this jealousy is not less general than reasonable a jealousy of abstract propositions is an aversion to whatever is beside the purpose—an aversion to impertinence the great enemies of public peace are the selfish and dissocial passions—necessary as they are—the one to the very existence of each individual the other to his security on the part of these affections a deficiency in point of strength is never to be apprehended all that is to be apprehended in respect of them is to be apprehended on the side of their excess society is held together only by the sacrifices that men can be induced to make of the gratifications they demand to obtain these sacrifices is the great difficulty the great task of government what has been the object the perpetual and palpable object of this declaration of pretended rights to add as much force as possible to these passions already but too strong—to burst the cords that hold them in—to say to the selfish passions there—everywhere—is your prey—to the angry passions there—everywhere—is your enemy such is the morality of this celebrated manifesto rendered famous by the same qualities that gave celebrity to the incendiary of the ephesian temple the logic of it is of a piece with its morality—a perpetual vein of nonsense flowing from a perpetual abuse of words—words having a variety of meanings where words with single meanings were equally at hand—the same words used in a variety of meanings in the same page—words used in meanings not their own where proper words were equally at hand—words and propositions of the most unbounded signification turned loose without any of those exceptions or modifications which are so necessary on every occasion to reduce their import within the compass not only of right reason but even of the design in hand of whatever nature it may be—the same inaccuracy the same inattention in the penning of this cluster of truths on which the fate of nations was to hang as if it had been an oriental tale or an allegory for a magazine—stale epigrams instead of necessary distinctions—figurative expressions preferred to simple ones—sentimental conceits as trite as they are unmeaning preferred to apt and precise expressions—frippery ornament preferred to the majestic simplicity of good sound sense—and the acts of the senate loaded and disfigured by the tinsel of the playhouse in a play or a novel an improper word is but a word and the impropriety whether noticed or not is attended with no consequences in a body of laws—especially of laws given as constitutional and fundamental ones—an improper word may be a national calamity—and civil war may be the consequence of it out of one foolish word may start a thousand daggers imputations like these may appear general and declamatory—and rightly so if they stood alone but they will be justified even to satiety by the details that follow scarcely an article which in rummaging it will not be found a true pandoras box in running over the several articles i shall on the occasion of each article point out in the first place the errors it contains in theory and then in the second place the mischiefs it is pregnant with in practice the criticism is verbal—true but what else can it be words—words without a meaning or with a meaning too flatly false to be maintained by anybody are the stuff it is made of look to the letter you find nonsense—look beyond the letter you find nothing article i men all men are born and remain free and equal in respect of rights social distinctions cannot be founded but upon common utility in this article are contained grammatically speaking two distinct sentences the first is full of error the other of ambiguity in the first are contained four distinguishable propositions all of them false—all of them notoriously and undeniably false—   that all men are born free   that all men remain free       that all men are born equal in rights   that all men remain i e remain for ever for the proposition is indefinite and unlimited equal in rights all men are born free all men remain free no not a single man not a single man that ever was or is or will be all men on the contrary are born in subjection and the most absolute subjection—the subjection of a helpless child to the parents on whom he depends every moment for his existence in this subjection every man is born—in this subjection he continues for years—for a great number of years—and the existence of the individual and of the species depends upon his so doing what is the state of things to which the supposed existence of these supposed rights is meant to bear reference—a state of things prior to the existence of government or a state of things subsequent to the existence of government if to a state prior to the existence of government what would the existence of such rights as these be to the purpose even if it were true in any country where there is such a thing as government if to a state of things subsequent to the formation of government—it in a country where there is a government in what single instance—in the instance of what single government is it true setting aside the case of parent and child let any man name that single government under which any such equality is recognised all men born free absurd and miserable nonsense when the great complaint—a complaint made perhaps by the very same people at the same time is—that so many men are born slaves oh but when we acknowledge them to be born slaves we refer to the laws in being which laws being void as being contrary to those laws of nature which are the efficient causes of those rights of man that we are declaring the men in question are free in one sense though slaves in another—slaves and free at the same time—free in respect of the laws of nature—slaves in respect of the pretended human laws which though called laws are no laws at all as being contrary to the laws of nature for such is the difference—the great and perpetual difference betwixt the good subject the rational censor of the laws and the anarchist—between the moderate man and the man of violence the rational censor acknowledging the existence of the law he disapproves proposes the repeal of it the anarchist setting up his will and fancy for a law before which all mankind are called upon to bow down at the first word—the anarchist trampling on truth and decency denies the validity of the law in question—denies the existence of it in the character of a law and calls upon all mankind to rise up in a mass and resist the execution of it whatever is is—was the maxim of descartes who looked upon it as so sure as well as so instructive a truth that everything else which goes by the name of truth might be deduced from it the philosophical vortexmaker—who however mistaken in his philosophy and his logic was harmless enough at least—the manufacturer of identical propositions and celestial vortices—little thought how soon a part of his own countrymen fraught with pretensions as empty as his own and as mischievous as his were innocent would contest with him even this his favourite and fundamental maxim by which everything else was to be brought to light whatever is is not—is the maxim of the anarchist as often as anything comes across him in the shape of a law which he happens not to like cruel is the judge says lord bacon who in order to enable himself to torture men applies torture to the law still more cruel is the anarchist who for the purpose of effecting the subversion of the laws themselves as well as the massacre of the legislators tortures not only the words of the law but the very vitals of the language all men are born equal in rights the rights of the heir of the most indigent family equal to the rights of the heir of the most wealthy in what case is this true i say nothing of hereditary dignities and powers inequalities such as these being proscribed under and by the french government in france are consequently proscribed by that government under every other government and consequently have no existence anywhere for the total subjection of every other government to french government is a fundamental principle in the law of universal independence—the french law yet neither was this true at the time of issuing this declaration of rights nor was it meant to be so afterwards the   th article which we shall come to in its place proceeds on the contrary supposition for considering its other attributes inconsistency could not be wanting to the list it can scarcely be more hostile to all other laws than it is at variance with itself all men i e all human creatures of both sexes remain equal in rights all men meaning doubtless all human creatures the apprentice then is equal in rights to his master he has as much liberty with relation to the master as the master has with relation to him he has as much right to command and to punish him he is as much owner and master of the masters house as the master himself the case is the same as between ward and guardian so again as between wife and husband the madman has as good a right to confine anybody else as anybody else has to confine him the idiot has as much right to govern everybody as anybody can have to govern him the physician and the nurse when called in by the next friend     of a sick man seized with a delirium have no more right to prevent his throwing himself out of the window than he has to throw them out of it all this is plainly and incontestably included in this article of the declaration of rights in the very words of it and in the meaning—if it have any meaning was this the meaning of the authors of it—or did they mean to admit this explanation as to some of the instances and to explain the article away as to the rest not being idiots nor lunatics nor under a delirium they would explain it away with regard to the madman and the man under a delirium considering that a child may become an orphan as soon as it has seen the light and that in that case if not subject to government it must perish they would explain it away i think and contradict themselves in the case of guardian and ward in the case of master and apprentice i would not take upon me to decide it may have been their meaning to proscribe that relation altogether—at least this may have been the case as soon as the repugnancy between that institution and this oracle was pointed out for the professed object and destination of it is to be the standard of truth and falsehood of right and wrong in everything that relates to government but to this standard and to this article of it the subjection of the apprentice to the master is flatly and diametrically repugnant if it do not proscribe and exclude this inequality it proscribes none if it do not do this mischief it does nothing so again in the case of husband and wife amongst the other abuses which the oracle was meant to put an end to may for aught i can pretend to say have been the institution of marriage for what is the subjection of a small and limited number of years in comparison of the subjection of a whole life yet without subjection and inequality no such institution can by any possibility take place for of two contradictory wills both cannot take effect at the same time the same doubts apply to the case of master and hired servant better a man should starve than hire himself—better half the species starve than hire itself out to service for where is the compatibility between liberty and servitude how can liberty and servitude subsist in the same person what good citizen is there that would hesitate to die for liberty and as to those who are not good citizens what matters it whether they live or starve besides that every man who lives under this constitution being equal in rights equal in all sorts of rights is equal in respect to rights of property no man therefore can be in any danger of starving—no man can have so much as that motive weak and inadequate as it is for hiring himself out to service sentence   social distinctions cannot be founded but upon common utility—this proposition has two or three meanings according to one of them the proposition is notoriously false according to another it is in contradiction to the four propositions that preceded it in the same sentence what is meant by social distinctions what is meant by can what is meant by founded what is meant by social distinctions—distinctions not respecting equality—then these are nothing to the purpose distinctions in respect of equality—then consistently with the preceding propositions in this same article they can have no existence not existing they cannot be founded upon anything the distinctions above exemplified are they in the number of the social distinctions here intended not one of them as we have been seeing but has subjection—not one of them but has inequality for its very essence what is meant by can—can not be founded but upon common utility is it meant to speak of what is established or of what ought to be established does it mean that no social distinctions but those which it approves as having the foundation in question are established anywhere or simply that none such ought to be established anywhere or that if the establishment or maintenance of such dispositions by the laws be attempted anywhere such laws ought to be treated as void and the attempt to execute them to be resisted for such is the venom that lurks under such words as can and can not when set up as a check upon the laws—they contain all these three so perfectly distinct and widely different meanings in the first the proposition they are inserted into refers to practice and makes appeal to observation—to the observation of other men in regard to a matter of fact in the second it is an appeal to the approving faculty of others in regard to the same matter of fact in the third it is no appeal to anything or to anybody but a violent attempt upon the liberty of speech and action on the part of others by the terrors of anarchical despotism rising up in opposition to the laws it is an attempt to lift the dagger of the assassin against all individuals who presume to hold an opinion different from that of the orator or the writer and against all governments which presume to support any such individuals in any such presumption in the first of these imports the proposition is perfectly harmless but it is commonly so untrue so glaringly untrue so palpably untrue even to drivelling that it must be plain to everybody it can never have been the meaning that was intended in the second of these imports the proposition may be true or not as it may happen and at any rate is equally innocent but it is  00 such as will not answer the purpose for an opinion that leaves others at liberty to be of a contrary one will never answer the purpose of the passions and if this had been the meaning intended not this ambiguous phraseology but a clear and simple one presenting this meaning and no other would have been employed the third which may not improperly be termed the ruffianlike or threatening import is the meaning intended to be presented to the weak and timid while the two innocent ones of which one may even be reasonable are held up before it as a veil to blind the eyes of the discerning reader and screen from him the mischief that lurks beneath can and can not when thus applied—can and can not when used instead of ought and ought not—can and can not when applied to the binding force and effect of laws—not of the acts of individuals nor yet of the acts of subordinate authority but of the acts of the supreme government itself are the disguised cant of the assassin after them there is nothing but do him betwixt the preparation for murder and the attempt they resemble that instrument which in outward appearance is but an ordinary staff but which within that simple and innocent semblance conceals a dagger these are the words that speak daggers—if daggers can be spoken they speak daggers and there remains nothing but to use them look where i will i see but too many laws the alteration or abolition of which would in my poor judgment be a public blessing i can conceive some—to put extreme and scarcely exampled cases—to which i might be inclined to oppose resistance with a prospect of support such as promised to be effectual but to talk of what the law the supreme legislature of the country acknowledged as such can not do—to talk of a void law as you would of a void order or a void judgment—the very act of bringing such words into conjunction is either the vilest of nonsense or the worst of treasons—treason not against one branch of the sovereignty but against the whole treason not against this or that government but against all governments article ii the end in view of every political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man these rights are liberty property security and resistance to oppression sentence   the end in view of every political association is the preservation of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man more confusion—more nonsense—and the nonsense as usual dangerous nonsense the words can scarcely be said to have a meaning but if they have or rather if they had a meaning these would be the propositions either asserted or implied—   that there are such things as rights anterior to the establishment of governments for natural as applied to rights if it mean anything is meant to stand in opposition to legal—to such rights as are acknowledged to owe their existence to government and are consequently posterior in their date to the establishment of government   that these rights can not be abrogated by government for can not is implied in the form of the word imprescriptible and the sense it wears when so applied is the cutthroat sense above explained   that the governments that exist derive their origin from formal associations or what are now called conventions associations entered into by a partnership contract with all the members for partners—entered into at a day prefixed for a predetermined purpose the formation of a new government where there was none before for as to formal meetings holden under the controul of an existing government they are evidently out of question here in which it seems again to be implied in the way of inference though a necessary and an unavoidable inference that all governments that is selfcalled governments knots of persons exercising the powers of government that have had any other origin than an association of the above description are illegal that is no governments at all resistance to them and subversion of them lawful and commendable and so on such are the notions implied in this first part of the article how stands the truth of things that there are no such things as natural rights—no such things as rights anterior to the establishment of government—no such things as natural rights opposed to in contradistinction to legal that the expression is merely figurative that when used in the moment you attempt to give it a literal meaning it leads to error and to that sort of error that leads to mischief—to the extremity of mischief we know what it is for men to live without government—and living without government to live without rights we know what it is for men to live without government for we see instances of such a way of life—we see it in many savage nations or rather races of mankind for instance among the savages of new south wales whose way of living is so well known to us no habit of obedience and thence no government—no government and thence no laws—no laws and thence no such things as rights—no security—no property—liberty as against regular controul the controul of laws and government—perfect but as against all irregular controul the mandates of stronger individuals none in this state at a time earlier than the commencement  0  of history—in this same state judging from analogy we the inhabitants of the part of the globe we call europe were—no government consequently no rights no rights consequently no property—no legal security—no legal liberty security not more than belongs to beasts—forecast and sense of insecurity keener—consequently in point of happiness below the level of the brutal race in proportion to the want of happiness resulting from the want of rights a reason exists for wishing that there were such things as rights but reasons for wishing there were such things as rights are not rights—a reason for wishing that a certain right were established is not that right—want is not supply—hunger is not bread that which has no existence cannot be destroyed—that which cannot be destroyed cannot require anything to preserve it from destruction natural rights is simple nonsense natural and imprescriptible rights rhetorical nonsense—nonsense upon stilts but this rhetorical nonsense ends in the old strain of mischievous nonsense for immediately a list of these pretended natural rights is given and those are so expressed as to present to view legal rights and of these rights whatever they are there is not it seems any one of which any government can upon any occasion whatever abrogate the smallest particle so much for terrorist language what is the language of reason and plain sense upon this same subject that in proportion as it is right or proper i e advantageous to the society in question that this or that right—a right to this or that effect—should be established and maintained in that same proportion it is wrong that it should be abrogated but that as there is no right which ought not to be maintained so long as it is upon the whole advantageous to the society that it should be maintained so there is no right which when the abolition of it is advantageous to society should not be abolished to know whether it would be more for the advantage of society that this or that right should be maintained or abolished the time at which the question about maintaining or abolishing is proposed must be given and the circumstances under which it is proposed to maintain or abolish it the right itself must be specifically described not jumbled with an undistinguishable heap of others under any such vague general terms as property liberty and the like one thing in the midst of all this confusion is but too plain they know not of what they are talking under the name of natural rights and yet they would have them imprescriptible—proof against all the power of the laws—pregnant with occasions summoning the members of the community to rise up in resistance against the laws what then was their object in declaring the existence of imprescriptible rights and without specifying a single one by any such mark as it could be known by this and no other—to excite and keep up a spirit of resistance to all laws—a spirit of insurrection against all governments—against the governments of all other nations instantly—against the government of their own nation—against the government they themselves were pretending to establish—even that as soon as their own reign should be at an end in us is the perfection of virtue and wisdom in all mankind besides the extremity of wickedness and folly our will shall consequently reign without controul and for ever reign now we are living—reign after we are dead all nations—all future ages—shall be for they are predestined to be our slaves future governments will not have honesty enough to be trusted with the determination of what rights shall be maintained what abrogated—what laws kept in force what repealed future subjects i should say future citizens for french government does not admit of subjects will not have wit enough to be trusted with the choice whether to submit to the determination of the government of their time or to resist it governments citizens—all to the end of time—all must be kept in chains such are their maxims—such their premises—for it is by such premises only that the doctrine of imprescriptible rights and unrepealable laws can be supported what is the real source of these imprescriptible rights—these unrepealable laws power turned blind by looking from its own height selfconceit and tyranny exalted into insanity no man was to have any other man for a servant yet all men were forever to be their slaves making laws with imposture in their mouths under pretence of declaring them—giving for laws anything that came uppermost and these unrepealable ones on pretence of finding them ready made made by what not by a god—they allow of none but by their goddess nature the origination of governments from a contract is a pure fiction or in other words a falsehood it never has been known to be true in any instance the allegation of it does mischief by involving the subject in error and confusion and is neither necessary nor useful to any good purpose all governments that we have any account of have been gradually established by habit after having been formed by force unless in the instance of governments formed by individuals who have been emancipated or have emancipated themselves from governments already formed the governments under which  0  they were born—a rare case and from which nothing follows with regard to the rest what signifies it how governments are formed is it the less proper—the less conducive to the happiness of society—that the happiness of society should be the one object kept in view by the members of the government in all their measures is it the less the interest of men to be happy—less to be wished that they may be so—less the moral duty of their governors to make them so as far as they can at mogadore than at philadelphia whence is it but from government that contracts derive their binding force contracts came from government not government from contracts it is from the habit of enforcing contracts and seeing them enforced that governments are chiefly indebted for whatever disposition they have to observe them sentence   these rights these imprescriptible as well as natural rights are liberty property security and resistance to oppression observe the extent of these pretended rights each of them belonging to every man and all of them without bounds unbounded liberty that is amongst other things the liberty of doing or not doing on every occasion whatever each man pleases—unbounded property that is the right of doing with everything around him with every thing at least if not with every person whatsoever he pleases communicating that right to anybody and withholding it from anybody—unbounded security that is security for such his liberty for such his property and for his person against every defalcation that can be called for on any account in respect of any of them—unbounded resistance to oppression that is unbounded exercise of the faculty of guarding himself against whatever unpleasant circumstance may present itself to his imagination or his passions under that name nature say some of the interpreters of the pretended law of nature—nature gave to each man a right to everything which is in effect but another way of saying—nature has given no such right to anybody for in regard to most rights it is as true that what is every mans right is no mans right as that what is every mans business is no mans business nature gave—gave to every man a right to everything—be it so—true and hence the necessity of human government and human laws to give to every man his own right without which no right whatsoever would amount to anything nature gave every man a right to everything before the existence of laws and in default of laws this nominal universality and real nonentity of right set up provisionally by nature in default of laws the french oracle lays hold of and perpetuates it under the law and in spite of laws these anarchical rights which nature had set out with democratic art attempts to rivet down and declares indefeasible unbounded liberty—i must still say unbounded liberty—for though the next article but one returns to the charge and gives such a definition of liberty as seems intended to set bounds to it yet in effect the limitation amounts to nothing and when as here no warning is given of any exception in the texture of the general rule every exception which turns up is not a confirmation but a contradiction of the rule—liberty without any preannounced or intelligible bounds and as to the other rights they remain unbounded to the end rights of man composed of a system of contradictions and impossibilities in vain would it be said that though no bounds are here assigned to any of these rights yet it is to be understood as taken for granted and tacitly admitted and assumed that they are to have bounds viz such bounds as it is understood will be set them by the laws vain i say would be this apology for the supposition would be contradictory to the express declaration of the article itself and would defeat the very object which the whole declaration has in view it would be selfcontradictory because these rights are in the same breath in which their existence is declared declared to be imprescriptible and imprescriptible or as we in england should say indeteasible means nothing unless it exclude the interference of the laws it would be not only inconsistent with itself but inconsistent with the declared and sole object of the declaration if it did not exclude the interference of the laws it is against the laws themselves and the laws only that this declaration is levelled it is for the hands of the legislator and all legislators and none but legislators that the shackles it provides are intended—it is against the apprehended encroachments of legislators that the rights in question the liberty and property and so forth are intended to be made secure—it is to such encroachments and damages and dangers that whatever security it professes to give has respect precious security for unbounded rights against legislators if the extent of those rights in every direction were purposely left to depend upon the will and pleasure of those very legislators nonsensical or nugatory and in both cases mischievous such is the alternative so much for all these pretended indefeasible rights in the lump their inconsistency with each other as well as the inconsistency of them in the character of indefeasible rights with the existence of government and all peaceable society will appear still more plainly when we examine them one by one   liberty then is imprescriptible—incapable  0  of being taken away—out of the power of any government ever to take away liberty—that is every branch of liberty—every individual exercise of liberty for no line is drawn—no distinction—no exception made what these instructors as well as governors of mankind appear not to know is that all rights are made at the expense of liberty—all laws by which rights are created or confirmed no right without a correspondent obligation liberty as against the coercion of the law may it is true be given by the simple removal of the obligation by which that coercion was applied—by the simple repeal of the coercing law but as against the coercion applicable by individual to individual no liberty can be given to one man but in proportion as it is taken from another all coercive laws therefore that is all laws but constitutional laws and laws repealing or modifying coercive laws and in particular all laws creative of liberty are as far as they go abrogative of liberty not here and there a law only—not this or that possible law but almost all laws are therefore repugnant to these natural and imprescriptible rights consequently null and void calling for resistance and insurrection and so on as before laws creative of rights of property are also struck at by the same anathema how is property given by restraining liberty that is by taking it away so far as is necessary for the purpose how is your house made yours by debarring every one else from the liberty of entering it without your leave but   property property stands second on the list—proprietary rights are in the number of the natural and imprescriptible rights of man—of the rights which a man is not indebted for to the laws and which cannot be taken from him by the laws men—that is every man for a general expression given without exception is an universal one has a right to property to proprietary rights a right which cannot be taken away from him by the laws to proprietary rights good but in relation to what subject for as to proprietary rights—without a subject to which they are referable—without a subject in or in relation to which they can be exercised—they will hardly be of much value they will hardly be worth taking care of with so much solemnity in vain would all the laws in the world have ascertained that i have a right to something if this be all they have done for me—if there be no specific subject in relation to which my proprietary rights are established i must either take what i want without right or starve as there is no such subject specified with relation to each man or to any man indeed how could there be the necessary inference taking the passage literally is that every man has all manner of proprietary rights with relation to every subject of property without exception in a word that every man has a right to every thing unfortunately in most matters of property what is every mans right is no mans right so that the effect of this part of the oracle if observed would be not to establish property but to extinguish it—to render it impossible ever to be revived and this is one of the rights declared to be imprescriptible it will probably be acknowledged that according to this construction the clause in question is equally ruinous and absurd—and hence the inference may be that this was not the construction—this was not the meaning in view but by the same rule every possible construction which the words employed can admit of might be proved not to have been the meaning in view nor is this clause a whit more absurd or ruinous than all that goes before it and a great deal of what comes after it and in short if this be not the meaning of it what is give it a sense—give it any sense whatever—it is mischievous—to save it from that imputation there is but one course to take which is to acknowledge it to be nonsense thus much would be clear if anything were clear in it that according to this clause whatever proprietary rights whatever property a man once has no matter how being imprescriptible can never be taken away from him by any law or of what use or meaning is the clause so that the moment it is acknowledged in relation to any article that such article is my property no matter how or when it became so that moment it is acknowledged that it can never be taken away from me therefore for example all laws and all judgments whereby anything is taken away from me without my free consent—all taxes for example and all fines—are void and as such call for resistance and insurrection and so forth as before   security security stands the third on the list of these natural and imprescriptible rights which laws did not give and which laws are not in any degree to be suffered to take away under the head of security liberty might have been included so likewise property since security for liberty or the enjoyment of liberty may be spoken of as a branch of security—security for property or the enjoyment of proprietary rights as another security for person is the branch that seems here to have been understood—security for each mans person as against all those hurtful or disagreeable impressions exclusive of those which consist in the mere disturbance of the enjoyment of liberty by which a man is affected in his person loss of life—loss of limbs—loss of the use of limbs—wounds bruises and the like all laws  0  are null and void then which on any account or in any manner seek to expose the person of any man to any risk—which appoint capital or other corporal punishment—which expose a man to personal hazard in the service of the military power against foreign enemies or in that of the judicial power against delinquents—all laws which to preserve the country from pestilence authorize the immediate execution of a suspected person in the event of his transgressing certain bounds   resistance to oppression fourth and last in the list of natural and imprescriptible rights resistance to oppression—meaning i suppose the right to resist oppression what is oppression power misapplied to the prejudice of some individual what is it that a man has in view when he speaks of oppression some exertion of power which he looks upon as misapplied to the prejudice of some individual—to the producing on the part of such individual some suffering to which whether as forbidden by the laws or otherwise we conceive he ought not to have been subjected but against everything that can come under the name of oppression provision has been already made in the manner we have seen by the recognition of the three preceding rights since no oppression can fall upon a man which is not an infringement of his rights in relation to liberty rights in relation to property or rights in relation to security as above described where then is the difference—to what purpose this fourth clause after the three first to this purpose the mischief they seek to prevent the rights they seek to establish are the same the difference lies in the nature of the remedy endeavoured to be applied to prevent the mischief in question the endeavour of the three former clauses is to tie the hand of the legislator and his subordinates by the fear of nullity and the remote apprehension of general resistance and insurrection the aim of this fourth clause is to raise the hand of the individual concerned to prevent the apprehended infraction of his rights at the moment when he looks upon it as about to take place whenever you are about to be oppressed you have a right to resist oppression whenever you conceive yourself to be oppressed conceive yourself to have a right to make resistance and act accordingly in proportion as a law of any kind—any act of power supreme or subordinate legislative administrative or judicial is unpleasant to a man especially if in consideration of such its unpleasantness his opinion is that such act of power ought not to have been exercised he of course looks upon it as oppression as often as anything of this sort happens to a man—as often as anything happens to a man to inflame his passions—this article for fear his passions should not be sufficiently inflamed of themselves sets itself to work to blow the flame and urges him to resistance submit not to any decree or other act of power of the justice of which you are not yourself perfectly convinced if a constable call upon you to serve in the militia shoot the constable and not the enemy—if the commander of a pressgang trouble you push him into the sea—if a bailiff throw him out of the window if a judge sentence you to be imprisoned or put to death have a dagger ready and take a stroke first at the judge article iii the principle of every sovereignty government resides essentially in the nation no body of men—no single individual—can exercise any authority which does not expressly issue from thence of the two sentences of which this article is composed the first is perfectly true perfectly harmless and perfectly uninstructive government and obedience go hand in hand where there is no obedience there is no government in proportion as obedience is paid the powers of government are exercised this is true under the broadest democracy this is equally true under the most absolute monarchy this can do no harm—can do no good anywhere i speak of its natural and obvious import taken by itself and supposing the import of the word principle to be clear and unambiguous as it is to be wished that it were that is taking it to mean efficient cause of power on the one part obedience on the other is most certainly everywhere the efficient cause but being harmless it would not answer the purpose as delivered by the immediately succeeding sentence being harmless this meaning is not that which was in view it is meant as an antecedent proposition on which the next proposition is grounded in the character of a consequent no body of men no individual can exercise any authority which does not issue from the nation in an express manner can—still the ambiguous and envenomed can what cannot they in point of fact cannot they exercise authority over other people if and so long as other people submit to it this cannot be their meaning this cannot be the meaning not because it is an untrue and foolish one but because it contributes nothing to the declared purpose the meaning must be here as elsewhere that of every authority not issuing from the nation in an express manner every act is void consequently ought to be treated as such—resisted risen up against and overthrown issuing from the nation in an express manner is having been conferred by the nation by a formal act in the exercise of which the nation i e the whole nation joined  0  an authority issues from the nation in one sense in the ordinary implied manner which the nation submits to the exercise of having been in the habit of submitting to it every man as long as he can remember or to some superior authority from which it is derived but this meaning it was the evident design of the article to put a negative upon for it would not have answered the disorganizing purpose all along apparent and more than once avowed it is accordingly for the purpose of putting a negative upon it that the word expressément—in an express way or manner—is subjoined every authority is usurped and void to which a man has been appointed in any other mode than that of popular election and popular election made by the nation—that is the whole nation for no distinction or division is intimated in each case and this is expressly declared to be the case not only in france under the government of france but everywhere and under every government whatsoever consequently all the acts in every government in europe for example are void excepted perhaps or rather not excepted two or three of the swiss cantons—the persons exercising the powers of government in these countries usurpers—resistance to them and insurrection against them lawful and commendable the french government itself not excepted—whatever is has been or is to be the government of france issue from the nation that is from the whole nation for no part of it is excluded women consequently included and children—children of every age for if women and children are not part of the nation what are they cattle indeed how can a single soul be excluded when all men—all human creatures—are and are to be equal in regard to rights—in regard to all sorts of rights without exception or reserve article iv liberty consists in being able to do that which is not hurtful to another and therefore the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no other bounds than those which insure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights these bounds cannot be determined but by the law in this article three propositions are included— proposition   liberty consists in being able to do that which is not hurtful to another what in that and nothing else is not the liberty of doing mischief liberty if not what is it and what word is there for it in the language or in any language by which it can be spoken of how childish how repugnant to the ends of language is this perversion of language—to attempt to confine a word in common and perpetual use to an import to which nobody ever confined it before or will continue to confine it and so i am never to know whether i am at liberty or not to do or to omit doing one act till i see whether or no there is anybody that may be hurt by it—till i see the whole extent of all its consequences liberty what liberty—as against what power as against coercion from what source as against coercion issuing from the law—then to know whether the law have left me at liberty in any respect in relation to any act i am to consult not the words of the law but my own conception of what would be the consequences of the act if among these consequences there be a single one by which anybody would be hurt then whatever the law says to me about it i am not at liberty to do it i am an officer of justice appointed to superintend the execution of punishments ordered by justice—if i am ordered to cause a thief to be whipped—to know whether i am at liberty to cause the sentence to be executed i must know whether whipping would hurt the thief if it would then i am not at liberty to whip the thief—to inflict the punishment which it is my duty to inflict proposition   and therefore the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no other bounds than those which insure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of those same rights has no other bounds where is it that it has no other bounds in what nation—under what government if under any government then the state of legislation under that government is in a state of absolute perfection if there be no such government then by a confession necessarily implied there is no nation upon earth in which this definition is conformable to the truth proposition   these bounds cannot be determined but by the law more contradiction more confusion what then—this liberty this right which is one of four rights that existed before laws and will exist in spite of all that laws can do owes all the boundaries it has all the extent it has to the laws till you know what the laws say to it you do not know what there is of it nor what account to give of it and yet it existed and that in full force and vigour before there were any such things as laws and so will continue to exist and that for ever in spite of anything which laws can do to it still the same inaptitude of expressions—still the same confusion of that which it is supposed is with that which it is conceived ought to be what says plain truth upon this subject what is the sense most approaching to this nonsense the liberty which the law ought to allow of and leave in existence—leave uncoerced unremoved—is the liberty which concerns those acts only by which if exercised no  0  damage would be done to the community upon the whole that is either no damage at all or none but what promises to be compensated by at least equal benefit accordingly the exercise of the rights allowed to and conferred upon each individual ought to have no other bounds set to it by the law than those which are necessary to enable it to maintain every other individual in the possession and exercise of such rights as it is consistent with the greatest good of the community that he should be allowed the marking out of these bounds ought not to be left to anybody but the legislator acting as such—that is to him or them who are acknowledged to be in possession of the sovereign power that is it ought not to be left to the occasional and arbitrary declaration of any individual whatever share he may possess of subordinate authority the word autrui—another is so loose—making no distinction between the community and individuals—as according to the most natural construction to deprive succeeding legislators of all power of repressing by punishment or otherwise any acts by which no individual sufferers are to be found and to deprive them beyond a doubt of all power of affording protection to any man woman or child against his or her own weakness ignorance or imprudence article v the law has no right to forbid any other actions than such as are hurtful to society whatever is not forbidden by the law cannot be hindered nor can any individual be compelled to do that which the law does not command sentence   the law has no right na le droit to forbid any other actions than such as are hurtful to society the law has no right na le droit not ne peut pas this for once is free from ambiguity here the mask of ambiguity is thrown off the avowed object of this clause is to preach constant insurrection to raise up every man in arms against every law which he happens not to approve of for take any such action you will if the law have no right to forbid it a law forbidding it is null and void and the attempt to execute it an oppression and resistance to such attempt and insurrection in support of such resistance legal justifiable and commendable to have said that no law ought to forbid any act that is not of a nature prejudical to society would have answered every good purpose but would not have answered the purpose which is intended to be answered here a government which should fulfil the expectations here held out would be a government of absolute perfection the instance of a government fulfilling these expectations never has taken place nor till men are angels ever can take place against every government which fails in any degree of fulfilling these expectations then it is the professed object of this manifesto to excite insurrection here as elsewhere it is therefore its direct object to excite insurrection at all times against every government whatsoever sentence   whatever is not forbidden by the law cannot be hindered nor can any individual be compelled to do what the law does not command the effect of this law for want of the requisite exceptions or explanations is to annihilate for the time being and for ever all powers of command all power the exercise of which consists in the issuing and inforcing obedience to particular and occasional commands domestic power power of the police judicial power military power power of superior officers in the line of civil administration over their subordinates if i say to my son do not mount that horse which you are not strong enough to manage if i say to my daughter do not go to that pond where there are young men bathing they may set me at defiance bidding me show them where there are anything about mounting unruly horses or going where there are young men bathing in the laws by the same clause they may each of them justify themselves in turning their backs upon the lesson i have given them while my apprentice refuses to do the work i have given him and my wife instead of providing the meals i had desired her to provide for ourselves and family tells me she thinks fit to go and dine elsewhere in the existing order of things under any other government than that which was here to be organized whatever is commanded or forbidden in virtue of a power which the law allows of and recognises is virtually and in effect commanded and forbidden by the law itself since by the support it gives to the persons in question in the exercise of their respective authorities it shows itself to have adopted those commands and considered them as its own before they are issued and that whatever may be the purport of them so long as they are confined within the limits it has marked out but all these existing governments being fundamentally repugnant to the rights of man are null and void and incapable of filling up this or any other gap in the texture of the new code besides this right of not being hindered from doing anything which the law itself has not forbidden nor compelled to do anything which it has not commanded is an article of natural unalienable sacred and imprescriptible right over which political laws have no sort of power so that the attempt to fill up the gap and to establish any such power of commanding or forbidding what is not already commanded and forbidden by the  0  law would be an act of usurpation and all such powers so attempted to be established null and void how also can any such powers subsist in a society of which all the members are free and equal in point of rights admit however that room is given for the creation of the powers in question by the spirit though not by the letter of this clause—what follows that in proportion as it is harmless it is insignificant and incapable of answering its intended purpose this purpose is to protect individuals against oppressions to which they might be subjected by other individuals possessed of powers created by the law in the exercise or pretended exercise of those powers but if these powers are left to the determination of succeeding and according to the doctrine of this code inferior legislatures and may be of any nature and to any extent which these legislatures may think fit to give them—what does the protection here given amount to especially as against such future legislatures for whose hands all the restraints which it is the object of the declaration to provide are intended mischievous or nugatory is still the alternative the employment of the improper word can instead of the proper word shall is not unworthy of observation shall is the language of the legislator who knows what he is about and aims at nothing more—can when properly employed in a book of law is the language of the private commentator or expositor drawing inferences from the text of the law—from the acts of the legislator or what takes the place of the acts of the legislator—the practice of the courts of justice article vi the law is the expression of the general will every citizen has the right of concurring in person or by his representatives in the formation of it it ought to be the same for all whether it protect or whether it punish all the citizens being equal in its eyes are equally admissible to all dignities public places and employments according to their capacity and without any other distinction than that of their virtues and their talents this article is a hodgepodge containing a variety of provisions as wide from one another as any can be within the whole circuit of the law some relating to the constitutional branch some to the civil some to the penal and in the constitutional department some relating to the organization of the supreme power others to that of the subordinate branches proposition   the law is the expression of the general will the law what law is the expression of the general will where is it so in what country—at what period of time in no country—at no period of time—in no other country than france—nor even in france as to general it means universal for there are no exceptions made—women children madmen criminals—for these being human creatures have already been declared equal in respect of rights nature made them so and even were it to be wished that the case were otherwise natures work being unalterable and the rights unalienable it would be to no purpose to attempt it what is certain is that in any other nation at any rate no such thing as a law ever existed to which this definition could be applied but that is nothing to the purpose since a favourite object of this effusion of universal benevolence is to declare the governments of all other countries dissolved and to persuade the people that the dissolution has taken place but anywhere—even in france—how can the law be the expression of the universal or even the general will of all the people when by far the greater part have never entertained any will or thought at all about the matter and of those who have a great part as is the case with almost all laws made by a large assembly would rather it had not taken place sentence   every citizen has the right of concurring in person or by his representatives in the formation of it here the language changes from the enunciation of the supposed practice to the enunciation of the supposed matter of right why does it change after having said so silly a thing as that there is no law anywhere but what was the expression of the will of every member of the community what should have hindered its going on in the same silly strain and saying that everybody did concur—did join in the formation of it however as the idea of right is in this second sentence at any rate presented by its appropriate term the ambiguity diffused by the preceding sentence is dissipated and now it appears beyond a doubt that every law in the formation of which any one citizen was debarred from concurring either in person or by his representatives is and ever will be here and there and everywhere a void law to characterize proxies the french language like the english has two words—representatives and deputies the one liable to misconstruction the other not—to misconstruction and such misconstruction as to be made expressive of a sense directly opposite to that which appears here to have been intended the one tainted with fiction as well as ambiguity the other expressing nothing but the plain truth being so superior to imitation—so free to choose—not tied down by usage as people in britain are—how come they to have taken the english word representatives which has given occasion to  0  so many quibbles instead of their own good word deputies which cannot give occasion to anything like a quibble the king of great britain is acknowledged to be the representative of the british nation in treating with foreign powers but does the whole nation ever meet together and join in signing an authority to him so to do the king of great britain is acknowledged in this instance to represent the british nation but in this instance is it ever pretended that he has been deputed by it the parliamentary electors have been said to represent the nonelectors and the members of parliament to represent both but did anybody ever speak of either members or electors as having been deputed by the nonelectors using the improper word representatives instead of the proper word deputies the french might be saddled with the british constitution for anything there is in this clause to protect them from so horrible a grievance representatives sounded better perhaps than deputies men who are governed by sounds sacrifice everything to sound they neither know the value of precision nor are able to attain it sentence   it the law ought to be the same for all whether it protect or whether it punish—i e as well in respect of the protection it affords as in respect of the punishment it inflicts this clause appears reasonable in the main but in respect to certain points it may be susceptible of explanations and exceptions from the discussion of which it might have been as well if all posterity had not been debarred as to protection english law affords a punishment which consists in being put out of the protection of the law in virtue of which a man is debarred from applying for redress from any kind of injury for my own part i do not approve of any such punishment but perhaps they do who having it in their power to abrogate it yet retain it in france i suppose it is approved of where in a much severer form than the english it has been so much practised this species of punishment is inhibited for ever by the letter at least of this clause as to the spirit of it one of the ruling features of this composition from end to end is that the spirit of it is incomprehensible under the english law heavier damages are given in many instances to the ministers of justice acting as such in case of illfounded prosecutions against them for supposed injuries to individuals than would be given to private individuals aggrieved by prosecutions for the same injuries the notion evidently is that the servants of the public not having so strong an interest in defending the rights of the public as individuals have in defending their own the public man would be apt to be deterred from doing his duty if the encouragement he have to do it were no greater than the encouragement which the individual has to defend his right these examples not to plunge further into details appear sufficient to suggest a reasonable doubt whether even in this instance the smacksmooth equality which rolls so glibly out of the lips of the rhetorician be altogether compatible with that undeviating conformity to every bend and turn in the line of utility which ought to be the object of the legislator as to punishment a rule as strictly subordinate to the dictates of utility as the doctrine of undeviating equality is congenial to the capricious play of the imagination is not in any instance to employ more punishment than is necesary to the purpose where as between two individuals the measure of sensibility is different a punishment which in name—that is according to every description which could be given of it in and by the law would be equal in the two instances—would in effect be widely different fifty lashes may in the estimation of the law be equal to fifty lashes but it is what no man can suppose that the suffering which a hardworking young man or even a young woman of the hardworking class would undergo from the application of fifty lashes could be really equal in intensity to that which must have been endured from the same nominal punishment were even the instrument and force applied the same by the countess lapuchin till then the favourite and one of the finest ornaments of the court of a russian empress banishment would upon the face of the law be equal to banishment but it will not readily be admitted that to a servant of the public who happens to have nothing to live upon but a salary the receipt of which depends upon attendance at his office it would be no greater punishment than to a sturdy labourer who in one country as well as in another may derive an equal livelihood from the labour of his hands those if any such there are to whom distinctions such as these would appear consonant to reason and utility might perhaps regard them as not irreconcilable with the language of this clause but others might think them either not reasonable or though reasonable not thus reconcilable and were any such distinctions to be ingrafted into the law by any succeeding legislators those who did not approve of the alteration would if at all actuated by any regard to the tenor and spirit of this declaration raise a cry of aristocracy and pronounce the alteration void and then comes resistance and insurrection and all the evils in their train sentence   all the citizens being equal in its eyes are all of them admissible to all dignities public places and employments  0  according to their capacity and without any other distinction than that of their virtues and their talents this is one of the few clauses not to say the only one which does not seem liable to very serious objection there is nothing to object to in its general spirit and meaning though perhaps there is something as to the expression in general it were to be wished that no class of men should stand incapacitated with regard to any object of competition by any general law nor can anything be said in favour of those hereditary incapacitations which suggested and provoked this clause yet as governments are constituted and as the current of opinion runs there may be cases where some sorts of incapacitation in regard to office seem called for by the purpose which operated as the final cause in the institution of the office it seems hardly decent or consistent for example to allow to a jew the faculty of presenting to a christian benefice with cure of souls though by a judgment of no very ancient date the law of england was made to lend its sanction to an appointment of this sort as inconsistent does it appear to admit a catholic patron to appoint to a protestant or a protestant to a catholic benefice at least so long as diversities in matters of religious profession continue to have illwill for their accompaniment ecclesiastical patronage in the hands of individuals is indeed one of the abuses or supposed abuses which it was the object of this code to eradicate and since then the maintenance of an ecclesiastical establishment of any kind at the expense of the state has in france been added to the catalogue of abuses but at the time of the promulgation of this code the spirit of subversion had not proceeded this length ecclesiastical offices were still kept up though in relation to all these together with all other offices the right of nomination was given to assemblies of the people the incongruity of admitting the professor of a rival religion to the right of suffrage would therefore be the same in this instance as in the case where the nomination rested in a single breast though the danger would seldom be of equal magnitude madmen and criminals of the worst description are equally protected against exclusion from any office or the exercise of any political right as to offices which under this system a man cannot come into possession of but by election the inconvenience it may be said cannot be great for though not incapable of being elected there is no danger of their being so but this is not the case with regard to any or those political privileges which this system gives a man in his own right and as a present derived from the hands of nature—such as the right of suffrage with regard to offices were an assassin covered with the blood of the murdered person and ordered for execution on the second of the month—or which is doubtless esteemed worse a royalist convicted of adherence to the government under which his country had existed for so many hundred years—to put in his claim for admittance to give his suffrage in the election of a deputy to the convention or of a mayor of the paris municipality i see not how his claim could be rejected without an infringement of this clause indeed if this right like all the others be as we are told over and over again a present of the goddess nature and proof against all attacks of law what is to be done and what remedy can be administered by the law something it is true is said of talents and of virtues and the madman it may be said is deficient in talents and the criminal in point of virtues but neither talents nor virtues are mentioned otherwise than as marks of preeminence and distinction recommending the possessors to a proportionable degree of favour and approbation with a view to preference nothing is said of any deficiency in point of talent or virtue as capable of shutting the door against a candidate distinction is the word not exception—distinction among persons all within the list not exception excluding persons out of the list so far from admitting the exclusion of classes of men however incompetent the provision does not so much as admit of the exclusion of individuals from any office an individual or a knot of individuals bent upon affording a constant obstruction to all business and selected perhaps for that very purpose might be returned to the supreme assembly or any other nor could they be got rid of without a breach of the natural and inviolable rights of man as declared and established by this clause what makes the matter still the clearer is that the particular provision is given in the character of a consequence of that is as being already included in the preceding article declaring the perfect and unchangeable equality of mankind in respect of all manner of rights—the citizens being all of them equal in its sight are all of them equally admissible and so forth as the general proposition therefore admits of no exception to it no more can this particular application of it have one virtues and talents sound prettily and flatter the imagination but in point of clearness had that been the object the clause such as it is would have been all the better had it ended with the words public places and employments and had all that is said about capacity and distinction and virtues and talents been left out article vii no one can be accused arrested or detained   0 but in the cases determined by the law and according to the forms prescribed by the law those who solicit issue execute or cause to be executed arbitrary orders ought to be punished but every citizen summoned or arrested in virtue of the law ought to obey that instant he renders himself culpable by resistance sentence   no one can be accused arrested or detained but in the cases determined by the law and according to the forms prescribed by the law here again we have the improper word can instead of ought here however the power of the law is recognized and passes unquestioned the clause therefore is in so far not mischievous and absurd but only nugatory and beside the purpose the professed object of the whole composition is to tie the hands of the law by declaring pretended rights over which the law is never to have any power—liberty the right of enjoying liberty—here this very liberty is left at the mercy and good pleasure of the law as it neither answers the purpose it professes to have in view so neither does it fulfil the purpose which it ought to have had in view and might have fulfilled—the giving the subject or to speak in the french style the citizen that degree of security which without attempting to bind the hands of succeeding legislators might have been given him against arbitrary mandates there is nothing in this article which might not be received and without making any alteration into the constitutional codes of prussia denmark russia or morocco it is or is not law—no matter which for i put it so only for supposition sake—it is law let us say in those countries that upon order signed or issued by any one of a certain number of persons—suppose ministers of state—any individual may be arrested at any time and detained in any manner and for any length of time without any obligation on the part of the person issuing the order to render account of the issuing or of the execution of it to anybody but the monarch if such were the law in these countries respectively before the establishment of such a law as this clause imports such may it remain and that without effecting any abridgment of the powers of the ministers in question or applying any check to the abuses of those powers or affording the subject any security or remedy against the abuses of those powers after the introduction of such article the case in which it is determined by the law that a man may be so arrested and detained is the case of an order having been issued for that purpose by any one in such a list of ministers and the form in which the order for that purpose must be conceived is the wording in the form in which orders to the purpose in question have been in use to be worded or in short any other form which the ministers in question may be pleased to give it if to this interpretation any objection can be made it must be grounded on the ambiguity of the word the law—an ambiguity resulting from the definition above given of it in this declaratory code if the laws are all of them ipso facto void as this manifesto has by the preceding article declared them to be in all countries where the laws are made by other authority than that of the whole body of the people then indeed the security intended to be afforded is afforded because in that case no arrest or detention can be legal till the ground and form of it have been preordained by a law so established on the contrary if that article be to be explained away and countries foreign to france are to be left in possession of their laws then the remedy and security amounts to nothing for the reason we have seen nugatory or mischievous such is the option every where else—such is the option here sentence   those who solicit issue execute or cause to be executed arbitrary orders ought to be punished yes says a moullah of morocco after the introduction of this article into the morocco code—yes if an order to the prejudice of the liberty of the subject be illegal it is an arbitrary order and the issuing of it is an offence against the liberty of the subject and as such ought to be and shall be punished if one dog of an infidel presume to arrest or detain another dog of an infidel the act of arrest and detention is an arbitrary one and nothing can be more reasonable than what the law requires viz that the presuming dog be well bastinadoed but if one of the faithful to every one of whom the sublime emperor crowned with the sun and moon has given the command over all dogs think fit to shut up this or that dog in a strange kennel what is there of arbitrariness in that it is no more than what our customs which are our laws allow of everywhere when the true believers have dogs under them the security of the individual in this behalf depends we see upon the turn given to that part of the law which occupies itself in establishing the powers necessary to be established for the furtherance of justice had the penners of this declaration been contented with doing what they might have done consistently with reason and utility in this view they might have done thus—they might have warned and instructed them to be particular in the indication of the cases in which they would propose to grant such powers and in the indication of the forms according to which the powers so granted should be exercised—for instance that no man should be arrested but for some one in the list of cases enumerated by the law as capable of warranting     an arrest nor without the specification of that case in an instrument executed for the purpose of warranting such arrest nor unless such instrument were signed by an officer of such a description and so on—not to attempt to exhibit a code of such importance extent and nicety in the compass of a parenthesis in doing so they would have done what would at least have been innocent and might have had its use—but in doing so they would not have prosecuted their declared purpose which was not only to tutor and lecture their more experienced and consequently more enlightened successors but to tie their hands and keep their fellowcitizens in a state of constant readiness to cut their throats sentence   but every citizen summoned or arrested in virtue of the law ought to obey that instant he renders himself culpable by resistance this clause is mighty well in itself—the misfortune is that it is nothing to the purpose the title of this code is the declaration of rights and the business of it is accordingly in every other part of it to declare such rights real or supposed as are thought fit to be declared but what is here declared is for once a duty the mention of which has somehow or other slipt in as it were through inadvertence the things that people stand most in need of being reminded of are one would think their duties—for their rights whatever they may be they are apt enough to attend to of themselves yet it is only by accident under a wrong title and as it were by mistake and in this single instance that anything is said that would lead the body of the people to suspect that there were any such things appertaining to them as duties he renders himself culpable by resistance oh yes—certainly unless the law for the infringement of which he is arrested or attempted to be arrested be an oppresive one or unless there be anything oppressive in the behaviour of those by whom the arrest or detention is performed if for instance there be anything of the insolence of office in their language or their looks—if they lay hold of him on a sudden without leaving him time to run away—if they offer to pinion his arms while he is drawing his sword without waiting till he have drawn it—if they lock the door upon him or put him into a room that has bars before the window—or if they come upon him the same night while the evidences of his guilt are about him and all fresh instead of waiting on the outside of the door all night till he have destroyed them in any of these cases as well as a thousand others that might be mentioned can there be any doubts about the oppression but by article ii of this same code—an article which has already been established and placed out of the reach of cavil the right of resistance to oppression is among the number of those rights which nature hath given and which it is not in the power of man to take away article viii the law ought not to establish any other punishments than such as are strictly and evidently necessary and no one can be punished but in virtue of a law established and promulgated before the commission of the offence and applied in a legal manner sentence   the law ought not to establish any other punishments than such as are strictly and evidently necessary the instruction administered by this clause is not great so far however is well that the purpose declared in this instrument is departed from and nothing but instruction is here attempted to be given and which succeeding legislators may be governed by or not as they think fit it is well indeed that penal laws not conforming to this condition are not included in the sentence of nullity so liberally dealt out on other occasions since if they were it would be difficult enough to find a penal law anywhere that would stand the test from whatever source—pure or impure democratical aristocratical or monarchical—it were derived no rules of any tolerable degree of particularity and precision have ever yet been laid down for adjusting either the quantum or the quality of punishments—none such at least could have been in the contemplation of the framers of this code and supposing such rules laid down and framed with the utmost degree of particularity and precision of which the nature of the subject is susceptible it would     still be seen in most instances if not in every instance that the offence admitted optionally of a considerable variety of punishments of which no one could be made to appear to be strictly and evidently necessary to the exclusion of the rest as a mere memento then of what is fit to be attended to a clause to this effect may be very well but as an instruction calculated to point out in what manner what is so fit to be attended to may be accomplished nothing can be more trifling or uninstructive—it is even erroneous and fallacious since it assumes and that by necessary implication that it is possible in the case of every offence to find a punishment of which the strict necessity is capable of being made evident—which is not true unfortunately the existence of a system of punishments of which the absolute necessity is capable of being made evident with reference to the offences to which they are respectively annexed is not altogether so clear as the existence of the article by which succeeding legislators are sent in quest of such a system by these their masters and preceptors one thing is but too evident that the attention bestowed by the penner of this article on the subject on which he gives the law to posterity so much at his ease was anything but strict it was the utopia created by the small talk of paris that was dancing before his eyes and not the elementary parts of the subjectmatter he was treating of—the list of possible punishments confronted with the list of possible offences he who writes these observations has bestowed a closer and more minute inquiry into the subject than any body who has been before him—he has laid down a set of rules by which as he conceives the disproportion but too generally prevalent between punishments and offences may be reduced within bounds greatly more narrow than it occupies anywhere at present in any existing code of laws—and what he would undertake for is not to make evident any such list of strictly necessary punishments but the impossibility of its existence sentence   no one can be punished but in virtue of a law established and promulgated before the commission of the offence and applied in a legal manner this clause—if instead of the insurrectioninviting word can the word ought had been employed as in the preceding clause of this same article—would as far as it goes have been well enough as it is while on the one hand it not only tends to bring in the everlasting danger of insurrection—on the other hand it leaves a considerable part of the danger against which it is levelled uncovered and unprovided against numerous are the occasions on which sufferings as great as any that being inflicted with a view to punishment go under the denomination of punishment may be inflicted without any such view these cases a legislator who understood his business would have collected and given notice of for the purpose of marking out the boundaries and confines of the instruction in question and saving it from misapplication laying an embargo for instance is a species of confinement and were a man subjected to it with a view to punishment might in many cases be a very severe punishment yet if the providence of the legislator happen not to have provided a general law empowering the executive authority to lay an embargo in certain cases the passing of a special law for that purpose after the incident which calls for it has taken place may be a very justifiable and even necessary measure for instance to prevent intelligence from being communicated to a power watching the moment to commence hostilities or to prevent articles of subsistence or instruments of defence of which there is a deficiency in the country from being carried out of it banishment must in a certain sense be admitted to be equally penal whether inflicted for the purpose of punishment or only by way of precaution—for the purpose of prevention and without any view to punishment will it be said that there is no case in which the supreme government of a country ought to be trusted with the power of removing out of it not even for a time any persons not even foreigners from whom it may see reason to apprehend enterprises injurious to its peace so in the case of imprisonment which though in some instances it may be a severer may in others be a less severe infliction than banishment even death a suffering which if inflicted with a view to punishment is the very extremity of punishment and which according to my own conception of the matter neither need nor ought to be inflicted in any instance for the purpose of punishment may in some certain instances perhaps be highly necessary to be inflicted without any view to punishment—for example to prevent the diffusion of the plague thus it is that while the clause passing censure on ex post facto penal laws a censure in itself and while it confines itself to the cases strictly within its declared subject so highly reasonable is thus exhibited with the insurrectioninciting can in it and without the explanations necessary as we have seen to guard it against misapplication the country is exposed to two opposite dangers one that an infliction necessary for the purpose of prevention should be resisted and risen up against by individuals under the notion of its being included in the prohibition given by this clause the other that the measure how necessary soever should be abstained     from by the legislature through apprehension of such resistance as to the concluding epithet and legally applied it might have been spared without any great injury to the sense if the law referred to in justification of an act of power have not been legally applied in the exercise of that act of power the act has not been exercised in virtue of that law article ix every individual being presumed innocent until he have been declared guilty—if it be judged necessary to arrest him every act of rigour which is not necessary to the making sure of his person ought to be severely inhibited by the law this article being free from the insurrectionexciting particle and confining itself to the office of simple instruction is so far innocent the object of it is laudable though the purport of it might have been expressed with more precision the maxim it opens with though of the most consummate triviality is not the more conformable to reason and utility and is particularly repugnant to the regulation in support and justification of which it is adduced that every man ought to be presumed innocent for is presumed innocent is nonsense until he have been declared that is adjudged guilty is very well so long as no accusation has been preferred against him—or rather so long as neither that nor any other circumstance appears to afford reason for suspecting the contrary—but very irrational after that ground for supposing he may have been guilty has been brought to light the maxim is particularly misapplied and absurd when applied to the case where it has been judged proper on sufficient grounds we are to suppose to put him under arrest to deprive him of his power of locomotion suppose him innocent and the defalcation made from his liberty is injurious and unwarrantable the plain truth of the matter is that the only rational ground for empowering a man to be arrested in such a case is its not being yet known whether he be innocent or guilty suppose him guilty he ought to be punished—suppose him innocent he ought not to be touched but plain unsophisticated truth and common sense do not answer the purpose of poetry or rhetoric and it is from poetry and rhetoric that these tutors of mankind and governors of futurity take their law a clap from the galleries is their object not the welfare of the state as for the expression ought to be severely repressed by punishment i suppose it is as well calculated to inflame the general purpose of this effusion of matchless wisdom as it is ill calculated to instruct a rather more simple and instructive way of stating it would have been to say in relation to every such exercise of rigour which goes beyond what appears necessary to the purpose in question—that of making sure of the person that not coming within the ground of justification taken from that source it remains upon the footing of an offence of that description of delinquency whatever it be of an injury of the species in question whatever it may be the satisfaction and punishment annexed to it will come of course to be of the same nature and extent as for an injury of the same nature and extent having no such circumstance to give occasion to it should the punishment in such case be greater or less than the punishment for the same injury would be if altogether divested of the justification which covers the remainder of the unpleasant treatment should the punishment of the minister of justice exceeding his authority be greater or less than that of the uncommissioned individual doing the same mischief without any authority on some accounts as would be found upon proper inquiry it should be greater on other accounts not so great but these are points of minute detail which might surely as well have been left to the determination of those who would have had time to give them due examination as determined upon at random by those who had no such time the words of this article seem to intimate that the punishment for the abuse of power by the minister of justice ought to be the greater of the two but why so you know better where to meet with the minister of justice than with an offending individual taken at large—the officer has more to lose than the individual—and the greater the assurance you have that a delinquent in case of accusation will be forthcoming in readiness to afford satisfaction in the event of his being sentenced to afford it the less the alarm which his delinquency inspires article x no one ought to be molested meaning probably by government for his opinions even in matters of religion provided that the manisfestation of them does not disturb better expressed perhaps by saying except in as far as the manifestation of them disturb or rather tends to the disturbance of the public order established by the law liberty of publication with regard to opinions under certain exceptions is a liberty which it would be highly proper and fit to establish but which would receive but a very precarious establishment from an article thus worded disturb the public order—what does that mean louis xiv need not have hesitated about receiving an article thus worded into his code the public order of things in this behalf was an order in     virtue of which the exercise of every religion but the catholic according to his edition of it was proscribed a law is enacted forbidding men to express a particular opinion or set of opinions relative to a particular point in religion forbidding men to express any of those opinions in the expression of which the lutheran doctrine for example or the calvinistic doctrine or the church of england doctrine consists—in a prohibition to this effect consists the public order established by the law spite of this a man manifests an opinion of the number of those which thus stand prohibited as belonging to the religion thus proscribed the act by which this opinion is manifested is it not an act of disturbance with relation to the public order thus established extraordinary indeed must be the assurance of him who could take upon him to answer in the negative thus nugatory thus flimsy is this buckler of rights and liberties in one of the few instances in which any attempt is made to apply it to a good purpose what should it have done then to this question an answer is scarcely within the province of this paper the proposition with which i set out is not that the declaration of rights should have been worded differently but that nothing under any such name or with any such design should have been attempted a word or two however may be given as a work of supererogation—that opinions of all sorts might be manifested without fear of punishment that no publication should be deemed to subject a man to punishment on account of any opinions it may be found to contain considered as mere opinions but at the same time that the plea of manifesting religious opinions or the practising certain acts supposed to be enjoined or recommended in virtue of certain religious opinions as proper or necessary to be practised should not operate as a justification for either exercising or prompting men to exercise any act which the legislature without any view or reference to religion has already thought fit or may hereafter think fit to insert into the catalogue of prohibited acts or offences to instance two species of delinquency—one of the most serious the other of the slightest nature—acts tending to the violent subversion of the government by force—acts tending to the obstruction of the passage in the streets—an opinion that has been supposed by some to belong to the christian religion is that every form of government but the monarchical is unlawful an opinion that has been supposed by some to belong to the christian religion—by some at least of those that adhere to that branch of the christian religion which is termed the roman catholic—is that it is a duty or at least a merit to join in processions of a certain description to be performed on certain occasions what then is the true sense of the clause in question in relation to these two cases what ought to be the conduct of a government that is neither monarchical nor catholic with reference to the respective manifestation of these two opinions first as to the opinion relative to the unlawfulness of a government not monarchical the falsity or erroneousness which the members of such a government could not but attribute in their own minds to such an opinion is a consideration which according to the spirit and intent of the provision in question would not be sufficient to authorize their using penal or other coercive measures for the purpose of preventing the manifestation of them at the same time should such manifestation either have already had the effect of engaging individuals in any attempt to effect a violent subversion of the government by force or appear to have produced a near probability of any such attempt—in such case the engagement to permit the free manifestation of opinions in general and of religious opinions in particular is not to be understood to preclude the government from restraining the manifestation of the opinion in question in every such way as it may deem likely to promote or facilitate any such attempt again as to the opinion relative to the meritoriousness of certain processions by the principal part of the provision government stands precluded from prohibiting publications manifesting an opinion in favour of the obligatoriness or meritoriousness of such processions by the spirit of the same engagement they stand precluded from prohibiting the performance of such processions unless a persuasion of a political inconvenience as resulting from such practice—a persuasion not grounded on any notions of their unlawfulness in a religious view—should come to be entertained as if for example the multitude of the persons joining in the procession or the crowd of persons flocking to observe them should fill up the streets to such a degree or for such a length of time and at intervals recurring with such frequency as to be productive of such a degree of obstruction to the free use of the streets for the purposes of business as in the eye of government should constitute a body of inconvenience worth encountering by a prohibitive law it would be a violation of the spirit of this part of the engagement if the government—not by reason of any view it entertained of the political inconveniences of these processions for example as above but for the purpose of giving an ascendency to religious opinions of an opposite nature determined for example by a protestant antipathy to catholic processions—were to make use of     the real or pretended obstruction to the free use of the streets as a pretence for prohibiting such processions these examples while they serve to illustrate the ground and degree and limits of the liberty which it may seem proper on the score of public tranquillity and peace to leave to the manifestation of opinions of a religious nature may serve at the same time to render apparent the absurdity and perilousness of every attempt on the part of the government for the time being to tie up the hands of succeeding governments in relation to this or any other spot in the field of legislation observe how nice and incapable of being described beforehand by any particular marks are the lines which mark the limits of right and wrong in this behalf—which separate the useful from the pernicious—the prudent course from the imprudent—how dependent upon the temper of the times—upon the events and circumstances of the day—with how fatal a certainty persecution and tyranny on the one hand or revolt and civil war on the other may follow from the slightest deviation from propriety in the drawing of such lines—and what a curse to any country a legislator may be who with the purest intentions should set about settling the business to all eternity by inflexible and adamantine rules drawn from the sacred and inviolable and imprescriptible rights of man and the primeval and everlasting laws of nature i give the preference for the purpose of exemplification to one of those points of all others in relation to which it would give me pleasure to see liberty established for ever as it could be established consistently with security and peace my persuasion is that there is not a single point with relation to which it can answer any good purpose to attempt to tie the hands of future legislators and so that as there is not a single point not even of my own choosing in relation to which i would endeavour to give any such perpetuity to a regulation even of my own framing it is still less to say—strong as it may appear to say—that were it to depend upon me i would sooner were the power of sanctioning in my hands give my sanction to a body of laws framed by any one else how bad soever it might appear to me free from any such perpetuating clause than a body of laws of my own framing how well soever i might be satisfied with it if it must be incumbered with such a clause article xi the free examination of thoughts and opinions is one of the most precious rights of man every citizen may therefore speak write and print freely provided always that he shall be answerable for the abuse of that liberty in the cases determined by the law the logic of this composition is altogether of a piece with its policy when you meet with a therefore—when you meet with a consequence announced as drawn from the proposition immediately preceding it assure yourself that whether the propositions themselves as propositions are true or false—as ordinances reasonable or unreasonable expedient or inexpedient—that the consequent is either in contradiction with the antecedent or has nothing at all to do with it the liberty of communicating opinions is one branch of liberty and liberty is one of the four natural rights of man over which human ordinances have no power there are two ways in which liberty may be violated by physical or bodily coercion and by moral coercion or demonstration of punishment—the one applied before the time for exercising the liberty—the other to be applied after it in the shape of punishment in the event or its not producing its intended effect in the shape of prohibition what is the boon in favour of the branch of liberty here in question granted by this article it saves it from succeeding legislators in one shape—it leaves it at their mercy in the other will it be said that what it leaves exposed to punishment is only the abuse of liberty be it so what then is there less of liberty in the abuse of liberty than in the use of it does a man exercise less liberty when he makes use of the property of another than when he confines himself to his own then are liberty and confinement the same thing—synonymous and interchangeable terms what is the abuse of liberty it is that exercise of liberty be it what it may which a man who bestows that name on it does not approve of every abuse of this branch of liberty is left exposed to punishment and it is left to future legislators to determine what shall be regarded as an abuse of it what is the security worth which is thus given to the individual as against the encroachments of government what does the barrier pretended to be set up against government amount to it is a barrier which government is expressly called upon to set up where it pleases let me not be mistaken—what i blame these constitutionmakers for is not the having omitted to tie the hands of their successors tight enough but the suffering themselves to entertain a conceit so mischievous and so foolish as that of tying them up at all and in particular for supposing that were they weak enough to suffer themselves to be so shackled a phrase or two of so loose a texture could be capable of doing the business to any purpose the general notion in regard to offences—a notion so general as to have become proverbial and even trivial—is that prevention     is better than punishment here prevention is abjured and punishment embraced in preference once more let me not be mistaken in the particular case of the liberty of communicating opinions there most certainly are reasons for giving up the object of prevention and in the choice of the means of repression confining the repressive operations of the legislator to the application of punishment which do not apply to other offences a word or two to this purpose and to justify the seeming inconsistency would have been rather more instructive than most of those other instructions of which the authors of this code have been so liberal not only is the consequent of these two propositions clogged with the proviso at the tail of it repugnant to the antecedent but in itself it is much more extensive—it extends a vast way beyond what is intended as a covering for it the free communication of thoughts and of opinions i presume are here put as synonymous terms the free communication of opinions says the antecedent is one of the most valuable of the rights of man—of those unalienable rights of man what says the consequent of it not only that a man may communicate opinions without the possibility of being prevented but that he is to be at liberty to communicate what he will without the possibility of being prevented and in any manner—false allegations in matters of fact and known to be such—for true false allegations to the prejudice of the reputation of individuals—in a word slander of all sorts—and that in all manner of ways—by speech by writing and even in the way of printing without the possibility of stopping his mouth destroying his manuscript or stopping the press what then does it follow that because a man ought to be left at liberty to publish opinions of all sorts subject not to previous prevention but only to subsequent punishment that therefore he ought to be left at equal liberty to publish allegations of all sorts false as well as true—allegations known by him to be false as well as allegations believed by him to be true—attacks which he knows to be false upon the reputation of individuals as well as those which he believes to be true far is it from my meaning to contend in this place especially in a parenthesis much more to take for granted that the endurance of even these mischiefs crying as they are may not be a less evil than the subjecting the press to a previous censure under any such restrictions on the exercise of that power as could be devised—at any rate under any such as have ever hitherto been proposed all i mean to say is that whether a man ought or ought not to be left at liberty to publish private slander without the application of anything but subsequent punishment to stop the progress of it it does not follow that it ought to be left in his power to publish such allegations because it ought to be left in like manner in his power to publish whatever can come under the denomination of opinions as for the word thoughts which is put in a line with the word opinions as if thoughts were something different from opinions i shall lay it out of the question altogether till i can find somebody who will undertake to satisfy me in the first place that it was meant to denote something in addition to opinions and in the next place that that something was meant to include allegations true and false in relation to matters of fact is it or is it not a matter to be wished in france for example that measures were taken by competent authority—whatever authority be deemed competent to draw the line between the protection due to the useful liberty and the restraint proper for the pernicious licence of the press what a precious task would the legislator find set for him by this declaration of sacred inviolable and imprescriptible rights the protectors of reputation on one side of him the idolators of liberty on the other each with the rights of man in his mouth and the dagger of assassination in his hand ready to punish the smallest departure from the course marked out in his heated imagination for this unbending line article xii the guarantee of the rights of the man and of the citizen necessitates a public force this force is therefore instituted for the advantage of all and not for the particular utility advantage of those to whom it is intrusted the general purpose of the whole performance taken together being mischievous and pestilential this article has thus much to recommend it that it is nothing to the purpose—no declaration of inviolable rights—no invitation to insurrection as it stands it is a mere effusion of imbecility—a specimen of confused conception and false reasoning with a little alteration it might be improved into a commonplace memento as stale and consequently as useless as it is unexceptionable to wit that the employment given to the public force maintained as it is at the expense of the public ought to have for its object the general advantage of the whole body of the public taken together not the exclusive private advantage of particular individuals this article is composed of two distinct propositions in the first after throwing out of it as so much surplusage the obscure part about the guarantee or maintenance of the rights of the man and the citizen there will remain a clear and intelligible part a declaration of opinion asserting the necessity of a public force to this hooked on in the shape     of an inference of a logical conclusion a vague assertion of an historical matter of fact which may have been true in one place and false in another—the truth of which is incapable of being ascertained in any instance—an operation the labour of which may be spared with the less loss from its being nothing to the purpose this matter of fact is neither more nor less than the main end in view which happened to be present in the minds of the several persons to whose cooperation the public force was respectively indebted for its institution and establishment in the several political communities in the world and which officiated in the character of a final cause in every such instance this final cause the penner of the article—such is his candour and good opinion of mankind—pronounces without hesitation or exception to have been the pure view of the greatest good of the whole community—public spirit in its purest form and in its most extensive application neither clovis pepin nor hugh capet had the smallest preferable regard to the particular advantage of themselves or their favourites when they laid the foundations of the public force in france nor any other consideration in view than what might be most conducive to the joint and equal advantage of the franks gauls and galloromans upon the whole as little partiality existed in the breast of william the conqueror in favour of himself or any of his normans on the occasion of his sharing out england among those normans and dividing it into knights fees freemen and villains barons and yeomen normans danes and english collectively and individually occupying one equal place in his affections and engaging one equal portion of his solicitude according to this construction the inference it must be confessed may be just enough all you have to suppose is that the greatest good of the whole community taken together was in every instance the ruling object of consideration in the breast of the institutors of the public force the pursuit of that greatest good in a certain shape not perfectly explained being the ruling object with these worthy men as they did institute this public force it seems to follow pretty accurately that the attainment of that general advantage was the end in view in each instance of its being instituted should the two propositions the antecedent and the consequent in this their genuine signification appear too silly to be endurable the way to defend it may be to acknowledge that the man who penned it knew no difference between a declaration of what he supposed was or is the state of things with regard to this or that subject and a declaration of what he conceived ought to have been or ought to be that state of things and this being the case it may be supposed that in saying such was the end in view upon the several occasions in question what he meant was that such it ought to have been if this were really his meaning the propositions are such both of them as we may venture to accede to without much danger a public force is necessary we may say and the public is the party for whose advantage that force ought to be employed the propositions themselves are both of them such that against neither of them surely can any objection be produced as to the inference by which they are strung together if the application made of it be not exactly of the clearest nature you have only to throw it out and everything is as it should be and the whole article is rendered unexceptionable article xiii for the maintenance of the public force and for the expenses of administration a common contribution is indispensable it ought to be equally divided among all the citizens in proportion to their faculties in the first part of this article two propositions are contained one is that a common contribution is indispensable for the maintenance of the public force if by this be meant that raising money upon all for the maintenance of those whose individual forces are employed in the composition of the public force is proper i see no reason to dispute it if the meaning be that this is the only possible way of maintaining a public force it is not true under the feudal system those whose individual forces composed the public force were maintained not at the expense of the community at large but at their own expense the other proposition is that a common contribution is indispensable for the expenses meaning the other expenses of administration indispensable yes certainly so far as these other branches of administration cannot be carried on without expense—if they are carried on the defraying of that expense is indispensable but are these nameless branches of administration necessary for if they are not neither is a common contribution for the defraying of the expense are they then necessary—these unnamed and unindicated branches of administration which in this mysterious manner are put down on the list of necessary ones is their title to be there a just one this is a question to which it is impossible to find an answer yet till an answer be found for it it is impossible to find a sufficient warrant for admitting this proposition to be true from this proposition as the matter stands upon the face of it it should seem that one of these sacred and inviolable and imprescriptible rights of a man consists in the obligation of contributing to an unknown mass of expense employed upon objects not ascertained     proposition   it the common contribution in question ought to be equally divided amongst all the citizens in proportion to their faculties partly contradiction—a sequel to or rather repetition of preceding contradictions partly tyranny under the mask of justice by the first article human creatures are and are to be all of them on a footing of equality in respect to all sorts of rights by the second article property is of the number of these rights by the two taken together all men are and are to be upon an equal footing in respect of property in other words all the property in the nation is and is to be divided into equal portions at the same time as to the matter of fact what is certain is that at the time of passing this article no such equality existed nor were any measures so much as taken for bringing it into existence this being the case which of the two states of things is it that this article supposes—the old and really existing inequality or the new and imaginary equality in the first case the concluding or explanatory clause is in contradiction to the principal one in the other case it is tautological and superfluous in the first case the explanatory clause is in contradiction to the principal one for from unequal fortunes if you take equal contributions the contributions are not proportional if from a fortune of one hundred pounds you take a contribution of ten pounds and from a fortune of two hundred pounds ten pounds and no more the proportion is not a tenth in both cases but a tenth in the one and only a twentieth in the other in the second case—that is if equality in point of property be the state of things supposed—then indeed equality of contribution will be consistent with the plan of equalization as well as consonant to justice and utility but then the explanatory clause in proportion to their faculties will be tautologous and superfluous and not only tautologous and superfluous but ambiguous and perplexing for proportionality in point of contribution is not consistent with equality in point of contribution on more than one out of an infinity of suppositions viz that of equality in point of fortune nor in point of fact was the one consistent with the other in the only state of things which was in existence at the time mens faculties too what does that word mean this if the state of things represented as actually existing as well as always having existed and for ever about to exist had been anything more than a sick mans dream would have required to be determined had it been at all a matter of concern to prevent men from cutting one anothers throats and must have been determined before this theory could have been reduced to practice in the valuation of mens faculties is it meant that their possessions only or that their respective wants and exigencies as well as their ways and means should be taken into account in the latter case what endless labour in the former case what injustice in either case what tyranny an inquisition into every mans exigencies and means—an inquisition which to be commensurate to its object must be perpetual—an inquisition into every mans circumstances one of the foundation stones in this plan of liberty to a reader who should put an english construction upon this plan of taxation—masked by the delusive term contribution as if voluntary contributions could be a practicable substitute for compulsory—to a reader who should collect from the state of things in england the construction to be put upon this plan of taxation the system here in view would not show itself in half its blackness to an english reader it might naturally enough appear that all that was meant was that the weight of taxation should bear in a loose sense as equally or rather as equitably—that is as proportionably as it could conveniently be made to do—that taxes a word which would lead him directly and almost exclusively to taxes upon consumption should be imposed—for example upon superfluities in preference to the necessaries of life wide indeed would be his mistake what he little would suspect is that taxes on consumption the only taxes from which arise the contributions that in plain truth and not in a sophistical sense are voluntary on the part of the contributor are carefully weeded out of the book of french finance deluded by the term indirect imposed as a sort of term of proscriptiom upon them by a set of muddyheaded metaphysicians—little does he think that the favourite species of taxation in that country of perfect liberty is a species of imposition and inquisition which converts every man who has any property into a criminal in the first instance which sends the taxgatherer into every nook and corner of a mans house which examines every man upon interrogatories and of which a double or treble tithe would be an improved and mollified modification article xiv all the citizens have the right to ascertain by themselves or by their representatives the necessity of the public contribution—to give their free consent to it—to follow up the aplication of it and to determine the quantity of it the objects on which it shall be levied the mode of levying it and getting it in and the duration of it supposing the author of this article an enemy to the state and his object to disturb     the course of public business and set the individual members of the state together by the ears nothing could have been more artfully or more happily adapted to the purpose supposing him a friend and his object to administer either useful instruction or salutary controul nothing more silly or childish can be imagined in the first place who is spoken of—who are meant by all the citizens does it mean all collectively acting in a body or every citizen every individual that is any one that pleases this right of mine—is it a right which i may exercise by myself at any time whenever it happens to suit me and without the concurrence of anybody else or which i can only exercise if and when i can get everybody else or at least the major part of everybody else to join me in the exercise of it the difference in a practical view is enormous but the penners of this declaration by whom terms expressive of aggregation and terms expressive of separation are used to all appearance promiscuously show no symptoms of their being aware of the smallest difference if in conjunction with everybody else i have it already by the sixth article laws imposing contributions are laws i have already then a right of concurring in the formation of all laws whatever what do i get by acquiring the right of concurring in the formation of the particular class of laws which are employed in imposing contributions as a specification as an application of the general provision to the particular subject it might be very well but it is not given as a specification but as a distinct article what marks the distinction the more forcibly is the jumbling in this instance and in this instance only acts of another nature with acts of legislation—the right of examining into the necessity of the operation and of following up such examination with the right of performing the operation—the right of observing and commenting on the manner in which the powers of government are exercised with the right of exercising them make what you will of it what a pretty contrivance for settling matters and putting an end to doubts and disagreements this whatever it is is one of the things which i am told i have a right to do that is either by myself or by certain persons alluded to under the denomination of my representatives—either in one way or the other but in which this is exactly what i want to know and this is exactly what i am not told—can i do it by myself or only by my representatives that is to say in the latter case by a deputy in whose election i have perhaps had a vote perhaps not—perhaps given the vote perhaps not—perhaps voted for perhaps voted against and who whether i voted for or against him will not do either this or any one other act whatsoever at my desire have i an individual—have i in my individual capacity—a right when i please to ascertain that is to examine into the necessity of every contribution established or proposed to be established then have i a right to go whenever i please to any of the officers in the department of the revenue—to take all the people i find under my command—to put all the business of the office to a stand—to make them answer all my questions—to make them furnish me with as many papers or other documents as i desire to have—you my next neighbour who are as much a citizen as i am have as much of this right as i have it is your pleasure to take this office under your command to the same purpose at the same time it is my pleasure the people should do what i bid them and not what you bid them it is your pleasure they should do what you bid them and not what i bid them—which of us is to have his pleasure the answer is—he who has the strongest lungs or if that will not do he who has the strongest hand to give everything to the strongest hand is the natural result of all the tutoring and all the checking and controuling of which this lecture on the principles of government is so liberal but this is the exact result of that state of things which would have place supposing there were no government at all nor any such attempt as this to destroy it under the notion of directing it the right of giving consent to a tax—the right of giving consent to a measure—is a curious mode of expression for signifying assent or dissent as a man thinks proper it is surprising that a man professing and pretending to fix words—to fix ideas—to fix laws—to fix everything—and to fix them to all eternity should fix upon such an expression and should say the right of giving consent instead of the right of giving a vote—the right of giving consent and consent only instead of the right of giving consent or dissent or neither as a man thinks proper article xv society has a right to demand from every agent of the public an account of his administration society what is the meaning—what is the object here different where it ought to be identical—identical where it ought to be different—ever inexplicit—ever indeterminate using as interconvertible expressions which for the purpose of precision and right understanding require the most carefully to be set and kept in opposition such is the language from the beginning of this composition to the end is it that superiors in office have a right to demand such an account of their subordinates   0 not to possess such a right would be not to be a superior—not to be subject to the exercise of it would be not to be a subordinate in this sense the proposition is perfectly harmless but equally nugatory is it that all men not in office have this right with respect to all men or every man in office then comes the question as before—each in his individual capacity or only altogether in their collective if in their collective whatever this article or any other article drawn up in the same view does or can do for them amounts to nothing whatever it would have them do it gives them no facilities for doing it which they did not possess without it whatever it would have them do if one and all rise for the purpose of doing it bating what hindrance they may receive from one another there will be nobody to hinder them but is there any great likelihood of any such rising ever taking place and if it were to take place would there be any great use in it if the right be of the number of those which belongs to each and every man in his individual capacity then comes the old story over again of mutual obstruction and the obstruction of all business as before the right of demanding an account what means that too the right of simply putting the question or the right of compelling an answer to it—and such an answer as shall afford to him that puts it the satisfaction he desires in the former case the value of the right will not be great in the latter case he who has it and who by the supposition is not in office will in fact be in office and as everybody has it and is to have it the result is that everybody is in office and those who command all men are under the command of every man instead of meaning stark nonsense was the article meant after all simply to convey a memento to those who are superiors in office to keep a good lookout after their subordinates if this be the case nothing can be more innocent and unexceptionable neither the child that is learning wisdom in his hornbook nor the old woman who is teaching him need blush to own it but what has it to do in a composition the work of the collected wisdom of the nation and of which the object is throughout and exclusively to declare rights silly or pestilential—such as usual is here the alternative in the shape of advice a proposition may be instructive or trifling wholesome or insipid but be it the one or the other the instant it is converted or attempted to be converted into a law of which those called legislators are to be the objects and those not called legislators to be the executors it becomes all sheer poison and of the rankest kind article xvi every society in which the warranty of rights is not assured la garantie des droits nest pas assurée nor the separation of powers determined has no constitution here we have an exhibition selfconceit inflamed to insanity—legislators turned into turkeycocks—the less important operation of constitutionmaking interrupted for the more important operation of bragging had the whole human species according to the wish of the tyrant but one neck it would find in this article a sword designed to sever it this constitution—the blessed constitution of which this matchless declaration forms the base—the constitution of france—is not only the most admirable constitution in the world but the only one that no other country but france has the happiness of possessing the sort of thing whatever it be called a constitution is a meaning sufficiently conveyed this meaning the article must have if it have any for other meaning most assuredly it has none every society in which the warranty of rights is not assured toute société dans laquelle la garantie des droits nest pas assurée is it must be confessed most rueful nonsense but if the translation were not exact it would be unfaithful and if not nonsensical it would not be exact do you ask has the nation i belong to such a thing as a constitution belonging to it if you want to know look whether a declaration of rights word for word the same as this forms part of its code of laws for by this article what is meant to be insinuated not expressed since by nonsense nothing is expressed is the necessity of having a declaration of rights like this set by authority in the character of an introduction at the head of the collection of its laws as to the not absolutely nonsensical but only very obscure clause about a societys having the separation of powers determined it seems to be the result of a confused idea of an intended application of the old maxim divide et impera the governed are to have the governors under their governance by having them divided among themselves a still older maxim and supposing both maxims applied to this one subject i am inclined to think a truer one is that a house divided against itself cannot stand yet on the existence of two perfectly independent and fighting sovereignties or of three such fighting sovereignties the supposed state of things in britain seems here to be the example in view the perfection of good government or at least of whatever approach to good government can subsist without the actual adoption in terminis of a declaration of rights such as this is supposed to     depend hence though britain have no such thing as a constitution belonging to it at present yet if during a period of any length five or ten years for example it should ever happen that neither house of commons nor house of lords had any confidence in the kings ministers nor any disposition to endure their taking the lead in legislation the house of commons being all the while as we must suppose peopled by universal suffrage possibly in such case for it were a great deal too much to affirm britain might be so far humoured as to be allowed to suppose herself in possession of a sort of thing which though of inferior stuff might pass under the name of a constitution even without having this declaration of rights to stand at its head that britain possesses at present anything that can bear that name has by citizen paine following or leading i really remember not nor is it worth remembering at any rate agreeing with this declaration of rights been formally denied according to general import supported by etymology by the word constitution something established something already established something possessed of stability something that has given proofs of stability seems to be implied what shall we say if of this most magnificent of all boasts not merely the simple negative but the direct converse should be true and if instead of france being the only country which has a constitution france should be the only country that has none yet if government depend upon obedience—the stability of government upon the permanence of the disposition to obedience and the permanence of that disposition upon the duration of the habit of obedience—this most assuredly must be the case article xvii property being an inviolable and sacred right no one can be deprived of it unless it be when public necessity legally established evidently requires it i e the sacrifice of it and under the condition of a just and previous indemnity here we have the concluding article in this pile of contradictions it does not mismatch the rest by the first article all men are equal in respect of all sorts of rights and so are to continue for evermore spite of everything which can be done by laws by the second article property is of the number of those rights by this seventeenth and last article no man can be deprived of his property—no not of a single atom of it without an equal equivalent paid—not when the occasion calls for it for that would not be soon enough but beforehand all men are equal in respect of property while john has £ 0000 ayear and peter nothing all men are to be equal in property and that for everlasting at the same time that he who has a thousand times as much as a thousand others put together is not to be deprived of a single farthing of it without having first received an exact equivalent nonsense and contradiction apart the topie touched upon here is one of those questions of detail that requires to be settled and is capable of being settled by considerations of utility deducible from quiet and sober investigation to the satisfaction of soberminded men but such considerations are far beneath the attention of these creators of the rights of man there are distinctions between species of property which are susceptible and species of property which are not susceptible of the value of affection between losses in relation to which the adequacy of indemnification may be reduced to a certainty and losses in respect of which it must remain exposed to doubt there may be cases in which a more than equivalent gain to one individual will warrant the subjecting another individual with or without compensation to a loss all these questions are capable of receiving a solution to the satisfaction of a man who thinks it worth his while to be at the pains of comparing the feelings on one side with the feelings on the other and to judge of regulations by their effect on the feelings of those whom they concern instead of pronouncing on them by the random application of declamatory epithets and phrases necessity what means necessity does necessity order the making of new streets new roads new bridges new canals a nation which has existed for so many ages with the stock of waterroads which it received from nature—is any addition to that stock necessary to the continuation of its existence if not there is an end to all improvement in all these lines in all changes there are disadvantages on one side there are advantages on the other but what are all the advantages in the world when set against the sacred and inviolable rights of man derived from the unenacted and unrepealable laws of nature conclusion on the subject of the fundamental principles of government we have seen what execrable trash the choicest talents of the french nation have produced on the subject of chemistry europe has beheld with admiration and adopted with unanimity and gratitude the systematic views of the same nation supported as they were by a series of decisive experiments and conclusive reasonings chemistry has commonly been reckoned and not altogether without reason among the most abstruse branches of science in     chemistry we see how high they have soared above the sublimest knowledge of past times in legislation how deep they have sunk below the profoundest ignorance—how much inferior has the maturest design that could be furnished by the united powers of the whole nation proved in comparison of the wisdom and felicity of the chancemedley of the british constitution comparatively speaking a select few applied themselves to the cultivation of chemistry—almost an infinity in comparison have applied themselves to the science of legislation in the instance of chemistry the study is acknowledged to come within the province of science the science is acknowledged to be an abstruse and difficult one and to require a long course of study on the part of those who have had the previous advantage of a liberal education whilst the cultivation of it in such manner as to make improvements in it requires that a man should make it the great business of his life and those who have made these improvements have thus applied themselves in chemistry there is no room for passion to step in and to confound the understanding—to lead men into error and to shut their eyes against knowledge in legislation the circumstances are opposite and vastly different what then shall we say of that system of government of which the professed object is to call upon the untaught and unlettered multitude whose existence depends upon their devoting their whole time to the acquisition of the means of supporting it to occupy themselves without ceasing upon all questions of government legislation and administration included without exception—important and trivial—the most general and the most particular but more especially upon the most important and most general—that is in other words the most scientific—those that require the greatest measures of science to qualify a man for deciding upon and in respect of which any want of science and skill are liable to be attended with the most fatal consequences what should we have said if with a view of collecting the surest grounds for the decision of any of the great questions of chemistry the french academy of sciences if its members had remained unmurdered had referred such questions to the primary assemblies if a collection of general propositions put together with the design that seems to have given birth to this performance—propositions of the most general and extensive import embracing the whole field of legislation—were capable of being so worded and put together as to be of use it could only be on the condition of their being deduced in the way of abridgment from an already formed and existing assemblage of less general propositions constituting the tenor of the body of the laws but for these more general propositions to have been abstracted from that body of particular ones that body must have been already in existence the general and introductory part though placed first must have been constructed last—though first in the order of communication it should have been last in the order of composition for the framing of the propositions which were to be included time knowledge genius temper patience everything was wanting yet the system of propositions which were to include them it was determined to have at any rate of time a small quantity indeed might be made to serve upon the single and very simple condition of not bestowing a single thought upon the propositions which they were to include and as to knowledge genius temper and patience the place of all these trivial requisites was abundantly supplied by effrontery and selfconceit the business instead of being performed in the way of abridgment was performed in the way of anticipation—by a loose conjecture of what the particular propositions in question were they to be found might amount to what i mean to attack is not the subject or citizen of this or that country—not this or that citizen—not citizen sieyes or citizen anybody else but all antilegal rights of man all declarations of such rights what i mean to attack is not the execution of such a design in this or that instance but the design itself it is not that they have failed in their execution of the design by using the same word promiscuously in two or three senses—contradictory and incompatible senses—but in undertaking to execute a design which could not be executed at all without this abuse of words let a man distinguish the senses—let him allot and allot invariably a separate word for each and he will find it impossible to make up any such declaration at all without running into such nonsense as must stop the hand even of the maddest of the mad ex uno disce omnes—from this declaration of rights learn what all other declarations of rights—of rights asserted as against government in general must ever be—the rights of anarchy—the order of chaos it is right i should continue to possess the coat i have upon my back and so on with regard to everything else i look upon as my property at least till i choose to part with it it is right i should be at liberty to do as i please—it would be better if i might be permitted to add whether other people were pleased with what it pleased me to do or not but as that is hopeless i must be content with such a portion of liberty though it is     the least i can be content with as consists in the liberty of doing as i please subject to the exception of not doing harm to other people it is right i should be secure against all sorts of harm it is right i should be upon a par with everybody else—upon a par at least and if i can contrive to get a peep over other peoples heads where will be the harm in it but if all this is right now at what time was it ever otherwise it is now naturally right and at what future time will it be otherwise it is then unalterably right for everlasting as it is right i should possess all these blessings i have a right to all of them but if i have a right to the coat on my back i have a right to knock any man down who attempts to take it from me for the same reason if i have a right to be secure against all sorts of harm i have a right to knock any man down who attempts to harm me for the same reason if i have a right to do whatever i please subject only to the exception of not doing harm to other people it follows that subject only to that exception i have a right to knock any man down who attempts to prevent my doing anything that i please to do for the same reason if i have a right to be upon a par with everybody else in every respect it follows that should any man take upon him to raise his house higher than mine—rather than it should continue so i have a right to pull it down about his ears and to knock him down if he attempt to hinder me thus easy thus natural under the guidance of the selfish and antisocial passions thus insensible is the transition from the language of utility and peace to the language of mischief transition did i say—what transition—from right to right the propositions are identical—there is no transition in the case certainly as far as words go scarcely any no more than if you were to trust your horse with a man for a week or so and he were to return it blind and lame—it was your horse you trusted to him—it is your horse you have received again—what you had trusted to him you have received it is in england rather than in france that the discovery of the rights of man ought naturally to have taken its rise it is we—we english that have the better right to it it is in the english language that the transition is more natural than perhaps in most others at any rate more so than in the french it is in english and not in french that we may change the sense without changing the word and like don quixote on the enchanted horse travel as far as the moon and farther without ever getting off the saddle one and the same word right—right that most enchanting of words—is sufficient for operating the fascination the word is ours—that magic word which by its single unassisted powers completes the fascination in its adjective shape it is as innocent as a dove it breathes nothing but morality and peace it is in this shape that passing in at the heart it gets possession of the understanding—it then assumes its substantive shape and joining itself to a band of suitable associates sets up the banner of insurrection anarchy and lawless violence it is right that men should be as near upon a par with one another in every respect as they can be made consistently with general security here we have it in its adjective form synonymous with desirable proper becoming consonant to general utility and the like i have a right to put myself upon a par with everybody in every respect here we have it in its substantive sense forming with the other words a phrase equivalent to this—wherever i find a man who will not let me put myself on a par with him in every respect it is right and proper and becoming that i should knock him down if i have a mind to do so and if that will not do knock him on the head and so forth the french language is fortunate enough not to possess this mischievous abundance but a frenchman will not be kept back from his purpose by a want of words the want of an adjective composed of the same letters as the substantive right is no loss to him is has been ought to be shall be can—all are put for one another—all are pressed into the service—all made to answer the same purposes by this inebriating compound we have seen all the elements of the understanding confounded every fibre of the heart inflamed the lips prepared for every folly and the hand for every crime our right to this precious discovery such as it is of the rights of man must i repeat it have been prior to that of the french it has been seen how peculiarly rich we are in materials for making it right the substantive right is the child of law from real laws come real rights but from imaginary laws from laws of nature fancied and invented by poets rhetoricians and dealers in moral and intellectual poisons come imaginary rights a bastard brood of monsters gorgons and chimæras dire and thus it is that from legal rights the offspring of law and friends of peace come antilegal rights the mortal enemies of law the subverters of government and the assassins of security will this antidote to french poisons have its effect—will this preservative for the understanding and the heart against the fascination of sounds find lips to take it this in point of speedy or immediate efficacy at least     is almost too much to hope for alas how dependent are opinions upon sound who shall break the chains which bind them together by what force shall the associations between words and ideas be dissolved—associations coeval with the cradle—associations to which every book and every conversation give increased strength by what authority shall this original vice in the structure of language be corrected how shall a word which has taken root in the vitals of a language be expelled by what means shall a word in continual use be deprived of half its signification the language of plain strong sense is difficult to learn the language of smooth nonsense is easy and familiar the one requires a force of attention capable of stemming the tide of usage and example the other requires nothing but to swim with it it is for education to do what can be done and in education is though unhappily the slowest the surest as well as earliest resource the recognition of the nothingness of the laws of nature and the rights of man that have been grounded on them is a branch of knowledge of as much importance to an englishman though a negative one as the most perfect acquaintance that can be formed with the existing laws of england it must be so—shakespeare whose plays were filling english hearts with rapture while the drama of france was not superior to that of caffraria—shakespeare who had a key to all the passions and all the stores of language could never have let slip an instrument of delusion of such superior texture no it is not possible that the rights of man—the natural preadamitical antelegal and antilegal rights of man—should have been unknown to have been unemployed by shakespeare how could the macbeths the jaffiers the iagos do without them they present a cloak for every conspiracy—they hold out a mask for every crime—they are every villains armoury—every spendthrifts treasury but if the english were the first to bring the rights of man into the closet from the stage it is to the stage and the closet that they have confined them it was reserved for france—for france in her days of degradation and degeneration—in those days in comparison of which the worst of her days of fancied tyranny were halcyon ones—to turn debates into tragedies and the senate into a stage the mask is now taken off and the anarchist may be known by the language which he uses he will be found asserting rights and acknowledging them at the same time not to be recognised by government using instead of ought and ought not the words is or is not—can or can not in former times in the times of grotius and puffendorf these expressions were little more than improprieties in language prejudicial to the growth of knowledge at present since the french declaration of rights has adopted them and the french revolution displayed their import by a practical comment—the use of them is already a moral crime and not undeserving of being constituted a legal crime as hostile to the public peace declaration of the rights and duties of the man and the citizen anno      rights—article i the rights of man in society are liberty equality security and property comparing this declaration with its predecessor we may observe that it opens with a specimen of legislative shuffling on the one hand a sense of the absurdity of its predecessor and the mischief that had been the fruit of it on the other hand a determination not to acknowledge these things the sorts of rights which this second declaration as well as the first sets out with the intention of declaring are of two sorts those of the man and those of the citizen those which it immediately proceeds to declare are neither the one nor the other but something between both—the rights of man in society the difference is not a mere affair of words the rights declared by the first declaration were declared to be natural inalienable and     imprescriptible—such rights against which all laws that should at any time presume to strike would become ipso facto void if no distinction were to be recognised between the rights of the man and the rights of the citizen one of the expressions must be acknowledged to be unmeaning and the insertion of it a dangerous impertinence if a distinction between them be to be recognised it must be this that the rights of the man—the rights of the man as existing in a state antecedent to that of political society—antecedent to the state of citizenship—are the only one of the sorts to which the character of inalienable and imprescriptible can be understood to belong—those of the citizen growing out of the laws by which the state of citizenship is constituted are the produce of the law itself and may be conceived to remain at the disposal of the law which gave them birth and may continue to depend for their existence on the law from which they received it this second declaration—leaving the doubt in its full force whether there are or are not a certain description of rights over which laws have no power—a description of rights which as we have seen covers the whole field of legislation shutting the door against everything that can present itself under the name of law—consequently whether such laws as they are about to create are or are not capable of possessing any binding force—varnishes over the ambiguity by a subterfuge obliterating the distinction so carefully made and so recently recognised between the man and the citizen at the next step they produce instead of the two a sort of neutral double man who is neither one nor the other or else both in one comparing the list of rights whoever they belong to whether to the man or the citizen or the man in society we shall find that between the year      and the year      inalienable as they are they have undergone a change indeed for a set of inalienable rights they must be acknowledged to have been rather unstable at the time of the passing the first article of the declaration of      there were but two of them—liberty and equality by the time the second article of that same declaration was framed three new ones had started up in addition to liberty viz property security and resistance to oppression total four sorts of rights—not five for in the same interval an accident had happened to equality and somehow or other it was not to be found in the interval between      and      it has been found again accordingly in the list of      we may observe equality occupying a station elevated above everything but liberty with security and property lying at its feet looking for resistance against oppression we shall find it kicked out of doors but like the images of the two illustrious romans mentioned by tacitus not the less regarded for not being seen to account for this exclusion we must recollect that between      and     —in short from the moment of his naturalization for it was in america that he had his birth citizen resistanceagainstoppression had been playing strange tricks he had been constantly flying in the face of the powers in being whatever they were—he had rendered himself a perfect nuisance and so great a nuisance that it was high time for him to be sent to coventry thither he has accordingly been sent though ready to present himself at the call of patriotism whenever a king is to be assassinated or a riot to be kicked up by the sagacity of the constitutionalist of      he had been at length discovered to be a most dangerous enemy to security after a four years experience of his activity in that line two years before his naturalization in france i had denounced him as such in a book which found its way into the hands of condorcet and others but my denunciation was not heard as to the rest the nonsensicalness and mischievousness of this article has been pointed out in the observations on the corresponding article of the declaration of      article ii liberty consists in the power of doing that which hurts not the rights of others the same as the commencement of article iv in the declaration of      except as to the insertion of the words—the rights article iii sentence   equality consists in this—that the law is the same for all whether it protect or whether it punish sentence   equality admits not any distinction of births—any hereditary succession of powers in article   of the declaration of      we saw this given in the character of a maxim in which character the propriety of it has been discussed the maxim is now turned into a definition of equality this is equality certainly as far as it goes but is it to be understood as stopping here or is it to go any further and how much further these questions are not answered apparently because the declarationmakers were afraid to answer them thus much is certain there is nothing in this declaration of rights to stop it therefore on it must go in its own course which course can never have found its end till it has laid everything smack smooth not leaving     any one stone in the whole fabric of property upon another that equality should leave no hereditary succession of powers is natural and consistent enough but how does it contrive to leave any powers at all where is the equality between him who has powers and him who has none the exclusion of the hereditary succession of powers excepted it turns out then that people are not the more upon a par for the possession of this right and that in short to speak correctly equality and inequality are the same things no distinction of births—no distinction in point of birth how is that managed are all the men in france born of the same father and mother will democratic omnipotence prevent the montmorencies from being descended from a known line of ancestors beginning under the capets or i forget what other family from a line beginning under clovis what they probably meant to say is that no distinction in point of rights should be suffered to depend on any distinction in point of birth but as epigrams are at least as necessary in a french book of legislation as laws the paradoxical turn of expression was preferred as being the most natural article iv security results from the concurrence of all in securing the rights of each an epigram upon security—a definition imitated from le malade imaginaire the property which opium has of laying men to sleep results from its soporific quality now citizen if you do not know what security is you deserve to have your house knocked down about your ears concurrence of all on one hand—rights of each on the other from this antithesis we learn that whatever security happens to be conferred by the exertions of any number less than all is no security at all article v property is the right of enjoying and disposing of ones goods—of ones revenues—of the fruit of ones labour and ones industry another definition in the soporific style but perhaps not quite so innocent property is the right of enjoyment and disposal let a man then have ever so much of either right yet if he have not the other he has no property it is perhaps owing to this definition of property that what the cidevant clergy of france had to live upon was not their property and consequently there was no harm in robbing them of it in england tenant for life of a settled estate conceives himself to be a man of property this article informs him that he knows nothing about the matter in england a woman who has an advowson conceives the advowson to be her property let her consult these french legislators they will tell her it is no such thing since she cannot give herself the living let us pass on to the declaration of the duties of man right being one of the fruits of law and duty another it oceurred to the second set of constitutionmakers that a declaration of rights would be but a lopsided job without a declaration of duties to match it on the other side the first declaration of rights having driven the people mad a declaration of duties it was hoped might help to bring them to their senses whatever were their notions about the matter thus much must be admitted to be true that if poison must be taken an antidote may have its use but what would be still better would be to throw both together poison and antidote into the fire every medicine that is good for anything say the physicians is a poison the political medicine we have now to analyze forms no exception to the rule what seems to have been no better understood by the second set of constitutionmakers than by the first is that rights and duties grow on the same bough and are inseparable that so sure as rights are created duties are created too and that though you may make duties without making rights which is in fact the result of the alas but too numerous catalogue of laws by which nobody is the better yet to make rights without making duties is impossible as deep judges of legislative composition as monsieur jourdan who talked prose without knowing it it seems to have escaped their observation that in making rights under pretence of dealing them out ready made they were making duties without knowing anything about the matter article i or preamble the declaration of rights contains the obligations of legislators—the maintenance of society requires that those who compose it know and fulfil equally their duties whether by duties in the latter part of the sentence were meant exactly the same things as by obligations in the first i will not take upon me absolutely to determine—if it were it will furnish one amongst so many other proofs how insensible these masters of legislation are of the value of useful precision in comparison with fancied elegance article ii all the duties of the man and the citizen are derived from these two principles engraven by nature in all breasts in the hearts of all men— do not to another that which you would not men should do to you     do constantly to others the good which you would receive from men the known source of this doubleheaded precept is the new testament whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you do ye even so unto them do as you would be done by says the abridged expression of it as given by the english proverb what improvement the precept has received from the new edition given of it by the antichristian hand will presently appear a division is here made of it into two branches a negative and a positive—the tendency of the negative placed where it is is pernicious—the tendency of the positive branch worded as it is absurd and contrary to the spirit of the original—the former for want of the limitations necessary to the application here made of it is too ample the latter by the tail clumsily tacked on to it is made too narrow in what country is it that it is the wish of accusers to be accused—of judges to be condemned—of guillotiners to be guillotined in topsyturvyland where cooks are roasted by pigs and hounds hunted by hares in that same land a law thus worded might do no harm and government might go on as well with it as without it in france thus much is clear that whatsoever individual prosecutes a delinquent—whatsoever judge condemns him—whatsoever subordinate minister of justice executes the sentence of the judge is a transgressor of this law—this fundamental law—given without reservation or exception—said to be engraven just as we see it in all hearts and placed first in the list of duties morality not affecting precision addresses itself to the heart law of which precision is the life and soul addresses itself to the head the positive branch of the precept under the necessity it should seem of rounding the period and making the line run well is so worded as to shut the door against generosity do to a man that good what good why exactly and constantly just that very good which you want him to do to you and if you happen not to want anything of him what then why then let him want and welcome there is nothing in this rule of law that can afford him a handle to take hold of should he be inclined to accuse you of a breach of this fundamental duty if you want a twopenny loaf for example go to the baker and give him either a twopenny loaf or twopence—in the first case you fulfil the letter—in the latter the spirit of the law should you see a man starving for want of such a loaf let him starve and welcome—you want nothing of him not you—neither the twopenny loaf nor the twopence let him starve on there is nothing he can indict you upon in this law article iv no one is a good citizen if he be not a good son a good father a good brother a good friend a good husband good—as good as any other good thing that has been said a thousand times over in a novel or a play—silly as a law—scarcely reconcilable to the next preceding article and not altogether reconcilable to the interests of the community at large the word civil gives name to one class of duties—the word domestic to another is it impossible to violate one law without violating another does a man by beating his wife defraud the revenue does a man who smuggles coffee beat his wife brutus—the elder brutus—who under a government where the father had the powers of life and death over the child put his sons to death for conspiracy against the government—he a bad citizen or does goodness in a father consist in putting his children to death a friend of lord monteagles was engaged with guy fawkes and others in a conspiracy for blowing up the legislature under this fourth article and the third what should monteagle have done the third bids him discover the plot for it bids him defend and serve the society and the laws thus threatened with destruction by the plot—the fourth bids him say nothing about the matter for what could he say about it that would not endanger the safety of his friend if monteagle had happened to be a wellwisher to the conspiracy and desirous of concealing it what could he have desired for his security better than such a clause article v no man is a good man if he be not frankly and religiously an observer of the laws of the laws—of what laws—of all laws—of all laws present and to come whatsoever they may forbid whatsoever they may enjoin a religious observer of the laws which proscribe his religion—the only religion he thinks true—and bid him drag to judicial slaughter those who exercise it to talk of religion—except in the way of rhetorical flourish—in the style which is here conceived to be the proper style for law may perhaps be deemed on this occasion an abuse of words well then the men of september or since they are out of power the men of the  0th of august or the conquerors of the bastile were they good men—were they frank and religious observers of the law declaring and enacting the inviolability of the king the question may seem puzzling but a former passage will help us to a solution by articles xviii and xx of the declaration of rights a law is no law unless made by democracy run mad—made by men women and children—convicts     madmen and so on—mediately or immediately here then we have a clue—in a democracy run mad goodness means submission to the laws under every other sort of government goodness means rebellion article vi he who openly violates the law declares himself in a state of war with society more very decent clappable matter for the stage in a book of law preciously absurd and not a little dangerous to be in a state of war is to be in that state in which the business of each party is to kill the other in kindness to one set of buttonmakers we have a silly law in england condemning the whole country to wear now and for everlasting a sort of buttons they do not like a more silly law can scarcely be imagined but laws of a similar stamp are but too plentiful in great britain and france will have good luck indeed if laws of similar complexion do not in spite of every exertion of democratic wisdom find their way into france in london you may see every day in any street men women and children violating these and other such wholesome laws knowingly or unknowingly with sufficient openness since all these wicked uncivic buttonwearers have declared war against society what say you citizen legalepigrammaker the penner of this declaration—what say you to a few fourandtwenty pounders filled with grapeshot to clear the streets of them article vii he who without openly infringing the laws eludes them by cunning or address wounds the interests of all he renders himself unworthy of their benevolence and their esteem as to the truth of this proposition whether the eluding the observance of a law be or be not prejudicial to anybody depends upon the nature of the law if the law be one of those which are of no use to anybody the eluding of it does no harm to anybody if it be one of those which are of use to this or that description of persons and that only the eluding of it may be a prejudice to them but does no harm to anybody else were the law of libel as it stands in england to be obeyed without infraction there would be no more liberty of discussion publication or discourse on political subjects in england than there is on religious subjects in spain were it executed in every instance of its being infringed there would not be a man or a woman in england who had eyes or ears out of jail the law of england taking it with all its faults is probably at least as near perfection upon the whole as the law of my other country at the same time were any good to come of it i would engage to find laws in it by dozens and by scores any one of which if generally obeyed or at least if constantly executed would be enough to effect the destruction of the country and render it miserable things being in this state there seems unhappily no help for it but that it must be left to each mans conscience in respect to what laws he shall be forward and to what backward to pay obedience and lend his hand to execute while matters are in this imperfect state indiscriminate obedience is no more to be insisted on with regard to laws in any country than under a limited monarchy passive obedience is with regard to kings to judge by these three last articles of the declaration of duties of the man and the citizen the compositor seems to have been rather hardly put to it to fill up the requisite quantity of paper rights of man present themselves in sufficient plenty but when he comes to duties it becomes apparent that when a man has said it is your duty to obey the laws he has said all that is to be said about the matter accordingly the contents of these three articles are not any addition to the list of duties but observations on the subject consisting of a string of epigrams and fine speeches fit for plays in regard to offences the great difficulty is and the great study ought to be to distinguish them from one another the business of this article is to confound them in england simple disobedience is one thing—rebellion technically but rather improperly called treason another the punishment of the one where no special punishment is appointed is a slight fine or a short imprisonment that of the other capital in france under the auspices of this declaration these trifling differences are not thought worth noticing—disobedience and rebellion are discovered to be the same thing the state of the laws in france must be superior not only to what it has ever been during the revolutionary anarchy but to what it ever has been during the best times of french history or of the history of any other country of considerable extent if there be a single day in any year in which scores of laws have not been transgressed and that openly by thousands and tens of thousands of individuals if this be true the effect of this single article must be that after the restoration of peace and the perfect establishment of the best of all possible constitutions the habitual state of france will be a state of civil war in the codes of other countries the great end of government is to quiet and repress the dissocial passions in france the great study is to inflame and excite them it is so when declaring rights it is so when declaring     duties under this code to be a true frenchman a man must be for ever in a passion—ever ready to cut either his own or his neighbours throat whatever may be the subject with which this constitution commences it ends in anarchy under this régime there appears no difference between a tragedy and a law in respect to style fine sentiments epigrams chaleur mouvement are equally indispensable in both every tragedy must be levelled at some law—every law must read like a tragedy—every law must end in a tragedy article viii on the maintenance of property rests the cultivation of the lands all the productions every means of labour and the whole fabric of social order the article as thus worded reads bold enough and if it were less so it would not be faithful it presents a striking picture of the penman his budget of duties emptied his subject exhausted and what is more even his stock of fine speeches yet he cannot persuade himself to stop he would fain persuade his fellowcitizens to pay respect to property by appealing to their love of country work and its productions and if they have no regard for these things to their love of work in general and if labour have no charms for them as a last resource to their love of social order article ix every citizen owes his services to his country to the maintenance of liberty equality and property as often as the law calls upon him to defend them this is the last in this list of dutydeclaring articles and the conclusion of this short but superfluous composition is of a piece with the beginning—full of uncertainty obscurity and danger every citizen owes his services to his country c owes services what services for what time and upon what terms military services for soldiers pay and for life if this were not meant nothing can be easier than for any legislature—any administration—any administrator—any recruiting sergeant to give it that meaning property we have seen already secured by double and treble tether liberty is here secured by a system of universal crimping in england pressing is still looked upon as a hardship though no man is liable to be pressed who has not voluntarily engaged in a profession which he knows will subject him to it what should we say in england were an act of parliament to be passed in virtue of which all individuals without exception all ages and professions sick and well married and single housekeepers and lodgers lawyers clergymen and quakers were liable to be pressed for soldiers—women perhaps into the bargain—since in france womens necks have been found to fit the guillotine as well as mens and in england thanks to the sages of the law women make good constables equality also is to be maintained as well as property equality without limitation and that by everybody at the call of anybody the distribution of property being at the time of issuing this declaration prodigiously unequal—as much at least as in many a monarchy—how are equality and property to be there at the same time the maintenance of both being incompatible—to choose which of the two shall be maintained since both cannot be maintained together seems to be left to the wisdom of the citizens rich and poor industrious or idle full or fasting as occasion may arise to a considerable majority the maintenance of equality will probably be the pleasanter task of the two as well as the more profitable   0 observations on parts of the declaration of rights as proposed by citizen sieyes one general imperfection runs through the whole of this composition the terms employed leave it continually in doubt whether it be meant to be prospective merely or retrospective also—whether it mean solely to declare what shall be the state of the law after the moment of the enactment of this declaration or likewise what has been its state previous to that moment to judge from the words it should seem almost everywhere to include this retrospect the objections to such retrospective declaration are—  that it is notoriously untrue—  that the untruth of it is supposed by the very act of enacting the declaration since if what is there established were already established there would be no use for establishing it anew—  that the declaration of the past existence of the provisions in question would be of no use though the matter of fact were true every society cannot but be the free work of a convention entered into between all the associated members hence it appears that there never has yet been such a thing as a society existing in the world this is the first and most fundamental of all the fundamental truths for the discovery of which the blind and obstinate world is indebted to citizen sieyes here live we somehow or other in great britain it seems to us that we are living in society but citizen sieyes who knows everything and everything in his own way knows it is no such thing what sort of a state is it we are living in if we really do live to know this we must wait till a word has been assigned as suited to our wretched condition adapted to express the miserable state we live in by the grace and ingenuity of citizen sieyes but do we live after all whether we do or no is at least as doubtful as whether we are in society whether the state we are in living or not living be a state of society is citizen sieyes living to judge by bickerstaffs test this were matter of serious doubt the argument however does not seem conclusive a man in bedlam or in the french convention might be writing such stuff—stuff altogether of a piece with this and that not only with perfect fluency but with perfect consistency of character between the composition and the situation that gave birth to it from a mans being known to write such stuff it follows therefore not that a man is not living but that he is living either in bedlam or in the french convention a man turned crazy by selfconceit takes a word in universal use and determines within himself that he will use it in such a sense as a man never used it in before with a word thus poisoned he makes up a proposition—any one that comes uppermost and this he calls ingenuity—this proposition he endeavours to cram down the throats of all those over whom he has or conceives himself to have power or influence—more especially of all legislators—of the legislators of the present and all future times—and this he calls liberty and this he call government the object of a political society can be no other than the greatest good of all this article announces a matter of fact in the form of an universal proposition which so far from being universally true is not nor perhaps ever was true in any instance it exhibits the same silly and unnecessary substitution of can not for ought not—the same use of an improper word for a proper one at least equally obvious—of an ambiguous for an unambiguous—unless to the original import of the word can be here meant to be added or rather substituted its mischiefmaking and anarchyexciting import—and that in consequence every society in which on any point any notion or notions of the public good were entertained different from those of citizen sieyes shall on every such occasion be regarded as ipso facto in a state of dissolution     one thing may be learned from the order given to the two articles—that happiness in society is an article but of secondary account a matter of superior importance is—that the society should have been got together upon the neverexemplified and physicallyimpossible plan of an original and universal contract every man is sole proprietor of his own person and this property is inalienable more nonsense—more mischievous nonsense—tendencies of the most mischievous kind wrapped up under the cover of a silly epigram as if a man were one thing the person of the same man another thing as if a man kept his person when he happened to have one as he does his watch in one of his pockets while the sentence means nothing it is as true as other nonsense give it a meaning any meaning whatsoever that the words are capable of bearing according to any import ever given to them and it is false if by the property in question it is meant to include all the uses that can be made of the proprietary subject the proposition is not selfcontradictory and nonsensical it is only a nugatory proposition of the identical kind if each individual be the only individual that is to be allowed to make any use whatsoever of the faculties of all kinds active and passive mental and corporal of that individual and this be meant by being the proprietor of the person of an individual then true it is that the person of each individual can have but one proprietor—but if the case be in any instance that while the individual himself and he alone is permitted to make use to certain purposes of the faculties of that individual for a certain time some other—any other—is permitted to make use of the faculties of the same individual to other purposes for the same time then the proposition that no individual can have a property in the person of another individual is false—the proposition that no man shall be suffered to have any property in the person of another would be a mischievous one and mischievous to a degree of madness in what manner is the legal relation of the husband to the wife constituted but by giving him a right for a certain time to the use of certain faculties of hers—by giving him in so far a property in her person—and so with respect to the legal relations of the father to the child under age and of the master to the apprentice or other servant whatever be the nature of the service the present tense is is absurdly put for the future shall be injustice and of the most cruel kind lurks under this absurdity the effect of the future would only be to cut up domestic power and thence domestic society for the future the effect of the present is to cut it up at the instant and by necessary inference as to the past and to put every past exercise of such power upon the footing of a crime in a word to have the retroactive effect disclaimed by the constitution of      if no individual have at this present time any property however limited in the person of any other individual it must be in virtue of some cause which has prevented his ever having had any such property in any past period of time it must be in a word in virtue of some such cause as this viz its being contrary to the eternal as well as inalienable and natural rights of man to possess any such property if it be a crime in a man now to send his servant on an errand with a bundle on his back—to dip his ailing infant in a cold bath—or to exercise the rights supposed to be given him by marriage on his wife—it must have always been a crime and a crime of equal dye punishable at the mercy of such judges as citizen sieyes to make the matter worse—the mischief greater—the absurdity more profound—this property such as it is whatever it be—all the property that any individual has in his own person—is to be considered as inalienable no individual is to be suffered to give any other individual a right to make use of his person his faculties his services in any shape no man shall let himself out to service—no man shall put himself or his son out to serve as an apprentice—no man shall appoint a guardian to his child—no woman shall engage herself to a man in marriage will it be said that there is no such thing as alienation for a time or will it be said in justification of the citizen that the citizen did not know what he was talking about and that though he spoke of alienation in general alienation for all manner of terms the only sort of alienation he really meant to interdict in respect of the property in question was alienation during life and that the meaning of the citizen was not absolutely to forbid marriage—that he meant to allow of marriage for limited terms of years and meant only to prohibit marriage for life but supposing even this to have been the purpose and that purpose ever so good a one the provision is still a futile one and inadequate to that purpose to what purpose forbid an alienation for life if you admit of it for years without restricting it to such a number of years as shall ensure it against possessing a duration coextensive with at least the longest ordinary term of life no such limitation has the citizen vouchsafed to give—possibly as not finding it altogether easy to put any such limitation in years and figures into the mouth of queen nature whose prime minister citizen sieyes like so many other citizens has been pleased to make himself the article seems to be levelled at negro     slavery but i do not see what purpose it is capable of answering in that view does it mean to announce what has been the state of the law hitherto or what shall be the state of the law in future in the first case its truth is questionable and true or false it is of no use in the latter sense does it mean to declare that no person shall have the right of exacting personal service of any other or producing physical impressions on his passive faculties without his consent it reprobates all rights to services of any kind and all powers of punishment does it declare that no such powers shall exist without limitation—it does not so much as provide against negro slavery even where the conditions on which it is established are most indefensible for nowhere has the power of the master over the slave subsisted without limitations does this article mean to set at perfect liberty all negro slaves at once this would be not more irreconcilable with every idea of justice with regard to the interest of the present master than with every idea of prudence with regard to the interest of the slaves themselves every author may publish or cause his productions to be published and he may cause them to circulate freely as well by the post as by any other way without having ever to fear any abuse of confidence i shall make no observations upon the dangers arising from this unlimited liberty but i cannot refrain from pointing out the silliness of the expression the author intended to have said that every abuse of confidence ought to be treated as an offence but what he has said is that the offence is impossible so impossible that there is no reason to fear it as if this declaration would be sufficient to deprive government and individuals of the power to commit an abuse of confidence letters in particular ought to be considered as sacred by all the intermediate persons who may be found between the person who writes and him to whom they are written what does this word sacred mean is this the manner in which a legislator ought to speak what if a calumny—a plan of conspiracy—a project of assassination—be put into a letter is that letter to be sacred will the opening it be sacrilege this crime if it be one will be ranked in that class of crimes which have commonly been considered the most enormous offences against religion—offences against god himself whilst as to the act itself is it for the public good that government should open the letters that is the question if the law prohibit it the post would become a terrible engine in the hands of malefactors and conspirators with the intention of protecting the communications of individuals this law would expose the public to the greatest dangers there are some crimes so mischievous that no means ought to be neglected for their prevention or detection will it be said that the fear of having their letters opened will restrain honest correspondents in the communications of commerce or the effusions of friendship it is true that if the simple communication of opinions between individuals should be constituted a crime the opening of letters might become a terrible engine of tyranny but it is here that the precautions against abuse should be placed it is this which is done in england where the secretary of state may open letters upon his responsibility though it be not allowed to any one else every man is equally at liberty to go or stay to enter or to go out and even to leave the kingdom and to return into it as shall seem good to him this article has reference not to the citizen alone but to every man to every stranger as well as every frenchman all are at liberty to go or stay to enter or to go out to leave the kingdom or to return into it as shall seem good to them absurdity cannot go farther is there to be no police cannot intercourse be interdicted—may not public edifices be closed—may not access to fortifications he prevented c with this unlimited right how would it be possible to advise the construction of prisons for the detention of malefactors how could the author of this declaration tolerate the laws against emigrants were not these laws a formal denial of the rights of man i do not impute these extravagant intentions to the author of the article he had concluded the preceding article by the words—the law alone can mark the limits which ought to be given to this liberty as well as every other and i suppose that the words in the same manner at the head of this announce that the liberty of going and coming is subject to the same restriction but then the proposition which seems to say much would have said nothing—you may do everything except what the laws prohibit dangerous or insignificant such is the alternative which is without ceasing found in this declaration in short every man is at liberty to dispose of his wealth of his property and to regulate his expense as he thinks proper here there is no legal restriction the proposition is unlimited if by disposing of his wealth the author intend that he may do whatever he likes the proposition is absurd in the extreme are there no necessary limits to the employment of his property ought a man to have the right of establishing after his death either religious or antireligious foundations at the expense of his family     ought not the law to hinder an individual from disinheriting his children without cause assigned to regulate his expense as he thinks proper is a good housekeeping expression a master may speak in this manner to his steward but is this the style of a legislator minors madmen prodigals ought to be placed under positive restrictions as to their expenses there are cases in which certain sumptuary laws may be suitable there may be good reasons for prohibiting games of hazard lotteries public entertainments donations after the manner of the romans and a thousand other species of expense the law has for its object the common interest it cannot grant any privilege to any one the first proposition is false in fact the law ought only to have for its object the common interest this is what is true this error perpetually recurs in this little work but is the consequence which is drawn from this principle just may there not be some privileges founded upon the common interest in one sense all powers are privileges in another sense all social distinctions are so also a title of honour an honorary decoration an order of knighthood—these are all privileges ought the legislature to be interdicted from the employment of these means of remuneration there is one species of privilege certainly very advantageous the patents which are granted in england for a limited time for inventions in arts and manufactures of all the methods of exciting and rewarding industry this is the least burthensome and the most exactly proportioned to the merit of the invention this privilege has nothing in common with monopolies which are so justly decried and if privileges are established they ought to be instantly abolished whatever may be their origin here is the most unjust the most tyrannical the most odious principle instantly abolished this is the order of the despot who will listen to nothing who will make everything bend to his will who sacrifices everything to his caprice there are some privileges and rights which have been purchased at great price their sudden abolition would throw a great number of families into despair it would strip them of their property—it would produce the same wrong to them as if a multitude of strangers were admitted to share their revenues and that instantly there are some magisterial offices held by hereditary title the possessors would be deprived of them without regard to their circumstances to their welfare or even to the interests of the state itself—and that instantly there are some commercial societies to which the law has granted monopolies these monopolies are abolished without regard to the ruin of the associates to the advances they have made to the engagements they have formed—and that instantly one great merit in a good administration is that it proceeds gently in the reform of abuses—that it does not sacrifice existing interests—that it provides for the enjoyments of individuals—that it gradually prepares for good institutions—that it avoids all violent changes in condition establishment and fortune instantly is a term suitable to the meridians of algiers and constantinople gradually is the language of justice and prudence if men are not equal in means—that is to say in wealth in mind in strength c—it does not follow that they ought not all to be equal in rights certainly the wife is not equal in rights to her husband neither is the child under age equal to his father nor the apprentice to his master nor the soldier to his officer nor the prisoner to the jailer unless the duty of obedience should be exactly equal to the right of commanding difference in rights is precisely that which constitutes social subordination establish equal rights for all there will be no more obedience there will be no more society he who possesses property possesses rights—exercises rights—which the nonproprietor does not possess and does not exercise if all men are equal in rights there will not exist any rights for if all have the same right to a thing there will no longer be any right for any one every citizen who is unable to provide for his own wants has a right to the assistance of his fellowcitizens to have a right to the assistance of his fellowcitizens is to have a right to their assistance in their individual or their collective capacity to give to every poor person a right to the assistance of every individual who is not equally poor is to overturn every idea of property for as soon as i am unable to provide for my subsistence i have right to be supported by you i have a right to what you possess—it is my property as well as yours the portion which is necessary to me is no longer yours—it is mine you rob me if you keep it from me it is true that there are difficulties in its execution i am poor to which of my fellowcitizens ought i to address myself to make him give me what i want is it to peter rather than to paul if you confine yourself to declaring a general right without     specifying how it is to be executed you do nothing at all i may die of hunger before i can find out who ought to supply me with food what the author has said is not what he meant to say his intention was to declare that the poor should have a right to the assistance of the community but then it is necessary to determine how this assistance ought to be levied and distributed it is necessary to organize the administration which ought to assist the poor—to create the officers who ought to inquire into their necessities and to regulate the manner in which the poor ought to proceed in availing themselves of their right the relief of indigence is one of the noblest branches of civilization in a state of nature when we can form any idea of it those who cannot procure food die of hunger there must exist a superfluity for a numerous class of the society before it is possible to apply a part of it to the maintenance of the poor but it is possible to suppose such a state of poverty—such a famine—that it would no longer be possible to supply bread to all who want it how then can we convert this duty of benevolence into an absolute right this would be to give the indigent class the most false and dangerous ideas it would not only destroy all gratitude on the part of the poor towards their benefactors—it would put arms in their hands against all proprietors i am aware that the author would defend himself against all the consequences which so clearly spring from his principles by the clause which he has inserted that no one has the right to injure another and that the law may put bounds to the exercise of all the branches of liberty but this clause reduces all his rights to nothing for if the law may put bounds to them till these are known what knowledge can i have of my rights—what use can i make of them nothing can be more fallacious than a declaration which gives me with one hand what it authorizes the taking from me with the other thus cut down this declaration might be propounded at morocco or algiers and do neither good nor harm     principles of international law by jeremy bentham now first published from the original manuscripts         essay i objects of international law if a citizen of the world had to prepare an universal international code what would he propose to himself as his object it would be the common and equal utility of all nations this would be his inclination and his duty would or would not the duty of a particular legislator acting for one particular nation be the same with that of the citizen of the world that moderation which would be a virtue in an individual acting for his own interests would it become a vice or treason in a public man commissioned by a whole nation would it be sufficient for him to pursue in a strict or generous manner their interests as he would pursue his own—or would it be proper that he should pursue their interests as he would pursue his own or ought he so to regulate his course in this respect as they would regulate theirs were it possible for them to act with a full knowledge of all circumstances and in this latter case would the course he would pursue be unjust or equitable what ought to be required of him in this respect whatever he may think upon these questions—how small soever may be the regard which it may be wished that he should have for the common utility it will not be the less necessary for him to understand it this will be necessary for him on two accounts in the first place that he may follow this object in so far as his particular object is comprised in it—secondly that he may frame according to it the expectations that he ought to entertain the demands he ought to make upon other nations for in conclusion the line of common utility once drawn this would be the direction towards which the conduct of all nations would tend—in which their common efforts would find least resistance—in which they would operate with the greatest force—and in which the equilibrium once established would be maintained with the least difficulty let us take for example the famous law with respect to prizes adopted by so many nations at the suggestion of catherine ii of russia how formidable soever may have been the initiating power there is no reason to think that it was fear which operated upon so many nations together so powerful and some of them so remote it must have been its equity that is to say its common utility or what amounts to the same thing its apparent utility which determined their acceptance of it i say real or apparent for it will be seen that this is not the place to decide without necessity upon a question so delicate and complex but ought the sovereign of a state to sacrifice the interests of his subjects for the advantage of foreigners why not—provided it be in a case if there be such an one in which it would have been praiseworthy in his subjects to make the sacrifice themselves probity itself so praiseworthy in an individual why should it not be so in a whole nation praiseworthy in each one how can it be otherwise in all it may have been true that charles the second did well in selling dunkirk he would not have done less well had he not put the price in his own pocket it is the end which determines the means here the end changes or at least appears to change it is therefore necessary that the means should change or appear to change also the end of the conduct which a sovereign ought to observe relative to his own subjects—the end of the internal laws of a society—ought to be the greatest happiness of the society concerned this is the end which individuals will unite in approving if they approve of any it is the straight line—the shortest line—the most natural of all those by which it is possible for a sovereign to direct his course the end of the conduct he ought to observe towards other men what ought it to be judging by the same principle shall it again be said the greatest happiness of his own subjects upon this footing the welfare the demands of other men will be as nothing in his eyes with regard to them he will have no other object than that of subjecting them to his wishes by all manner of means he will serve them as he actually serves the beasts which are used by him as they use the herbs on which they browse—in short as the ancient greeks as the romans as all the models of virtue in antiquity as all the nations with whose history we are acquainted employed them     yet in proceeding in this career he cannot fail always to experience a certain resistance—resistance similar in its nature and in its cause if not always in its certainty and efficacy to that which individuals ought from the first to experience in a more restricted career so that from reiterated experience states ought either to have set themselves to seek out—or at least would have found their line of least resistance as individuals of that same society have already found theirs and this will be the line which represents the greatest and common utility of all nations taken together the point of repose will be that in which all the forces find their equilibrium from which the greatest difficulty would be found in making them to depart hence in order to regulate his proceedings with regard to other nations a given sovereign has no other means more adapted to attain his own particular end than the setting before his eyes the general end—the most extended welfare of all the nations on the earth so that it happens that this most vast and extended end—this foreign end—will appear so to speak to govern and to carry with it the principal the ultimate end in such manner that in order to attain to this there is no method more sure for a sovereign than so to act as if he had no other object than to attain to the other—in the same manner as in its approach to the sun a satellite has no other course to pursue than that which is taken by the planet which governs it for greater simplicity let us therefore substitute everywhere this object to the other—and though unhappily there has not yet been any body of law which regulates the conduct of a given nation in respect to all other nations on every occasion as if this had been or say rather as if this ought to be the rule—yet let us do as much as is possible to establish one   the first object of international law for a given nation—utility general in so far as it consists in doing no injury to the other nations respectively saving the regard which is proper to its own wellbeing   second object—utility general in so far as it consists in doing the greatest good possible to other nations saving the regard which is proper to its own wellbeing   third object—utility general in so far as it consists in the given nation not receiving any injury from other nations respectively saving the regard due to the wellbeing of these same nations   fourth object—utility general in so far as it consists in such state receiving the greatest possible benefit from all other nations saving the regard due to the wellbeing of these nations it is to the two former objects that the duties which the given nation ought to recognise may be referred it is to the two latter that the rights which it ought to claim may be referred but if these same rights shall in its opinion be violated in what manner by what means shall it apply or seek for satisfaction there is no other mode but that of war but war is an evil—it is even the complication of all other evils   fifth object—in case of war make such arrangements that the least possible evil may be produced consistent with the acquisition of the good which is sought for expressed in the most general manner the end that a disinterested legislator upon international law would propose to himself would therefore be the greatest happiness of all nations taken together in resolving this into the most primitive principles he would follow the same route which he would follow with regard to internal laws he would set himself to prevent positive international offences—to encourage the practice of positively useful actions he would regard as a positive crime every proceeding—every arrangement by which the given nation should do more evil to foreign nations taken together whose interests might be affected than it should do good to itself for example the seizing a port which would be of no use except as the means of advantageously attacking a foreign nation—the closing against other nations or another nation the seas and rivers which are the highways of our globe—the employing force or fraud for preventing a foreign nation from carrying on commerce with another nation but by their reciprocity injuries may compensate one another in the same manner he would regard as a negative offence every determination by which the given nation should refuse to render positive services to a foreign nation when the rendering of them would produce more good to the lastmentioned nation than it would produce evil to itself for example if the given nation without having reason to fear for its own preservation occupying two countries of which the productions were different should obstinately prohibit commerce with them and a foreign nation—or if when a foreign nation should be visited with misfortune and require assistance it should neglect to furnish it—or in conclusion if having in its own power certain malefactors who have malâ fide committed crimes to the prejudice of the foreign nation it should neglect to do what depends upon it to bring them to justice war is as has been said a species of procedure by which one nation endeavours to enforce its rights at the expense of another nation it is the only method to which recourse can be had when no other method of     obtaining satisfaction can be found by complainants who have no arbitrator between them sufficiently strong absolutely to take from them all hope of resistance but if internal procedure be attended by painful ills international procedure is attended by ills infinitely more painful—in certain respects in point of intensity commonly in point of duration and always in point of extent the counterpart of them will however be found in the catalogue of offences against justice the laws of peace would therefore be the substantive laws of the international code the laws of war would be the adjective laws of the same code the thread of analogy is now spun it will be easy to follow it there are however certain differences a nation has its property—its honour—and even its condition it may be attacked in all these particulars without the individuals who compose it being affected will it be said that it has its person let us guard against the employment of figures in matter of jurisprudence lawyers will borrow them and turn them into fictions amidst which all light and common sense will disappear then mists will rise amidst the darkness of which they will reap a harvest of false and pernicious consequences among nations there is no punishment in general there is nothing but restitution to the effect of causing the evil to cease—rarely indemnification for the past because among them there can scarcely be any mauvaise foi there is but too much of it too often among their chiefs so that there would be no great evil if at the close of his career every conqueror were to end his days upon the rack—if the justice which thomyris executed upon cyrus were not deemed more striking and his head were not thrown into a vessel of blood—without doubting that the head of cyrus was most properly thrown there but however dishonest the intention of their chiefs may be the subjects are always honest the nation once bound—and it is the chief which binds it—however criminal the aggression may be there is properly no other criminal than the chief—individuals are only his innocent and unfortunate instruments the extenuation which is drawn from the weight of authority rises here to the level of an entire exemption the suffrages of the principle of antipathy are here found in accord with the principle of utility on the one part vengeance wants a suitable object on the other hand every punishment would be unnecessary useless expensive and inefficacious as to the third and fourth objects it is scarcely necessary to insist on them—nations as well as men sovereigns as well as individuals pay sufficient attention to their own interests—there is scarcely any need to seek to lead them to it there remain the two first and the last to actions by which the conduct of an individual tends to swerve from the end which internal laws ought to propose to themselves i have given by way of anticipation the name of offences—by a similar anticipation we may apply the same appellation to actions by which the conduct of a whole nation swerves from the object which international laws ought to propose to themselves among sovereigns as well as among individuals there are some offences de bonne foi there are others de mauvaise foi one must be blind to deny the latter—one must be much more sadly blind to deny the others people sometimes think to prove their discernment by referring everything to the latter head or to prove it equally by referring everything to the former it is in this manner they proceed in judging of men and especially of sovereigns they grant to them an intelligence without limits rather than recognise in them a grain of probity they are believed never to have blushed at folly provided that it has had malignity for its companion so much has been said of the injustice of sovereigns that i could wish a little consideration were given to the still more common injustice of their detractors who whilst they preserve their concealment revenge themselves upon the species in general for the adulation which in public they lavish upon individuals the following are among the causes of offences de bonne foi and of wars—   uncertainty of the right of succession with regard to vacant thrones claimed by two parties   intestine troubles in neighbouring states these troubles may also have for their cause an uncertainty of the same kind as the preceding or a dispute concerning constitutional law in the neighbouring state either between the sovereign and his subjects or between different members of the sovereign body   uncertainty with respect to limits whether actual or ideal the object of these limits may be to keep separate either goods or persons or causes   uncertainty as to the limits of new discoveries made by one party or another   0   jealousies caused by forced cessions more or less recent   disputes or wars from whatsoever cause they may arise among circumjacent states   religious hatred means of prevention   homologation of unwritten laws which are considered as established by custom   new conventions—new international laws to be made upon all points which remain unascertained that is to say upon the greater number of points in which the interests of two states are capable of collision   perfecting the style of the laws of all kinds whether internal or international how many wars have there been which have had for their principal or even their only cause no more noble origin than the negligence or inability of a lawyer or a geometrician essay ii of subjects or of the personal extent of the dominion of the laws coextensive to dominion is jurisdiction dominion the right of the sovereign jurisdiction of the judge not that it is necessary that there should be any one judge or set of judges whose jurisdiction should be coextensive with the dominion of the sovereign—only that for every particle of dominion there should be a correspondent particle of jurisdiction in the hands of some judge or other correspondent to one field of dominion there may be many fields of jurisdiction what is dominion it is either the power of contrectation or else that of imperation for there are no others but the power of contrectation is a sort of power which in a settled government it scarcely ever becomes either necessary or agreeable to the sovereign as such to exercise so that under the head of the power of imperation is comprised all the power which the sovereign is accustomed to exercise and the same observation may be applied to the power of the judge of the power of imperation or the power of issuing mandates the amplitude will be as the amplitude of the mandates which may be issued in virtue of it the amplitude and quality of the mandates will be as the amplitude and quality of the persons who are their agible subjects—the persons who are their passible subjects—the things if any which are their passible subjects and the acts which are their objects in place and time the persons who are their agible subjects are the persons whose acts are in question—the persons whose acts are the objects of the mandate a sovereign is styled such in the first instance in respect of the persons whom he has the right or power to command now the right or legal power to command may be coextensive with the physical power of giving force and effect to the command that is by the physical power of hurting—the power of hyperphysical contrectation employed for the purpose of hurting but by possibility every sovereign may have the power of hurting any or every person whatsoever and that not at different times only but even at one and the same time according to this criterion then the sphere of possible jurisdiction is to every person the same but the problem is to determine what persons ought to be considered as being under the dominion of one sovereign and what others under the dominion of another—in other words what persons ought to be considered as the subjects of one sovereign and what as the subjects of another the object of the present essay is to determine upon the principle of utility what persons ought in the several cases that may present themselves to be considered as the subjects of the law of the political state in question as subject to the contrectative or imperative power of that law proceeding as usual upon the exhaustive plan i shall examine—   over what persons the law can in point of possibility exercise dominion what persons in point of possibility may be the subject of it what persons in point of possibility it may treat as upon the footing of its subjects with effect over what persons the law has possible dominion and jurisdiction over what persons the law may have dominion and jurisdiction in point of force   over other persons than these it is plain that it can never be right to say the law ought upon the principle of utility to exercise     jurisdiction why because it is idle to say of the lawgiver as of anybody else that he ought to do that which by the supposition is impossible the next inquiry is then—the persons over whom the law may in point of possibility exercise dominion being given over what sort of persons in that number ought the law in point of utility to exercise dominion what persons of that number ought to be looked upon as subject to it over what persons of that number it has jurisdiction in point of right taking general utility as the measure of right as usual where positive law is out of the question   it will then be another and that a distinct question over what sort of persons and in what cases the law in any given state does actually exercise dominion and over what sort of persons and in what cases the law has dominion in point of exercise dominion then may be distinguished into—  dominion potential or in point of force   dominion actual or dominion in point of exercise   jurisdiction rightful or rather approveable or jurisdiction in point of moral right the nature of the present design is to determine in what cases if actual dominion were established it would be rightful in other words in what cases it is the moral right and at the same time the moral duty—in what cases the moral right without being the moral duty—of the given sovereign as towards other sovereigns to cause jurisdiction to be exercised over persons who are subject to his physical power how far and in what points sovereigns in the jurisdiction which they cause to be exercised over such persons as are within their reach ought to yield or be aiding to each other an individual can be subject to a sovereign no farther than the physical power which that sovereign has of hurting him or his afflictive power as it may be called extends the question is the cases in which the sovereign has the power of hurting him being given in which of them ought he upon the principle of utility to exercise that power—in which of them ought other sovereigns who may think their power concerned to acquiesce in his exercising such power in every state there are certain persons who are in all events throughout their lives and in all places subject to the sovereign of that state—it is out of the obedience of these that the essence of sovereignty is constituted these may be styled the standing or ordinary subjects of the sovereign or the state and the dominion over them may be styled fixed or regular there are others who are subject to him only in certain events for a certain time while they are at a certain place the obedience of these constitutes only an accidental appendage to his sovereignty these may be termed his occasional or extraordinary subjects or subjects pro re natis and the dominion he has over them may be styled occasional his afflictive power being the limit of his actual as well as of his rightful dominion his standing subjects will be those over whom he has the most afflictive power—over whom his afflictive power is the strongest over his occasional subjects his afflictive power will not be so strong now the points in which a man can be hurt are all of them comprised as we have seen under these four viz his person his reputation his property and his condition of these four points that in respect of which he can be made to suffer most is his person since that includes not only his liberty but his life the highest jurisdiction therefore is that of which the subject is a mans person according to this criterion then the standing subjects of a sovereign should be those individuals whose persons are in his power this criterion would be a perfectly clear and eligible one were the case such that in the ordinary tenor of human affairs the persons of the same individuals were constantly under the physical power or as we say within the reach of the same sovereign but this is not the case the different interests and concerns of the subject the interest even of the sovereign himself requires the subject to transport himself necessarily to various places where according to the above criterion he would respectively become the subject of so many sovereigns but the question is to what sovereign a given individual is subject in a sense in which he is not subject to any other this question it is plain can never be determined by a criterion which determines him to be the subject of one sovereign in the same sense in which he may be subject to any number of other sovereigns according to this criterion a sovereign might have millions of subjects one day and none at all the next some circumstance therefore more constant and less precarious must be found to ground a claim of standing dominion upon than that of the present facility of exercising an afflictive power over the person of the supposed subject a facility which in truth is no more than might be possessed not only by an established sovereign but by any the most insignificant oppressor any man may at times have the power of hurting any other man the circumstance of territorial dominion—dominion over land—possesses the properties desired it can seldom happen that two sovereigns can each of them with equal     facility the other being unwilling traverse the same tract of land that sovereign then who has the physical power of occupying and traversing a given tract of land insomuch that he can effectually and safely traverse it in any direction at pleasure—at the same time that against his will another sovereign cannot traverse the same land with equal facility and effect—can be more certain of coming at the individual in question than such other sovereign can be and therefore may be pronounced to have the afflictive power over all such persons as are to be found upon that land—and that a higher afflictive power than any other sovereign can have and hence the maxim dominion over person depends upon dominion over land but even this indicium this mark is not a ground of sufficient permanence whereon to found the definition of standing sovereignty for the same individual who is one day on land which is under the dominion of a given sovereign may another day be on land which is not under his dominion from this circumstance therefore no permanent relation can be derived but that the relation should be a permanent one is requisite on various grounds upon the principle of utility—that each subject may know what sovereign to resort to principally for protection—that each sovereign may know what subjects to depend upon for obedience—and that each sovereign may know when to insist and when to yield in any contest which he might have with any other sovereign who might lay a claim to the obedience of the same subjects the circumstance then which is taken for the indicium of sovereignty on the one part and subjection on the other should be not a situation which at any time may change but an event this event should be one which must have happened once—which cannot have happened more than once—and which having happened once cannot be in the condition of one which has not happened in short an event which is past necessary and unicurrent such an event is that found in the event of a mans birth—which must have happened for the man to exist—which cannot happen a second time and which being over cannot but have happened—which must have happened in some district of the earth so that at that period the man must have been within the physical power of the sovereign within whose territory he was born yet still it is not birth that is the immediate ground of jurisdiction the immediate ground is presence—presence with reference to the locus of the territorial dominion if birth be the ground of dominion it is only in virtue of the presumption which it affords of the other circumstance in every state almost there are some who emigrate from the dominion within which they were born but in every state almost it is otherwise with by far the greater number in civilized nations the greater part of mankind are glebæ ascriptitii fixtures to the soil on which they are born with nations of hunters and shepherds—with tribes of american savages and hordes of tartars or arabians it is otherwise but with these we have no business here thus it is that dominion over the soil confers dominion de facto over the greater part of the natives its inhabitants in such manner that such inhabitants are treated as owing a permanent allegiance to the sovereign of that soil and in general there seems no reason why it should not be deemed to do so even de jure judging upon the principle of utility on the one hand the sovereign on his part naturally expects to possess the obedience of persons who stand in this sort of relation to him possessing it at first he naturally expects to possess it—he is accustomed to reckon upon it were he to cease to possess it it might be a disappointment to him any other sovereign having even begun to possess the allegiance of the same subject has not the same cause for expecting to possess it not entertaining any such expectation the not possessing it is no disappointment for subjects in as far as their obedience is a matter of private benefit to the sovereign may without any real impropriety absit verbo invidia be considered as subjects of his property they may be considered as his property just as any individual who owes another a service of any kind may pro tanto be considered as his property we speak of the service as being his property such is the turn of the language that is as being the object of his property but a service being but a fictitious entity can be but a fictitious object of property—the real and only real object is the person from whom the service is due on the other hand let us consider the state of mind and expectations of the subject the subject having been accustomed from his birth to look upon the sovereign as his sovereign continues all along to look upon him in the same light to be obedient to him is as natural as to be obedient to his own father he lives and has all along been accustomed to live under his laws he has some intimation i wish the universal negligence of sovereigns in the matter of promulgation would permit me to say anything more than a very inaccurate and general intimation some intimation he has however of the nature of them when occasion happens he is accustomed to obey them he finds it no hardship to obey them none at least in comparison with what it would be were they altogether new to him whereas those of another sovereign were they in themselves more easy might merely on account of their novelty appear and therefore be harder upon the whole     thus much as to the more usual case where a man continues to inhabit as his parents did before him the country in which he was born but what if his parents being inhabitants of another country were sojourners only or mere travellers in the country in which he was born and he immediately after his birth carried out of it never to see it again the manners and customs the religion the way of thinking the laws of the one country opposite to those of the other the sovereign of the one at war with the sovereign of the other if regard be paid to birth something surely is due to lineage an englishwoman travelling with her husband from italy through france is delivered of a son in france—shall the son when he grows up be punished as a traitor if taken in battle when fighting against the king of france or on the other hand supposing it to be right and politic for the king of france to refuse to strangers born out of his dominion any of the rights enjoyed by his native subjects would it be right that this man who has never looked upon the french as his countrymen nor the king of france as his sovereign should partake of privileges which are denied to the subjects of the most favoured foreign nation shall the offspring of english protestants born at cadiz be reclaimed as a fugitive from the inquisition or the offspring of spanish catholics born in london undergo the severity of the english laws for being reconciled to the church of rome shall the mahometan born at gibraltar be punished for polygamy or wine drinking nor would it it should seem be an adequate remedy to these inconveniences to take the birthplace of the parents or in case of their birthplaces being different that of the father for example as the indicium to determine the allegiance of the child the circumstances of their birth might have been accompanied by a similar irregularity during a mans education his parents may have lived half their time in one country half in another what external mark can there be to determine to which of the two countries if to either his affections are attached the best way therefore seems to be to refer the solution of the question to those alone who are in a condition to give it and to refer the option of his country in the first instance to the parents or guardian provisionally while the child is incapable of judging for himself afterwards to himself as soon as he is judged capable so that when he comes to a certain age he shall take his choice a man may therefore be a member of a community either permanently or occasionally a man may be permanently a member of a community—  by lineage as the paternal grandson of an englishman is an englishman wherever born   by birth   by naturalization a man may be occasionally the member of a community—  by fixed residence   by travelling jurisdiction may be distinguished into—  potential   rightful   actual the first principle with regard to its exercise is regard for the interest of ones own state this must however be controuled in point of volition and act by the consideration of what will be endured by other states the next consideration is in what cases jurisdiction may be assumed for the sake of foreign states over the natives of a foreign state jurisdiction may be exercised—  for its own sake   for the sake of the natives state   for the sake of some other state   for the sake of mankind at large for the same reasons it may be exercised over its own subjects for offences committed in foreign states for its own sake it ought to punish all injurious offences committed for lucre although committed abroad by foreigners the following considerations may restrain the state proposed from punishing offences committed out of its dominions—   the difficulty of getting evidence since foreigners cannot be compelled to appear supposing the difficulty of procuring evidence to be got over there is another difficulty—the insuring the veracity of the evidence if perjury should be detected and even proofs obtained after the foreigner is gone back to his own country he could not be punished this difficulty might be overcome by a commission to examine foreign witnesses abroad touching any particular fact application being made to the sovereign abroad for his sanction to corroborate the powers of the commissioners or the commission might be given to his own subjects to execute—it being left to the judgment of the judges in each case whether the evidence alleged be the whole or if not the whole whether sufficient evidence such a concurrence and communication is no more visionary and impracticable in all cases than in admiralty causes concerning captures   the fear of giving umbrage to foreign powers the former consideration applies equally to offences committed by citizens as by foreigners the latter scarcely at all to offences committed by citizens or at least not so strongly as to offences committed by foreigners—citizens of the state by which it is feared umbrage may be taken     the following considerations may impel the state proposed to punish offences committed out of its dominion—   regard for the interest of the citizens   regard for the interests of foreigners—viz the foreign state or individual injured by the offence essay iii of war considered in respect of its causes and consequences war is mischief upon the largest scale it might seem at first sight that to inquire into the causes of war would be the same thing as to inquire into the causes of criminality and that in the one case as in the other the source of it is to be looked for in the nature of man—in the selfregarding the dissocial and now and then in some measure in the social affections a nearer view however will show in several points considerable difference—these differences turn on the magnitude of the scale the same motives will certainly be found operating in the one case as in the other but in tracing the process from the original cause to the ultimate effect a variety of intermediate considerations will present themselves in the instance of war which have no place in the quarrels of individuals incentives to war will be found in the waradmiring turn of histories particularly ancient histories in the prejudices of men the notion of natural rivalry and repugnancy of interests confusion between meum and tuum—between private ownership and public sovereignty and the notion of punishment which in case of war can never be other than vicarious in ancient times there was one system of inducements under the feudal system another and in modern times another the following may be enumerated among the inducements to war—apprehension of injustice—hope of plunder of moveables by individuals—hope of gain by raising contributions—hope of gain by sale or ransom of captives—national pride or glory—monarchical pride—national antipathy—increase of patronage—hope of preferment states have no persons distinct from the persons of individuals but they have property which is the property of the state and not of individuals when an individual has a dispute about property with an individual or has sustained what he looks upon as an injury in respect of his property from an individual he applies for redress to their common superior the judicial power of the state when a state has sustained what it looks upon as an injury in respect of property from another state—there being no common superior ready chosen for them—it must either submit to the injury or get the other state to join in the appointment of a common judge or go to war every state regards itself as bound to afford to its own subjects protection so far as it is in its power against all injuries they may sustain either from the subjects or the government of any other state the utility of the disposition to afford such protection is evident and the existence of such disposition no less so accordingly if any individual subject of the state a receive from a subject of the state b an injury for which the state b forbears after due proof and demand to afford or procure adequate satisfaction it is to the purpose of responsibility the same thing as if the state b itself in the persons of the members of its government had done the injury the following may be set down as the principal causes or occasions of war with some of the means of prevention— i offences real or pretended of the citizens of one state towards the citizens of another state caused by the interests of the citizens—   injuries in general means of prevention—liquidation of the pretensions of the subjects of every sovereign with regard to the subjects of every other sovereign   occasional injuries from rivalry in commerce interception of the rights of property means of prevention—general liberty of commerce ii offences real or pretended of the citizens of one state towards the citizens of another state caused by the interests or pretensions of sovereigns—   diputes respecting the right of succession means of prevention—liquidation of titles perfecting the style of the laws   disputes respecting boundaries whether physical or ideal means of prevention—liquidation of titles amicable demarcations positively made perfecting of the style of the laws regulation   disputes arising from violations of territory   enterprizes of conquest means of prevention—confederations of defence alliances defensive general guarantees   attempts at monopoly in commerce insolence of the strong towards the weak tyranny of one nation towards another means of prevention—confederations defensive conventions limiting the number of troops to be maintained no one could regard treaties implying positive obligations in this kind as chimerical yet if these are not so those implying negative obligation are still less so there may arise difficulty in maintaining an army there can arise none in not doing so     it must be allowed that the matter would be a delicate one there might be some difficulty in persuading one lion to cut his claws but if the lion or rather the enormous condor which holds him fast by the head should agree to cut his talons also there would be no disgrace in the stipulation the advantage or inconvenience would be reciprocal let the cost of the attempt be what it would it would be amply repaid by success what tranquillity for all sovereigns—what relief for every people what a spring would not the commerce the population the wealth of all nations take which are at present confined when set free from the fetters in which they are now held by the care of their defence   fear of conquests means of prevention—defensive confederations   disputes respecting new discoveries—respecting the limits of acquisitions made by one state at the expense of another on the ground of peaceful occupation means of prevention—previous agreement on the subject of possible discoveries   part taken in intestine troubles the refusal of a foreign power to recognise the right of a newlyformed government has been a frequent cause of war but no interest being at stake on either side nothing so much as proposed to be gained it is evident that on both sides whatever mischief is produced is so much misery created in waste   injuries caused on account of religion the difference between religion and no religion however grating is not nearly so irritating as that between one religion and another means of prevention—progress of toleration  0 interest of ministers means of prevention—salaries determinate but effective wars may be— i bonâ fide wars a remedy against these would be found in the tribunal of peace ii wars of passion the remedy against these—reasoning showing the repugnancy betwixt passion on the one hand and justice as well as interest on the other iii wars of ambition or insolence or rapine the remedies against these are—  reasoning showing the repugnancy betwixt ambition and true interest   remedies of regulation in the event of a temporary ascendency on the part of reason in all these cases the utility with regard to the state which looks upon itself as aggrieved—the reasonableness in a word of going to war with the aggressor—depends partly upon his relative force partly upon what appears to have been the state of his mind with relation to the injury if it be evident that there was no mala fides on his part it can never be for the advantage of the aggrieved state to have recourse to war whether it be stronger or weaker than the aggressor and that in whatever degree—in that case be the injury what it will it may be pronounced impossible that the value of it should ever amount to the expense of war be it ever so short and carried on upon ever so frugal a scale in case of mala fides whether even then it would be worth while to have recourse to war will depend upon circumstances if it appear that the injury in question is but a prelude to others and that it proceeds from a disposition which nothing less than entire destruction can satisfy and war presents any tolerable chance of success how small soever prudence and reason may join with passion in prescribing war as the only remedy in so desperate a disease for though in case of perseverance on the part of the assailant successful resistance may appear impossible yet resistance such as can be opposed may by gaining time give room for some unexpected incident to arise and may at any rate by the inconvenience it occasions to the assailant contribute in time or loss to weaken the mass of inducements which prompt him to similar enterprises though the spartans at thermopylæ perished to a man yet the defence of thermopylæ was not without its use if on the other hand the aggression though too flagrant not to be accompanied with mala fides appear to have for its origin some passion or caprice which has for its incentive some limited object and promises to be contented with that object—the option is now not between ruin avenged and unavenged but between the loss of the object whatever it be and the miseries of a more or less hopeless war the dutch displayed prudence while they yielded to the suggestions of indignation in defending themselves against the force of spain the same people displayed their prudence in yielding to britain the frivolous honours of the flag at the end of the war of      they would have displayed still more if they had made the same concession at the beginning of it lastly if the aggression how unjust soever it may appear when viewed in the point of view in which it is contemplated by the state which is the object of it does not appear accompanied with mala fides on the part of the aggressor nothing can be more incontestable than the prudence of submitting to it rather than encountering the calamities of war the sacrifice is seen at once in its utmost extent and it must be singular indeed if the amount of it can approach to that of the expense of a single campaign when war has broken out a palliative for its evils might perhaps be found in the appointment of warresidents to provide for prisoners and to prevent violations of the laws of war will it be said that in quality of a spy such     residents would be to be feared an enemy known to be such could scarcely be a spy all the proceedings of such residents should be open and all his letters subjected to inspection at present foreigners are scarcely excluded from an enemys country—scarcely even military men or ministers and so soon as it is wished to employ a spy could not a native be found a resident of this character could always be employed as a channel of communication if an accommodation were desired essay iv a plan for an universal and perpetual peace the object of the present essay is to submit to the world a plan for an universal and perpetual peace the globe is the field of dominion to which the author aspires—the press the engine and the only one he employs—the cabinet of mankind the theatre of his intrigue the happiest of mankind are sufferers by war and the wisest nay even the least wise are wise enough to ascribe the chief of their sufferings to that cause the following plan has for its basis two fundamental propositions—  the reduction and fixation of the force of the several nations that compose the european system   the emancipation of the distant dependencies of each state each of these propositions has its distinct advantages but neither of them it will appear would completely answer the purpose without the other as to the utility of such an universal and lasting peace supposing a plan for that purpose practicable and likely to be adopted there can be but one voice the objection and the only objection to it is the apparent impracticability of it—that it is not only hopeless but that to such a degree that any proposal to that effect deserves the name of visionary and ridiculous this objection i shall endeavour in the first place to remove for the removal of this prejudice may be necessary to procure for the plan a hearing what can be better suited to the preparing of mens minds for the reception of such a proposal than the proposal itself let it not be objected that the age is not ripe for such a proposal the more it wants of being ripe the sooner we should begin to do what can be done to ripen it the more we should do to ripen it a proposal of this sort is one of those things that can never come too early nor too late who that bears the name of christian can refuse the assistance of his prayers what pulpit can forbear to second me with its eloquence—catholic and protestants churchofenglandmen and dissenters may all agree in this if in nothing else i call upon them all to aid me with their countenance and their support the ensuing sheets are dedicated to the common welfare of all civilized nations but more particularly of great britain and france the end in view is to recommend three grand objects—simplicity of government national frugality and peace reflection has satisfied me of the truth of the following propositions— i that it is not the interest of great britain to have any foreign dependencies whatsoever ii that it is not the interest of great britain to have any treaty of alliance offensive or defensive with any other power whatever iii that it is not the interest of great britain to have any treaty with any power whatsoever for the purpose of possessing any advantage whatsoever in point of trade to the exclusion of any other nation whatsoever iv that it is not the interest of great britain to keep up any naval force beyond what may be sufficient to defend its commerce against pirates v that it is not the interest of great britain to keep on foot any regulations whatsoever of distant preparation for the augmentation or maintenance of its naval force such as the navigation act bounties on the greenland trade and other trades regarded as nurseries for seamen vi vii viii ix  x that all these several propositions are also true of france as far as great britain is concerned i rest the proof of these several propositions principally upon two very simple principles i that the increase of growing wealth in every nation in a given period is necessarily limited by the quantity of capital it possesses at that period ii that great britain with or without ireland and without any other dependency can have no reasonable ground to apprehend injury from any one nation upon earth turning to france i substitute to the last of the two justmentioned propositions the following— iii that france standing singly has at present nothing to fear from any other nation than great britain nor if standing clear of her foreign dependencies would she have any thing to fear from great britain     xi that supposing great britain and france thoroughly agreed the principal difficulties would be removed to the establishment of a plan of general and permanent pacification for all europe xii that for the maintenance of such a pacification general and perpetual treaties might be formed limiting the number of troops to be maintained xiii that the maintenance of such a pacification might be considerably facilitated by the establishment of a common court of judicature for the decision of differences between the several nations although such court were not to be armed with any coercive powers xiv that secresy in the operations of the foreign department ought not to be endured in england being altogether useless and equally repugnant to the interests of liberty and to those of peace proposition i—that it is not the interest of great britain to have any foreign dependencies whatsoever the truth of this proposition will appear if we consider  st that distant dependencies increase the chances of war—   by increasing the number of possible subjects of dispute   by the natural obscurity of title in case of new settlements or discoveries   by the particular obscurity of the evidence resulting from the distance   by mens caring less about wars when the scene is remote than when it is nearer home  d that colonies are seldom if ever sources of profit to the mother country profitable industry has five branches—  production of new materials including agricultures mining and fisheries   manufactures   home trade   foreign trade   carrying trade the quantity of profitable industry that can be carried on in a country being limited by that of the capital which the country can command it follows that no part of that quantity can be bestowed upon any one branch but it must be withdrawn from or withholden from all the others no encouragement therefore can be given to any one but it must be a proportionable discouragement to all the others nothing can be done by government to induce a man to begin or continue to employ his capital in any one of those branches but it must induce him in the same degree to withdraw or withhold that capital from all the rest of these five branches no one is to such a degree more beneficial to the public than the rest as that it should be worth its while to call forth the powers of law to give it an advantage but if there were any it would unquestionably be the improvement and cultivation of land every fictitious encouragement to any one of these rival branches being a proportionable discouragement to agriculture every encouragement to any of those branches of manufacture which produce articles that are at present sold to the colonies is a proportionable discouragement to agriculture when colonies are to be made out to be beneficial to the mother country and the quantum of the benefit is to be estimated the mode in which the estimate is made is curious enough an account is taken of what they export which is almost the whole of their produce all this it is said while you have the colonies is yours this is exactly what you lose if you lose your colonies how much of all this is really yours not one single halfpenny when they let you take it from them do they give it you for nothing not they indeed they make you pay for it just as anybody else would do how much just so much as you would pay them if they belonged to themselves or to anybody else for maintaining colonies there are several avowed reasons besides others which are not avowed of the avowed reasons by far the principal one is the benefit of trade if your colonies were not subject to you they would not trade with you they would not buy any of your goods or let you buy any of theirs at least you could not be sure of their doing so if they were subject to anybody else they would not do so for the colonies of other nations are you see not suffered to trade with you give up your colonies you give up so much of your trade as is carried on with your colonies no we do not give up any such thing—we do not give up anything whatsoever trade with colonies cannot any more than with anywhere else be carried on without capital just so much of our capital as is employed in our trade with the colonies—just so much of it is not employed elsewhere—just so much is either kept or taken from other trades suppose then any branch of trade or manufacture to decline—even suppose it lost altogether—is this any permanent loss to the nation not the smallest we know the worst that can happen from any such loss the capital that would otherwise have been employed in the lost branch will be employed in agriculture the loss of the colonies if the loss of the colony trade were the consequence of the loss of the colonies would at the worst be so much gain to agriculture other reasons against distant dominion may be found in a consideration of the good of the government distant mischiefs make little impression on those on whom the remedying of them depends a single murder committed in london makes more impression than if thousands of murders and other cruelties were committed in the east indies the situation of hastings only because he was present     excited compassion in those who heard the detail of the cruelties committed by him with indifference the communication of grievances cannot be too quick from those who feel them to those who have the power to relieve them the reason which in the old writs the king is made to assign for his interfering to afford relief is the real cause which originally gave birth to that interference—it is one of those few truths which have contrived to make their way through the thick cloud of lies and nonsense they contain see what it is that these people want says the sovereign to the ministers of justice that i may not any more be troubled with their noise the motive assigned to the unjust judge in the gospel is the motive which the sovereign who is styled the fountain of justice is thus made to avow the following then are the final measures which ought to be pursued—   give up all the colonies   found no new colonies the following is a summary of the reasons for giving up all the colonies— i interest of the mothercountry   saving the expense of the establishments civil and military   saving the danger of war—  for enforcing their obedience   on account of the jealousy produced by the apparent power they confer   saving the expense of defending them in case of war on other grounds   getting rid of the means of corruption afforded by the patronage—  of their civil establishments   of the military force employed in their defence   simplifying the whole frame of government and thereby rendering a competent skill in the business of government more attainable—  to the members of administration   to the people the stock of national intelligence is deteriorated by the false notions which must be kept up in order to prevent the nation from opening its eyes and insisting upon the enfranchisement of the colonies at the same time bad government results to the mothercountry from the complication of interests the indistinct views and the consumption of time occasioned by the load of distant dependencies ii interest of the colonies diminishing the chance of bad government resulting from—  opposite interest   ignorance the real interests of the colony must be sacrificed to the imaginary interests of the mothercountry it is for the purpose of governing it badly and for no other that you can wish to get or to keep a colony govern it well it is of no use to you govern it as well as the inhabitants would govern it themselves—you must choose those to govern it whom they themselves would choose you must sacrifice none of its interests to your own—you must bestow as much time and attention to their interests as they would themselves in a word you must take those very measures and none others which they themselves would take but would this be governing and what would it be worth to you if it were after all it would be impossible for you to govern them so well as they would govern themselves on account of the distance† the following are approximating measures—   maintain no military force in any of the colonies   issue no moneys for the maintenance of any civil establishment in any of the colonies   nominate to the offices in the colonies as long as they permit you—yield as soon as they contest such nomination   give general instructions to governors to consent to all acts presented to them   issue no moneys for fortifications     proposition ii—that it is not the interest of great britain to have any treaty of alliance offensive or defensive with any other power whatever reason saving the danger of war arising out of them and more especially ought not great britain to guarantee foreign constitutions reason saving the danger of war resulting from the odium of so tyrannical a measure proposition iii—that it is not the interest of great britain to have any treaty with any power whatsoever for the purpose of possessing any advantages whatsoever in point of trade to the exclusion of any other nation whatsoever that the trade of every nation is limited by the quantity of capital is so plainly and obviously true as to challenge a place among selfevident propositions but selfevident propositions must not expect to be easily admitted if admitted at all if the consequences of them clash with prevalent passions and confirmed prejudices nations are composed of individuals the trade of a nation must be limited by the same causes that limit the trade of the individual each individual merchant when he has as much trade as his whole capital and all the credit he can get by means of his capital can suffice for carrying on can have no more this being true of each merchant is not less true of the whole number of merchants put together many books directly recognise the proposition that the quantity of trade a nation can carry on is limited—limited by the quantity of its capital none dispute the proposition but almost all somewhere or other proceed upon the opposite supposition they suppose the quantity of trade to have no limitation whatsoever it is a folly to buy manufactured goods wise to buy raw materials why because you sell them to yourselves or what is still better to foreigners manufactured and the manufacturers profit is all clear gain to you what is here forgotten is that the manufacturer to carry on his business must have a capital and that just so much capital as is employed in that way is prevented from being employed in any other hence the perfect inutility and mischievousness of all laws and public measures of government whatsoever for the pretended encouragement of trade—all bounties in every shape whatsoever—all nonimportation agreements and engagements to consume home manufactures in preference to foreign—in any other view than to afford temporary relief to temporary distress but of the two—prohibitions and bounties—penal encouragements and remuneratory—the latter are beyond comparison the most mischievous prohibitions except while they are fresh and drive men at a great expense out of the employments they are embarked in are only nugatory bounties are wasteful and oppressive they force money from one man in order to pay another man for carrying on a trade which if it were not a losing one there would be no need of paying him for what then are all modes of productive industry alike may not one be more profitable than another certainly but the favourite one is it in fact more profitable than any other that is the question and the only question that ought to be put and that is the very question which nobody ever thinks of putting were it ever put and answered and answered ever so clearly it never could be of any use as a ground for any permanent plan of policy why because almost as soon as one branch is known to be more profitable than the rest so soon it ceases so to be—men flock to it from all other branches and the old equilibrium is presently restored your merchants have a monopoly as against foreigners true but they have no monopoly as against one another men cannot in every instance quit the less productive branch their capitals are already employed in to throw them into this more productive one true—but there are young beginners as well as old stagers and the first concern of a young beginner who has a capital to employ in a branch of industry is to look out for the most profitable objection—oh but it is manufacture that creates the demand for the productions of agriculture you cannot therefore increase the productions of agriculture but by increasing manufactures no such thing i admit the antecedent—i deny the consequence increase of manufactures certainly does create an increase in the demand for the productions of agriculture equally certain is it that the increase of manufactures is not necessary to produce an increase in that demand farmers can subsist without ribbons gauzes or fine cambrics weavers of ribbons gauzes or fine cambrics cannot subsist without the productions of agriculture necessary subsistence never can lose its value those who produce it are themselves a market for their produce is it possible that provisions should be too cheap is there any present danger of it suppose in spite of the extreme absurdity of the supposition that provisions were growing gradually too cheap from the increase of the quantity produced and the want of manufacturers to consume them what would be the consequence the increasing cheapness would increase the facility and disposition to marry it would thence increase the population of the country and the children thus produced eating as they grew up would keep down this terrible evil of a superabundance of provisions   0 provisions the produce of agriculture constantly and necessarily produce a market for themselves the more provisions a man raises over and above what is necessary for his own consumption the more he has to give to others to induce them to provide him with whatever besides provisions he chooses to have in a word the more he has to spare the more he has to give to manufacturers who by taking it from him and paying him with the produce of their labours afford the encouragement requisite for the productions of the fruits of agriculture it is impossible therefore that you can ever have too much agriculture it is impossible that while there is ground untilled or ground that might be better tilled than it is that any detriment should ensue to the community from the withholding or withdrawing capital from any other branch of industry and employing it in agriculture it is impossible therefore that the loss of any branch of trade can be productive of any detriment to the community excepting always the temporary distress experienced by the individuals concerned in it for the time being when the decline is a sudden one the following are the measures the propriety of which results from the above principles—   that no treaties granting commercial preferences should be made   that no wars should be entered into for compelling such treaties   that no alliances should be contracted for the sake of purchasing them   that no encouragements should be given to particular branches of trade by—   prohibition of rival manufactures   taxation of rival manufactures   bounties on the trade meant to be favoured   that no treaties should be entered into insuring commercial preferences they are useless as they add nothing to the mass of wealth they only influence the direction of it proposition iv—that it is not the interest of great britain to keep up any naval force beyond what may be sufficient to defend its commerce against pirates it is unnecessary except for the defence of the colonies or for the purposes of war undertaken either for the compelling of trade or the formation of commercial treaties proposition v—that it is not the interest of great britain to keep on foot any regulations whatsoever of distant preparation for the augmentation or maintenance of its naval force—such as the navigation act bounties on the greenland trade and other trades regarded as nurseries for scamen this proposition is a necessary consequence of the foregoing one propositions vi vii viii ix  x propositions similar to the foregoing are equally true applied to france proposition xi—that supposing great britain and france thoroughly agreed the principal difficulties would be removed to the establishment of a plan of general and permanent pacification for all europe proposition xii—that for the maintenance of such a pacification general and perpetual treaties might be formed limiting the number of troops to be maintained† if the simple relation of a single nation with a single other nation be considered perhaps the matter would not be very difficult the misfortune is that almost everywhere compound relations are found on the subject of troops—france says to england yes i would voluntarily make with you a treaty of disarming if there were only you but it is necessary for me to have troops to defend me from the austrians austria might say the same to france but it is necessary to guard against prussia russia and the porte and the like allegation might be made by prussia with regard to russia whilst as to naval forces if it concerned europe only the difficulty might perhaps not be very considerable to consider france spain and holland as making together a counterpoise to the power of britain—perhaps on account of the disadvantages which accompany the concert between three separate nations to say nothing of the tardiness and publicity of procedures under the dutch constitution—perhaps england might allow to all together a united force equal to half or more than its own an agreement of this kind would not be dishonourable if the covenant were on one side only it might be so if it regard both parties together the reciprocity takes away the acerbity by the treaty which put an end to the first punic war the number of vessels that the carthaginians might maintain was limited this condition was it not humiliating it might be but if it were it must have been because there was nothing correspondent to it on the side of the romans a treaty which placed all the security on one side what cause could it have had for its source it could only have had one—that is the avowed superiority of the party thus incontestably secured—such a condition     could only have been a law dictated by the conqueror to the party conquered the law of the strongest none but a conqueror could have dictated it none but the conquered would have accepted it on the contrary whatsoever nation should get the start of the other in making the proposal to reduce and fix the amount of its armed force would crown itself with everlasting honour the risk would be nothing—the gain certain this gain would be the giving an incontrovertible demonstration of its own disposition to peace and of the opposite disposition in the other nation in case of its rejecting the proposal the utmost fairness should be employed the nation addressed should be invited to consider and point out whatever further securities it deemed necessary and whatever further concessions it deemed just the proposal should be made in the most public manner—it should be an address from nation to nation this at the same time that it conciliated the confidence of the nation addressed would make it impracticable for the government of that nation to neglect it or stave it off by shifts and evasions it would sound the heart of the nation addressed it would discover its intentions and proclaim them to the world the cause of humanity has still another resource should britain prove deaf and impracticable let france without conditions emancipate her colonies and break up her marine the advantage even upon this plan would be immense the danger none the colonies i have already shown are a source of expense not of revenue—of burthen to the people not of relief this appears to be the case even upon the footing of those expenses which appear upon the face of them to belong to the colonies and are the only ones that have hitherto been set down to their account but in fact the whole expense of the marine belongs also to that account and no other what other destination has it what other can it have none take away the colonies what use would there be for a single vessel more than the few necessary in the mediterranean to curb the pirates in case of a war where at present      would england make its first and only attack upon france in the colonies what would she propose to herself from success in such an attack what but the depriving france of her colonies were these colonies—these bones of contention—no longer hers what then could england do what could she wish to do there would remain the territory of france with what view could britain make any attack upon it in any way not with views of permanent conquest—such madness does not belong to our age parliament itself one may venture to affirm without paying it any very extraordinary compliment would not wish it it would not wish it even could it be accomplished without effort on our part without resistance on the other it would not even though france herself were to solicit it no parliament would grant a penny for such a purpose if it did it would not be a parliament a month no king would lend his name to such a project he would be dethroned as surely and as deservedly as james the second to say i will be king of france would be to say in other words i will be absolute in england well then no one would dream of conquest what other purpose could an invasion have the plunder and destruction of the country such baseness is totally repugnant not only to the spirit of the nation but to the spirit of the times malevolence could be the only motive—rapacity could never counsel it long before an army could arrive anywhere everything capable of being plundered would be carried off whatever is portable could be much sooner carried off by the owners than by any plundering army no expedition of plunder could ever pay itself such is the extreme folly the madness of war on no supposition can it be otherwise than mischievous especially between nations circumstanced as france and england though the choice of the events were absolutely at your command you could not make it of use to you if unsuccessful you may be disgraced and ruined if successful even to the height of your wishes you are still but so much the worse you would still be so much the worse though it were to cost you nothing for not even any colony of your own planting still less a conquest of your own making will so much as pay its own expenses the greatest acquisitions that could be conceived would not be to be wished for—could they even be attained with the greatest certainty and without the least expense in war we are as likely not to gain as to gain—as     likely to lose as to do either we can neither attempt the one nor defend ourselves against the other without a certain and most enormous expense mark well the contrast all trade is in its essence advantageous—even to that party to whom it is least so all war is in its essence ruinous and yet the great employments of government are to treasure up occasions of war and to put fetters upon trade ask an englishman what is the great obstacle to a secure and solid peace he has his answer ready—it is the ambition perhaps he will add the treachery of france i wish the chief obstacle to a plan for this purpose were the dispositions and sentiments of france—were that all the plan need not long wait for adoption of this visionary project the most visionary part is without question that for the emancipation of distant dependencies what will an englishman say when he sees two french ministers of the highest reputation both at the head of their respective departments both joining in the opinion that the accomplishment of this event nay the speedy accomplishment of it is inevitable and one of them scrupling not to pronounce it as eminently desirable it would only be the bringing things back on these points to the footing they were on before the discovery of america europe had then no colonies—no distant garrisons—no standing armies it would have had no wars but for the feudal system—religious antipathy—the rage of conquest—and the uncertainties of succession of these four causes the first is happily extinct everywhere—the second and third almost everywhere and at any rate in france and england—the last might if not already extinguished be so with great case the moral feelings of men in matters of national morality are still so far short of perfection that in the scale of estimation justice has not yet gained the ascendency over force yet this prejudice may in a certain point of view by accident be rather favourable to this proposal than otherwise truth and the object of this essay bid me to say to my countrymen it is for you to begin the reformation—it is you that have been the greatest sinners but the same considerations also lead me to say to them you are the strongest among nations though justice be not on your side force is and it is your force that has been the main cause of your injustice if the measure of moral approbation had been brought to perfection such positions would have been far from popular prudence would have dictated the keeping them out of sight and the softening them down as much as possible humiliation would have been the effect produced by them on those to whom they appeared true—indignation on those to whom they appeared false but as i have observed men have not yet learned to tune their feelings in unison with the voice of morality in these points they fell more pride in being accounted strong than resentment at being called unjust or rather the imputation of injustice appears flattering rather than otherwise when coupled with the consideration of its cause i feel it in my own experience but if i listed as i am as the professed and hitherto the only advocate in my own country in the cause of justice set a less value on justice than is its due what can i expect from the general run of men proposition xiii—that the maintenance of such a pacification might be considerably facilitated by the establishment of a common court of judicature for the decision of differences between the several nations although such court were not to be armed with any coercive powers it is an observation of somebodys that no nation ought to yield any evident point of justice to another this must mean evident in the eyes of the nation that is to judge—evident in the eyes of the nation called upon to yield what does this amount to that no nation is to give up anything of what it looks upon as its rights—no nation is to make any concessions wherever there is any difference of opinion between the negociators of two nations war is to be the consequence while there is no common tribunal something might be said for this concession to notorious injustice invites fresh injustice establish a common tribunal the necessity for war no longer follows from difference of opinion just or unjust the decision of the arbiters will save the credit the honour of the contending party can the arrangement proposed be justly styled visionary when it has been proved of it—that   it is the interest of the parties concerned   they are already sensible of that interest   the situation it would place them in is no new one nor any other than the original situation they set out from difficult and complicated conventions have been effectuated for examples we may mention—     the armed neutrality     the american confederation     the german diet     the swiss league why should not the european fraternity     subsist as well as the german diet or the swiss league these latter have no ambitious views be it so but is not this already become the case with the former how then shall we concentrate the approbation of the people and obviate their prejudices one main object of the plan is to effectuate a reduction and that a mighty one in the contributions of the people the amount of the reduction for each nation should be stipulated in the treaty and even previous to the signature of it laws for the purpose might be prepared in each nation and presented to every other ready to be enacted as soon as the treaty should be ratified in each state by these means the mass of the people the part most exposed to be led away by prejudices would not be sooner apprized of the measure than they would feel the relief it brought them they would see it was for their advantage it was calculated and that it could not be calculated for any other purpose the concurrence of all the maritime powers except england upon a former occasion proved two points the reasonableness of that measure itself and the weakness of france in comparison with england it was a measure not of ambition but of justice—a law made in favour of equality—a law made for the benefit of the weak no sinister point was gained or attempted to be gained by it france was satisfied with it why because she was weaker than britain she could have no other motive—on no other supposition could it have been of any advantage to her britain was vexed at it why for the opposite reason she could have no other oh my countrymen purge your eyes from the film of prejudice—extirpate from your hearts the black specks of excessive jealousy false ambition selfishness and insolence the operations may be painful but the rewards are glorious indeed as the main difficulty so will the main honour be with you what though wars should hereafter arise the intermediate savings will not the less be so much clear gain though in the generating of the disposition for war unjust ambition has doubtless had by far too great a share yet jealousy sincere and honest jealousy must be acknowledged to have had a not inconsiderable one vulgar prejudice fostered by passion assigns the heart as the seat of all the moral diseases it complains of but the principal and more frequent seat is really the head it is from ignorance and weakness that men deviate from the path of rectitude more frequently than from selfishness and malevolence this is fortunate—for the power of information and reason over error and ignorance is much greater and much surer than that of exhortation and all the modes of rhetoric over selfishness and malevolence it is because we do not know what strong motives other nations have to be just what strong indications they have given of the disposition to be so how often we ourselves have deviated from the rules of justice—that we take for granted as an indisputable truth that the principles of injustice are in a manner interwoven into the very essence of the hearts of other men the diffidence which forms part of the character of the english nation may have been one cause of this jealousy the dread of being duped by other nations—the notion that foreign heads are more able though at the same time foreign hearts are less honest than our own has always been one of our prevailing weaknesses this diffidence has perhaps some connexion with the mauvaise honte which has been remarked as commonly showing itself in our behavour and which makes public speaking and public exhibition in every line a task so much more formidable to us than to other people this diffidence may perhaps in part be accounted for from our living less in society and accustoming ourselves less to mixed companies than the people of other nations but the particular cast of diffidence in question the apprehension of being duped by foreign powers is to be referred in part and perhaps principally to another cause—the jealousy and slight opinion we entertain of our ministers and public men we are jealous of them as our superiors contending against us in the perpetual struggle for power we are diffident of them as being our fellowcountrymen and of the same mould as ourselves jealousy is the vice of narrow minds—confidence the virtue of enlarged ones to be satisfied that confidence between nations is not out of nature where they have worthy ministers one need but read the account of the negotiation between de wit and temple as given by hume i say by hume—for as it requires negotiators like de wit and temple to carry on such a negotiation in such a manner so it required a historian like hume to do it justice for the vulgar among historians know no other receipt for writing that part of history than the finding out whatever are the vilest and basest motives capable of accounting for mens conduct in the situation in question and then ascribing it to those motives without ceremony and without proof temple and de wit whose confidence in each other was so exemplary and so just—temple and de wit were two of the wisest as well as most honourable men in europe the age which produced such virtue was however the age of the pretended popish plot and of a thousand other enormities     which cannot now be thought of without horror since then the world has had upwards of a century to improve itself in experience in reflection in virtue in every other line its improvements have been immense and unquestioned is it too much to hope that france and england might produce not a temple and a de wit—virtue so transcendent as theirs would not be necessary—but men who in happier times might achieve a work like theirs with less extent of virtue such a congress or diet might be constituted by each power sending two deputies to the place of meeting one of these to be the principal the other to act as an occasional substitute the proceedings of such congress or diet should be all public its power would consist—  in reporting its opinion   in causing that opinion to be circulated in the dominions of each state manifestoes are in common usage a manifesto is designed to be read either by the subjects of the state complained of or by other states or by both it is an appeal to them it calls for their opinion the difference is that in that case nothing of proof is given no opinion regularly made known the example of sweden is alone sufficient to show the influence which treaties the acts of nations may be expected to have over the subjects of the several nations and how far the expedient in question deserves the character of a weak one or the proposal for employing and trusting to it that of a visionary proposal the war commenced by the king of sweden against russia was deemed by his subjects or at least a considerable part of them offensive and as such contrary to the constitution established by him with the concurrence of the states hence a considerable part of the army either threw up their commissions or refused to act and the consequence was the king was obliged to retreat from the russian frontier and call a diet this was under a government commonly though not truly supposed to be changed from a limited monarchy or rather aristocracy to a despotic monarchy there was no act of any recognised and respected tribunal to guide and fix the opinion of the people the only document they had to judge from was a manifesto of the enemy couched in terms such as resentment would naturally dictate and therefore none of the most conciliating—a document which had no claim to be circulated and of which the circulation we may be pretty well assured was prevented as much as it was in the power of the utmost vigilance of the government to prevent it   after a certain time in putting the refractory state under the ban of europe there might perhaps be no harm in regulating as a last resource the contingent to be furnished by the several states for enforcing the decrees of the court but the necessity for the employment of this resource would in all human probability be superseded for ever by having recourse to the much more simple and less burthensome expedient of introducing into the instrument by which such court was instituted a clause guaranteeing the liberty of the press in each state in such sort that the diet might find no obstacle to its giving in every state to its decrees and to every paper whatever which it might think proper to sanction with its signature the most extensive and unlimited circulation proposition xiv—that secresy in the operations of the foreign department in england ought not to be endured being altogether useless and equally repugnant to the interests of liberty and peace the existence of the rule which throws a veil of secresy over the transactions of the cabinet with foreign powers i shall not take upon me to dispute—my objection is to the propriety of it being asked in the house of lords by lord stormont about secret articles the minister for foreign affairs refuses to answer i blame him not subsisting rules it seems to be agreed forbid reply they throw a general veil of secresy over the transactions of the cabinet with foreign powers i blame no man for the fault of the laws it is these laws that i blame as repugnant to the spirit of the constitution and incompatible with good government i take at once the boldest and the broadest ground—i lay down two propositions—   that in no negociation and at no period of any negociation ought the negociations of the cabinet in this country to be kept secret from the public at large much less from parliament and after inquiry made in parliament†   that whatever may be the case with preliminary negociations such secresy ought never to be maintained with regard to treaties actually concluded in both cases to a country like this such secresy is equally mischievous and unnecessary it is mischievous over measures of which you have no knowledge you can apply no controul measures carried on without your knowledge you cannot stop—how rumous soever to you and how strongly soever you would disapprove of them if you knew them of negociations with foreign powers carried     on in time of peace the principal terminations are treaties of alliance offensive or defensive or treaties of commerce but by one accident or other everything may lead to war that in new treaties of commerce as such there can be no cause for secresy is a proposition that will hardly be disputed only such negociations like all others may eventually lead to war and everything connected with war it will be said may come to require secresy but rules which admit of a ministers plunging the nation into a war against its will are essentially mischievous and unconstitutional it is admitted that ministers ought not to have it in their power to impose taxes on the nation against its will it is admitted that they ought not to have it in their power to maintain troops against its will but by plunging it into war without its knowledge they do both parliament may refuse to carry on a war after it is begun—parliament may remove and punish the minister who has brought the nation into a war sorry remedies these add them both together their efficacy is not worth a straw arrestment of the evil and punishment of the authors are sad consolations for the mischief of a war and of no value as remedies in comparison with prevention aggressive war is a matter of choice defensive of necessity refusal of the means of continuing a war is a most precarious remedy a remedy only in name what when the enemy is at your doors refuse the materials for barricading them before aggression war or no war depends upon the aggressor—once begun the party aggrieved acquires a vote he has his negative upon every plan for terminating the war—what is to be done give yourself up without resistance to the mercy of a justly exasperated enemy but this or the continuance of the war is all the choice that is now left in what state of things can this remedy be made to serve are you unsuccessful—the remedy is inapplicable are you successful—nobody will call for it punishment of the authors of the war punishment whatever it may be to the personal adversaries of the ministers is no satisfaction to the nation this is selfevident but what is closer to the purpose and not less true is that in a case like this the fear of punishment on such an account is no check to them of a majority in parliament they are in possession or they would not be ministers that they should be abandoned by this majority is not in the catalogue of events that ought to be looked upon as possible but between abandoning them and punishing them there is a wide difference lord north was abandoned in the american war he was not punished for it his was an honest error in judgment unstained by any malâ fide practice and countenanced by a fair majority in parliament and so may any other impolitic and unjust war be this is not a punishing age if bribetaking oppression peculation duplicity treachery every crime that can be committed by statesmen sinning against conscience produce no desire to punish what dependence can be placed on punishment in a case where the mischief may so easily happen without any ground for punishment mankind are not yet arrived at that stage in the track of civilization foreign nations are not yet considered as objects susceptible of an injury for the citizens of other civilized nations we have not so much feeling as for our negroes there are instances in which ministers have been punished for making peace—there are none where they have been so much as questioned for bringing the nation into war and if punishment had been ever applied on such an occasion it would be not for the mischief done to the foreign nation but purely for the mischief brought upon their own not for the injustice but purely for the imprudence it has never been laid down as a rule that you should pay any regard to foreign nations it has never been laid down that you should stick at anything which would give you an advantage in your dealings with foreign nations on what ground could a minister be punished for a war even the most unsuccessful brought on by any such means i did my best to serve you he would say—the worse the measure was for the foreign nation the more i took upon me the greater therefore the zeal i showed for your cause the event has proved unfavourable are zeal and misfortune to be represented as crimes a war unjust on the part of our own nation by whose ministers it is brought on can never be brought on but in pursuit of some advantage which were it not for the injustice towards the foreign nation it would be for our interests to pursue the injustice     and the danger of retaliation being on all hands looked upon as nothing the plea of the minister would always be—it was your interest i was pursuing and the uninformed and unreflecting part of the nation that is the great body of the nation would echo to him—yes it was our interest you were preserving the voice of the nation on these subjects can only be looked for in newspapers but on these subjects the language of all newspapers is uniform—it is we that are always in the right without a possibility of being otherwise against us other nations have no rights if according to the rules of judging between individual and individual we are right—we are right by the rules of justice if not we are right by the laws of patriotism which is a virtue more respectable than justice—injustice oppression fraud lying whatever acts would be crimes whatever habits would be vices if manifested in the pursuit of individual interests when manifested in pursuit of national interests become sublimated into virtues let any man declare who has ever read or heard an english newspaper whether this be not the constant tenor of the notions they convey party on this one point makes no difference however hostile to one another on all other points on this they have never but one voice—they write with the utmost harmony such are the opinions and to these opinions the facts are accommodated as of course who would blush to misrepresent when misrepresentation is a virtue but newspapers if their voice make but a small part of the voice of the people the instruction they give makes on these subjects the whole of the instruction which the people receive such being the national propensity to error on these points and to error on the worst side the danger of parliamentary punishment for misconduct of this kind must appear equivalent to next to nothing even in the eyes of an unconcerned and cool spectator what must it appear then in the eyes of ministers themselves acting under the seduction of selfpartiality and hurried on by the tide of business no the language which a minister on such occasions will hold to himself will be uniformly this—in the first place what i do is not wrong in the next place if it were nothing should i have to fear from it under the present system of secresy ministers have therefore every seduction to lead them into misconduct while they have no check to keep them out of it and what species of misconduct that in comparison of which all others are but peccadillos let a minister throw away £ 0000 or £ 0000 in pensions to his creatures let him embezzle a few hundred thousand for himself what is that to fifty or a hundred millions the ordinary burthen of a war observe the consequence this is the department of all others in which the strongest checks are needful at the same time thanks to the rules of secresy of all the departments this is the only one in which there are no checks at all i say then the conclusion is demonstrated the principle which throws a veil of secresy over the proceedings of the foreign department of the cabinet is pernicious in the highest degree pregnant with mischiefs superior to everything to which the most perfect absence of all concealment could possibly give rise there still remains a sort of inexplicit notion which may present itself as secretly furnishing an argument on the other side such is the condition of the british nation peace and war may be always looked upon as being to all human probability in good measure in her power when the worst comes to the worst peace may always be had by some unessential sacrifice i admit the force of the argument what i maintain is that it operates in my favour why it depends upon two propositions—the matchless strength of this country and the uselessness of her foreign dependencies i admit both but both operate as arguments in my favour her strength places her above the danger of surprise and above the necessity of having recourse to it to defend herself the uselessness of her foreign dependencies prove a fortiori the uselessness of engaging in wars for their protection and defence if they are not fit to keep without war much less are they worth keeping at the price of war the inutility of a secret cabinet is demonstrated by this short dilemma for offensive measures cabinet secresy can never be necessary to this nation for defence it can never be necessary to any my persuasion is that there is no state whatever in which any inconveniences capable of arising from publicity in this department would not be greatly overbalanced by the advantages be the state ever so great or ever so small ever so strong or ever so weak be its form of government pure or mixed single or confederated monarchical aristocratical or democratical the observations already given seem in all these cases sufficient to warrant the conclusion but in a nation like britain the safety of publicity the inutility of secresy in all such business stands upon peculiar grounds stronger than any two other nations much stronger of course than any one its superiority deprives it of all pretence of necessity of carrying points by surprise clandestine surprise is the resource of knavery and fear of unjust ambition combined with weakness her matchless power exempts her from the one her interest if her servants could be     brought to be governed by her evident interests would forbid the other taking the interest of the first servant of the state as distinct from and opposite to the nation clandestinity may undoubtedly be in certain cases favourable to the projects of sceptred thieves and robbers without taking the precautions of a thief the great frederic might probably enough not have succeeded in the enterprise of stealing silesia from her lawful sovereign without an advantage of this sort the triple gang might perhaps not have found it quite so easy to secure what they stole from poland whether there can or cannot exist occasions on which it might in this point of view be the interest of a king of great britain to turn highwayman is a question i shall waive but a proposition i shall not flinch from is that it never can be the interest of the nation to abet him in it when those sceptred sinners sold themselves to the service of mammon they did not serve him for nought the booty was all their own were we i speak as one of the body of the nation to assist our king in committing a robbery upon france the booty would be his he would have the naming to the new places which is all the value that in the hands of a british robber such booty can be of to anybody the privilege of paying for the horse and pistols is all that would be ours the booty would be employed in corrupting our confidential servants and this is the full and exact amount of what we should get by it conquests made by new zealanders have some sense in them while the conquered fry the conquerers fatten conquests made by the polished nations of antiquity—conquests made by greeks and romans—had some sense in them lands moveables inhabitants everything went into the pocket the invasions of france in the days of the edwards and the henrys had a rational object prisoners were taken and the country was stripped to pay their ransom the ransom of a single prisoner a duke of orleans exceeded onethird of the national revenue of england conquests made by a modern despot of the continent have still some sense in them the new property being continguous is laid on to his old property the inhabitants as many as he thinks fit to set his mark upon go to increase his armies their substance as much as he thinks fit to squeeze from them goes into his purse conquests made by the british nation would be violations of common sense were there no such thing as justice they are bungling imitations of miserable originals bating the essential circumstances nothing but confirmed blindness and stupidity can prompt us to go on imitating alexander and cæsar and the new zelanders and catherine and frederic without the profit if it be the king alone who gets the appointment to the places it is a part of the nation it may be said that gets the benefit of filling them a precious lottery fifty or one hundred millions the cost of the tickets so many years purchase of ten or twenty thousand ayear the value of the prizes this if the scheme succeed—what if it fail i do not say there are no sharers in the plunder—it is impossible for the head of a gang to put the whole of it into his own pocket all i contend for is that robbery by wholesale is not so profitable as by retail—if the whole gang together pick the pockets of strangers to a certain amount the ringleaders pick the pockets of the rest to a much greater shall i or shall i not succeed in persuading my countrymen that it is not their interest to be thieves oh but you mistake cries somebody we do not now make war for conquests but for trade more foolish still this is a still worse bargain than before conquer the whole world it is impossible you should increase your trade one halfpenny—it is impossible you should do otherwise than diminish it conquer little or much you pay for it by taxes—but just so much as a merchant pays in taxes just so much he is disabled from adding to the capital he employs in trade had you two worlds to trade with you could only trade with them to the amount of your capital and what credit you might meet with on the strength of it this being true of each trader is so of all traders find a fallacy in this short argument if you can if you obtained your new right of trading given you for nothing you would not be a halfpenny the richer if you paid for them by war or preparations for war by just so much as you paid for these you would be the poorer the good people of england along with the right of selfgovernment conquered prodigious right of trade the revolution was to produce for them not only the blessings of security and power but immense and sudden wealth year has followed after year and to their endless astonishment the progress to wealth has gone on no faster than before one piece of good fortune still wanting they have never thought of—that on the day their shackles were knocked off some kind sylph should have slipped a few thousand pounds into every mans pocket there is no law against my flying to the moon yet i cannot get there why because i have no wings what wings are to flying capital is to trade there are two ways of making war for trade—forcing independent nations to let you trade with them and conquering nations or pieces of nations to make them trade with     you the former contrivance is to appearance the more easy and the policy of it the more refined the latter is more in the good old way and the king does his own business and the nations at the same time he gets the naming to the places and the nation cannot choose but join with him being assured that it is all for the sake of getting them the trade the places he lays hold of good man only out of necessity and that they may not go abegging—on his own account he has no more mind for them than a newmade bishop for the mitre or a newmade speaker for the chair to the increase of trade both these plans of war equally contribute what you get in both cases is the pleasure of the war the legal right of trading to part of america was conquered by france from britain in the last war what have they got by it they have got tobago bankruptcy and a revolution for their fifty millions ministers who to account for the bankruptcy are forced to say something about the war call it a national one—the king has not got by it—therefore the nation has what has it got a fine trade were there but capital to carry it on with such room for trade how comes there to be no more of it this is what merchants and manufacturers are putting themselves to the torture to account for the sylph so necessary elsewhere was still more necessary to france since over and above her other work there was the fifty millions spent in powder and shot to replace the king of france however by getting tobago probably obtained two or three thousand pounds worth of places to give away this is what he got and this is all that anybody got for the nations fifty millions let us go on as we have begun strike a bold stroke take all their vessels we can lay hold of without a declaration of war and who knows but what we may get it back again with the advantages we now have over them five times the success they are so pleased with would be but a moderate expectation for every fifty millions thus laid out our king would get in places to the amount not of two or three thousand pounds only but say of ten fifteen or twenty thousand pounds all this would be prodigious glory—and fine paragraphs and speeches thanksgivings and birthday odes might be sung and said for it but for economy i would much rather give the king new places to the same amount at home if at this price his ministers would sell us peace the conclusion is that as we have nothing to fear from any other nation or nations nor want anything from other nations we can have nothing to say to other nations nor to hear from them—that might not be as public as any laws what then is the veil of secresy that enwraps the proceedings of the cabinet a mere cloak for wickedness and folly—a dispensation to ministers to save them from the trouble of thinking—a warrant for playing all manner of mad and silly pranks unseen and uncontrouled—a licence to play at hazard with their fellows abroad staking our lives and fortunes upon the throw what then is the true use and effect of secresy that the prerogatives of place may furnish an aliment to petty vanity—that the members of the circulation may have as it were a newspaper to themselves—that under favour of the monopoly ignorance and incapacity may put on airs of wisdom—that a man unable to write or speak what is fit to be put into a newspaper may toss up his head and say i dont read newspapers—as if a parent were to say i dont trouble my head about schoolmasters—and that a minister secure from scrutiny in that quarter may have the convenient opportunity upon occasion of filling the posts with obsequious cyphers instead of effective men—anything will do to make a minister whose writing may be written for him and whose duty in speaking consists in silence this much must be confessed—if secresy as against the nation be useless and pernicious to the nation it is not useless and pernicious with regard to its servants it forms part of the douceurs of office—a perquisite which will be valued in proportion to the insignificance of their characters and the narrowness of their views it serves to pamper them up with notions of their own importance and to teach the servants of the people to look down upon their masters oh—but if everything that were written were liable to be made public were published who would treat with you abroad just the same persons as treat with you at present negotiations for fear of misrepresentation would perhaps be committed somewhat more to writing than at present—and where would be the harm the king and his ministers might not have quite such such copious accounts true or false of the tittletattle of each court or they must put into different hands the tittletattle and the real business and suppose your head servants were not so minutely acquainted with the mistresses and buffoons of kings and their ministers—what matters it to you as a nation who have no intrigues to carry on no petty points to compass it were an endless task to fill more pages with the shadows that might be conjured up in order to be knocked down i leave that task to any that will undertake it i challenge party men—i invite the impartial lovers of their country and mankind to discuss the question—to ransack the stores of history and imagination as well as history for cases actual or possible in which the want of secrecy in this line of business can be     shown to be attended with any substantial prejudice as to the constitution the question of cabinetsecresy having never been tried by the principles of the constitution has never received a decision the good old tudor and stuart principles have been suffered to remain unquestioned here foreign politics are questions of state under elizabeth and james nothing was to be inquired into—nothing was to be known—everything was matter of state on other points the veil has been torn away but with regard to these there has been a sort of tacit understanding between ministers and people hitherto war has been the national rage peace has always come too soon—war too late to tie up the ministers hands and make them continually accountable would be depriving them of numberless occasions of seizing those happy advantages that lead to war it would be lessening the peoples chance of their favourite amusement for these hundred years past ministers to do them justice have generally been more backward than the people—the great object has rather been to force them into war than to keep them out of it walpole and newcastle were both forced into war it admits of no doubt if we are really for war and fond of it for its own sake we can do no better than let things continue as they are if we think peace better than war it is equally certain that the law of secresy cannot be too soon abolished such is the general confusion of ideas—such the power of the imagination—such the force of prejudice—that i verily believe the persuasion is not an uncommon one—so clear in their notions are many worthy gentlemen that they look upon war if successful as a cause of opulence and prosperity with equal justice might they look upon the loss of a leg as a cause of swiftness well but if it be not directly the cause of opulence it is indirectly from the successes of war come say they our prosperity our greatness thence the respect paid to us by foreign powers—thence our security and who does not know how necessary security is to opulence no war is in this way just as unfavourable to opulence as in the other in the present mode of carrying on war—a mode which it is in no mans power to depart from security is in proportion to opulence just so far then as war is by its direct effects unfavourable to opulence—just so far is it unfavourable to security respect is a term i shall beg leave to change respect is a mixture of fear and esteem but for constituting esteem force is not the instrument but justice the sentiment really relied upon for security is fear by respect then is meant in plain english fear but in a case like this fear is much more adverse than favourable to security so many as fear you join against you till they think they are too strong for you and then they are afraid of you no longer—meantime they all hate you and jointly and severally they do you as much mischief as they can you on your part are not behindhand with them conscious or not conscious of your own bad intentions you suspect theirs to be still worse their notion of your intentions is the same measures of mere selfdefence are naturally taken for projects of aggression the same causes produce on both sides the same effects each makes haste to begin for fear of being forestalled in this state or things if on either side there happen to be a minister or a wouldbe minister who has a fancy for war the stroke is struck and the tinder catches fire at school the strongest boy may perhaps be the safest two or more boys are not always in readiness to join against one but though this notion may hold good in an english school it will not bear transplanting upon the theatre of europe oh but if your neighbours are really afraid of you their fear is of use to you in another way—you get the turn of the scale in all disputes points that are at all doubtful they give up to you of course watch the moment and you may every now and then gain points that do not admit of doubt this is only the former old set of fallacies exhibited in a more obscure form and which from their obscurity only can show as new the fact is as has been already shown there is no nation that has any points to gain to the prejudice of any other between the interests of nations there is nowhere any real conflict if they appear repugnant anywhere it is only in proportion as they are misunderstood what are these points what points are these which if you had your choice you would wish to gain of them preferences in trade have been proved to be worth nothing—distant territorial acquisitions have been proved to be worth less than nothing when these are out of the question what other points are there worth gaining by such means opulence is the word i have first mentioned but opulence is not the word that would be first pitched upon the repugnancy of the connexion between war and opulence is too glaring—the term opulence brings to view an idea too simple too intelligible too precise splendour greatness glory these are terms better suited to the purpose prove first that war contributes to splendour and greatness you may persuade yourself it contributes to opulence because when you think of splendour you think of opulence but splendour greatness glory all these fine   0 things may be produced by useless success and unprofitable and enervating extent of dominion obtained at the expense of opulence and this is the way in which you may manage so as to prove to yourself that the way to make a man run the quicker is to cut off one of his legs and true enough it is that a man who has had a leg cut off and the stump healed may hop faster than a man who lies in bed with both legs broken can walk and thus you may prove that britain is in a better case after the expenditure of a glorious war than if there had been no war because france or some other country was put by it into a still worse condition in respect therefore of any benefit to be derived in the shape of conquest or of trade—of opulence or of respect—no advantage can be reaped by the employment of the unnecessary the mischievous and unconstitutional system of clandestinity and secresy in negotiation     appendix—junctiana proposal proposals for the on of the two seas—the atlantic and the pacific by means of a jointstock company to be styled the junctiana company §   grounds of expectation respecting the practicability of the proposed junction the most recent as well as most determinate grounds rest it is believed on the authority of the work intituled memoirs of the mexican revolution c by william davis robinson in two volumes  vo london    0 the author a citizen of the united states a gentleman of good character well known to the legation of his own state here in london in volume ii chapter xiii p     is devoted to this subject it speaks ii     of the measure in question as being known to have been a favourite measure of the last of the two pitts it certainly was in the contemplation of general miranda whose enterprise was undertaken under the protection of that minister it was from miranda that the edinburgh review derived the principal part of the information contained in its article on the subject anno    0 being so long posterior to humboldts great work this of mr robinson speaks of course p     of the nine several supposed lines of junction mentioned in that universally known work but by humboldt in making the number of them so considerable physical possibility is alone taken into consideration length of voyage in respect of time and consequently prospect of net profit not being taken into the account to which latter purpose if the reports given by mr robinson are to be depended upon the nine will be found reduced to one nothing can be more encouraging than the expectations held out by this account of his three spots it is true are mentioned but of the three taking the matter upon the face of his account of it the one from porto bello on the atlantic to panamá on the pacific is decidedly impracticable another namely from the port formed by the river guasacualco in the atlantic to tehuantepec in the pacific not worth a thought in comparison with the     third a chain of mountains running between the two seas p     and the only chance depending on the existence of some ravine deep enough to afford a practicable passage for a cut in this third proposed course through the lake of nicaragua no mountains are in the way from the river san juan in english st john running from the lake into the atlantic it passes on to the pacific either through the lake of leon which by a river communicates with the lake of nicaragua or by a direct cut at a less distance the information he speaks of as being derived from a number of persons of different descriptions names not mentioned by whom the tract of country in question had been visited the sum of it is as follows— i elevation of the land between both lakes and the pacific the ground a dead level ii depth of water on the side of the atlantic   feet   general depth over the bar at the mouth of st johns river      in a particular part      depth in the river after the bar has been crossed from fathoms   making     to fathoms   making      depth of water in the nicaragua lake from fathoms   making     to fathoms   making      in the pacific ocean depths of water not stated in figures but said to be free from rocks and shoals in one part the papagayo coast the shore so bold that a frigate may anchor within a few yards of the beach iii length of a strait cut at different parts of the above dead level     from lake nicaragua to the pacific in the gulph of papagayo miles from    to        from lake leon to the pacific on the coast of nicoya miles from    to        from the atlantic into lake nicaragua up the river san juan large brigs and schooners sail length of a river by which lake leon communicates already with the sea leagues   say miles    neither in humboldts work nor in any other as yet published is any considerable part of the above information it is believed to be found under these circumstances the nicaragua track seems to be the one the only one to which in the present state of our knowledge here in europe the attention of capitalists can be directed with a view to the formation of any such company as is here proposed §   outline of the proposed agreement for the accomplishment of it i situation and dimensions of the proposed spot taking the conception of the spot from the view given of it in the maps to pinkertons atlas the greatest tract of territory that would be requisite to be allotted to the purpose would be that which occupies in length somewhat less than four degrees of longitude geographical miles say   0 namely from the mouth of st johns river in the pacific and in breadth upon an average a little more than a degree of latitude geographical miles say a little more than  0 upon the face of the map the natural boundaries are to the north a chain of lofty mountains to the south another such chain with the exception of the dead level above spoken of to the east the atlantic to the west—in part the chain of mountains having on the other side of it the territory of costa rica—on other part the pacific in this tract of country may be seen the maximum of what it can be necessary should be ceded to the proposed company whether from this quantity consistently with the accomplishment and perpetual maintenance of the junction for mutual and universal benefit any and what defalcation can be made will scarcely be ascertainable until the necessary surveys have been made and reported whatever may be the site and amount of it call it for the present junctiana ii proposed source of benefit to the proposed company in a pecuniary shape   the price of transit whatsoever shape or shapes may be given to it this price being to be received from the masters of all vessels making use of the communication   the absolute property in the land land covered with water included of all this territory or of what lesser portion of it shall on report of surveyors as above be deemed necessary and sufficient thence the right of selling it in parcels and letting it out upon leases for building and other purposes iii proposed obligations of the company   to pay to the local authorities a sum in the name of purchase money for the powers of government   to pay the expense of the indemnification due to all such individuals original inhabitants styled indians included as possess any interest in whatsoever land comes to be purchased the value so paid for to be the present value only not any such additional value as may be expected to be derived from the accomplishment of the measure in case of disagreement the prices to be referred to arbitration in manner hereinafter to be mentioned   to defray the whole expense of effecting     and keeping up the communication including as well necessary fortifications towards the two seas as necessary means of communication of all sorts such as canals locks bridges tunnels c and necessary receptacles of all sorts for vessels such as docks jetties c   in respect of the price of transit as above the company to admit vessels of all states at the outset and forever on exactly the same footing—the state or states with which the agreement is made not excepted no favour direct or indirect to be given to any one at the expense of any other state or of all states   so in respect of purchase and renting of land as above   proposition to be made to the angloamerican united states to take the junctiana territory under their protection by admitting it into their union terms except so far as shall be excepted the same in principle with those upon which the recently admitted states have been admitted admitted namely for a time and while in a state of probation under the administration of the president of the united states and as soon as ripe admitted on the same footing as those other states and with the same sort of government considering the benefit which in so many shapes these united states would reap from the accomplishment of the junction and the honour conferred on their nation by the proposed spontaneous choice their concurrence seems hardly to be doubted of as to this point see §     no slavery in any shape to be allowed should any vessel with any slave on board obtain admittance into the territory every such slave upon his entrance within the territory to he free nb—it seems essential that considering the magnitude of the advances which the company would have to make before any returns could be expected every security which the nature of the case admits of should be afforded to it and in particular against any changes to which in their origin states so lately emancipated from so bad a form of government cannot but appear to stand exposed society and manners on the part of so large a proportion of the population being as yet on so unfavourable a footing as to this point see §   for the preservation of its rights and powers from injury the company might stipulate for its having the appointment of a governor of the state so constituted with a negative upon all laws but quere as to the need of this see §     the entire price of transit at the rate of so much per ton to be made known and always kept known to all persons concerned no enhancement by particular and undeclared collateral charges   the maximum of it to be determined by the agreement between the contracting parties no enhancement except by mutual consent in consequence of casual expenses and consequent net loss expenses the nature of which will be to be specified in the ultimate agreement §   mexico—sacrifices eventually requisite—inducements to compliance for the accomplishment of the measure upon the plan here submitted the following are among the conditions necessary—   that the expense be defrayed—not by the government to which the territory belongs but by a jointstock company   that for their security the dominion of the territory through which the communication is made be ceded to the company   that the dominion so ceded have—not on both sides of it a territory belonging to one and the same government but on one side a territory belonging to one government namely mexico—on the other side of it a territory belonging to another government namely columbia   that for security to the capitalists members of the jointstock company as well as for the benefit and satisfaction of all other nations interested the territory in question be taken under the protection of the angloamerican united states of all other nations interested—which is as much as to say of all the other nations of the earth on this plan at the hands of mexico certain sacrifices will on certain suppositions be requisite   in mexico has any such idea yet been entertained as that of executing the enterprise within her own dominions and with capital to no greater amount than could be either raised by taxes or obtained in some way or other from proprietors subjects of her own government in columbia there seems some ground for supposing that a conception to the like effect may perhaps have been entertained in relation to herself forasmuch as many months ago a competent person was sent out from europe by columbia to make surveys in this view and on any such occasion its own internal resources are the ways and means which a government would naturally look to before it thought of extraneous ones in mexico should a persuasion to this effect have already obtained possession of mens minds a proposal such as the present seems to have no great prospect of finding acceptance the probability however seems to be on the negative side   the first point on which this part of the question will turn is—what is the quantity of capital that will be requisite as to this point everything is it must be confessed in     utter darkness estimate being as yet altogether out of the question what remains is loose conjecture and without anything but the general nature of the enterprise for its ground on this ground no professional man would it is believed set the expense at less than several millions of pounds sterling—between four and five times as many dollars whatsoever be the amount thus much is however certain that the expenditure would require to be kept running on—running on for a length of time probably for several years before any the least return for the money could be received that any such sum should be raised by taxes—raised by government in its infant and as yet unsettled state—by taxes over and above all that will be requisite for carrying on the ordinary business of government is an expectation of a result which upon the face of it does not seem probable as to a capital to be raised without taxes—a capital to be furnished by a jointstock company having for its members to an exclusive or principal amount individuals belonging to the state of mexico—the formation of any such company depends upon two conditions—   upon the existence of capital to such an amount at the disposal of individuals   upon the inability of finding other applications for it and those of an ordinary nature that would be still more advantageous applications in the instance of which the employment given to it would be under the eye of the proprietor—at the choice of the proprietor—determined on each occasion by the will of the proprietor and would not as in this case have to wait during an indefinite time for every the smallest return if for example the information that has been received is correct fifteen per cent and more and with an immediate return may always be made of capital in mexico while by an english capitalist less than ten per cent if placed upon a footing regarded by him as an assured one would be caught at and for this or something not more than this if possessed of sufficient means of living from other sources he would even be content to wait on the establishment of the london docks for example ten per cent was the maximum looked to and this was long before the commencement of that state of things by which the profit capable of being expected from capital has been of late years so much reduced this point being determined upon if the determination be that a jointstock company formed by capitalists of all nations foreigners as well as natives shall be resorted to then comes the question about the portion of territory and the cession to be made of it if the only portion that required to be ceded were the portion to be purchased by the company for the purpose of the communication that is to say the portion through which the work would have to be carried on thus far no great difficulty presents itself thus far by the supposition mexico would have her equivalent the sacrifice would be such as she would be prepared to make the equivalent one with which by the supposition she would be satisfied but the difficulty if there be any in the case lies here it is essential to the plan that columbia be not excluded from a share in that benefit which consists in contiguity—immediate contiguity—to the spot through which the communication is made for this purpose it is necessary that while on one side mexico has the territory immediately contiguous to the territory through which the communication passes columbia should have the territory immediately contiguous to it on the other side but according to the latest account that has been made public viz mr robinsons as published in london anno      there is but one spot that affords any tolerably fair promise of any such junction on profitable terms and that is a spot in which lake nicaragua is included and if the information received be correct not only the contiguous land on the side of mexico is regarded as appertaining to mexico but also the contiguous land on the side of columbia if this be not the case if the claims or expectations of mexico do not embrace both sides here ends this difficulty but if they do embrace both sides then it is that the difficulty will have place for then it is that by mexico according to the plan here proposed a sacrifice to a certain amount will have to be made for its direct object this plan has the securing the establishment of the communication for the benefit of all nations without exception and more particularly for the benefit of mexico columbia and the angloamerican states these being the three nations to which local proximity will render it in a peculiar degree advantageous but moreover for its collateral objects it has the prevention of all that illwill as between mexico and columbia of which the possession of so great an advantage to mexico to the ex lusion of columbia could scarcely the nature of man considered fail of being productive betwixt mexico and columbia with more propriety might it have been said between mexico on the one part and on the other part columbia backed by all the other nations of the earth this heartburning this source of war and disappointment—this it is that presents itself to view as the great natural stumblingblock to the undertaking this stumblingblock it is the principal object of this proposal to remove suppose even that by her own resources     and within her own dominions it were completely in the power of mexico to establish the communication still this stumbingblock would remain unremoved a nation which for a long time at sea at least could not but remain a weak one this weak nation embarked in a project presenting a face of injury to all the powers upon earth for the sake of peace in general and for the peace and safety to mexico in particular this proposal has therefore for its main object the preventing a possession thus important to all nations from being endeavoured to be taken for a subject of exclusive property by any nation—to preserve it from becoming a bone of contention to all nations—to preserve it from this fate by placing it in the conjunct hands of three nations in the character of trustees for themselves and for all others without exception on the supposition that mexico has placed herself and is known to have placed herself in so dangerous a situation and that the aid of capital from without is at the same time regarded by her as necessary would any such capital to any such amount be found by capitalists the danger against which in this case adequate security would be looked for is not merely want of inclination to secure to them the stipulated benefits but want of ability but as to this point in the case supposed the company would behold itself in a state of dependence not only on mexico herself but on every other power with which either on the account here in question or on any other mexico might at any point of time however distant find herself in a state of hostility should any such hostility at any time have place and can it rationally be supposed that it will not at any time have place the most prominent object would of course be this matchless jewel—this matchless key to commercial advantage the first endeavour would be either to take possession of it or as england did by the washington capital to destroy it and in either case what would be the condition of the company hereupon comes the question—the security here proposed will it be sufficient o yes that it will this position requires a separate consideration and the truth of it will be rendered it is hoped sufficiently manifest in another place see §   upon the plan of universal benefit here proposed all nations would behold in mexico a friend upon the plan of exclusive benefit to mexico this plan of universal benefit being supposed rejected and known to be rejected all nations would behold in her an enemy upon the plan of universal benefit all other nations in their competition with these two nations and one another are secured against every disadvantage except that which has been established by the hand of nature that is to say local distance upon the plan of exclusive benefit they would behold themselves exposed at all times to extortion—to extortion blind and boundless they would look to the vistula to the elbe to the rhine in a word to all those water communications which in europe run through different states all this they would look to and in the scene of selfpernicious selfishness so universally and constantly exhibited in the old world behold evidence but too conclusive of the like mixture of improbity and folly in the new to columbia such virtual hostility could scarce fail to be in a peculiar degree galling and irritative to mexico to the exclusion of columbia the junction would on this supposition give the prodigious advantage of a water communication between her own ports in the atlantic and her own ports in the pacific meantime for this same advantage in the case of columbia the demand is equally urgent suppose her next neighbour in possession of it and herself for ever either destitute of it or dependent for it on the ever precarious goodwill of a foreign state—the very idea of such a state of things—could it consistently with the nature of man fail to have irritation for its accompaniment while they themselves are confined to the supremely tedious sea communication round cape horn or to the not much less tedious internal communication up the rapid current of the river magdalena with a tedious landcarriage at the end of it—the mercantile men of that alreadyestablished republic with their rulers at their back—is it in the nature of man they should look with other than an evil eye on their rivals in the mexican state if in the exclusive possession of so irresistible an instrument for throwing them out of the market the columbians it is well known to mexicans have for a considerable time past been regarding this jewel with a proprietary eye after many unexpected delays so late as february      a civil engineer went from europe to make surveys in this view exclusion from it would produce in their breasts the sensation of a loss in the breast of mexicans the nonacquisition of it would not produce any such sensation as that of loss by the acquisition of it in equal shares on the hereproposed partnership footing the sensation of gain would be produced alike on both sides in this state of things supposing the partnership plan rejected if it were not really the interest it would at any rate appear to be the interest of all classes in the republic of columbia to act in a manner more or less declaredly hostile to mexico—to obstruct the settlement of the government—to foment divisions—to keep the country in such a state of poverty as should oppose an insuperable     bar to her putting herself in possession of so exclusive and invidious an advantage all this while what should never be out of mind is that for all these surmises unpleasant as they are not any of the parties concerned but the penner of this proposal and he alone is answerable all individuals on whom any thing depends being on both sides alike unknown to him the propensities so universal in human nature constitute the only source whence these indications of probable hostility have been derived a much more pleasing object of contemplation to him is the state of amity—cordial and durable amity—which the sort of partnership here proposed could not fail to number among its natural fruits the infant state would behold in them its common parents in the angloamerican union of whose kindness the columbian republic has had such recent experience and at whose hands the mexican state has so sure an anticipation of the like kindness they would behold a common friend and a friend in case of misunderstanding whether on these or any other points a common referee—a referee such as for impartiality probity and sound sense has assuredly never as yet been matched in the history of nations one advantage however it must be confessed there is of which in this plan mexico would put herself exclusively in possession an advantage in which neither any other nation nor even columbia herself could claim any the least share this is the glory of so extraordinary not to say unexampled a manifestation of the union of those two virtues to which all other virtues are reducible—effective benevolence and selfregarding prudence in fact it would be nothing more than a sacrifice of personal interest ill understood to personal interest well understood still so difficult to human weakness is every such sacrifice so imperfectly understood as yet is the connexion between social and personal interest that the characters of generosity would not the less assuredly stamp themselves upon the face of the sacrifice in the most conspicuous and unfading colours so much as between mexico and columbia now as between mexico and all other nations as by refusal of this cession mexico would stand forth in the eyes of all other nations in the light of an enemy of their common welfare so by consent to it she would establish herself in the character—the conspicuous the indisputable the indelible character—not simply of a common friend but of a benefactress—a common universal and unexampled benefactress to her they would behold themselves indebted—not merely for a benefit but for such a benefit as unless it were without design or expectation on the part of the benefactor the nations of the earth taken in the aggregate never yet received at the hands of any one gratitude is therefore an affection of which in so far as in minds so situated any such social affection can have place she will be an object in all eyes—in the eyes of the present generation and of all future ones by spain and spain alone can any exception to this observation be afforded but no longer than the present delirium lasts can this exception last nations are not like individuals exposed to any such lamentable disease as insanity coeval with existence—insanity beyond the reach of cure howsoever liable to become faint the colours of national gratitude may be such is not the case with the impression made by respect respect is a tribute which where really due not even the bitterest enemy can altogether refuse and as to time tribute in this shape so far from being diminished is even increased by it the cession—shall it be gratuitous—shall it be for a price—if for a price by whom paid—by columbia in the whole—by the proposed company in the whole—by columbia and the proposed company in shares—and if so in what shares questions these which of necessity must in the present stage of the business be left unanswered thus much however may even here be mentioned namely that if by mexico a price is looked for selfregarding prudence may remain or not remain—there at any rate ends benevolence—effective benevolence with whatever glory encircles a virtue of such matchless rarity among nations there ends that glory to mexico and there commences embarrassment and obstruction on a possession such as that in question who shall fix a value on what grounds can it be fixed with an amount fixed upon without grounds who will be satisfied be it what it may who will be content to pay it meantime thus much may be answered in the negative and thence what follows from it in the affirmative no preference must there be in respect of the price of transit by any such preference the simplicity of the plan would be destroyed the merit of it as towards all other nations would be destroyed in this shape an advantage could not be given to mexico by columbia against herself without its being given as against all other nations this shape being set aside money seems therefore to be the only shape in which if in any advantage could on any such score be granted §   columbia—her particular inducements to concurrence after what has been said on the subject of those inducements which apply to the case of mexico next to nothing remains to be said of those which apply to the case of columbia on the proposed plan none present themselves     but those in which she will be a sharer with mexico of these in the next section with regard to columbia thus much only remains to be said namely that if the glory of the cession is assumed by mexico as above whatsoever net profit in any more substantial shape comes to be afforded by it will fall of course to the share of columbia §   inducements common to mexico and columbia for the next section is reserved the consideration of the more striking benefit in which upon the proposed plan these two new states will see the old established republic of the angloamerican united states sharing with them and yet without detriment to them or either of them in any shape what remains for the present section will not require many words the spot ceded to the company for the formation and security of the communication will naturally be a seat of new created opulence and population elements of prosperity rapidly increasing from the first and till the spot shall have been incapable of holding any more for ever on the increase a communication in any shape effected commercial functionaries and agents would immediately repair to it from all nations and with them or after them men of all occupations from all nations on both sides of the american continent the asiatic as well as the european junctiana with its two principal towns one on the atlantic the other on the pacific would present to every eye the civilized world in miniature the hands of so many various descriptions of whom in such multitudes the labour would be necessary—the functionaries of the superintending classes whose presence would be necessary for the giving direction to all that labour—the members of the establishment civil and military which upon a scale of even such perfect frugality would still be necessary—all these multitudes put together would form a sensible addition to the active population and circulating wealth of the territory even from the very commencement of the work the narrower the spot thus allotted to the company the more speedily of course will all this mass of wealth and population begin to run over and spread itself over the two great states on each side of it but be that as it may the frontier on each side can scarce fail to be marked by a flowing tide of the matter of national prosperity in both shapes of this influx so much as is formed by emigrants from other states will with reference at least to the two states in question be so much created as it were out of nothing and in this advantage no other nation will possess any the least share for anything like a clear or correct conception of the advantage derivable to any tract of country from the accession of settlers in its immediate vicinity recourse should be had to the state of things in this respect in the angloamerican united states as depictured in the various printed accounts that have from time to time been given of it by statistical writers and travellers felicity in these shapes has the advantage of presenting determinate conceptions by being expressed in figures benefits not susceptible of any such precise expression but of still superior because of anterior importance—anterior as being the efficient causes of them—are those which will be derived in the shape of mental improvement in every line intellectual and moral together in the little republic of junctiana her two great neighbours parents as they are to her would enjoy the benefit of a common school established under the eyes of both of them an allcomprehensive school of everything that is useful in art and science but more particularly of those things that are most useful—good legislation good judicature good government in every line this indeed supposes and assumes that the territory of junctiana will be a member of the angloamerican united states and thereby that the government will be in the only form to which that school can give admittance see §   for if it be in any other nothing that is good can be answered for on any tenable ground §   inducements common to mexico columbia and the angloamerican united states—water communication between their ports on the one ocean and their ports on the other of this benefit little need here be said after the bare mention of it of the matters of fact on which the magnitude of it depends nothing in addition to that which the maps indicate can here be said to the inhabitants of the several territories and in particular to those by whom they have been contemplated with either a political or a commercial eye to them and to them almost alone must the cognizance of this part of the field of consideration be referred for the present and doubtless for a long time to come by mexico and columbia will this benefit be possessed in by far the greatest magnitude with its settlement in the columbian river that empties itself into the pacific the confederation of which washington is the capital—washingtonia if for this purpose it may for the moment be called—will at the first be in the state of the hen with one chick but out of so fertile a womb say who can how many more such chicks may not be destined to be poured forth at any rate if it be worth while to keep her fed by a frequently interrupted watercarriage     and at the end of it a landcarriage over a chain of mountains of  00 miles in length much more so must it be through a level and unbroken channel of which dry land forms no part in the instance of all three states this benefit whatever may be the amount of it has two mutually contrasted yet intimately connected advantages to these states it belongs exclusively as compared with all other states at the same time neither in the eyes of any one of those other states can it be a ground of complaint or an object of jealousy if the act of which it is the result were the act of man—of man with his selfish and antisocial arrangements—yes but no it is the act not of partial and hostile man but of impartial and bounteous nature upon the hereproposed plan the only acts in which man has any concern will be so many manifestations of beneficence universal and indisputable beneficence §   in the eyes of capitalists the proposed protection at the hands of the angloamerican united states necessary and satisfactory the party here considered as that to which such protection would naturally be looked upon as necessary is the proposed company the body of men by whom antecedently to all commencement of profit so vast a capital will be to be expended   first as to necessity without such a security it seems difficult to say in what quarter for such a purpose a prudent set of capitalists could behold a sufficient ground for confidence on the part of the state or states out of whose territory the requisite spot of ground would be to be carved two points it has already been observed would require to be established the constancy of their disposition to perform their part of the engagement and the permanency of their power so to do but in respect of both these points not only now but for an indefinite time to come persons in the situation of those from whom the capital would have to come cannot but be in a great degree in the dark take in the first place columbia the firstborn and best known of the two infant states   at the time at which this line is writing neither is porto cabello the last port remaining to spain in the atlantic known as yet to be in possession of columbia nor is the result of the expedition towards the pacific as yet known in any complete state the republic therefore is not as yet so much as formed   of the effect of its constitution and of its deportment in a state of peace no experience whatever can have as yet been had   of the founder of this state the liberator bolivar the character forms no doubt already a very considerable ground for the requisite sort of confidence not only does it stand high at present but it has for a long time done so in the estimation of those countries from which the capital will have to come but the life of a single person and that still exposed to the chances of war is but a slender prop to lean upon nor for some time owing to the state of her military occupations can matters of a civil nature be so much as submitted to his cognizance one circumstance indeed there is which it may not be improper to mention in this view and which to english and united states capitalists cannot but be of an encouraging nature the five men in whose hands the executive power is at present namely general santander vicepresident of the republic mr gual minister of foreign affairs mr restropo minister of the interior mr castillo minister of finance mr briceno minister of the war and marine department are all of them it seems well acquainted with the english language and to men of english lineage acquaintance with the english language will naturally serve as a sort of circumstantial evidence of english ideas and affections still however this though it is no trifle is all which at the vast distance of bogota the present capital from the place of inquiry there has as yet been time for the public in england or in the angloamerican united states to learn even in relation to the executive government and as to the executive government it is but the organ of the legislative in london the constitution has indeed though only within these few days been made public but the constitution of a state is one thing the conduct of the government and the people under the constitution another thing and of this there cannot as yet have been any the smallest portion of time for observation and experience to have applied themselves to true it is that before the earliest time at which any agreement grounded on this or any other basis can have been entered into light in a considerable degree may naturally be expected to have been cast upon all this darkness a small number of years however how tranquilly and prosperously soever they may have passed on can in such a case afford but a slight foundation for the appropriate confidence and in the mean time if the present opportunity be not embraced—when minds are on the alert generous affections not yet cooled and what is more determinately material capital which as yet is in an overflowing state not yet settled in channels from which it cannot be diverted—this or that unfavourable turn taken by the political machine may have opposed a final bar to the accomplishment of this matchless work of universal beneficence     thus much even as to columbia as to mexico to the eye of an english capitalist everything in that quarter is as yet in utter darkness the result seems to be—that without adequate extraneous security—security on both the above points namely permanency of inclination and permanency of power—without additional security such as nothing but the guarantee of a fully established government can give capital to a sufficient amount would have but small likelihood of finding a sufficient ground for confidence to what government then for any such purpose can expectation turn itself assuredly to one alone and that is the government which has here already been so continually presented to notice—the government of the angloamerican united states in that government prudence is too consummate and too constant to admit of its entering into any such engagement without an assurance of adequate benefit to the great community entrusted to its care the grounds for such assurance will be touched upon under the next head under the present their sufficiency must be provisionally assumed the company will require sufficient assurance of its being permitted at all times to come to exact the price of transit and the rents and profits of its lands meantime for the exercise of the powers of government on a sufficiently frugal plan and in particular for the appointment of fit functionaries it stands irremediably incapacitated—incapacitated partly by local distance partly by its own unchangeable constitution—an aristocratical government the shares in which will be continually shifting hands objects of purchase and sale no one of all these rulers knowing anything about his subjects nor caring anything more about them than he knows were the details of government in hands so circumstanced a necessary consequence is that in the minds of the leading men in this instance as in every other the prime object would be patronage to render this source of profit the more productive useless and needless offices would gradually be multiplied the emolument attached to them swollen to the utmost possible amount pensions of retreat added and the richest of the offices improved into sinecures the proprietors at large not finding any of them adequate inducements to expend their time upon the details of the government or the management—no individual among them beholding any recompense for his labour unless it were in the being let into a partnership of the sinister profit in the repression of which the only service he could render would consist—these proprietors the great majority of them would at all times with the necessarily accustomed blindness and negligence trust everything to those same leaders thus by the everbeaten track—thus a sure as man is man—would a government so constituted go on from worse to worse the permanent prosperity not only of its distant subjects but of the company itself that is to say of the great majority of its members offered up as a constant sacrifice to the particular and sinister interest real or imagined of a small junta of the leaders in a word in neither of the two only shapes in question could the profit be rendered permanent by any other means than the establishment of a form of government which had really for its object the greatest happiness of the greatest number of the people but this it could not have any further than in proportion to the share which the people themselves had in it in such a situation as that in question the people it may be said are not as yet of sufficient age to go alone such would assuredly not be the language in columbia such it is hoped would not be the language in mexico but such would but too naturally be the language in england well then in washington may be seen an institution which has long been in the habit of taking in infant states to nurse witness indiana illinois alabama missouri and how excellent the system of nursing is—how admirable a dry nurse the president has always been—experience has abundantly testified no sooner were the infants of an age to go alone than the alacrity with which the leading strings would be taken off has also been abundantly testified nor in all this is there anything to which any such imputation as that of vague theory can attach itself it rests throughout on practice—longcontinued and universallynotorious practice the circumlocution of the angloamerican united states—a circumlocution as yet indispensable—for these are not at present the only american united states—this circumlocution howsoever where precision is an object indispensable is to any other purpose intolerable well then—washingtonia would by the supposition ease the company of the cares of government she would do for the company and continue to do as she has always done well and to perfection that which for the company to do for itself in any tolerable manner and for any length of time would be morally impossible the company being at the expense of the fortifications these same fortifications would on both sides—and in particular on that which is most material the atlantic side—be in the hands of the company here so long as the fortifications remained untouched would be even against the inhabitants themselves—the inhabitants of the junctiana territory—a security a substantial security for the main source of profit the price of transit together with the fortifications to the   0 company would belong the function and expense of garrisoning them this it might do without considerable danger to itself—without considerable danger from infrugality and peculation out of two small garrisons the number of official situations being determinate no great pickings could be made but in case of aggression from any distant power how would the fortifications be to be defended by land indeed under a government such as here proposed the assistance of the inhabitants of the territory might be trusted to as a sufficient defence but by sea a source of defence suited to the nature of that element would be necessary and for this defence not only the navy of washingtonia on the spot but the mere name of it would be sufficient under the assurance that making war upon junctiana would be making war upon washingtonia of no such war does there seem any the smallest danger at the hands of any other states to destroy the communication would be to put an end to their own use of it to injure it would be to injure themselves were it in any other view than the putting themselves in possession of it by putting themselves in possession of it they could do themselves no service any further than they could keep it keep it they might if a navy alone would suffice to keep it but this they could not do no such thing could any one of them do without an army likewise an army and that sufficient to maintain itself against the three powers perpetually confederated in the defence of the object of a conquest so obviously untenable §   angloamerican united states—their inducements for granting the protection requisite i as to the guarantee looked for at their hands the purpose for which the concurrence of the longestablished american republic is regarded as necessary has been already stated—the affording to capitalists a sufficient assurance that the source of their profit will not be dried up—dried up either by hostility from without or by misconduct in any shape within the shapes in which eventual assistance is looked for at her hands have also been already brought to view—   first of the two mischiefs against which the guarantee is looked for hostility on the part of any maritime power—hostility directed to the purpose of destroying injuring or seizing and keeping the line of communication eventual assistance looked for that of her naval force if of the engagement for such eventual assistance any actual addition to expense were a necessary consequence here would be a burthen—a burthen to set in account against the accompanying benefit but for any such expense no probable need it is believed can be pointed out for general purposes a naval force to a certain amount she keeps up already and will at all times keep up the sight of this force ready at all times to be called for and brought into action should the conjuncture in question—the casus fæderis as it is called by publicists—ever come into existence will in all human probability be at all times sufficient for the purpose to prevent its ever being called for its universally known readiness to come whenever called for will suffice   second of the two mischiefs against which the guarantee is looked for misconduct on the part of the population of junctiana misconduct whether in the general shapes of misrule or anarchy or in the particular shape of injustice towards the company depriving them of the possessions stipulated for by them in return for the expense to which this same population will the greatest part of it have been indebted for its existence the junctiana territory being by the supposition a member of the united states namely in the first instance upon the footing of their other dependent territories and as soon as ripe upon the equal footing of an independent confederate the following are rights for the enjoyment of which the expectation of a guarantee on the part of the union will scarcely present itself as unreasonable understand a guarantee not only against all other nations but against the mexican and columbian nations themselves their consent to it being included in the agreement—   right of exacting the price of transit—so it be for ever without enhancement unless it be in certain stipulated cases   right of receiving the rents and profits of whatever lands the company is proprietor of as in the case of any other proprietors under these two heads is comprised everything that seems necessary ii as to their inducements for the affording this same guarantee to the entering into the engagement thus defined refusal or even reluctance on the part of the united states in question does not seem much to be apprehended by the supposition the infant state would from the first be a member of their confederacy in the first instance and so long as in their judgment should be necessary in a state of pupillage and probation—on the footing of what they call a territory—a territory nursed in the manner in which they are so well accustomed and with such conspicuous success to nurse infant states now then comes the question of their own skill in this most useful most noble of all arts in this instance any more than in any former one can any distrust     on their part reasonably be expected to have existence—distrust of their own skill and after so many conclusive evidences of it as have been afforded by experience if indeed to such guarantee as that in question any considerable danger were attached of their being engaged in war here would be a contingent evil to be set in the balance against the certain good but of any such war the utter improbability has it is hoped been rendered sufficiently manifest see the last preceding section without adequate prospect of benefit to their principals duty and interest would concur in preventing these constantly and necessarily faithful trustees from taking any such part in the affairs of others but of such benefit can there be any deficiency   in the first place on the supposition that from the communication in question benefit to any amount will be derived of all the nations of the earth will not they reap the greatest share of it already their commercial navy is not greatly inferior to that of england—to that of every other country it is decidedly superior erelong in the natural course of things it cannot fail of being superior even to that of england and whatever be the number of her vessels that will find a convenience in availing themselves of the communication the convenience to each such american vessel will in proportion to its greater vicinity to the spot be rendered greater than it can be to any european one   as to the particular benefit from the so much speedier communication with the settlement or settlements present future and contingent in the pacific—on this subject enough has been already said true it is that for the representatives of junctiana when they come to sit in congress distance from the nearest part of the present territory of the united states will give an additional sea voyage of some days but upon the whole would the length of time occupied by the conveyance be in any considerable degree greater than that which is at present occupied by the state most distant from the seat of government and whatever it be what if any will be the amount of the practical inconvenience at the utmost it may operate as a slight deduction from the value of the benefit but cannot assuredly ever operate as a bar to it another acquisition which though not of quite so substantial a nature as either of the preceding ones does not seem much in danger of finding the nation in question altogether insensible to its value is that political gem called glory glory—not of that bloody hue which it is hoped is growing more and more out of fashion and will one day be as little in repute as spangles and embroidery upon a coat at present but glory of the very purest water—the glory radiating from the uncontrovertible proof that will thus be given of its having been looked up to as the nation which in the opinion of two other free nations stands highest in the composite scale of national probity wisdom and benevolence stands highest or should it not rather have been said is the only nation in the government of which any such union of virtues could in the nature of things have ever yet found place §   all other nations—their inducements to acquiescence from the proposed communication formed upon the proposed plan all other nations have more or less to gain nothing to lose whatever may be the gain it will in the instance of each such nation be at the risk of others without risk in any shape to itself that which they will gain by this means they could not any of them gain by any other means         a protest against lawtaxes showing the peculiar mischievousness of all such impositions as add to the expense of appeal to justice by jeremy bentham printed in      and first published in      taxes on lawproceedings constitute in many and perhaps in all nations a part of the resources of the state they do so in great britain—they do so in ireland in great britain an extension of them is to be found among the latest productions of the budget—in ireland a further extension of them is among the measures of the day it is this impending extension that calls forth the publication of the present sheets the substance of which has lain upon the shelf these many years it is a wellknown parliamentary saying that he who reprobates a tax ought to have a better in his hand a juster condition never was imposed i fulfil it at the first word my better tax is—any other that can be named the people when considered with a view to the manner in which they are affected by a tax of this description may be distinguished into two classes those who in each instance of requisition have wherewithal to pay and those who have not to the former we shall find it more grievous than any other kind of tax to the latter a still more cruel grievance taxes on consumption cannot fall but where there is some fund to pay them of poll taxes and taxes on unproductive property the great imperfection is that they may chance to bear where such ability may be wanting taxes upon lawproceedings fall upon a man just at the time when the likelihood of his wanting that ability is at the utmost when a man sees more or less of his property unjustly withholden from him then is the time taken to call upon him for an extraordinary contribution when the back of the innocent has been worn raw by the yoke of the oppressor then is the time which the appointed guardians of innocence have thus pitched upon for loading him with an extraordinary burthen† most taxes are as all taxes ought to be taxes upon affluence—it is the characteristic property of this to be a tax upon distress a tax on bread though a tax on consumption would hardly be reckoned a good tax bread being reckoned in most countries where it is used among the necessaries of life a tax on bread however would not be near so bad a tax as one on lawproceedings a man who pays to a tax on bread may indeed by reason of such payment be unable to get so much bread as he wants but he will always get some bread and in proportion as he pays more and more to the tax he will get more and more bread of a tax upon justice the effect may be that after he has paid the tax he may without getting justice by the payment lose bread by it bread the whole quantity on which he depended for the subsistence of himself and his family for the season may as well as anything else be the very thing for which he is obliged to apply to justice were a threepenny stamp to be put upon every threepenny loaf a man who had but threepence to spend in bread could no longer indeed get a threepenny loaf but an obliging baker could cut him out the half of one a tax on justice admits of no such retrenchment the most obliging stationer could not cut a man out half a latitat nor half a declaration half justice where it is to be had is better than no justice but without buying the whole weight of paper there is no getting a grain of justice     a tax on necessaries is a tax on this or that article of the commodities which happen to be numbered among necessaries a tax on justice is a tax on all necessaries put together a tax on a necessary of life can only lessen a mans share of that particular sort of article a tax on justice may deprive a man and that in any proportion of all sorts of necessaries this is not yet the worst it is not only a burthen that comes in the train of distress but a burthen against which no provision can be made all other taxes may be either foreseen as to the time or at any rate provided for where general ability is not wanting in the instance of this tax it is impossible to foresee the moment of exaction—it is equally impossible to provide a fund for it a tax to be paid upon the loss of a husband or of a father on whose industry the family depended—a tax upon those who have suffered by fire or inundation would seem hard and i know not that in fact any such modes of taxation have ever been made choice of but a tax on lawproceedings is harder than any of these against all those misfortunes provision may be made it is actually made in different ways by insurance and were a tax added to them pay so much more and you might insure yourself against the tax against the misfortune of being called upon to institute or defend ones self against a suit at law there neither is nor can be any office of insurance such is the cruelty of this species of tax to those who have wherewithal to pay and do pay to it accordingly to those who do not it is much more cruel it is neither more nor less than a denial of justice justice is the security which the law provides us with or professes to provide us with for everything we value or ought to value—for property for liberty for honour and for life it is that possession which is worth all others put together for it includes all others a denial of justice is the very quintessence of injury the sum and substance of all sorts of injuries it is not robbery only enslavement only insult only homicide only—it is robbery enslavement insult homicide all in one the statesman who contributes to put justice out of reach the financier who comes into the house with a lawtax in his hand is an accessary after the fact to every crime every villain may hail him brother every malefactor may boast of him as an accomplice to apply this to intentions would be calumny and extravagance but as far as consequences only are concerned clear of criminal consciousness and bad motives it is incontrovertible and naked truth outlawry is the engine applied by the law as an instrument of compulsion to those who fly from civil justice outlawry is the engine employed as an instrument of punishment against the most atrocious of malefactors this selfsame load of mischief the financier with perfect heedlessness but with unerring certainty heaps on the head of unsuspected innocence besides outlawry which in the cases where the offender could not otherwise be affected comes in as subsidiary in lieu of other punishment there are certain offences for which a man is subjected expressly and in the first instance to a similar punishment under the name of forfeiture of the protection of the law the same fate attends a man thus at different periods according to his merits if guilty it lays hold of him after conviction for a particular cause and without excluding the hope of pardon if innocent and poor and injured before conviction and without conviction and for no cause at all and as long as he continues poor that is as long as he lives what a contrast what inconsistency the judge and the legislator deliberating with all gravity each in his separate sphere whether to inflict or not this heavy punishment on this or that guilty individual or narrow description of guilty individuals the legislator on the other hand merely to get a little money which he could better get from any other source whatever heaping the same doom upon thousands not to say millions of innocent and injured subjects without consideration or remorse mark well that of all sorts of men it is the poor and they the more certainly in proportion to their poverty that are despoiled in this way of the protection of the law the protection of the law that inestimable jewel which in the language of that very law is defined the citizens universal and best birthright the poor and him that has none to help him these are they to whom the help of the law is thus unfeelingly refused the rich were it from them that this great safeguard were withholden have shields of their own to     ward off the attacks of injury the natural influence of wealth the influence of situation the power of connexion the advantages of education and intelligence which go hand in hand with wealth the poor has but one stronghold the protection of the law and out of this the financier drives him without vouchsafing him a thought in company with the herd of malefactors the poor on account of the ignorance and intellectual incapacity inseparably attached to poverty are debarred generally—as perhaps it is necessary were it only for their own sake they should be universally—from the sweets of political power but are not so many unavoidable inequalities enough without being added to by unnecessary injustice such is the description of those from whom this sum total of all rights is torn away with one hand while tendered with the other what are their numbers in proportion to the sum total of subjects i fear to say—perhaps twothirds perhaps fourfifths perhaps ninetenths but at the lowest computation a vast majority a third description of persons may yet be distinguished whose condition under the system of lawtaxes is still more deplorable than that of either of the other two i mean those who having wherewithal to pay the imposition at the commencement of the suit and during more or less of its progress see their substance swallowed up by the taxes before the termination of it the two preceding modifications of abuse either of them bad enough are thus put together and compounded into a third considered with a view to the treatment given to persons of this description a court of justice is converted into exactly the same sort of place as the shop of a baker would be who having ranged his loaves along his window in goodly show to invite customers should instead of selling them the bread they asked for first rob them of their money and then turn them out of doors to an unprejudiced imagination the alliance between justice and finance presents on this occasion a picture almost too near the truth to be termed an apologue at the door of a house more predatory than any of those that are called houses of ill fame the judge in his robes presenting to unsuspecting passengers a belt to prick in the lord high treasurer in the back ground with his staff lying in wait ready as soon as the victims are fairly housed and the money on the table to knock them down and run away with it the difference is that any man may choose whether he will prick in the belt of the unlicensed sharper nor are any but the rawest louts to be so deluded whereas the wisest men may be inveigled in as well as the stoutest dragged in by the exalted and commissioned plunderers—so much surer is their game for were the list of lawtaxes ever so familiar and ever so easy to be understood it is impossible for a man to know beforehand whether he has wherewithal to pay the bill because it is impossible for him to know what incidents may intervene to lengthen it were a man even to sit down and form a resolution to submit to every injury which he could not afford to prosecute for and to plead guilty to every accusation which he could not afford to defend himself against even at this price he could not save himself from the hardship of paying for justice aggravated by the still greater hardship of not getting it if in all cases the practice is wicked in some it is more particularly preposterous in civil causes and other causes where the injury to individuals affords a natural interest to prosecute artificial expenses are cruelty and breach of faith in a large class of penal causes in which for want of such natural interest prosecutors must be engaged by factitious inducements or the law be a dead letter the cruelty and treachery are crowned by blunder and inconsistency beckoned into court with one hand men are driven away with the other but costly as the attractive power frequently is the repulsive force is apt to be much stronger reward is subsequent distant uncertain and dependent upon success trouble expense and odium are certain and precedent†     in favour of this species of imposition i have seen two arguments produced one is that in this case as in others the burthen of an establishment ought to lie on those by whom the benefit is reaped the principle is incontrovertible the matter of fact supposed by the application of it is not true the argument were it just would not extend beyond so much of the produce of the tax as is requisite for defraying the charge of this part of the national establishment whether it be confined or no within these bounds was perhaps never thought worth inquiring into in any country where this tax was imposed it certainly extends much beyond them in england and it seems to be resorted to from time to time with as little scruple as an extension of the customs or excise but let this pass as to the notion of a connexity in this case betwixt the benefit and the burthen it has been countenanced by an authority too respectable not to deserve the most serious notice but come it from whom it will it is a mere illusion the persons on whom the whole of the burthen is cast are precisely those who have the least enjoyment of the benefit the security which other people enjoy for nothing without interruption and every moment of their lives they who are so unfortunate as to be obliged to go to law for it are forced to purchase at an expense of time and trouble in addition to what pecuniary expense may be naturally unavoidable meantime which is of most value—which most worth paying for—a possession thus cruelly disturbed or the same possession free from all disturbance so far then from being made thus wantonly to pay an extra price a man who stands in this unfortunate predicament ought rather to receive an indemnification at the public expense for his time and trouble and the danger of insidious or collusive contests in the view of obtaining such an indemnity is the only objection i can see though perhaps a conclusive one against the granting it litigation may in this point of view be compared to war in sober sadness as war has been to litigation in the way of pleasantry the suitor is the forlorn hope in this forensic warfare to throw upon the suitor the expense of administering justice in addition to the trouble and the risk of suing for it is as if in case of an invasion you were to take the inhabitants of the frontier and force them not only to serve for nothing but to defray of themselves the whole expenditure of the war what in our times is become inveterate practice is stigmatized as a species of iniquity without a precedent by saint paul who is there demands the apostle who is there that ever goes to war at his own charge—alas cries the poor suitor i do the other argument in favour of a set of taxes of this kind is that they are a check to litigation litigation is a term not altogether free from ambiguity it is used sometimes in a neutral sense to denote the prosecuting or defending a suit though perhaps more frequently in a bad one in its neutral sense it expresses the irreproachable exercise of an essential right in a bad sense a species of misconduct practised under the notion of exercising such a right in the first sense taxes can never have been recommended by any man as a check to litigation in this sense an avowed desire of checking litigation would be neither more nor less than an avowed desire of denying justice in a bad sense again the word is used on two different occasions where the suit whatever be the importance of the matter in dispute is on the part of the person spoken of as maintaining it a groundless one and where the suit however wellgrounded on his part in point of title is on account of the supposed unimportance of the matter in dispute deemed a frivolous a trifling a trivial one and in either case it is of course applicable to the situation of either plaintiff or defendant though it is apt to fix in the first instance and most readily upon the situation of the plaintiff as being the party who by taking the first step on the commencement of the suit exhibits himself as the author of it on either side litigation when groundless may be accompanied or not with what the lawyers call in genere malitia meaning consciousness of misdoing and in this particular case mala fides consciousness of the groundlessness of the action or defence—consciousness of the want of merits     where merits are wanting but there exists no consciousness of the want taxes on lawproceedings do it must be confessed operate as a check to litigation and that as well on the side where it is groundless as on that where it is wellgrounded and in the same degree indeed as both of two contending parties cannot in point of law be actually in the right though either or both may think themselves so the impediment cannot operate to the denial of justice but it must operate to the prevention of groundless litigation at the same time prevent him who is in the right from instituting a suit you prevent him who is in the wrong from defending one but neither is litigation prevented any further than as justice is denied so far then as this case extends it is still but the other side of the same effect the denial of justice have they then any peculiar tendency to operate as a check to litigation when it is not only groundless but accompanied with a consciousness of its being so—to malicious or as it might with more propriety be termed anticonscientious litigation on the contrary their direct tendency and sure effect is to promote it they produce it on the part of the plaintiff—were proceedings at law attended with no expense nor other inconvenience till the suit were heard and at an end a plaintiff who had no merits could do a defendant man no harm by suing him he could give him no motive for submitting to an unfounded claim malice would have no weapons oppression would have no instrument when proceedings are attended with expense the heavier that expense the greater of course is the mischief which a man who has no merits is enabled to do the sharper the weapon thus put into the hand of malice the more coercive the instrument put into the hand of the oppressor they produce it on the part of the defendant were proceedings at law attended with no expense a defendant who knew he had no merits a defendant who was conscious that the demand upon him was a just one would be deprived of what is in some cases his best chance for eluding justice in others the absolute certainty of so doing he would lose the strongest incentive he has to make the attempt a defendant who means not to do justice unless compelled and who knows that the plaintiff cannot compel him without having advanced a certain sum such a defendant if he thinks his adversary cannot raise that sum will persevere in refusal till a suit is commenced and in litigation afterwards whether they make the litigation or whether they find it ready made they show most favour to the side on which anticonscientious litigation is most likely to be found by attaching on the commencement of the suit they bear hardest upon the plaintiff or him who if they would have suffered him would have become plaintiff in so doing they favour in the same degree the defendant or him who if the party conceiving himself injured could have got a hearing would have been called upon to defend himself but it is on the defendants side that anticonscientious practice is most likely to be found setting expense out of the question an evil of which these laws are thus far the sole cause—setting out of the question the imperfections of the judicial system and the hope of seeing evidence perish or the guilty view of fabricating it a man will find no motive for instituting a suit for an ordinary pecuniary demand without believing himself to be in the right for if he is in the wrong disappointment waste of time fruitless trouble and so much expense as is naturally unavoidable are by the supposition what he knows must be his fate whereas on the other hand a man upon whom a demand of that kind is made may although he knows himself to be in the wrong find inducement enough to stand a suit from a thousand other considerations from the hope of a deficiency in point of evidence on the part of the plaintiff not to mention as before the rare and criminal enterprise of fabricating evidence on his own part—from the hope of tiring the plaintiff out or taking advantage of casual incidents such as the death of witnesses or parties—from the temporary difficulty or inconvenience of satisfying the demand or to conclude with the case which the weakness of human nature renders by far the most frequent from the mere unwillingness to satisfy it in a word they give a partial advantage to conscious guilt on whichever side it is found and that advantage is most partial to the defendants side on which side consciousness of guilt as we see is most likely to be found better says a law maxim subscribed to by everybody better that ten criminals should escape than one innocent person should suffer and this in case even of the deepest guilt for ten some read a hundred some a thousand whichever reading be the best an expedient of procedure the effect of which were to cause ten innocent persons to suffer for every ten guilty ones would be acknowledged to be no very eligible ingredient in the system what shall we say of an institution which for one culpable person whom it causes to suffer involves in equal suffering perhaps ten blameless ones thus much for groundless suits there remains the plea of its tendency to check what are deemed trivial suits i know what a groundless suit means—i know of no such thing as a frivolous one no wrong that i know of can be a trivial one which to him to whom it is done appears     a serious one serious to such a degree as to make it worth his while to demand redress at the hand of justice conduct is the test of feeling i know of no right i have to set up any feelings of my own as the standard of those of my neighbour in contradiction to a declaration of his the truth of which is evidenced by his own conduct what to one man again is trivial to another man may be of high importance in the account of wrong too must be included not only the individual wrong taken by itself but its effects in the way of encouragement to repetition and its effects in the way of example i know of no wrong so slight that by multiplication may not become intolerable give me but a licence to do to any person at pleasure the minutest wrong conceivable—i need no more that person is my slave allow me to rob him though it be but of a farthing farthing by farthing i will find the bottom of his purse allow me but to let fall a drop of water upon his head—gutta cavat lapidem the power of striking his head off would be less susceptible of abuse in pecuniary cases the smaller the sum in dispute the less reserve is used in branding the conduct of the parties with the charge of litigation of which in such cases the reproach is apt to fall principally if not exclusively to the plaintiffs share but the importance of the sum is altogether governed by the circumstances of the parties the amount of it in pounds shillings and pence shows nothing one mans income may be a hundred a thousand four thousand times as great as that of another in england there are men whose income exceeds £ 0000 ayear fifteen pounds ayear is as much as falls to the lot of perhaps the greater number of the whole body of the people without a particular caution a legislator or a judge will naturally enough like any other man take the relation of the sum in dispute to his own feelings that is its ratio to his own circumstances for the measure of importance but by this standard he will be sure to be deceived as often as the circumstances of the parties or either of them are materially different from his own fifty pound for example will be apt to appear in his eyes an object of considerable importance an object of which a tenth or a twentieth part or less might be of importance sufficient to justify from the charge of litigation the maintenance of a suit a shilling would be almost sure to appear to him an object altogether trifling an object by no means of magnitude enough to warrant the maintenance of a suit fifty pound is however a sum of less importance to a duke of marlborough or bedford than a single shilling viz than a thousandth part of £ 0 to many a man in truth to probably the majority of men in the kingdom it is therefore more unjust more tyrannical to refuse to hear the demand of an ordinary working man to the amount of a shilling than it would be to refuse to hear the demand of a duke of marlborough or bedford to the amount of £ 0 the legislator who on the plea of checking litigation or on any other plea exacts of a working man as a preliminary to his obtaining justice what that working man is unable to pay does refuse to him a hearing—does in a word refuse him justice and that as effectually and completely as it is possible to refuse it that all men should have equal rights not only would be politically pernicious but is naturally impossible but i hope this will not be said of equal justice trivial causes require no such factitious checks to such causes were all expenses struck off that can be struck off there are natural checks in abundance that are unavoidable there is the pain of disappointment there is expense of which a certain measure will every now and then be absolutely unavoidable there is consumption of time which to the working classes that is to the great majority of the people is expense but even let the cause be trivial and that to such a degree as to render the act of commencing the litigation blameable the blame is never so great on the side of the party most favoured by the tax as on the side of the party most oppressed by it the party most oppressed is the complainant—the party who having suffered the injury such as it is claims or would claim satisfaction for it at the hands of justice but so as there does but exist the smallest particle of an injury the party who claims satisfaction for it can never be so much in the wrong for doing so but that he who refuses satisfaction must be still more so if the demand he just why did not he comply with it if just but trifling why does he contest it in this case then you cannot punish in this way the misconduct of one party without rewarding the still greater misconduct of the other if the tax applies a check where there is blame it affords protection and encouragement where there is still greater blame another injustice—the poorer a man is the more exposed he is to the oppression of which this supposed remedy against litigation is the instrument but the poorer a man is the less likely he is to be litigious the less time a man has to spare and the less a man can afford to expend his time not to speak of money without being paid for it the less likely is he to expose himself to such a consumption of his time the rich man the man who has time and money at command he surely if any is the man to consume it litigiously and frivolously no wonder however if to a superficial glance the poor should appear more litigious than he     there are more of the poor than of the rich and to the eye of unreflecting opulence the causes of the poor are all trivial ones we think of the poor in the way of charity for to deal out charity gratifies not only benevolence but pride we think much of them in the way of charity but we think little of them in the way of justice justice however ranks before charity and they would need less charity if they had more justice what contributes more than anything to the indignation excited by suits that are deemed trivial and on account of the triviality vexatious is the excessive ratio of the expense of the suit to the value of the matter in dispute especially when the matter in dispute being pecuniary its minuteness is more conspicuous and defined but to what is this expensiveness owing as far at least as these taxes are in question to the legislator himself mark then the iniquity—he is himself the author of the wrong and he punishes for it the innocent and the injured to exclude the poor from justice was not enough—they must be excluded also from mercy forty shillings is the tax imposed on pardons by a statute of king william      w  m c    §   forty shillings more by another not five years afterwards     0 w iii c    §    0 together £ —half a years income of a british subject according to davenants computation above quoted what is called mercy let it be remembered is in many cases no more than justice in all cases where the ground of pardon is the persuasion of innocence entertained either notwithstanding the verdict or in consequence of evidence brought to light after the verdict all punishments are accordingly irremissible to him who has not to the amount of half a years income in store or credit—all fines to that amount or under absolutely irremissible† taxes on lawproceedings so far then from being a check to litigation are an encouragement to it—an encouragement to it in every sense in which it is mischievous and blameable would you really check litigation and check it on both sides—the simple course would be a sure one when men are in earnest about preventing misconduct in any line they annex punishment to misconduct in that line and to that only a species of misconduct which cannot be practised but as it were under the eye of the court is of all others the easiest to cope with in the way of law deal with misconduct that displays itself under the eye of the court as you deal by delinquency at large and you may be sure of succeeding to a still superior degree discriminate misconduct then from innocence lay the burthen on misconduct and misconduct only leaving innocence unoppressed keep back punishment till guilt is ascertained keep back costs as much as possible till the last stage of procedure keep off from both parties everything of expense that is not absolutely unavoidable where litigation is on both sides without blame at that last stage if there be found blame throw whatever expense of which you allow the necessity to subsist beyond what is absolutely unavoidable—throw it on that side and on that side only where there has been blame if on both then if circumstances require punish it on both sides by fine for instance to the profit of the public litigation though eventually it prove groundless—litigation like any other course of conduct of which mischief is the result is not therefore blameable and where it is blameable there is a wide difference whether it is accompanied with temerity only or with consciousness of its own injustice the countenance shown to the parties by the law ought to be governed and governed uniformly and proportionally by these important differences—so much in point of utility—how stands establishment—taxes heaped on in all stages from the first to the last without distinction—all costs given or no costs no medium—costs scarce ever complete and nothing beyond costs no mitigation or enhancement in consideration of pecuniary circumstances no shades of punishment in this way correspondent to shades of blame—in most cases no difference so much as between consciousness of injustice and simple temerity nor so much as betwixt either and innocence the power of adjudging as between costs and no costs seldom discretionary—that of apportioning never—nor that of fining beyond the amount of costs—consequently nor that of punishing both parties where both have been to blame were a power to be given by statute to impose on a litigious suitor convicted of litigation a fine to an amount not exceeding what the losing party pays now whether he be blameable or blameless it would be cried out against perhaps as a great power too great to be given to judges without juries‡   0 justice shall be denied to no man justice shall be sold to no man says the first of statutes magna charta how is it under these later ones—denied as we have seen to ninetenths of the people sold to the other tenth at an unconscionable price it was a conceit among the old lawyers reported if not adopted by lord coke that a statute made contrary to magna charta though made in all the forms would be a void law god forbid that by all the lawyers in the world or for the purpose of any argument i should ever suffer myself to be betrayed into any such extravagance in a subject it would be sedition in a judge it would be usurpation in anybody it would be nonsense but after all it must be acknowledged to be in some degree unfortunate as well as altogether singular that of an instrument deemed the foundation of all liberty and magnified as such even still to a degree of fanaticism a passage by far the most important and almost the only one that has any application nowadays should be thus habitually trodden under foot without remorse or reclamation a tax so impolitic and so grievous—a tax thus demonstrated to be the worst of taxes how comes it ever to have been made choice of and when made choice of acquiesced in these are not questions of mere curiosity for acquiescence under a tax and that so general forms at first glance no inconsiderable presumption in its favour a presumption it does form but when demonstration has shown itself presumptions are at an end how comes the tax to have been made choice of one cause we have seen already in another shape the unscrutinized notion of its supposed tendency to check litigation litigation which where it stands for mischief is the very mischief which the species of tax in question contributes with all its power to promote another cause may possibly be the tendency which this sort of tax has to be confounded in the eye of an incurious observer with other sorts which are either the best of all or next to the best the best of all are taxes on consumption because not only do they fall nowhere without finding some ability to pay them but where necessaries are out of the question they fall on nobody who has not the option of not paying them if he does not choose it taxes on property and those on transfer of property such as those on contracts relative to property are the next best because though they are not optional like the former they may be so selected as never to call for money but where there is ability nay even ample ability to pay them now of these two most supportable classes of taxes the second are all of them levied by means of stamps taxes on consumption too in many instances such as those on cards dice gloves and perfumery show to the eye as stampduties but all these are very good taxes stampduties therefore are good taxes and taxes on justice are all stampduties thinking men look to consequences they look to the feelings of the individuals affected acting men look to the stamp taxes on justice taxes on property taxes on consumption are accordingly one and the same object to the optics of finance stampduties too have another most convenient property they execute themselves and lawtaxes beyond all others in short they exclude all smuggling† they heap distress indeed upon distress but the distress is not worth minding as there is no escaping it but the great cause of all is the prospect     of acquiescence—a prospect first presented by hope since realized over and over again by experience it is too much to expect of a man of finance that he should anticipate the feelings of unknown individuals it is a great deal if he will listen to their cries taxes on consumption fall on bodies of men the most inconsiderable one when touched will make the whole country ring again the oppressed and ruined objects of the taxes on justice weep in holes and corners as rats die no one voice finds any other to join with it a tax on shops a tax on tobacco falls upon a man if at all immediately and presses on him constantly—every man knows whether he keeps or means to keep a shop—whether he means to sell or to use tobacco a tax on justice falls upon a man only occasionally it is like a thunderstroke which a man never looks for till he is destroyed by it he does not know when it will fall on him or whether it ever will nor even whether when it does fall it will press upon him most or upon his adversary he knows not what it will amount to he has no data from which to calculate it it comes lumped to him in the general mass of law charges a heap of items among which no vulgar eye can ever hope to discriminate an object on which investigation would be thrown away as comprehension is impossible calamities that are not to be averted by thought are little thought of and it is best not to think of them when is the time for complaint before the thunderbolt is fallen it would be too soon—when fallen it is too late shopkeepers tobacconists glovers are compact bodies—they can arm counsel—they come in force to the house of commons suitors for justice have no common cause and scarce a common name—they are everybody and nobody—their business being everybodys is nobodys who are suitors where are they what does a chancellor of the exchequer care for them what can they do to help him what can they do to hurt him so far from having a common interest they have a repugnant interest to crush the injured is to befriend the injurer may not ignorance with regard to the quantum and the source of the grievance have contributed something to patience unable to pierce the veil of darkness that guards from vulgar eyes the avenues of justice men know not how much of the difficulty of the approach is to be ascribed to art and how much to nature as the consumers of tobacco confound the tax on that commodity with the price so those who borrow or would have wished to borrow the hand of justice confound the artificial with the natural expense of hiring it but if the whole of the grievance be natural it may be all inevitable and incurable and at any rate it may be no more the fault of lawyers or lawmakers than gout and stone are of physicians happy ignorance if blindness to the cause of a malady could blunt the pain of it there want not apologistsgeneral and talkers in the air to prove to us that this as well as everything else is as it should be the expense the delay and all the other grievances which activity has heaped up or negligence suffered to accumulate are the prices which according to montesquieu we must be content to pay for liberty and justice a penny is the price men pay for a peeny loaf therefore why not twopence and if threepence there would be no harm done since the loaf would be worth so much the more may not a sort of instinctive fellowfeeling among the wealthy have contributed something if not to the imposition at least to the acquiescence it is the wealthy alone that either by fortune situation education intelligence or influence are qualified to take the lead in legislation and the characteristic property of this tax is to be favourable to the wealthy and that in proportion to their wealth other taxes afford a man no indemnification for the wealth they take from him this gives him power in exchange the power of keeping down those who are to be kept down the power of doing wrong and the more generous pride of abstaining from the wrong which it is in our power to do advantages such as these are too precious not to be grasped at with avidity by human weakness and as in a country of political liberty and under a system of justice in other respects impartial they can only be obtained by a blind and indirect route such as this the inconvenience of travelling in it finds on the part of those who are well equipped for it the more patient an acquiescence will it be said that abolishing the taxes on justice would not answer the purpose for that supposing them all abolished justice would still remain inaccessible to the body of the people—this would be to justify one abuse by another the other obstacles by which the avenues to justice have been blocked up constitute a separate head of abuse from which i gladly turn aside as being foreign to the present purpose take off law taxes altogether the number of those to whom justice will still remain inaccessible would still it must be confessed be but too great it would however not be so great as it is at present under the pressure of those taxes though you could not tell exactly to how many you would open the doors of justice you might be sure you opened them to some though you would still leave the burthen but too heavy you would at any rate make it proportionably more supportable     if by taking off these taxes you reduced the expense of a common action from £   to £ 0 you might open the door suppose to one in five of those against whom it is shut at present even this would be something at any rate whatever were the remaining quantum of abuse which you still suffered to subsist you would have the consolation at least of not being actively instrumental in producing it to reform in toto a system of procedure is a work of time and difficulty and would require a rare union of legal knowledge with genius—repealing a tax may require discernment candour philanthropy and fortitude—but it is a work of no difficulty requires no extraordinary measure of science nor even so much time as the imposing of one but by whatever plea the continuance of the subsisting taxes of this kind may be apologized for nothing can be said in favour of any new addition to the burthen the subsisting ones it may be said have been acquiesced in and men are used to them in this respect at least they have the advantage of any new ones which could be substituted in the room of them but even this immoral plea which puts bad and good upon a level effacing all distinction but that between established and not established even this faint plea is mute against any augmentation of this worst of evils to conclude either i am much mistaken or it has been proved—that a law tax is the worst of all taxes actual or possible—that for the most part it is a denial of justice that at the best it is a tax upon distress—that it lays the burthen not where there is most but where there is least benefit—that it cooperates with every injury and with every crime—that the persons on whom it bears hardest are those on whom a burthen of any kind lies heaviest and that they compose the great majority of the people—that so far from being a check it is an encouragement to litigation and that it operates in direct breach of magna charta that venerable monument commonly regarded as the foundation of english liberty the statesman who cares not what mischief he does so he does it without disturbance may lay on lawtaxes without end he who makes it a matter of conscience to abstain from mischief will abstain from adding to them he whose ambition it is to extirpate mischief will repeal them general error makes law says a maxim in use among lawyers it makes at any rate an apology for law but when the error is pointed out the apology is gone notes mem—anno      at a dinner at mr morton pitts in arlington street mr rose then secretary of the treasury in the presence of mr william pitt then minister took me aside and told me that they had read my pamphlet on lawtaxes that the reasons against them were unanswerable and it was determined there should be no more of them anno   0  july  0         —this being in the number of mr addingtons taxes mr pitt upon returning to office took up all those taxes in the lump on the above days this tax was opposed in the house of commons and mr wyndham according to the report in the times on one of those days spoke of this pamphlet as containing complete information on the subject observing at the same time that it was out of print on behalf of administration nothing like an answer to any of the objections was attempted only the attorneygeneral percival said that the addition proposed to those taxes was no more than equal to the depreciation of money mr addington before this had recourse to the tax on medicine here spoken of page     so that in the course of his short administration if the representation here given be correct he had had the misfortune to find out and impose the two worst species of taxation possible compare this with denmark and its courts of natural procedure called reconciliation courts   th february     —unalleviated by any adequate hope of use too painful would be the task of hunting out and holding up to view the subsequent additions which this worst of oppressions has in this interval of twenty years been receiving money it is said must be had and no other taxes can be found the justification being conclusive the tax receives its increase next year from the same hand flow others in abundance grievous enough is the incometax called lest it should be thought to be what it is the propertytax grievous that tax is whatever be its name yet sum for sum compared with this tax it is a blessing instead of  0 per cent suppose it  0 per cent less bad would it be to add yet another  0 per cent than a tax to an equal amount upon justice grievous have been the additions so lately and repeatedly made to the taxes on conveyances and agreements extensive the prohibitory part of the effect though the pressure     confined as usual to the poor i e the great majority of the community who have none to speak for them is scarcely complained of by the rich yet were all lawtaxes taken off and the amount thrown upon conveyances and agreements this—even this—would in reality be an indulgence whether the oppression be more or less grievous is never worth a thought will it be submitted to—this is the only question charity is kicked out of doors hope is fled—faith and piety remain and atone for everything for a list of about twentyeight other sources of factitious delay vexation and expense and thence of denial of justice produced by the judges of former times for the augmentation of iawyers profit their own included—together with a list and summary account of the devices by which these burthens have been imposed and by which technical stands distinguished from natural procedure—see by the same author scotch reform c printed for ridgway piccadilly vol v addition by a learned friend in the court of chancery two cases have recently occurred which may serve as an illustration of the extent in which the taxes upon lawproceedings may operate as a denial of justice in one case roe v gudgeon the defendant in his answer to the plaintiffs bill submitted that he ought not to be compelled to set out certain accounts which had been required by the bill as the expense of taking what is called an office copy of them—a necessary preliminary to any further proceeding on the part of the plaintiff in the cause—would amount to the sum of £  000 an expense almost wholly arising from the stamps on the paper on which the office copy of the answer is compulsorily made in this case the court determined that it was not necessary these accounts should be set out but in coming to this conclusion how far the court was determined by the nature of the particular case or by the magnitude of the expense that would thus be occasioned—or whether if without any such objection the defendant had actually set out these accounts the plaintiff could have been relieved from pursuing the regular mode of procuring a copy of them and thus incurring the above expense—or whether if the expense had been instead of £  000 only    or    thousand pounds such an objection would have been listened to—it is extremely difficult to say the other case alluded to is one in which from peculiar circumstances it is not thought proper to mention the names of the parties it is optional with a man to be a plaintiff in a cause—it is not altogether so optional with him to be a defendant the preceding case shows that it is not always safe for a man to become a plaintiff without £  000 at least in his pocket to begin with over and above what is necessary for his maintenance—the following case shows that a man may not be always able to resist a demand however unjust it may be without being able to support an outlay of at least £ 00 in the case in question the writer of this has been assured—and from authority which he has peculiar reason for relying upon—that the expense of merely putting in an answer by one of the defendants to a bill in equity amounted to the above sum of £ 00 what part of this expense was occasioned by the tax on lawproceedings cannot be accurately ascertained but it assuredly constituted a very considerable proportion of that sum         supply without burden or escheat vice taxation being a proposal for a saving of taxes by an extension of the law of escheat including strictures on the taxes on collateral succession comprised in the budget of  th december      printed in      and first published      preface of the two essays laid before the public that which presents a new resource was submitted to the proper authority in the month of september      but was not fortunate enough to be deemed worth further notice the arguments which it contains will speak for themselves none were controverted nor any hinted at on the other side only as a matter of fact it was observed that it had not been customary of late for the crown to avail itself of the branch of prerogative here proposed to be cultivated for the public use nobody can suppose that the minister would not gladly have availed himself of this as of any other source of supply had it promised in his conception to conciliate the voice of the public in its favour nobody can suppose that if the apprehensions that occurred in prospect should ever be dispelled by the event the sense of the public would find him backward in conforming to it it is natural that the difficulties attending a measure of considerable novelty and magnitude should strike with a force proportioned to the responsibility of the situation to which the measure is presented it is natural that they should strike with less than their proper force on the imagination of him in whose conception it received its birth the idea had been honoured with the approbation of several gentlemen of eminence at the bar some of them in parliament as many as had had the paper in their hands if they were right in their wishes in its favour it by no means follows but those to whom it was submitted in their official capacities did otherwise than right in declining to make use of it of all the qualifications required at the board to which it was presented one of the most indispensable is the science of the times a science which though its title to the name of science were to be disputed would not the less be acknowledged to be in the situation in question fairly worth the seven for that masterscience none can have higher pretensions than the illustrious chief of that department none less than the author of these pages neither his expectations nor so much as his wishes in relation to this proposal had extended so far as to its immediate adoption it now lies with the public who in due time will grant or refuse it their passport to the treasury and to parliament according to its deserts the protest against lawtaxes had better fortune it received from the candour of the minister on whose plans it hazarded a comment all the attention that candour could bestow and if i do not misrecollect the taxes complained against did not afterwards appear the publication of it in this country was kept back till the proposal for a substitute to the tax complained of should be brought into shape upon the principle of the parliamentary notion which forbids the producing an objection to a tax without a proposal for a better on the back of it the two essays seemed no unsuitable accompaniments to each other mutual light promised to be reflected by the contrast between the best of all possible resources and the worst section i general idea in a former essay i pointed out the species of tax which if the reasoning there given be just is the worst of all taxes existing or possible     the object of the present essay is to point out that mode of supply which for one of so great a magnitude will i flatter myself appear to be absolutely the best what is that mode of supply of which the twentieth part is a tax and that a heavy one while the whole would be no tax and would not be felt by anybody the question has the air of a riddle but the proposition it involves paradoxical as it may appear is not more strikingly paradoxical than strictly true the answer is an extension of the existing law of escheat—a law coeval with the very first elements of the constitution to which i would add as an aid to its operation a correspondent limitation not an extension of the power of bequest of the extended law of escheat according to the degree of extension here proposed the effect would be the appropriating to the use of the public all vacant successions property of every denomination included on the failure of near relations will or no will subject only to the power of bequest as hereinafter limited by near relations i mean for the purpose of the present proposal such relations as stand within the degrees termed prohibited with reference to marriage as a farther aid to the operation of the law i would propose in the instance of such relations within the pale as are not only childless but without prospect of children†—whatever share they would take under the existing law that instead of taking that share in ready money they should take only the interest of it in the shape of an annuity for life it would be a farther help to the operation of the measure and if confined to the cases where from the nature of the relationship the survivor is not likely to have grounded his plans of life upon the expectation of the succession or otherwise to have placed any determinate dependence on it may scarcely if at all be felt if in such instances although the relationship be within the pale the public were to come in for a share in the succession suppose an equal share though not the whole this may be applied to the case of the uncle and aunt—to the case of the grandfather and grandmother—and perhaps unless under particular circumstances to the case of the nephew and niece with regard to family settlements the persons whose benefit they have in view will be found provided for with few or perhaps no exceptions by the reservations made in this plan in favour of relations within the pale to make provision for the cases where in virtue of an old settlement an estate might devolve to a relation without the pale i would propose to add a proviso that whereever the deceased had he been of full age could by his single act have cut off the entail it shall be as if he had actually done so for the purpose of excluding the distant relative this in the instance of settlements already existing as to future ones there will be still less difficulty about confining their operation within the range meant to be allowed them by the spirit of the proposed law regard to the principles of the constitution not less than to the probability of carrying the measure through the upper house would at the sametime incline me to exempt the peerage from its operation wherever the effect would be to deprive the title of any property which under the existing law would go to the support of it as to the latitude to be left to the power of bequest i should propose it to be continued in respect of the half of whatever property would be at present subject to that power the wills of persons in whose succession no interest is hereby given to the public to be observed in all points as at present as likewise those in whose succession an interest is given to the public saving as to the amount of that interest—the plan consequently not trenching in any degree upon the rights of parents‡     to give the plan its due effect it will be seen to be indispensably necessary in the first place that the whole property in which the public shall thus have acquired an interest shall whatever it consists of be converted into readymoney property in the funds alone excepted from which the public cannot reap so great a benefit in any other way than by the sinking of so much of its debt in the first instance in the next place that to prevent collusive undervaluation and the suspicion of it the conversion shall in every instance be performed in the way of public auction as to the reasons for such conversion they are tolerably apparent on the face of the proposition and they will be detailed in their proper place what will also be seen to be necessary is that wherever the public has any interest at all in any succession under the proposed law the officer of the public i e the officer of the crown shall enter into the possession and management of the whole in the first instance in the same manner as assignees of bankrupts do in respect of the whole property real and personal together or administrators or executors do in respect of the personalty not to mention the real in some cases as where by a clause in the will it is ordered to be sold of the several extensions above proposed it may be observed that though they operate all of them to the augmentation of the produce and in so far at least to the utility of the measure yet are they not any of them so indispensably necessary to its adoption but that they may be struck out or modified or even added to by further extensions and the principle of the plan still adopted—the essence of it still preserved it may be a satisfaction to see at this early stage of the inquiry the principles by which the extent that may with propriety be given to this resource appears to be marked out and limited the propositions i would propose in that view are as follows— i whatever power an individual is according to the received notions of propriety understood to possess in this behalf with respect to the disposal of his fortune in the way of bequest—in other words whatever degree of power he may exercise without being thought to have dealt hardly by those on whom what he disposes of would otherwise have devolved—that same degree of power the law may for the benefit of the public exercise once for all without being conceived to have dealt hardly by anybody—without being conceived to have hurt anybody—and consequently without scruple and even though the money so raised would not otherwise have been to be raised in the way of taxes ii any further power which could be exercised in this way to the profit of the public purse and of which the exercise though not altogether clear of the imputation of producing a sense of hardship would at the same time be productive of less hardship than the lightest tax that could be substituted in the soom of it ought if the public mind can be sufficiently reconciled to it to be exercised in preference to the establishment of any tax iii a power thus exercised in favour of the public purse would go beyond the latitude given by the first rule and would accordingly be productive of a sense of hardship in as far as it went the length of producing in any degree any of the following effects viz   if it extended to the prejudice of the jointpossession customarily enjoyed by a mans natural and necessary dependents such as children and those who stand in the place of children   if it went to the bereaving a man of the faculty of continuing after his death any support he had been in the habit of affording to relatives of any other description whose claims to and dependence on such support     are by reason of the nearness of the relationship too strongly rooted in nature and opinion to be capable of being dissolved by the dispensations of law   if by putting it out of the power of a relation of parental age to receive at the death of a relation of inferior age an adequate indemnification for requisite assistance given in the way of nurture it threatened by lessening the inducements to lessen the prevalence of so useful a branch of natural benevolence   if it went to the bereaving a man of the faculty of affording an adequate reward for meritorious service of whatsoever nature and by whomsoever rendered lessening thereby the general disposition among men to the rendering of such service   the effect of such an extension of the proposed power would be purely mischievous if what were gained thereby on one hand by the augmentation of the share taken into the hands of government at the expense of the power of bequest were to be lost on the other hand by a proportionable diminution effected in the whole mass of property in the country in consequence of the diminution of the inducements to accumulate and lay up property instead of spending it   the public mind must in this instance as in every other be at any rate treated with due deference in this instance as in every other a law however good in itself—however good on the supposition of acquiescence—may become bad in any degree by unpopularity by running too suddenly and directly against opinions and affections that have got possession of mankind thus much for the rules that may serve for our guidance in adjusting the extent that may be given to this resource they may be trusted it should seem for the present at least to the strength of their own selfevidence the application of them to practice the application of them to the several modes and degrees of relationship and to the several situations and exigencies of families is matter of detail that will meet us in its proper place section ii order of the details in continuing the thread of this proposal the following is the course i propose to take—   to give a brief view of the advantages or beneficial properties that appear to recommend the measure to the adoption of government   to show how distinct it is in reality from all taxes on collateral successions which have ever been established or proposed and how much the distinction is to its advantage   to exhibit the best idea i am capable of giving of the probable amount of the produce that may be expected from it   i shall add a few observations relative to the most eligible application to be made of that produce descending further into detail   i shall give a more particular view of such regulations as may seem proper to be inserted for the purpose of applying to practice the principles already exhibited   i shall attempt a sketch of an official establishment for the collection of the produce   i shall consider the measure with reference to the cases where the interest of individuals belonging to nations altogether foreign or nations coordinate with or subordinate to the british are concerned   i shall consider it with reference to the cases where the property in question happens to be situated anywhere without the limits of the laws of great britain   i shall attempt a general sketch of a plan for the collection of the produce in the course of which attempt i shall have occasion to advert to the differences that may be suggested by the nature of the property which may come to be collected to the means of guarding against concealments and other frauds to which the property in its several shapes may be exposed on the part of such individuals whose interest or affections may be at variance in this behalf with the interest of the public as also against any such abuses of power and other mismanagements as the servants employed on behalf of the public in this business stand exposed by their respective situations to the temptation of being chargeable with in a sort of appendix which those who may find themselves already satisfied with the principle of the mode of supply may spare themselves the trouble of looking into  0 i shall defend the proposed institution against every objection which my imagination can represent to me as capable of presenting itself†    i shall show that a latitude much beyond what is here proposed to be assumed stands warranted by the opinions of the most respected writers    that it is equally warranted by precedent that is by the disposition of law in     this country from the primitive ages of the constitution down to the present times    lastly in the way of supplement to the refutation of the several imaginable objections to the proposed measure i shall endeavour to give a comprehensive idea of the several effects as well immediate as remote that appear any way likely to result from it considered in every imaginable point of view section iii advantages the advantageous properties of the proposed resource may be stated under the following heads viz—   its unburthensomeness   its tendency to cut off a great source of litigation   its favourableness to marriage   its probable popularity on that score its unburthensomeness which is the great and transcendent advantage is not matter of surmise it is testified by experience it is confirmed as we shall see by the most indisputable principles of human nature—by the fundamental constitution of the human feelings   it is testified by experience on the decease of my uncle who had children before i was born the law gives everything to his children nothing to me what do i suffer from finding myself thus debarred just nothing—no more than at the thoughts of not succeeding to the stranger whose hearse is passing by what more should i suffer if my uncles property instead of going to his children were known beforehand to go to the public in point of personal feeling at least nothing sympathy for my cousins in the case of their being left destitute is a different concern living under the law of england i find myself debarred from a succession in which i should have shared had i lived under the law of spain what do i suffer at hearing this just nothing no more than i suffer at the thoughts of not being king of spain but if the law of england were to be changed in this behalf in conformity to the measure proposed what is now the existing law would be to me no more than the law of spain my father gets an office upon his decease the office goes to the nominee of the king from whom he got it not to me do i regard the successor as an intruder—do i feel his taking possession of the office as a hardship upon me no more than i do his majestys having succeeded to the crown instead of me under the existing law of escheat real property on the absolute failure of all heirs lapses to the crown already is there anything of hardship felt by any body if there were it would be a cruel hardship for it would be felt by every body give to this branch of law the extent proposed confining it always within the bounds above traced out and it will be even then as unburthensome as it is now thus stands the resource in point of unburthensomeness as demonstrated by experience what does so singular a property turn upon upon a most simple and indisputable principle in human nature—the feeling of expectation in the case of acquiring or not acquiring—of retaining or not retaining—no hardship without previous expectation disappointment is expectation thwarted in the distribution of property no sense of hardship but in proportion to disappointment but expectation as far as the law can be kept present to mens minds follows with undeviating obsequiousness the finger of the law why should i suffer bodily distress from want out of the question—why should i suffer if the property i call mine and have been used to regard as mine were to be taken from me for this reason and no other because i expected it to continue with me if the law had predetermined that the property i am now using as mine should at the arrival of the present period cease to be mine and this determination of the law had been known to me before i began to treat it as mine i should no longer have expected to be permitted to treat it as mine the ceasing to possess it the ceasing to treat it as mine would be no disappointment no hardship no loss to me why is it that i do not suffer at the reflection that my neighbour enjoys his own property and not i because i never expected to call it mine in a word in matters of property in general and succession in particular thus then stands the case hardship depends upon disappointment disappointment upon expectation expectation upon the dispensations meaning the known dispensations of the law the riddle begins to solve itself a part taken and a sense of burthen left the whole taken and no such effect produced the effect of a part greater than the effect of a whole the old greek paradox verified a part greater than the whole† suffer a mass of property in which a man has an interest to get into his hands his expectation his imagination his attention   0 at least fastens upon the whole take from him afterwards a part let it be such a part and no other as at the time of his beginning to know that the whole was to come into his hands he knew that he would have to quit still when the time comes for giving it up the parting with it cannot but excite something of the sensation of a loss—a sensation which will of course be more or less pungent according to the tenacity of the individual ah why was not this mine too ah why must i part with it is there no possible means of keeping it well i will keep it as long as i can however and perhaps the chapter of acculents may serve me take from him now i should not say take but keep from him the whole so keeping it from him that there shall never have been a time when he expected to receive it all hardship all suffering is out of the case if he were a sufferer he would be a sufferer indeed he would be a sufferer for every atom of property in the world possessed by anybody else he would be as miserable as the world is wide under a tax on successions a man is led in the first place to look upon the whole in a general view as his own he is then called upon to give up a part his share amounts to so much—this share he is to have only out of it he is to pay so much per cent his imagination thus begins with embracing the whole his expectation fastens upon the whole then comes the law putting in for its part and forcing him to quit his hold this he cannot do without pain if he could no tax at all not even a tax on property would be a burthen neither landtax nor poorsrate could be too high† the utility of that part of the proposal which gives to the public officer possession of the whole whether the public in conclusion is admitted to the whole or only to a part may now be seen in full force it is a provision not more of prudence with a view to the public than of tenderness with a view to the individual had he been suffered to lay his hands upon the whole being afterwards or even at the time called upon to give up a part his attention would unavoidably have grasped the whole the giving up the part would have produced a sensation fainter perhaps but similar to that produced by an unexpected loss on the other hand as according to the proposal he takes nothing that he does not keep no such unpleasant sensation is produced the case where the individual sees a share go from him for the benefit of the public in the way of partition stands in this respect between the case where the public is let into the whole and that where a part is taken from him in the way of a tax whether on this plan of partition the individual shall feel in any degree the sensation of a loss will depend partly upon the mode of carving out the share—partly upon the proportion taken by the law—partly after all upon the temper and disposition of the individual as to the mode of carving the whole secret lies in taking the public officer and not the individual for the carver for the reasons that have been seen as to the proportion—to come back to the paradox the larger the share of the public the better even with reference to his feelings for the larger it is the more plainly it will show as a civil regulation in matters of succession the smaller the more palpably it will have the air of a fiscal imposition—the more it will feel in short like a tax the more is taken under the name of a tax the more burthensome the measure as everybody knows at the same time the more is taken for the public under the name of partition so long as an equal or not much more than equal share is left to the individual the farther the measure from being burthensome because the farther from being considered as a tax the roman tax of five per cent on collateral successions was considered as a heavy burthen a tax of fifty per cent imposed under the name of a tax would have been intolerable at the same time pass instead of the tax a law of inheritance giving the public fifty per cent upon certain successions the burthen may be next to nothing pass a law of inheritance giving the public the whole the burthen vanishes altogether the dominion of the imagination upon the feelings is unbounded the influence of names upon the imagination is well known things are submitted to without observation under one name that would drive men mad under another justice is denied to the great bulk of     the people by lawtaxes and the blind multitude suffer without a murmur were the distribution of justice to be prohibited in name under a penalty to the amount of a tenth part of the tax parliament would be blown into the air or thrown into a madhouse would it be better then upon the whole for the public to take all and let no relation in for a share certainly not in every case the law is powerful here but even here the law is not absolutely omnipotent it can govern expectation absolutely meaning always in as far as it makes itself present to the mind it can govern expectation absolutely but governing expectation is not everything it may prevent me from being disappointed at not having bread to eat but if by preventing my having bread to eat it starves me it will not prevent me from suffering by being starved it can save me in this way from ideal hardship but not from corporal sufferance it can save me from disappointment at not beginning to enjoy but it cannot save me from disappointment at not continuing to enjoy after the habit of enjoyment has grown upon me hence the necessity of consulting the rules of precautionary tenderness that have been exhibited above unburthensomeness is a praise that belongs to this mode of supply in another point of view with reference to the business of collection in many instances so great is the incidental burthen accruing from this source as almost to rival in real magnitude and even eclipse in apparent magnitude the principal burthen which is the more immediate fruit of the fiscal measure this is more eminently the case in the instances of the customs and the excise—of those branches of taxation by which by far the largest portion of the revenue is supplied the officer of excise goes nowhere where he is not a guest and of all guests the most unwelcome the escheator will have nowhere to go where he is not at home—into no habitation into no edifice not so much as upon a foot of land which is not to this purpose—which is not as against all individuals his own no jealousies—no collision of rights—no partial occupations extorted at the expense of the comfort and independence of proprietors the excise is not only the most productive branch of the revenue but the most capable of extension and therefore the most liable to be extended it can surely be no small merit in the proposed supply in addition to its other merits that in proportion as it extends in the same proportion it puts a stop to the extensions of the excise   the advantages that follow are of minor importance the advantage of checking litigation in this way by the diminution of its aliment is however not to be despised the fishing in the troubled waters of litigation for the whole or a part of the property of a distant relation or supposed relation is one of the most alluring and at the same time most dangerous pursuits by which adventurers are enticed into the lottery of the law it is like the search after a gold mine—a search by which the property of the adventurer is too often sunk before the precious ore is raised causes of this nature are by no means unfrequent in westminster hall the famous selby cause was a bequest nominally to relations really to the profession this source of litigation would be effectually dried up by the measure here proposed an item which may naturally enough be added to the account of advantage is the favour shown to marriage and in particular to prolific marriages—the sort of marriages of which the title to legislative favour stands in the most plausible point of view that the influence of the system in question would be favourable to marriage and in particular to prolific marriage will hardly be disputed of fathers and mothers of families it leaves the powers untouched—it places them in comparison with single persons of both sexes in a situation of privilege and preeminence within the threshold of him whose marriage has fulfilled the ends of marriage the foot of the officer of the revenue has no place his will is executed in all points whatever he bequeathes—to whomsoever he bequeathes it—offspring relation or stranger—passes without deduction whatever restriction it imposes is all at the expense of the celibatary and unmarried if with propriety it could be styled a tax it would be a tax on celibacy an advantage of a less questionable nature is the popularity which seems the natural effect of any measure wearing the complexion above mentioned for popularity it must be confessed—popularity how hollow soever be the ground it stands upon—can never be refused a place among the advantages of a measure satisfaction on the part of a people—satisfaction so long as it subsists is a real good—so long as it subsists its title to that appellation is altogether independent of the source from which it flows if indeed the utility of the measure be illusory then indeed when the illusion is dispelled there is an end of the advantage but the advantage so long as it continued was not the less real happily in the present instance the advantage is not only real but pure though in the way of affording     encouragement to marriage the proposed measure should in truth be of little service any farther than as it happened to be thought to be so the pleasure of seeing it popular on this score may be indulged with the less reserve as the delusion if it be one is not in this instance attended with any pernicious consequences section iv originality if the proposal relative to this resource be not an original one its want of originality may be seen to afford an objection if not original it has been proposed and if it has been proposed it has been rejected for assuredly it has not been adopted anywhere a tax on successions might at first glance present itself as bearing a resemblance to the resource in question as being a sort of modification of it—a commencement towards it—as forming in a manner a branch of it but we have already seen how perfectly dissimilar or rather opposite in effect the tax is to the regulation and how much the difference is to its disadvantage a tax on successions lies as heavy on the individual as it falls light into the exchequer taxes on successions not to mention the old roman tax the vicesima hereditatem the   per cent on collateral successions exist already in this country they exist in the form of a stampduty in some degree proportional on probates and letters of administration they exist in the form of a stamp duty on receipts for legacies and distributive shares as to the duties on legacies in what proportion they are paid i do not know but i am sure they are evaded and very frequently evaded one should be almost sorry if they were not evaded they are evaded in proportion as confidence prevails in families the whole mass of property goes in the first place into the hands of individuals a course which indeed it could not but take so long as the resource is left to stand upon the footing of a tax the private executor sets out with getting everything into his hands the public gets what this most confidential friend of the deceased thinks proper to bestow of course he will not bestow anything at the expense of the friend of his testator so long as he can persuade himself with any tolerable assurance that the person he is befriending will not requite his generosity with such a degree of baseness as to make him pay the legacy over again out of his own pocket another circumstance concurs in diminishing the productive power of a tax upon successions when the duty amounts to a sum which appears considerable the levy being a tax—a tax to be levied on an individual and levied all at once it wears so formidable an aspect that the man of finance himself is startled at it he accordingly reduces the rate and the higher the legacy amounts the more he reduces it so that all proportionality is destroyed by this means the better a man can afford to pay the less it is he pays and the tax has the appearance of a conspiracy of the richer against the poorer classes of mankind whence comes this only from its being raised by a tax and not by a regulation as above proposed under the regulation the public will pay itself the officer of the public will have the staff in his hands a partiality as unfriendly to the interests of finance as it is unseemly in the eyes of justice will disappear and wealthy successions will yield in proportion to their opulence section v produce to mr — instead of the matter destined for the present section i must content myself for the present with sending you little more than a blank i could not have filled it up without attempting to lead you into a labyrinth of calculations which after all i could not render complete for want of data without your assistance and which if the principle of the measure should not be approved of would have no claim to notice meantime as the result of the calculations need not wait for the calculations themselves and as a supposition of this sort however imperfectly warranted may be more satisfactory than a total void i will beg your indulgence for the following apperçu net annual produce of this resource upwards of £ 000000 over and above the expense of collection— expense of collection escheators and subescheators at   per cent upon the above produce £ 00000 judicial establishment for the purpose at  ½ per cent which i apprehend could not be dispensed with  0000 total at  ½ per cent £  0000     it is natural i should be over sanguine but i must confess i should expect to find the above sum below the mark rather than above it the calculations in their present state point at three millions but then there are deductions to be made on one hand as well as additions on the other for my own part if it depended upon me i should be very much disposed to turn my back upon calculations for if the principle of the resource be but approved of £ 00000 ayear would be as sufficient a warrant for it as £ 000000 since whether much or little it would be all so much clear gain unfelt by anybody in the shape of a loss the calculations however such as they are can be submitted at any time upon a day or twos notice they will at any rate afford a view of the data the subject affords of the difficulties to be overcome and of the uncertainties which are not capable of being cleared up without the aid of parliament section vi application a word or two may not be amiss respecting the application of the produce in general this topic may seem foreign enough from the consideration of the supply itself but that as we shall see is not altogether the case here in time of full peace the floating debt provided for there are but two options with regard to the application of a new supply reduction of debt and extinction of taxes for current service is already provided for by existing funds in time of war there are two additional options pledging for interest of loans and application to current service i will begin with the case of war for though the measure would be equally fit for establishment at either season yet war is certainly that which holds out to it the most promising chance for being actually established necessity the mother of invention may then be the mother of adoption too which of the two is by much the hardest offspring to bring forth i should not wish or even expect to see the produce of this resource appropriated to current service i should not wish or even expect to see it among the mass of pledges given as security for a loan the novelty of its complexion the uncertainty of its amount both seem to preclude it from either destination it may be prodigious it may be nothing there is no saying what it may be taken for resources more according to the usual model and therefore regarded as more certain—taxes in a word would be the supplies naturally destined to such service there remain discharge of debt and extinction of taxes between these two employments i would wish to see it divided and perhaps pretty equally divided there is one portion that could not well be refused to the discharge of public debt—even in wartime—even under the pressure of any exigency i mean the portion which exists already in that shape—where the property consists of a debt due from government to be discharged by an annuity till paid off in a word property in governmentannuities or as it is commonly termed to the great confusion of ideas money in the funds the extinction of so much of the debt is here so natural a result that it may be set down as an unavoidable one—to keep the debt alive and sell it for the benefit of government just as if it had fallen into individual hands it might have been sold for the benefit of individuals will surely not be thought of remit taxes and that in war time that would be an extraordinary employment for it indeed extraordinary indeed but not on that account the less eligible novel blessings shine but the brighter for being new an opportunity would by this incident be presented and perhaps this is the only incident by which such an opportunity could be presented of shaking off the yoke of some of the most oppressive taxes the whole list would then be to be overhauled and the worst chosen picked out and expunged† those which to my conception would stand at the head of the list are as i have said already the taxes upon justice in relation to these i can speak with confidence having sifted them to the bottom and demonstrated them—or i know not what demonstration     is—to be the worst of all taxes actual or possible further from the precise limits of the subject i will not attempt to stray unless it be for a fantastic moment in the way of reverie pure as we have found the resource to be from hardship and in all human probability from odium how pregnant may we imagine it at least to be of relief no lawtaxes—no prohibition of justice no tax on medical drugs—no prohibition of relief from sickness and from death no windowtax—no prohibition of air light health and cheerfulness no soaptax—no prohibition of cleanliness no salttax—no prohibition of the only sustenance of a famished people make the most of this resource and if not all these reliefs at least the most essential of them might perhaps be afforded even under the pressure of the war to do all this and government never the poorer to do all this and have a rich surplus for the sinking fund what a feast for humanity what a harvest of popularity what a rich reward for wisdom and virtue in a minister it is scarce necessary to observe that neither in any of those ways nor in any other should specific relief be engaged for till the means of relief are actually in hand the produce should be taken for nothing till it is actually in the exchequer when a year of probation is elapsed the amount will for any reason that can be alleged to the contrary be as uniform as that of the steadiest tax section vii heads of objection with answers† objection i supposed tendency to promote dissipation of the national wealth by leading men to live upon their capitals or sell them for annuities for their own lives in consequence of their being restrained from benefiting those that are dear to them after their death answer no such tendency for—   a man will not bar those that are dear to him from receiving any part only because there is some part that he cannot enable them to receive   nor himself from disposing in that manner of any part only because there is some part that he can not so dispose of   the power of benefiting others after death is not the sole motive to accumulation another and a still stronger and more universal one is the faculty of increasing a mans fund of personal enjoyment during life—a faculty which would be at a stand if he parted with his capital for an annuity   such dissipation were it really to be in here and there an instance the result of the measure would only be a diminution and that a most trifling one from the benefit of it—not any objection to the principle of it objection ii breach of faith in the instance of property in the funds answer not unless confined to that species of property which is not proposed— no more than the existing taxes on distributive shares and legacies which in as far as there is nothing else to pay them must come out of any property a man had in the funds no more than any tax on consumption which must fall upon stockholders in common with other people since in as far as a mans own income arises out of the funds every tax he pays is paid out of what he has in the funds property is not in this way the more affected for being in the funds since in any other shape it would be equally reached by the proposed regulation objection iii breach of faith in the instance of foreign stockholders resident abroad who would not have been affected by the taxes in lieu of which this would come answer none for they may sell out reply the sort of obligation they will thereby be laid under to sell out is still a hardship the more as their submitting to it will lower the price answer yes were many likely to sell out on this account but that is not in the case—   because much of such stock is in the hands of bodies corporate   among individuals it is but a small proportion that will be destitute of relations within the pale   fewer still who would take to heart to such a degree a restriction from which a mans near relations stand exempted   feeling it to be in his power to sell out at any time a man would neither sell out at first nor afterwards objection iv it is pro tanto very much exposed at least to evasion answer   to none but what may be pretty effectually guarded against by proper registers c   if it could not the objection applies not to the principle of the measure but only to the quantum of advantage   it removes pro tanto the objection of breach of faith so far as a man evades so far he is not hurt objection v tendency to sink the price of land by glutting the market with it answer   no reason for supposing it will tend to sink the price in one way more than it will to raise it in another for i income arising out of land being more generally eligible will always fetch more than equal income arising out of the funds—still     more than equal income depending upon mere personal security ii nothing therefore can sink the price of land without sinking that and the price of stocks together nor without sinking the price of stocks more than the price of land nor raise the price of stocks without raising the price of land iii it will tend to raise the price of stocks at any rate as to that part of the property it attaches upon which it finds already in the shape of stock and which it will of course extinguish and take out of the market as also in respect of whatever other part is applied to the extinction of the public debt admitted that a depreciation in the price of property in land in comparison with that of property in the funds might take place if land were as yet at a monopoly price as adam smith seems to think it is b iii c   but this does not seem to be the case since a man can make three per cent by laying out his money in land when he can make but three and a half per cent by laying it out in the funds which is no more than an adequate difference for the difference in point of general eligibility between the two sources of income   a fall in the price of land is considered not as an ineligible but as an eligible event by adam smith b iii c   though not by me who referring everything to the feelings of individaals regard the sensation of loss thus produced as an evil outweighing every possible advantage objection vi money thus obtained will be collected at greater expense than if obtained from taxes answer   no particular reason for thinking so   were this clear it would afford no objection because none of the hardship would be produced here which is the result of expense when defrayed by taxes objection vii increase of the influence of the crown by the new places that would be necessary answer   not more from this mode of supply than from any other of equal magnitude   were the objection anything determinate the weight of it would bear not against a useful establishment like this but against useless or less useful places   the objection if it were worth while might be got rid of in part by giving the appointment of escheators to the freeholders who now have the appointment of coroners objection viii the powers that must be given for the purpose of collection would be abused answer   this mode of supply is not more open to abuse of power to the prejudice of the individual than any other   abuse of power by undue indulgence to the individual to the prejudice of the revenue goes only to the quantum of the advantage and forms therefore no objection to the principle of the measure and as to the individual so far as he is indulged duly or unduly he is not hurt   abuses of both kinds may be more effectually checked in this instance than in others viz by the publicity that even for other purposes would require to be given to the proceedings the remark though bad as an objection is good as a warning and as such would be attended to objection ix by the facility it would give to the business of supply it would be an encouragement to profusion on the part of government answer if this were an objection the most burdensome mode of supply would be the best rendering supply more burthensome than it might be is a remedy worse than the disease or rather an aggravation of the disease to the exclusion of the remedy the following are the suppositions which the objection must take for granted—  that all expenditure is unnecessary   that this mode of supply would be submitted to   that no other would it would be a strange inconsistency if those who could not be brought to adopt other modes of checking profusion could in the mere view of checking profusion be brought to reject this mode of supply objection x it would make a revolution in property answer the tendency of this objection the force of which consists altogether in the abuse of a word is to point to a wrong object the just horror conceived against the french revolution the characteristic of that revolution is to trample in every possible way upon the feelings of individuals the characteristic of this measure is to show more tenderness to those feelings than can be shown by the taxes to which it is proposed to substitute it objection xi the property of the nation would thus be swallowed up in the exchequer answer no more than by taxes to the same amount objection xii it would be a subversion of the ancient law of inheritance in this country answer a quiet alteration made by a mere extension given to the old law—to a branch more ancient than almost any of those at the expense of which it is extended no subversion except in as far as every amendment is a subversion objection xiii it would be an innovation     answer no more than every new law nor as we have seen so much as most new laws no more than a set of taxes to the same amount not so much for all the revenue laws we have are innovations in comparison with the law of escheat section viii existing law can anything of harshness be imputed to the proposed measure not when viewed by itself we have seen already view it then in comparison turn to existing law no exclusion of the father here as there on pretence of the ponderosity of inheritances no exclusion of the halfblood as if the son of my father or my mother were a stranger to me no exclusion of all children but the first born as if the first born only lived upon food and all others upon air no exclusion of the better half of the species as if the tender sex had no need of sustenance the feelings of individuals—sole elements of public happiness—these and these only are the considerations that have here been exclusively consulted and their suggestions undeviatingly adhered to—human feelings the only true standards of right and wrong in the business of legislation not lawyers quibbles nor reasons of other times that have vanished with the times pursue the comparison yet farther on the one hand no harshness at all as we have seen on the other a harshness which is incurable the proposed law taking nature for its guide leads expectation by a silken string the existing law pursuing the ghosts of departed reasons thwarts expectation at every step and can never cease to do so it does so because it is in the speechless shape of common law and it would do so still even though words were given to it and it were converted into statute law reasons rooted in utility are so many anchors by which a law fastens itself into the memory lawyers quibbles are a rope of sand which neither has tenacity of its own nor can give stability to anything else rules and quibbles together the impression they make upon the mind is that of the wind upon the waves and when incidents spring up to call them into action the sensation produced is the sensation of a thunderstroke section ix ancient law shall we dig into antiquity the result will be still more favourable reckoning from the subversion of the roman empire property considered as surviving to the proprietor is comparatively of modern date under the feudal system in the morning of its days estates greater than life estates were unknown the most fixed of all possessions fell back into the common stock upon the death of the possessor and before the reign of the conqueror was at an end the feudal tree transplanted from the continent into this our island had covered almost the whole surface of the kingdom with its gloomy shade this venerable system had indeed before that period lost a good deal of its vigour which is the same thing as to say its rigour and the principle of succession had taken root under it but not without being loaded with conditions and weakened by defalcations and distortions over and above those which have been already glanced at and which we are plagued with to this day the relaxation too was an innovation which in the vocabulary of antiquarian idolatry as well as of indiscriminating timidity means a corruption of the primeval state of things at a much later period moveable property took if not exactly the same course with immoveable a course more opposite to that indicated by utility and equally repugnant to that which seems prescribed by nature the more substantial part—the immoveable—had been reserved for the maw of feudal anarchy the lighter part—the moveable—was carried off by some holy personage for pious uses and of all uses the most pious was his own moveable and immoveable together power without mercy or imposture without shame took the whole under their charge the claims of the widow and the orphan were as little regarded as those of the most distant relative so late even as the latter part of the reign of edward iii it required an exertion of parliamentary power to make the man of god disgorge in favour of the fatherless and the widow† the right of bequest the right of governing property by one who is no longer in existence to enjoy it is an innovation still more modern in its relation to moveables it was conquered from the spiritual power by gradual and undefinable     encroachments the validity of its exercise having from the conquest to the present time depended on the decision of that same power which till the abovementioned statute of edward iii was interested in denying it and after the right was secured the facility of its exercise must for a long time have been confined within narrow bounds by the scarcity of literary acquirements in its relation to immoveables it was not placed on solid ground till the statute of henry viii and then only by implication nor to take the matter in the words of blackstone was it till even after the restoration that the power of devising real property became so universal as at present all this while the law of escheat coeval with the reign of the conqueror dwelt upon as a subject of importance in the reign of henry ii† touched upon by a numerous series of statutes reaching down as low as edward vi recognised by decisions of so recent a period as the late reign‡ exists in indisputable vigour although the facility of tracing out heirs in these times of universal and instantaneous communication added to the want of an administrative establishment adapted to the collection of such a branch of revenue prevent it from being noticed in its present state in the accountbook of finance section x blackstone is opinion worth resorting to a poor warrant after the fiat of utility written in characters so legible in morals in politics in legislation the table of human feelings is i must confess to me what the alkoran was to the good mussulman opinions if unconformable to it are false—if conformable useless not so to many a worthy mind for their satisfaction then even this muddy source of argument shall not remain unexplored shall blackstone then be our oracle blackstone the most revered of oracles though the latest from him we have full licence—from him we have a latitude outstretching and that even to extravagance the utmost extent which either humanity or policy would permit us to assume but let us hear him in his own words— blackst comment ii    wills therefore says he and testaments rights of inheritance and successions are all of them creatures of the civil or municipal laws and accordingly are in all respects regulated by them every distinct country having different ceremonies and requisites to make a testament completely valid neither does anything vary more than the right of inheritance under different national establishments in england particularly this diversity is carried to such a length as if it had been meant to point out the power of the laws in regulating the succession to property and how futile every claim must be that has not its foundation in the positive rules of the state—in personal estates the father may succeed to his children in landed property he can never be their immediate heir by any the remotest possibility in general only the eldest son in some places only the youngest in others all the sons together have a right to succeed to the inheritance in real estates males are preferred to females and the eldest male will usually exclude the rest in the division of personal estates the females of equal degree are admitted together with the males and no right of primogeniture is allowed thus far our apollo legatees we see are nothing to him he sacrifices parents to us and even children he sees not that children are not only expectants but cooccupants no sympathy for disappointed expectation—no feeling for beggared opulence—no regard for meritorious service—no compassion for repulsive infirmity obliged to forego assistance or to borrow it of selfish hope the law his idol has no bowels why should we the rights of legatees the rights of children are mere creatures of the law as if the rights of occupants were anything more of wills or even succession he knows no use but to prevent a scramble the business of succession is a theatre which the laws of nations have pitched upon as it were in concert for the exhibition of caprice none with greater felicity than the law of england she has her views in this and they are always wise ones—to insult the subject to show him what arbitrary power is and to teach him to respect it this one consideration continues he may help to remove the scruples of many wellmeaning persons who set up a mistaken conscience in opposition to the rules of law if a man disinherits his son by a will duly executed and leaves his estate to a stranger there are many who consider this proceeding as contrary to natural justice while others so scrupulously adhere to the supposed intention of the dead that if a will of lands be attested by only two witnesses instead of three which the law requires they are apt to imagine that the heir is bound in conscience to relinquish his title to the devise but both of them certainly proceed upon very erroneous principles as if on the one hand the son had by nature a right to succeed to his fathers lands or as if on the other hand the owner was by nature entitled to direct the succession of his property after his decease whereas the law of nature suggests that on the death     of the possessor the estate should again become common and be open to the next occupant unless otherwise ordered for the sake of civil peace by the positive law of society the right of inheritance says he but two pages before or descent to the children and relations of the deceased seems to have been allowed much earlier than the right of devising by testament we are apt to conceive at first view that it has nature on its side yet we often mistake for nature what we find established by long and inveterate custom† it is certainly a wise and effectual but clearly a political establishment‡ since the permanent right of property§ vested in the ancestor himself was no natural but merely a civil right∥ what we learn from all this is that so long as a man can find a pretence for getting rid of the phrase contrary to natural justice there is no harm in his childrens being left by him to starve and that those who would make a conscience of leaving their children thus to starve are wellmeaning but mistaken people quere who is this same queen nature who makes such stuff under the name of laws quere in what year of her own or anybody elses reign did she make it and in what shop is a copy of it to be bought that it may be burnt by the hands of the common hangman and her majesty well disciplined at the carts tail it being supposed in point of fact that the children have or have not a right of the sort in question given them by the law the only rational question remaining is whether in point of utility such a right ought to be given them or not to talk of a law of nature giving them or not giving them a natural right is so much sheer nonsense answering neither the one question nor the other     tax with monopoly or hints of certain cases in which in alleviation of the burden of taxation exclusive privileges may be given as against future competitors without producing any of the ill effects which in most cases are inseparable from everything that savours of monopoly exemplified in the instances of the stockbroking and banking businesses taxes on the profits of traders would generally speaking be impracticable—   the difficulty of ascertaining the profit and loss upon each article would be an endless source of evasion   the measures necessary to be taken against evasion would be an equally endless source of real or supposed oppression   the disclosure of the secrets of the trade would operate as a prohibition of ingenuity and improvement i stockbrokers in the business of a stockbroker none of these objections have place—      no difficulty about ascertaining profit and loss loss none in any case rate of profit perfectly fixed the transactions which gave birth to it are always upon record   no secret no inventions no improvement in the case ii bankers        no more difficulty about ascertaining profit and loss nor anything more of invention than in the case of stockbrokers the profit of the banker results from the placing out at interest in large sums what he finds to spare out of the money he receives in large and small sums on condition of returning it as it is wanted if in this case there be any such thing as a secret the disclosure of which might be attended with prejudice to anybody it lies in the money transactions of the customers who deposit the money and draw for it and of those who by getting bills discounted or otherwise deal with this shop in the character of borrowers were the knowledge of these transactions generally spread or were it easily attainable it might in some instances be attended with prejudice to the parties by the information given to rivals in business or other adversaries but for the purpose in question the knowledge in question might be confined in each instance to a single accountant appointed by the crown whose attention would be confined to the mere figures having neither time to inquire nor interest in inquiring into the history of any transaction in the occasion of which this or that sum was drawn for or deposited so much for the tax—the burthen now as to the exclusive privilege—the compensation the effects to which this sort of institution in as far as it is mischievous stands indebted for its mischievousness are—   enhancement of the price of the article dealt in   impairing the quality   lessening consumption in the case of consumable goods—or more generally diminishing the general mass of benefit depending upon this use of the sort of article whatever it may be   enhancement of trouble to the customer by his having farther to go than if dealers were more numerous   the exclusion of persons already embarked in the business a still greater grievance if it existed is out of the question here none of these ill effects would take place in any degree in the instance of either of the above professions thus in the case of   the stock broker   the price of the service rendered is a fixed per centage it is amply sufficient enhancement might be prevented by law   the quality of the service cannot from  00 the nature of it either be improved or impaired neither skill nor invention nor so much as any extraordinary degree of exertion have anything to do with it   the demand for this sort of service cannot in the nature of things be lessened or anyways affected by the limitation of the number of the persons whose profession it is to render it or by the fixation of the price at which they are to render it   the distance between the agent and his employer cannot receive any enhancement from the exclusive privilege or from anything else the agents how numerous soever are confined to a spot by the very nature of their business ii the banker   the service of receiving and keeping—the service rendered to the depositor of money is rendered gratis and though the number of bankers should ever be lessened there can be no apprehension of their requiring payment for this service the price at which the other sort of customer the borrower is supplied is equally incapable of being raised by the operation the rate of interest will depend upon the quantity of capital accumulated in the whole country not upon the quantity that happens to be in the hands of bankers a confederacy and that a successful one among all the bankers town and country to raise the rate of interest is in itself scarce possible besides that the rate is actually limited by law   the quality of the service is as little susceptible of being impaired by such a cause it is more likely to be improved each bank being rendered richer and thereby safer in proportion as the number is kept down   as little is the demand for this sort of service capable of being lessened by the restriction of the number of hands allowed to render it the demand for the service consisting in the keeping of money will depend upon the quantity of money to be kept the demand for the service consisting in the loan of money will depend upon the quantity of money wanted for a time by those who have value to give for it when the time is over in neither of these instances has the demand anything to do with the number of the persons whose business it is to render this sort of service   the distance between the professional man and his customer and employer need not receive any enhancement in that case any more than in the other distance has never been a matter much regarded in this branch of business as to the london bankers instead of spreading themselves equally within the circle of the metropolis their object seems rather to have been to crowd into or as near as possible to lombard street in the country whatever distance the depositor and borrower have been used to go they might contrive to go were it necessary without much inconvenience the inconvenience might be done away entirely by proper reservation adapted to future demands in places where as yet there is none a calculation might easily be made of the progressive value of the indemnity from retrospective view of the gradual increase in the number of bankers on the one hand and in the quantity of circulating cash and paper deposited on the other the advantages of monopoly find their way without much difficulty to the eyes of dealers monopoly would be no innovation in this branch of business an illustrious example is afforded by the bank of england should the principle be approved of it might be worth while to look over the list of trades professions and other lucrative occupations for the purpose of ascertaining the instances in which this species of compensation might be given without any such inconvenience as would outweigh the benefit the exclusive privilege being a benefit ought of course to be coupled with the tax in every instance where it is not attended by a proponderant mass of inconvenience to the public at large the stock of these cases being exhausted then and not till then may be the time to look out for the instances if any in which the tax might stand alone without the indemnity to lighten

king elevated any one to the rank of nobility or conferred on him the title of baron to insert in the diploma the circumstances by which he had merited this distinction but upon a late occasion when his majesty ennobled m de geer chamberlain of the court he requested that the kindness and good pleasure of the king might be inserted in his diploma as the only reason for his elevation his majesty not only complied but directed that the chancery should thenceforward follow this rule as was anciently the practice under the sovereigns of the family of vasa till the reign of christina i have not seen any of these ancient diplomas of swedish nobility and i know not whether the facts they exhibited as the reasons operating upon the sovereign were specific and detailed but whatever were the

the chance of contestation is altogether wanting this chance will of course be the greater the more numerous that body but if the body be very small especially if it be composed without any mixture of

wealth of nations † the following is the general outline of an arrangement by which all the above difficulties would be effectually removed—unlimited competition with power to the minister or to any competent authority to reject the offer which ought according to the general rule to be accepted power also to the offerer to call upon the minister or competent authority to assign their reasons for such rejection when all this is done publicly no attempt would be made to reject the offer of a man who together with his sureties was known to be perfectly responsible a praise to which one of the most celebrated ministers in england is justly entitled and about which there is no difference of opinion is the having with more consistency than any of his predecessors followed this principle mr

varying in method and completeness and rendering unavoidable the great inconvenience of consulting four volumes instead of one if a plan analogous to that employed in the case of architectural works had been adopted the course taken would have been to advertise a premium for the best essay on the art of indexmaking and particularly as applied to the work in question as a still further security an

censendum est  if the nature of the case admitted the possibility of any such result the endeavour of this constitution would be—on each occasion to maximize the felicity of every one of the individuals of whose interests the universal interest is composed on which supposition the greatest happiness of all not of the greatest number only would be the end aimed at but such universality is not possible for neither in the augmentation given to the gross amount of felicity can all the individuals in question ever be included nor can the infelicity in which the expense consists be so disposed of as to be borne in equal amount by all in particular such part of that same expense as consists in the suffering produced by punishment thus it is that to provide for the greatest felicity of the greatest number is the utmost that can be done towards the maximization of universal national felicity in so far as depends on government † by subsistence—or say matter of subsistence—may be understood everything the nonpossession of which would be productive of positive physical suffering—that and nothing more in so far as distinct from and not comprehended in the corresponding branch of security namely security for subsistence—subsistence itself must be understood as being in the field of time limited to a single instant—any instant taken at pleasure accordingly of the several elements or dimensions of value to extent alone as measured by the number of the individuals in question can maximization on this occasion be applicable ‡ in the words good and evil apt additaments

property under which denomination the matter of subsistence and the matter of abundance as above are comprehended   power considered in its two distinguishable branches—the domestic and the political   reputation a fictitious entity the value of which considered in the character of a subjectmatter of possession and security consists in its being a source of respect or love or both and as being in either case an eventual source of good offices or say of services receivable from other persons by the person by whom it is possessed take away all services eventual as well as actual you strip it of all intelligible value   condition in life a factitious and fictitious entity compounded of property power and reputation in indeterminate and indefinitely diversifiable proportions in the idea of

relations expressed by the words husband wife son daughter father mother and so on throughout the whole genealogical tree   the several distinguishable occupations profitseeking ones included and the several political situations corresponding to the several offices with the powers and functions respectively attached to them taken together—the injuries against which security for these five several subjectmatters is requisite to happiness constitute the most obvious and as it were tangible portion of the matter of the penal code as does the detailed description of the several cases in which a man has a right to security against these several injuries those to property in particular that of the civil code right to security that is to say to the eventual appropriate services of the several classes of public functionaries—that is to say judges and their subordinates by the exercise of whose functions it is afforded a distinction—which must here be kept in view or a conception as afflictive as it would be erroneous will be entertained is—that between a defalcation made from a subjectmatter of security say for example from property and a defalcation from security itself in which latter case in the phrase commonly employed a shock is spoken of as being given to security howsoever the subjectmatter of security be lessened security itself will not be lessened if by means of the defalcation made from the subjectmatter the probability of retaining what remains of it be not lessened by any such defalcation made from the subjectmatter of security taken in the aggregate so far is security itself from being necessarily lessened that without such defalcation it could not have existence witness taxation without which nowhere could the business of government be carried on nowhere could security against adversaries of any class have place nowhere could security against calamity in any shape be afforded by government  the giving execution and effect to precautionary arrangements taken with a view to calamity belongs to one branch of that part of the business of the executive department which in the ensuing code is styled the preventive service the giving the like support to such precautionary arrangements as are taken with a view to hostility at the hands of the unofficial and resistible class of adversaries belongs to the other branch of that same service  to this arrangement no objection wearing the face of a rational one could ever be made other than that of impracticability—an objection formed by the assertion that consistently with internal peace and security no such arrangement can have place but in the case of the angloamerican united states the groundlessness of this objection has been completely demonstrated by experience—demonstrated by the very first experiment ever made while to the purpose of all such persons as had a new constitution to make this same arangement even on the supposition that the experiments made of it had in a considerable number all of them failed might still have remained the only eligible one for as will be seen below the abovementioned constitution is one which bating irresistible force from without

conversation one prosecution had—possibly in his eyes certainly in mine—eclipsed the other or the few others the case was that of a prosecution instituted by the marquess of casa yrujo in his quality

a nation with permanent confidence in an assembly which is considered to represent it—  direct election   amoveability   certain conditions for being an elector or elected   a number proportioned to the extent of the country it is upon these points that questions of detail multiply the election ought to be direct if it be made by more steps the people who only elect the electors cannot regard the deputies elected as their work they are not connected with them by the affection of choice nor by the feeling of power the electors are connected with the people neither by gratitude nor responsibility there is no approximation of the superior and inferior classes and the political bond continues imperfect amoveability is absolutely necessary what is an election it is a solemn declaration that a certain man actually enjoys the confidence of his constituents but this declaration does not possess a miraculous virtue which will guarantee the character and the future actions of this man it is absurd to cause a whole nation to assert this grave foolery—we declare that these five hundred individuals who now possess our confidence will equally possess it whatever they do during all the rest of their lives the conditions to be required are of a more doubtful nature eligibility founded upon pecuniary conditions appears to turn upon a general distrust of individuals who cannot offer the pledge of property they are considered as less attached to the established order or less secure from corruption the conditions required to constitute an elector have for their object the exclusion from political power of those who are considered incapable of exercising this power with intelligence or probity—they are precautions against venality ignorance and intrigue the number is an important consideration legislative functions demand qualities and virtues which are not common there is no chance of finding them except in a large assembly of individuals legislation requires a variety of local knowledge which can only be obtained in a numerous body of deputies chosen from all parts of the empire it is proper that all interests should be known and discussed legislation is not susceptible of direct responsibility a small junta of legislators may have particular interests in making laws opposed to the general interest it will be easy for the executive power to subject them to its influence but number is a preservative against this danger a numerous body of amoveable legislators participate too strongly in the interest of the community to neglect it long oppressive laws would press upon themselves even the rivalries which are formed in a large assembly become the security of the people in conclusion if the number of the deputies were too small the extent of the electoral district would render the elections embarrassing and by reducing the value of a vote almost to nothing would proportionally diminish the authority of the electors at the same time that it

which can be identical among many individuals and constitute the principle of unity in a body it cannot be a physical act such an act peculiar to the individual who exercises it does not offer any foundation for this identity when the roman senate decided that the consul opimius should put tiberius gracchus to death this decision was literally and without figure the act of each senator who contributed to it by his vote when opimius in consequence slew gracchus with his sword the blow struck was the act of opimius alone jurists say that this act was no less the act of the senate than the other qui facit per alium facit per se i am not examining whether this mode of expression which tends to confound one person with another may have any use all that i intend to observe here is that if for the sake of abbreviation or for greater emphasis this stroke of the sword be represented as the act of the senate it can only be so in a figurative sense  this inconvenience will be lessened if the deliberations are public and successive the reasons which have prevailed in one assembly will be known in the other  mr bentham not having executed this labour i have endeavoured to supply

their character the nobility are naturally indolent they dislike business because they are unaccustomed to it even in england the house of lords is extremely negligent of its senatorial functions it is frequently necessary to recruit it to maintain it in activity they are like certain indians who allow themselves to be governed by men brought from another climate those who have most to lose are

all the papers published by the house of commons are now allowed to be sold     —ed ‡ they have in the present house of commons a gallery appropriated to themselves     —ed  by the french constitution of the year      it was directed that all the deliberations of the chamber of peers should be secret i can discover no good reason for this secresy if publicity be dangerous it appears to me that there is least danger for the peers who are the least exposed to the danger of popular ambition nonpublicity appears to me particularly disadvantageous to the peers they require publicity as a bridle and a spur as a bridle because in virtue of their situation they are thought to have interests separate from the body of the people—as a spur because their immoveability weakens the motives of emulation and gives them an absolute independence i suppose that the chamber of peers is considered as being or about to become eminently monarchical as being the bulwark of royalty against the attacks of the deputies of the people but in this point of view is not the secresy of their deliberations a political blunder public discussion is allowed to those who by the supposition are enemies of the royal authority or at least too much inclined to democracy and those who are considered the hereditary defenders of the king and his dominion are shut up to secret discussion is not this in some manner to presume that their cause is too feeble to sustain the observation of the nation and that to preserve the individuals from general disapprobation it is necessary they should vote in secret when a proposition in the chamber of deputies has obtained great popular favour is it not desirable that the arguments by which it has been opposed should be known that the body which has rejected it should have the right of publicly justifying its refusal that it should not be exposed to the injurious suspicion of acting only with a view to its own interest that it ought not to be placed in so disadvantageous a position in the struggle which it has to sustain the body which speaks in public and whose debates are published possesses all the means of conciliating to itself numerous partisans whilst those who deliberate in secret can only influence themselves it would therefore seem that this secresy so flattering to them had been invented as a means of taking from their influence over opinion more than was given to them in superiority of rank  i proposed this plan of mr benthams to many of the members of the constituent assembly of france they considered it very ingenious and even very useful but that it could not be carried into effect because of the rapidity of the motions and operations of the assembly during many months i attended all its sittings with the greatest assiduity and i cannot forget how often i have experienced difficulty in ascertaining what was the subject of deliberation i have asked many members who were not able to inform me when even the motion was known it was only in its general object—never in all its details and in its precise terms there were consequently continual disputes about words a momentary absence a momentary abstraction a late entry were sufficient to produce entire ignorance of the subject of debate individuals sought to instruct themselves by conversations which formed the assembly into groupes and gave rise to little particular debates a multitude of motions thus presented passed as spectres and were only half known hence the indolent members either went away without voting or voted upon trust that is to say not being able to form an opinion they abandoned themselves to that of their party these observations may appear but trifles but the sum of these trifles produces great effects a torrent is composed of drops of water and a mountain of grains of sand—note by dumont  the roman senate could not begin any business before the rising of the sun nor conclude any after its setting this was a precaution against surprises but the english method is much preferable demosthenes caused a decree to be passed by surprise after the party opposed to his had retired believing the sitting finished such an event could not have happened in the british senate  see rationale of reward book i ch iv p      it was for a long time a trade among the common people to seize at an early hour upon places in

president i employ in preference to any other term which the english or any other european language offers as capable of being made to express the function i have in view to an englishman whose view was confined to his own island and to the chief governing bodies in that island speaker is the word which would naturally first present itself but the term speaker exhibits the office of president no otherwise than as an appendage to a very different and now frivolous function of which hereafter and of which latter only an intimation is given by this name—and in relation to the business of debate it has an incorrigible tendency to produce confusion it confounds the president with any member whom there is occasion to mention as speaking in the instance in which it is most used viz to denote the president in ordinary of the house of commons it involves a contradiction the original propriety of the appellation having in this instance slipped away and left absurdity in its place in that house the speaker while he officiates as such is the only person present who neither makes those speeches which all the other members make nor has any right to do so in this point of view it lends countenance to a principle of etymology generally cited as a whimsical one speaker from not speaking ut lucus a non lucendo orator orateur is the word by which the english word speaker has been usually rendered in the general language of europe it is by the same word that the presidency of the three inferior orders of the swedish diet is rendered in the same language to the innocent improprieties chargeable on the word speaker this adds a dangerous one oration means supplication—supplication implies pliancy as towards the person to be addressed the pliancy of the swedish presidents as towards the person they had to address has justa consummated the ruin of everything that ought to be dear to sweden the word chairman is free from the inconvenience attached to the use of the words speaker and orator but it draws the attention to an idea too confined as if it were necessary to the function that the person who performs it should sit in a chair and that nobody else should at times it may even bring up an improper and ignoble idea several committees being about to sit a voice is heard in the purlieus of the house of commons gentlemen your chairmen wait for you does chairmen here mean presidents or porters marshal is the appellation by which the president is designated in the polish diet in one of the four orders which compose the swedish body of that name and in the provincial assemblies of the noblesse instituted within these few years throughout the russian empire this term besides being unexpressive is liable to objections of a much more serious nature in the original german it signified neither more nor less than what we call a hostler or groom—a servant having horses under his care a horse being an animal of great importance to a barbarian king to have the care of the kings horses was to be a great man when not to be military was to be nobody to be a man in the service of the king was to have a military command thus by degrees a command over horses has involved as a matter of inferior consequence a command over their riders till at length the title of marshal superior even to that of general is come to denote in most countries of europe the chief military command but to command militarily is to command despotically accordingly in the swedish diet the nobles sitting under the command of their marshal named by the king are to speak or to hold their tongues as a soldier is to turn to the right or to the left as the commander gives the word thus as will be seen below ordained gustavus adolphus a military king hence of all the words which ever were or ever could be devised to denote the president of an assembly which is not meant for an army or a puppetshow the word marshal is that which ought most studiously to be proscribed france therefore in giving to the presidents of her national assemblies this simple and expressive name instead of the swelling and so much coveted title of marshal has had a fortunate escape the length of this note may demand justification but needs no apology while minds are led by sounds and modes of thinking depend on association names of office will never be of light importance a king of poland or sweden looks upon himself as an injured being so long as his will meets with any resistance that would not have been made to a king of prussia or denmark and because a president is termed marshal sweden is destroyed a published       for instance putting the question declaring the decision from the number of the votes giving orders to subordinates giving thanks or reprimands to individuals or in short using in the name of the assembly any other discourse of any kind which is not deemed of sufficient importance to be penned by the assembly itself † an assembly may in this point of view be deemed too numerous when it is too numerous for the opinion of each member to be recorded distinctly in his own terms this takes out of the rule such assemblies for instance as the boards of administration and the principal courts of justice in great britain and the boards established in the dominions of the english eastindia company  in contradistinction to a comparative one i e if there be a number of candidates the having more votes than any other candidate ought not to determine the election unless he who possesses such comparative majority have a majority of the whole number of the votes † for instance where a king or other chief magistrate in any state institutes a new assembly or convokes one not already provided with one by ancient designation it might be of use that he should name a president for this purpose only ‡ thus in an english county meeting it may be better to accept of the presidency of the sheriff though an officer of the kings appointment than to consume the time in debating who shall fill the chair  this chapter was originally published in  to in the year      in the preface to that publication it is stated that the circumstance which gave rise to the publication of this detached chapter was the notification that had been given of the then approaching meeting of the french statesgeneral since termed the national assembly as to the particular matter of the present essay preceded as it required to be by several other matters as well in respect to the chronological order of the subjects treated of as in respect to the order that seemed most favourable to investigation it presented itself as second to none in the order of importance what was more the very rules that suggested themselves as necessary to every assembly turned out to be the very rules actually observed in both assemblies of the british legislature what theory would have pitched upon as a model of perfection practice presented as having been successfully pursued never was the accord more perfect between reason and experience the conjuncture which gave rise to the publication seemed to be such as would give it its best chance of being of use a political assembly selected from the whole body of a great nation were about to meet for the first time everything that concerned them was as yet new to them everything was as yet to create they were in the situation of a manufacturer who besides the work that was the object of his manufacture should find himself under the necessity of making the very tools he was to work with the presenting these new manufacturers with a new set of tools with a description of their uses—tools whose temper had been so well tried—was the object of the present design the subject however taken in its full extent and handled in the manner in which it was endeavoured to be handled was far too extensive for the time all that could be done at the moment was to select for immediate publication what seemed to stand first in the order of importance by forced exertions the part now published was accordingly printed off and of a few copies that were sent to paris the last sheet reached that metropolis a day or two after the first formal meeting of the assembly and before any business was begun upon of these copies one having found its way into the hands of the comte de mirabeau the sheets as fast as they came over had been honoured as i afterwards learned with a translation either by the pen of that distinguished member or under his care congenial affections had happened about the same time to give birth without my knowledge to a little tract that promised to afford not only furtherance to the design but assistance towards the execution of this larger enterprise to deliver the theory of a copious and unattempted branch of political science was necessarily a work not only of time but of bulk and would require more paper than could at the ordinary rate of business make its way in the course of several months through the press practice itself stated simply and without reasoning might be comprised within limits much less extensive moved by these considerations a gentleman eminently qualified for the task had undertaken much about the same time this philanthropic office his valuable paper was sent over in manuscript a translation of it was not only made but soon after published by the procurement of the celebrated frenchman above spoken of whose name stands in the titlepagea to judge from the temper and modes of thinking that had so long appeared prevalent in the french nation the larger of these works if tolerably performed and the other almost at any rate seemed to possess a fair chance of engaging some attention and of being turned to some account in practice the prepossession so generally entertained in favour of english law had been nowhere more strenuous more general or more liberally avowed than among our nearest neighbours if such was the case with regard to points in relation to which both countries had possessed the advantage of practice it seemed still more natural that it should be so with regard to points like these in relation to which the whole stock of experience had fallen exclusively to the share of that country to whose example the other had been used to look with so favourable an eye to judge beforehand the danger seemed to be that english practice at least whatever might become of english doctrine so far from being slighted should meet with an adoption rather too general and indiscriminate what seemed to be apprehended was rather that the dross should be taken up and employed than that the sterling should be rejected to make the distinction as plain as possible was therefore all along one of the principal objects of my care with these expectations the event has it must be confessed but indifferently accorded howsoever it has happened both these labours for any good effect they seem to have had in the country to whose service they were dedicated might as well have been spared of the theoretical essay the translation has not been so much as published and the practical might as well not have been published for any use that seems to have been made of it of the theoretical tract the author was indeed given to understand at the time that it had made as many proselytes as it had found readers but this it might easily do without having much success to boast of for at that busy period the time of the leading people in that country was as it still continues to be so fully occupied by the conversation which the topics of the day furnished in such abundance that the faculty of reading as to everything but what absolute necessity forced into mens hands seems to have been almost laid aside be that as it may from any effect that has manifested itself either in the rules or the practice of the french assembly few or no indicacations have appeared from which it can be inferred that either british practice or british reason or both together have met with that attention that either alone had some title to expect a few english expressions and some of them too misapplied compose nearly the whole of what france has drawn upon us for out of so large a fund has she reason to congratulate herself on this neglect on the contrary scarce a day that she has not smarted for it nor has the wisdom of these rules received a farther or more illustrious demonstration from the beneficial consequences that have attended the observance of them in the one country than from the bad effects that have resulted from the nonobservance of them in the other how often has the assembly been at the eve of perishing by the mere effect of the principles of dissolution involved in its own undigested practice what a profusion of useless altercation what a waste of precious time has been produced by doubts started and disputes carried on concerning the terms of a decree days after the decree has been supposed to have been framed a sort of dispute which never has arisen for ages nor ever can possibly arise under the british practice—the only practice on this head reconcileable to common sense the minutes of the proceedings—a work performed with the utmost exactness and punctuality in the house of commons by a single clerk—exercises the patience and finds full employment for the time and ingenuity of six members of the national assembly of france in london the publication of this work is as regular as that of a daily newspaper while in the corresponding work at paris the series of numbers has been commonly at least ten days or a fortnight in arrear besides being broken by frequent gaps and disturbed by second editions correcting and cancelling the first little by little the practice relative to these points has it is true already undergone some improvements well might it for if it had not instead of going on ill as it does it could not have gone on at all and so far as with relation to these same points it has been altered and improved so far has it been brought nearer and nearer to the british practice as delineated and justified by the ensuing pages as to the present detached essay a natural question is how it happens that being but a part and that not the first it comes now to be published separate from and before the rest—the answer is that though but a part it is as far as it goes complete within itself and as to every purpose of intelligibility completely independent of everything that was designed to precede or follow it observing it thus circumstanced it has occurred to me that the sheets might as well be transferred to the booksellers as remain any longer an incumbrance to the printer should it in this country be found to afford half an hours amusement to half an

appears that even so late as the year      the identity of the terms of the act of the house with those of the motion was not invariably preserved i will state it at length the rather as while it exemplifies the deviation from that rule it may also serve to exemplify and demonstrate the ill consequences of such deviation the whole passage is as follows—a debate arising in the house touching the ancient order and course of the house in the method of raising supplies and concerning the precedency of the lesser sum the house upon the question did resolve and declare it an ancient order of the house that when there comes a question between the greater and lesser sum or the longer or shorter time the least sum and longest time ought first to be put to the question upon the face of this passage two propositions may be laid down as undeniable—  st that the words of it are not all of them the same without any variation as those employed by the author of the motion which gave birth to it  dly that if in any part of it such identity was preserved it is impossible to say how far such part extends it being impossible to say where it begins the part that looks most like the authentic and if one may so say the enactive part of it is that which begins at these words that when there comes a question between the greater and lesser sum     but this cannot be taken for the beginning of the authentic part for two reasons—   because these words in order to make up along with the succeeding one a sentence capable of officiating in the character of an act of the house require to be preceded by the word resolved or to use the phraseology that comes nearest to that word in the passage in question by the words resolved and declared but in this passage no such word or words stand immediately precedent to the words in question nor can any form of words capable of answering that purpose be found in it without going farther back and that so far as to involve some words which upon the face of them could not have been the words of the author of the motion could not have been the words of the house to get the complement of words necessary to make out an intelligible proposition the least remote ones one can begin with are the words the house upon the question did resolve and declare but these it is evident could not have been the words of the house nor words given by the author of the motion as designed to be adopted by the house they are not words of an act of the house but words used by a third person in speaking of an act of the house   another reason why the part beginning at the words that when there comes a question cannot be taken as comprising all the words employed by the author of the motion is that between these words and the first words of the paragraph come others the import of which forms an essential part of the import whatever it be of the act of the house viz those which speak of the antiquity of the regulation the establishment of which was in view—the house upon the question did resolve and declare it to be an ancient order of the house these words an ancient order we see are in their import inseparably interwoven with the preceding ones which we have seen must have been words not of the house not of the author of the motion but of a third person the penner of the journals so far as to the fact of the uncertainty now as to the ill effects of it they consist in this that as you cannot tell what part of the passage if any was in the words of the act of the house you cannot tell to what cases the act of the house meant to extend itself this we shall see immediately the first paragraph not amounting of itself to an intelligible proposition—not amounting to a complete grammatical sentence is inextricably interwoven with the second they form two parts of the same sentence and in both parts there is matter equally capable of being considered as representative of a part of the import of the act of the house as you cannot tell where the language of the historiographer of the house ends and where the language of the house itself begins—it may be that both paragraphs were expressive of the sense of the house it may be that only the latter was now then comes the uncertainty and the mischief the last paragraph gives the proposition generally and without restriction the former paragraph applies a restrictive clause the last gives to understand that in all cases where divers sums meaning sums of money are in question it is the least sum that is to be put to the question first the former paragraph contradicts this proposition in its character of an universal one and says that the only case to which this rule is to be deemed to extend is that where the business upon the carpet is the business of supply—where the question is relative to the method of raising supplies what is the consequence that it is only in the case where the question is touching the method of raising supplies that this passage in the journals affords any certain rule and that as to all other questions in which sums of money may be concerned it not only affords no certainty but presents a rule with which the certainty of any conclusion that can be formed relative to the subject is absolutely incompatible the absence of all rule leaves the subject open to such other means of decision as the nature of it comports but an ambiguous rule is mortal to all certainty while it lasts and renders all true and regular decisions relative to that subject impossible observe how subservient a rule thus circumstanced is to the purposes of disingenuous altercation a debate arises on a question not relating to supply does it suit your purpose to have the rule attach upon this question—present the last paragraph alone does it suit your purpose to take the question out of the rule—produce both paragraphs together collateral considerations only make the confusion thicker such lights as are to be collected from the situation of the legislators point one way the interpretation given by subsequent practice points the other it is tolerably evident that in the minds of the authors this rule had no other extent than what related to the single business of supply where money was concerned the great object with them was how to keep their purses as close shut as possible against the swindler on the throne it was no part of their purpose to sit down and frame a set of general principles fit to enter into the composition of a regular code how should it have been when down to the present hour none of their successors have dared ever to harbour any such ambitious thoughts besides that the rule is given as an ancient one and the farther back we go in the history of the house of commons setting aside the period of its shortlived tyranny during the civil wars the less we find them have to do with money for any other purpose than the simple one of affording a temporary relief to the necessities of the crown on the other hand subsequent practice is in favour of the more general construction in a question noways relating to the business of affording supplies to the crown we shall find in a succeeding chapter a curious instance and such for aught i know may be the practice in every other instance here then to increase the confusion we have precedent against reason and all for want of the observance of a rule of composition so simple in its conception and so easy in practice to exhibit what ought to have been done as well as what ought not to have been done i will now give the order in question as it ought to have stood and as it would have stood had it been penned on the same plan with others that precede and follow it in the same volume and even in the same leaf the words in brackets express the dubious parts the retention or omission of which will give the different constructions of which the passage as it stands in the journals is susceptible— the passage as it

résultats des assemb prov p     in ancient times the scottish parliament was subject as to the order of its labours to a committee named by the king the lords of articles alone had the initiative of all measures they prepared beforehand everything which was to be presented to the assembly and consequently had an absolute negative much more powerful than they could have had after the debate—robertsons history of scotland book i reign of james v they were not named by the king but by the several estates of the parliament—ed  if it be necessary that motions should be composed beforehand in order that they may be presented to the legislature which is composed of the élite of the nation—for a much stronger reason is this precaution indispensable with regard to popular assemblies which are formed and dissolved in a day and which can have little or no practice in the art of debate such assemblies often take place in towns or counties in england for the purpose of presenting petitions or addresses either to the king or the houses of parliament if in these assemblies an individual propose a petition or address previously prepared his antagonists seldom fail to draw from this circumstance an argument in its disfavour there is indeed a term of ridicule for the designation of such previously prepared motions they are called pocket motions and pocket petitions by these terms an intention is imputed to their author of surprising and deceiving the assembly by causing his own personal ideas to be received as a public act there is in this suspicion a mixture of reason and error—of inadvertence and reflection the inadvertence consists in not considering that a motion which is to be the act of all must begin by being the act of one individual—and that a writing of this kind as well as every other writing ought to be the better precisely because it is the work of time and reflection but on the other hand it is an instinct of reason to distrust the ascendency which one individual may obtain over an assembly by proposing a measure which he had prepared at leisure but upon which the assembly is called to decide at once without having had time to examine its foundations and consequences what follows ought no one in a popular assembly to propose any motion previously prepared this certainly ought not to be the rule—but the rather that before the day of assembly the motions intended to be made ought to be published there exist in some assemblies of this kind regulations which prohibit their convocation without a public declaration of the object of the meeting this regulation ought to be universal and there ought to be added to it as a necessary condition that the principal motion in its totality should be annexed to the act of convocation that there should be a sufficient interval to allow of the publication of rival propositions and that no motion should be presented to such assemblies which had not been previously made

intimation is given by the words of which the title of his work is composed  i e the editor of the original edition  extract from the preface to hamiltons work— he indeed considered politics as a kind of game of which the stake or prize was the administration of the country hence he thought that those who conceived that one party were possessed of greater ability than their opponents and were therefore fitter to fill the first offices in the state might with great propriety adopt such measures consistent with the constitution as should tend to bring their friends into the administration of affairs or to support them when invested with such power without weighing in golden scales the particular parliamentary questions which should be brought forward for this purpose as on the other hand they who had formed a higher estimate of the opposite party might with equal propriety adopt a similar conduct and shape various questions for the purpose of showing the imbecility of those in power and substituting an abler ministry or one that they considered abler in their room looking on such occasions rather to the object of each motion than to the question itself and in support of these positions which however short they may be of theoretical perfection do not perhaps very widely differ says mr malone from the actual state of things he used to observe that if any one would carefully examine all the questions which have been agitated in parliament from the time of the revolution he would be surprised to find how few could be pointed out in which an honest man might not conscientiously have voted on either side however by the force of rhetorical aggravation and the fervour of the times they may have been represented to be of such high importance that the very existence of the state depended on the result of the deliberation some questions indeed he acknowledged to be of a vital nature of such magnitude and so intimately connected with the safety and welfare of the whole community that no inducement or friendly disposition to any party ought to have the smallest weight in the decision one of these in his opinion was the proposition for a parliamentary reform or in other words for the new modelling the constitution of parliament a measure which he considered of such moment and of so dangerous a tendency that he once said to a friend now living that he would sooner suffer his right hand to be cut off than vote for it † yet such was the warmth of his friends feelings and with such constant pleasure did he reflect on the many happy days which they had spent together that he not only in the first place obtained for him a permanent provision on the establishment of irelanda but in addition to this proof of his regard and esteem he

no means unconversant with law and had himself sat in parliament for more than forty years who in the commencement of his political career burst forth like a meteor and for a while obscured his contemporaries by the splendour of his eloquence who was a most curious observer of the characteristic merits and defects of the distinguished speakers of his time and who though after his first effort he seldom engaged in public debate devoted almost all his leisure and thoughts during the long period above mentioned to the examination and discussion of all the principal questions agitated

clearer point of view the word gallantry is employed to denote either of two dispositions which though not altogether without connexion may either of them exist without the other in one of these senses it denotes on the part of the stronger sex the disposition to testify on all occasions towards the weaker sex those sentiments of respect and kindness by which civilized is so strikingly and happily distinguished from savage life in the other sense it is in the main synonymous to adultery yet not so completely synonymous as indeed words perfectly synonymous are of rare occurrence but that in addition to this sense it presents an accessary and collateral one having from the habit of being employed in the other sense acquired in addition to its direct sense a collateral sense of the eulogistic cast it serves to give to the act habit or disposition which in this sense it is employed to present something of an eulogistic tincture in lieu of that dyslogystic colouring under which the object is presented by its direct and proper name whatever act a man regards himself as being known to have performed or meditates the performance of under any expectation of his being eventually known to have performed it he will not in speaking of it make use of any term the tendency of which is to call forth on the part of the hearer or reader any sentiment of disapprobation pointed at the sort of act in question and consequently through the medium of the act at the agent by whom it has been performed to the word adultery this effect to every man more or less unpleasant is attached by the usage of language on every occasion in which it is necessary to his purpose to bring to view an act of this obnoxious description he will naturally be on the lookout for a term in the use of which he may be supposed to have had another meaning and which in so far as it conveys an idea of the forbidden act in question presents it with an accompaniment not of reproach but rather of approbation which in general would not have accompanied it but for the other signification which the word is also employed to designate this term he finds in the word gallantry there is a sort of man who whether ready or no to commit any act or acts of adultery would gladly be thought to have been habituated to the commission of such acts but even this sort of man would neither be found to say of himself i am an adulterer nor pleased to have it said of him he is an adulterer but to have it said of him that he is a man of gallantry—this is what the sort of man in question would regard as a compliment with

how defective soever it may be as a law the difficulty would be to trace such limits as should agree with objects which have not been seen an island for example in what case ought the whole of it to belong to those who first discovered it and when to many others who have equally touched at it ought it to belong to him who first saw it without entering it—to him who first entered it—or to him who first went round it how also shall an island in every case be distinguished from a part of a continent or even from an entire continent which may be very extensive and when it respects a discovered continent to what distance shall the right of possession extend shall it be the space inclosed by the sea the two nearest navigable rivers and the high ground in which these rivers take their rise

occasional expense of defending it and victualling it in war   the possession of it is useless it is said to be useful only on account of the levant trade—but   we could carry on that trade equally well without gibraltar   if we could not we should suffer no loss the capital employed in that trade would be equally productive if employed in any other   supposing this the most productive of all trades yet what we lost by losing gibraltar would only be equal to the difference between the per centage gained in that trade and the per centage gained in the next most productive trade for   we

expense of litigation is a burden which this artificial one finds pressing on him in any case  i say there never can be in those other instances the event insured against is always some very simple

impoverished suitors there are lady bountifuls that relieve the sick from the tax on medicines and the price of them into the bargain but a lady bountiful must be bountiful indeed to take the place of attorney and counsel as well as of physician and apothecary and supply a poor man with as many pounds worth of latitats and pleas as he must have to recover a shilling a man cannot as we have seen insure himself against lawsuits but a man may insure himself and many thousands actually do insure themselves against sickness but these reliefs are neither certain nor general and after all a tax on him who has had a leg or an arm broken a tax on him who has had a fit of the ague gout rheumatism or stone will be the worst possible species of tax next to a tax on justice n b the tax on quack

scarce words for it in the language temerity is taken from the roman law malice the term by which english lawyers seem in some instances to have had in view the expressing consciousness of blame

know whether it succeeded  let us not for the purpose of any argument give rise or countenance to injurious imputations though justice is partly denied and partly sold the difference is certainly immense betwixt selling it for the personal benefit of the king or of a judge and selling it for the benefit of the public—betwixt selling it by auction and selling it at a fixed price—betwixt denying it for the sake of forcing the sale of it or denying it to a few obnoxious individuals and denying it indiscriminately to the great majority of the people in point of moral guilt there is certainly no

longexisting usages but the success of the very system here proposed though established in so great a degree at the expense of the power in question may depend upon the leaving that power in possession of a very considerable degree of force if a man were allowed no power at all over what property he left behind him he would in many instances either be indifferent about getting it or spend it as fast as he got it or transfer it to some happier clime where the interests of the community were better understood and the feelings of individuals treated with more respect and in fact a great part of the value of all property would be thus destroyed so much as to the abolishing the power altogether as to the narrowing it in the manner here proposed should that be objected to as too great a

in for anything would now be a disappointment it will even be a disappointment should the share he gets prove smaller than what he hoped to get and the disappointment will be not less but greater if he gets no share at all true but all this depends upon the option accordingly in the case you suppose there is an option given whereas in the case i suppose here is none when an estate in england has
