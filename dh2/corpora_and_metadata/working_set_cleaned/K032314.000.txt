the platonic lady a comedy as it is acted at the queens theater in the haymarket  by the author of the gamester and loves contrivance  london printed for james knapton at the crown in st pauls churchyard and egbert sanger at the post house at the middletemplegate in fleetstreet   0  price   s   d where may be had all sorts of plays  to all the generous encouragers of female ingenuity this play is humbly dedicated gentlemen and ladies my muse chose to make this universal address hoping among the numerous crowd to find some souls great enough to protect her against the carping malice of the vulgar world who think it a proof of their sense to dislike every thing that is writ by women i was the more induced to this general application from the usage i have met on all sides  a play secretly introduced to the house whilst the author remains unknown is approved by every body the actors cry it up and are in expectation of a great run the bookseller of a second edition and the scribler of a sixth night but if by chance the plots discovered and the brat found fatherless immediately it flags in the opinion of those that extolled it before and the bookseller falls in his price with this reason only it is a womans thus they alter their judgment by the esteem they have for the author though the play is still the same they never reflect that we have had some maleproductions of this kind void of plot and wit and full as insipid as ever a womans of us all  i cannot forbear inserting a story which my bookseller that printed my gamester told me of a spark that had seen my gamester three or four times and liked it extremely having bought one of the books asked who the author was and being told a woman threw down the book and put up his money saying he had spent too much after it already and was sure if the town had known that it would never have run ten days no doubt this was a wit in his own eyes it is such as these that rob us of that which inspires the poet praise and it is such as these made him that printed my comedy called loves contrivance or medin cin malgre lui put two letters of a wrong name to it which though it was the height of injustice to me yet his imposing on the town turned to account with him and thus passing for a mans it has been played at least a hundred times  and why this wrath against the womens works perhaps you will answer because they meddle with things out of their sphere but i say no for since the poet is born why not a woman as well as a man not that i would derogate from those great men who have a genius and learning to improve that genius i only object against those illnatured critics who wanting both think they have a sufficient claim to sense by railing at what they dont understand some have armed themselves with resolution not to like the play they paid to see and if in spite of spleen they have been pleased against their will have maliciously reported it was none of mine but given me by some gentleman nay even my own sex which should assert our prerogative against such detractors are often backward to encourage a female pen  would these professed enemies but consider what examples we have had of women that excelled in all arts in music painting poetry also in war nay to our immortal praise what empresses and queens have filled the world what cannot england boast from women the mighty romans felt the power of boadiceas arm eliza made spain tremble but ann the greatest of the three has shook the man that aimed at universal sway after naming this miracle the glory of our sex sure none will spitefully cavil at the following scenes purely because a woman writem this i dare venture to say in their behalf there is a plot and story in them i hope will entertain the reader which is the utmost

dress and make a figure   toy born and bred in somersetshire never five miles from home before wore the cloth of her own spinning daind to make her own butter paid the laborers their wages on workdays

charity   isa what does your wisdom guess   toy why truly madam i should guess your ladyship may have some small pulse for the handsome young officer that mrs dowdy is so much afraid you should see

his name   isa upon my life thou have hit it girl i will not conceal my plot since i design thee chief instrument f you remember i told you that five years since i was in france and my mothers sister being of the romish persuasion had entered her self among the augustines in paris she overperswaded me to board there too hoping i suppose from her endeavors to make me quit my religion and profess my self a nun during my abode there this very gentleman used to make me frequent visits at the grate the first time i saw him he came a long with another that paid a compliment to a young lady of the same convent our acquaintance held near two months twas then toylet that i felt the force of love but not without a thousand protestations of the same from him but my father hearing of my aunts design and apprehending my youth for i was then not full sixteen might be prevailed upon to change my faith sent for me to england in such haste that i was not permitted to stay one hour in the monastery after the messenger arrived so had no opportunity to inform belvil of my departure   toy i presume you have kept a correspondence ever since   isa no i knew not how to direct to him he told me he had been bred in the spanishnetherlands and came to france only for his pleasure his parents he said were english and he spoke the language very well   toy nor did not you inform him of your family   isa he often pressed it and i promised to satisfy him but my fathers unexpected commands broke all our measures and from that day till i saw him here i never heard of him   toy and what is your design now madam i fear he is a man of gallantry besides you know he makes love to your cousin you cannot love him still sure   isa indeed i do nay more can love nothing else   toy what will you do with sir charles richley then who your father upon his deathbed enjoined you to marry whom he contracted you to in your childhood   isa i cannot love him it was in my nonage and the barters illegal and

accomplishments of his sex and a fair estate   isa i own it but i have a whimsical heart not to be touched with jointures and settlements   toy and if i have any skill in faces belvil is a general lover   isa no matter my conquest will be the greater to get him from them all besides i will run any risk to break this unreasonable contract   toy what you please madam i am ready to convey a letter or a message to him   isa no i have a stratagem to try his temper and fathom his inclinations i do not intend to discover my self to him till i have him within my power beyond a possibility of retreat
