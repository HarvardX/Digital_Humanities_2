   general introduction   there are few amusements more dangerous for an author than the indulgence in ironic descriptions of his own work if the irony is depreciatory posterity is but too likely to say many a true word is spoken in jest if it is encomiastic the same ruthless and ungrateful critic is but too likely to take it as an involuntary confession of folly and vanity but when fielding in one of his seriocomic introductions to tom jones described it as this prodigious work he all unintentionally for he was the least pretentious of men anticipated the verdict which posterity almost at once and with everincreasing suffrage of the best judges as time went on was about to pass not merely upon this particular book but upon his whole genius and his whole production as a novelist his work in other kinds is of a very different order of excellence it is sufficiently interesting at times in itself and always more than sufficiently interesting as his for which reasons as well as for the further one that it is comparatively little known a considerable selection from it is offered to the reader in the last two volumes of this edition until the present occasion which made it necessary that i should acquaint myself with it i own that my own knowledge of these miscellaneous writings was by no means thorough it is now pretty complete but the idea which i previously had of them at first and second hand though a little improved has not very materially altered though in all this hackwork fielding displayed partially and at intervals the same qualities which he displayed eminently and constantly in the four great books here given he was not as the french idiom expresses it dans son assiette in his own natural and impregnable disposition and situation of character and ability when he was occupied on it the novel was for him that assiette and all his novels are here  although henry fielding lived in quite modern times although by family and connections he was of a higher rank than most men of letters and although his genius was at once recognised by his contemporaries so soon as it displayed itself in its proper sphere his biography until very recently was by no means full and the most recent researches including those of mr austin dobsona critic unsurpassed for combination of literary faculty and knowledge of the eighteenth centuryhave not altogether sufficed to fill up the gaps his family said to have descended from a member of the great house of hapsburg who came to england in the reign of henry ii distinguished itself in the wars of the roses and in the seventeenth century was advanced to the peerages of denbigh in england and later of desmond in ireland the novelist was the grandson of john fielding canon of salisbury the fifth son of the first earl of desmond of this creation the canons third son edmond entered the army served under marlborough and married sarah gold or gould daughter of a judge of the kings bench their eldest son was henry who was born on april      0  and had an uncertain number of brothers and sisters of the whole blood after his first wifes death general fielding for he attained that rank married again the most remarkable offspring of the first marriage next to henry was his sister sarah also a novelist who wrote david simple of the second john afterwards sir john fielding who though blind succeeded his halfbrother as a bow street magistrate and in that office combined an equally honourable record with a longer tenure  fielding was born at sharpham park in somersetshire the seat of his maternal grandfather but most of his early youth was spent at east stour in dorsetshire to which his father removed after the judges death he is said to have received his first education under a parson of the neighbourhood named oliver in whom a very uncomplimentary tradition sees the original of parson trulliber he was then certainly sent to eton where he did not waste his time as regards learning and made several valuable friends but the dates of his entering and leaving school are alike unknown and his subsequent sojourn at leyden for two yearsthough there is no reason to doubt itdepends even less upon any positive documentary evidence this famous university still had a great repute as a training school in law for which profession he was intended but the reason why he did not receive the even then far more usual completion of a public school education by a sojourn at oxford or cambridge may be suspected to be different it may even have had something to do with a curious escapade of his about which not very much is knownan attempt to carry off a pretty heiress of lyme named sarah andrew  even at leyden however general fielding seems to have been unable or unwilling to pay his sons expenses which must have been far less there than at an english university and henrys return to london in        is said to have been due to sheer impecuniosity when he returned to england his father was good enough to make him an allowance of l 00 nominal which appears to have been equivalent to l0 actual and as practically nothing is known of him for the next six or seven years except the fact of his having worked industriously enough at a large number of not very good plays of the lighter kind with a few poems and miscellanies it is reasonably enough supposed that he lived by his pen the only product of this period which has kept or indeed which ever received competent applause is tom thumb or the tragedy of tragedies a following of course of the rehearsal but full of humour and spirit the most successful of his other dramatic works were the mock doctor and the miser adaptations of molieres famous pieces his undoubted connection with the stage and the fact of the contemporary existence of a certain timothy fielding helped suggestions of less dignified occupations as actor boothkeeper and so forth but these have long been discredited and indeed disproved  in or about      when fielding was twentyeight we find him in a new a more brilliant and agreeable but even a more transient phase he had married we do not know when or where miss charlotte cradock one of three sisters who lived at salisbury it is to be observed that fieldings entire connections both in life and letters are with the western counties and london who were certainly of competent means and for whose alleged illegitimacy there is no evidence but an unsupported fling of that old maid of genius richardson the descriptions both of sophia and of amelia are said to have been taken from this lady her good looks and her amiability are as well established as anything of the kind can be in the absence of photographs and affidavits and it is certain that her husband was passionately attached to her during their too short married life his method however of showing his affection smacked in some ways too much of the foibles which he has attributed to captain booth and of those which we must suspect mr thomas jones would also have exhibited if he had not been adopted as mr allworthys heir and had not had mr westerns fortune to share and look forward to it is true that grave breaches have been made by recent criticism in the very picturesque and circumstantial story told on the subject by murphy the first of fieldings biographers this legend was that fielding having succeeded by the death of his mother to a small estate at east stour worth about l 00 a year and having received l  00 in ready money as his wifes fortune got through the whole in three years by keeping open house with a large retinue in costly yellow liveries and so forth in details this story has been simply riddled his mother had died long before he was certainly not away from london three years or anything like it and so forth at the same time the best and soberest judges agree that there is an intrinsic probability a consensus if a vague one of tradition and a chain of almost unmistakably personal references in the novels which plead for a certain amount of truth at the bottom of a much embellished legend at any rate if fielding established himself in the country it was not long before he returned to town for early in      we find him back again and not merely a playwright but lessee of the little theatre in the haymarket the plays which he produced heresatiricopolitical pieces such as pasquin and the historical registerwere popular enough but offended the government and in      a new bill regulating theatrical performances and instituting the lord chamberlains control was passed this measure put an end directly to the great moguls company as fielding had called his troop and indirectly to its managers career as a playwright he did indeed write a few pieces in future years but they were of the smallest importance  after this check he turned at last to a serious profession entered himself of the middle temple in november of the same year and was called three years later but during these years and indeed for some time afterwards our information about him is still of the vaguest character nobody doubts that he had a large share in the champion an essayperiodical on the usual eighteenthcentury model which began to appear in      and which is still occasionally consulted for the work that is certainly or probably his he went the western circuit and attended the wiltshire sessions after he was called giving up his contributions to periodicals soon after that event but he soon returned to literature proper or rather made his debut in it with the immortal book now republished the history of the adventures of joseph andrews and his friend mr abraham adams appeared in february      and its author received from andrew millar the publisher the sum of l      s even greater works have fetched much smaller sums but it will be admitted that joseph andrews was not dear  the advantage however of presenting a survey of an authors life uninterrupted by criticism is so clear that what has to be said about joseph may be conveniently postponed for the moment immediately after its publication the author fell back upon miscellaneous writing and in the next year      collected and issued three volumes of miscellanies in the two first volumes the only thing of much interest is the unfinished and unequal but in part powerful journey from this world to the next an attempt of a kind which fontenelle and others following lucian had made very popular with the time but the third volume of the miscellanies deserved a less modest and gregarious appearance for it contained and is wholly occupied by the wonderful and terrible satire of jonathan wild the greatest piece of pure irony in english out of swift soon after the publication of the book a great calamity came on fielding his wife had been very ill when he wrote the preface soon afterwards she was dead they had taken the chance had made the choice that the more prudent and less wise studenthero and heroine of mr brownings youth and art had shunned they had no doubt sighed deep laughed free starved feasted despaired and we need not question that they had also been happy  except this sad event and its rather incongruous sequel fieldings marriage to his wifes maid mary daniela marriage however which did not take place till full four years later and which by all accounts supplied him with a faithful and excellent companion and nurse and his children with a kind stepmotherlittle or nothing is again known of this elusive man of genius between the publication of the miscellanies in      and that of tom jones in      the second marriage itself in november      an interview which joseph warton had with him rather more than a year earlier one of the very few direct interviews we have the publication of two antijacobite newspapers fielding was always a strong whig and hanoverian called the true patriot and the jacobites journal in      and the following years some indistinct traditions about residences at twickenham and elsewhere and some more precise but not much more authenticated respecting patronage by the duke of bedford mr lyttelton mr allen and others pretty well sum up the whole  tom jones was published in february a favourite month with fielding or his publisher millar      and as it brought him the for those days very considerable sum of l 00 to which millar added another hundred later the novelist must have been for a time at any rate relieved from his chronic penury but he had already by lytteltons interest secured his first and last piece of preferment being made justice of the peace for westminster an office on which he entered with characteristic vigour he was qualified for it not merely by a solid knowledge of the law and by great natural abilities but by his thorough kindness of heart and perhaps it may also be added by his long years of queer experience on as mr carlyle would have said the burning marl of the london bohemia very shortly afterwards he was chosen chairman of quarter sessions and established himself in bow street the bow street magistrate of that time occupied a most singular position and was more like a french prefect of police or even a minister of public safety than a mere justice yet he was ill paid fielding says that the emoluments which before his accession had but been l 00 a year of dirty money were by his own action but l 00 of clean and the work if properly performed was very severe  that he performed it properly all competent evidence shows a foolish inconclusive and i fear it must be said emphatically snobbish story of walpoles notwithstanding in particular he broke up a gang of cutthroat thieves which had been the terror of london but his tenure of the post was short enough and scarcely extended to five years his health had long been broken and he was now constantly attacked by gout so that he had frequently to retreat on bath from bow street or his suburban cottage of fordhook ealing but he did not relax his literary work his pen was active with pamphlets concerning his office amelia his last novel appeared towards the close of      and next year saw the beginning of a new paper the covent garden journal which appeared twice a week ran for the greater part of the year and died in november its great author did not see that month twice again in the spring of      he grew worse and after a years struggle with ill health hard work and hard weather lesser measures being pronounced useless was persuaded to try the portugal voyage of which he has left so charming a record in the journey to lisbon he left fordhook on june         reached lisbon in august and dying there on the  th of october was buried in the cemetery of the estrella  of not many writers perhaps does a clearer notion as far as their personality goes exist in the general mind that interests itself at all in literature than of fielding yet more than once a warning has been sounded especially by his best and most recent biographer to the effect that this idea is founded upon very little warranty of scripture the truth is that as the foregoing recordwhich brief as it is is a sufficiently faithful summarywill have shown we know very little about fielding we have hardly any letters of his and so lack the best by far and the most revealing of all characterportraits we have but one important autobiographic fragment and though that is of the highest interest and value it was written far in the valley of the shadow of death it is not in the least retrospective and it affords but dim and inferential light on his younger healthier and happier days and ways he came moreover just short of one set of men of letters of whom we have a great deal of personal knowledge and just beyond another he was neither of those about addison nor of those about johnson no intimate friend of his has left us anything elaborate about him on the other hand we have a far from inconsiderable body of documentary evidence of a kind often by no means trustworthy the best part of it is contained in the letters of his cousin lady mary wortley montagu and the reminiscences or family traditions of her granddaughter lady louisa stuart but lady mary vivacious and agreeable as she is had with all her talent a very considerable knack of writing for effect of drawing strong contrasts and the like and it is not quite certain that she saw very much of fielding in the last and most interesting third of his life another witness horace walpole to less knowledge and equally dubious accuracy added decided illwill which may have been due partly to the shrinking of a dilettante and a fop from a burly bohemian but i fear is also consequent upon the fact that horace could not afford to despise fieldings birth and knew him to be vastly his own superior in genius we hear something of him again from richardson and richardson hated him with the hatred of dissimilar genius of inferior social position and lastly of the cat for the dog who touzles and worries her johnson partly inherited or shared richardsons aversion partly was blinded to fieldings genius by his aggressive whiggery i fear too that he was incapable of appreciating it for reasons other than political it is certain that johnson sane and robust as he was was never quite at ease before genius of the gigantic kind either in dead or living whether he did not like to have to look up too much or was actually unable to do so it is certain that shakespeare milton swift and fielding those four atlantes of english verse and prose all affected him with lukewarm admiration or with positive dislike for which it is vain to attempt to assign any uniform secondary cause political or other it may be permitted to hint another reason all johnsons most sharpsighted critics have noticed though most have discreetly refrained from insisting on his thornintheflesh the combination in him of very strong physical passions with the deepest sense of the moral and religious duty of abstinence it is perhaps impossible to imagine anything more distasteful to a man so buffeted than the extreme indulgence with which fielding regards and the easy freedom not to say gusto with which he depicts those who succumb to similar temptation only by supposing the workings of some subtle influence of this kind is it possible to explain even in so capricious a humour as johnsons the famous and absurd application of the term barren rascal to a writer who dying almost young after having for many years lived a life of pleasure and then for four or five one of laborious official duty has left work anything but small in actual bulk and fertile with the most luxuriant growth of intellectual originality  partly on the obiter dicta of persons like these partly on the still more tempting and still more treacherous ground of indications drawn from his works a fielding of fantasy has been constructed which in thackerays admirable sketch attains real life and immortality as a creature of art but which possesses rather dubious claims as a historical character it is astonishing how this fielding of fantasy sinks and shrivels when we begin to apply the horrid tests of criticism to his component parts the eidolon with inked ruffles and a towel round his head sits in the temple and dashes off articles for the covent garden journal then comes criticism hellish maid and reminds us that when the covent garden journal appeared fieldings wild oats if ever sown at all had been sown long ago that he was a busy magistrate and householder in bow street and that if he had towels round his head it was probably less because he had exceeded in liquor than because his grace of newcastle had given him a headache by wanting elaborate plans and schemes prepared at an hours notice lady mary apparently with some envy tells us that he could feel rapture with his cookmaid which many has as mr ridley remarks from xanthias phoceus downwards but when we remember the historic fact that he married this maid not a cookmaid at all and that though he always speaks of her with warm affection and hearty respect such raptures as we have of his clearly refer to a very different woman who was both a lady and a beautiful one we begin a little to shake our heads horace walpole at secondhand draws us a fielding pigging with low companions in a house kept like a hedge tavern fielding himself within a year or two shows us more than halfundesignedly in the voyage to lisbon that he was very careful about the appointments and decency of his table that he stood rather upon ceremony in regard to his own treatment of his family and the treatment of them and himself by others and that he was altogether a person orderly correct and even a little finikin nor is there the slightest reasonable reason to regard this as a piece of hypocrisy a vice as alien from the fielding of fancy as from the fielding of fact and one the particular manifestation of which in this particular place would have been equally unlikely and unintelligible  it may be asked whether i propose to substitute for the traditional fielding a quite different person of regular habits and methodical economy certainly not the traditional estimate of great men is rarely wrong altogether but it constantly has a habit of exaggerating and dramatising their characteristics for some things in fieldings career we have positive evidence of document and evidence hardly less certain of probability although i believe the best judges are now of opinion that his impecuniosity has been overcharged he certainly had experiences which did not often fall to the lot of even a cadet of good family in the eighteenth century there can be no reasonable doubt that he was a man who had a leaning towards pretty girls and bottles of good wine and i should suppose that if the girl were kind and fairly winsome he would not have insisted that she should possess helens beauty that if the bottle of good wine were not forthcoming he would have been very tolerant of a mug of good ale he may very possibly have drunk more than he should and lost more than he could conveniently pay it may be put down as morally ascertained that towards all these weaknesses of humanity and others like unto them he held an attitude which was less that of the unassailable philosopher than that of the sympathiser indulgent and excusing in regard more especially to what are commonly called moral delinquencies this attitude was so decided as to shock some people even in those days and many in these just when the first sheets of this edition were passing through the press a violent attack was made in a newspaper correspondence on the morality of tom jones by certain notorious advocates of purity as some say of pruriency and prudery combined according to less complimentary estimates even midway between the two periods we find the admirable miss ferrier a sister of fieldings own craft who sometimes had touches of nature and satire not far inferior to his own expressing by the mouth of one of her characters with whom she seems partly to agree the sentiment that his works are vanishing like noxious exhalations towards any misdoing by persons of the one sex towards persons of the other when it involved brutality or treachery fielding was pitiless but when treachery and brutality were not concerned he was to say the least facile so too he probably knew by experiencehe certainly knew by native shrewdness and acquired observationthat to look too much on the wine when it is red or on the cards when they are particoloured is ruinous to health and fortune but he thought not over badly of any man who did these things still it is possible to admit this in him and to stop short of that idea of a careless and reckless viveur which has so often been put forward in particular lady marys view of his childlike enjoyment of the moment has been i think much exaggerated by posterity and was probably not a little mistaken by the lady herself there are two moods in which the motto is carpe diem one a mood of simply childish hurry the other one where behind the enjoyment of the moment lurks and in which the enjoyment of the moment is not a little heightened by that vast ironic consciousness of the before and after which i at least see everywhere in the background of fieldings work  the man however of whom we know so little concerns us much less than the author of the works of which it only rests with ourselves to know everything i have above classed fielding as one of the four atlantes of english verse and prose and i doubt not that both the phrase and the application of it to him will meet with question and demur i have only to interject as the critic so often has to interject a request to the court to take what i say in the sense in which i say it i do not mean that shakespeare milton swift and fielding are in all or even in most respects on a level i do not mean that the three last are in all respects of the greatest names in english literature i only mean that in a certain quality which for want of a better word i have chosen to call atlantean they stand alone each of them for the metaphor is applicable either way carries a whole world on his shoulders or looks down on a whole world from his natural altitude the worlds are different but they are worlds and though the attitude of the giants is different also it agrees in all of them on the points of competence and strength take whomsoever else we may among our men of letters and we shall find this characteristic to be in comparison wanting these four carry their world and are not carried by it and if it in the language so dear to fielding himself were to crash and shatter the inquiry que vous restetil could be answered by each moi  the appearance which fielding makes is no doubt the most modest of the four he has not shakespeares absolute universality and in fact not merely the poets tongue but the poets thought seems to have been denied him his sphere is not the ideal like miltons his irony splendid as it is falls a little short of that diabolical magnificence which exalts swift to the point whence in his own way he surveys all the kingdoms of the world and the glory or vainglory of them all fieldings critics have noted the manner in a certain sense modest in another ostentatious in which he seems to confine himself to the presentation of things english they might have added to the presentation of things englishas they appear in london and on the western circuit and on the bath road  but this apparent parochialism has never deceived good judges it did not deceive lady mary who had seen the men and manners of very many climes it did not deceive gibbon who was not especially prone to overvalue things english and who could look down from twenty centuries on things ephemeral it deceives indeed i am told some excellent persons at the present day who think fieldings microcosm a toylike world and imagine that russian nihilists and french naturalists have gone beyond it it will deceive no one who has lived for some competent space of time a life during which he has tried to regard his fellowcreatures and himself as nearly as a mortal may sub specie aeternitatis  as this is in the main an introduction to a complete reprint of fieldings four great novels the justification in detail of the estimate just made or hinted of the novelists genius will be best and most fitly made by a brief successive discussion of the four as they are here presented with some subsequent remarks on the miscellanies here selected and indeed it is not fanciful to perceive in each book a somewhat different presentment of the authors genius though in no one of the four is any one of his masterly qualities absent there is tenderness even in jonathan wild there are touches in joseph andrews of that irony of the preacher the last echo of which is heard amid the kindly resignation of the journey to lisbon in the sentence whereas envy of all things most exposes us to danger from others so contempt of all things best secures us from them but on the whole it is safe to say that joseph andrews best presents fieldings mischievous and playful wit jonathan wild his halflucianic halfswiftian irony tom jones his unerring knowledge of human nature and his constructive faculty amelia his tenderness his mitis sapientia his observation of the details of life and first of the first  the history of the adventures of joseph andrews and his friend mr abraham adams was as has been said above published in february      a facsimile of the agreement between author and publisher will be given in the second volume of this series and it is not uninteresting to observe that the witness william young is none other than the asserted original of the immortal mr adams himself he might on balzacs plea in a tolerably wellknown anecdote have demanded half of the l      s of the other origins of the book we have a pretty full account partly documentary that it is writ in the manner of cervantes and is intended as a kind of comic epic is the authors own statementno doubt as near the actual truth as is consistent with comicepic theory that there are resemblances to scarron to le sage and to other practitioners of the picaresque novel is certain and it was inevitable that there should be of directer and more immediate models or startingpoints one is undoubted the other though less generally admitted not much less indubitable to my mind the parody of richardsons pamela which was little more than a year earlier nov    0 is avowed open flagrant nor do i think that the author was so soon carried away by the greater and larger tide of his own invention as some critics seem to hold he is always more or less returning to the ironic charge and the multiplicity of the assailants of josephs virtue only disguises the resemblance to the longdrawn dangers of pamela from a single ravisher but fielding was also well acquainted with marivauxs paysan parvenu and the resemblances between that book and joseph andrews are much stronger than fieldings admirers have always been willing to admit this recalcitrance has i think been mainly due to the erroneous conception of marivaux as if not a mere fribble yet a dresdenshepherdess kind of writer good at preciousness and patchandpowder manners but nothing more  there was in fact a very strong satiric and ironic touch in the author of marianne and i do not think that i was too rash when some years ago i ventured to speak of him as playing fielding to his own richardson in the paysan parvenu  origins however and indebtedness and the like are when great work is concerned questions for the study and the lectureroom for the literary historian and the professional critic rather than for the reader however intelligent and alert who wishes to enjoy a masterpiece and is content simply to enjoy it it does not really matter how close to anything else something which possesses independent goodness is the very utmost technical originality the most spotless purity from the faintest taint of suggestion will not suffice to confer merit on what does not otherwise possess it whether as i rather think fielding pursued the plan he had formed ab incepto or whether he cavalierly neglected it or whether the current of his own genius carried him off his legs and landed him half against his will on the shore of originality are questions for the schools and as i venture to think not for the higher forms in them we have joseph andrews as it is and we may be abundantly thankful for it the contents of it as of all fieldings work in this kind include certain things for which the moderns are scantly grateful of late years and not of late years only there has grown up a singular and perhaps an ignorant impatience of digressions of episodes of tales within a tale the example of this which has been most maltreated is the man of the hill episode in tom jones but the stories of the unfortunate jilt and of mr wilson in our present subject do not appear to me to be much less obnoxious to the censure and amelia contains more than one or two things of the same kind me they do not greatly disturb and i see many defences for them besides the obvious and at a pinch sufficient one that divagations of this kind existed in all fieldings spanish and french models that the public of the day expected them and so forth this defence is enough but it is easy to amplify and reintrench it it is not by any means the fact that the picaresque novel of adventure is the only or the chief form of fiction which prescribes or admits these episodic excursions all the classical epics have them many eastern and other stories present them they are common if not invariable in the abundant mediaeval literature of prose and verse romance they are not unknown by any means in the modern novel and you will very rarely hear a story told orally at the dinnertable or in the smokingroom without something of the kind there must therefore be something in them corresponding to an inseparable accident of that most unchanging of all things human nature and i do not think the special form with which we are here concerned by any means the worst that they have taken it has the grand and prominent virtue of being at once and easily skippable there is about cervantes and le sage about fielding and smollett none of the treachery of the modern novelist who induces the conscientious reader to drag through pages chapters and sometimes volumes which have nothing to do with the action for fear he should miss something that has to do with it these great men have a fearless frankness and almost tell you in so many words when and what you may skip therefore if the curious impertinent and the baneful marriage and the man of the hill and the lady of quality get in the way when you desire to read for the story you have nothing to do but turn the page till finis comes the defence has already been made by an illustrious hand for fieldings interchapters and exordiums it appears to me to be almost more applicable to his insertions  and so we need not trouble ourselves any more either about the insertions or about the exordiums they both please me the second class has pleased persons much better worth pleasing than i can pretend to be but the making or marring of the book lies elsewhere i do not think that it lies in the construction though fieldings following of the ancients both sincere and satiric has imposed a false air of regularity upon that the odyssey of joseph of fanny and of their ghostly mentor and bodily guard is in truth a little haphazard and might have been longer or shorter without any discreet man approving it the more or the less therefor the real merits lie partly in the abounding humour and satire of the artists criticism but even more in the marvellous vivacity and fertility of his creation for the very first time in english prose fiction every character is alive every incident is capable of having happened there are lively touches in the elizabethan romances but they are buried in verbiage swathed in stage costume choked and fettered by their authors want of art the quality of bunyans knowledge of men was not much inferior to shakespeares or at least to fieldings but the range and the results of it were cramped by his single theological purpose and his unvaried allegoric or typical form why defoe did not discover the new world of fiction i at least have never been able to put into any brief critical formula that satisfies me and i have never seen it put by any one else he had not only seen it afar off he had made landings and descents on it he had carried off and exhibited in triumph natives such as robinson crusoe as man friday as moll flanders as william the quaker but he had conquered subdued and settled no province therein i like pamela i like it better than some persons who admire richardson on the whole more than i do seem to like it but as in all its authors work the handling seems to me academicthe working out on paper of an ingeniously conceived problem rather than the observation or evolution of actual or possible life i should not greatly fear to push the comparison even into foreign countries but it is well to observe limits let us be content with holding that in england at least without prejudice to anything further fielding was the first to display the qualities of the perfect novelist as distinguished from the romancer  what are those qualities as shown in joseph andrews the faculty of arranging a probable and interesting course of action is one of course and fielding showed it here but i do not think that it is at any time the greatest one and nobody denies that he made great advances in this direction later the faculty of lively dialogue is another and that he has not often been refused but much the same may be said of it the interspersing of appropriate description is another but here also we shall not find him exactly a paragon it is in characterthe chief differentia of the novel as distinguished not merely from its elder sister the romance and its cousin the drama but still more from every other kind of literaturethat fielding stands even here preeminent no one that i can think of except his greatest successor in the present century has the same unfailing gift of breathing life into every character he creates or borrows and even thackeray draws if i may use the phrase his characters more in the flat and less in the round than fielding whether in blifil he once failed we must discuss hereafter he has failed nowhere in joseph andrews some of his sketches may require the caution that they are eighteenthcentury men and women some the warning that they are obviously caricatured or set in designed profile or merely sketched but they are all alive the finical estimate of gray it is a horrid joy to think how perfectly capable fielding was of having joined in that practical joke of the young gentlemen of cambridge which made gray change his college while dismissing these light things with patronage had to admit that parson adams is perfectly well so is mrs slipslop they were mr gray said some one once they were more perfectly well and in a higher kind than anything you ever did though you were a pretty workman too  yes parson adams is perfectly well and so is mrs slipslop but so are they all even the hero and heroine tied and bound as they are by the necessity under which their maker lay of preserving josephs josephhood and of making fanny the example of a franker and less interested virtue than her sisterinlaw that might have been are surprisingly human where most writers would have made them sticks and the rest require no allowance lady booby few as are the strokes given to her is not much less alive than lady bellaston mr trulliber monster and not at all delicate monster as he is is also a man and when he lays it down that no one even in his own house shall drink when he caaled vurst one can but pay his maker the tribute of that silent shudder of admiration which hails the addition of one more everlasting entity to the world of thought and fancy and mr towwouse is real and mrs towwouse is more real still and betty is real and the coachman and miss graveairs and all the wonderful crew from first to last the dresses they wear the manners they exhibit the laws they live under the very foods and drinks they live upon are past like the shadows on glassesto the comfort and rejoicing of some to the greater or less sorrow of others but they are therealive full of blood full of breath as we are and in truth i fear a little more so for some purposes a century is a gap harder to cross and more estranging than a couple of millenniums but in their case the gap is nothing and it is not too much to say that as they have stood the harder test they will stand the easier there are very striking differences between nausicaa and mrs slipslop there are differences not less striking between mrs slipslop and beatrice but their likeness is a stranger and more wonderful thing than any of their unlikenesses it is that they are all women that they are all live citizenesses of the land of matters unforgot the fashion whereof passeth not away and the franchise whereof once acquired assures immortality    note to general introduction   the text of this issue in the main follows that of the standard or first collected edition of      the variants which the author introduced in successive editions during his lifetime are not inconsiderable but for the purposes of the present issue it did not seem necessary or indeed desirable to take account of them in the case of prose fiction more than in any other department of literature it is desirable that work should be read in the form which represents the completest intention and execution of the author nor have any notes been attempted for again such things in the case of prose fiction are of very doubtful use and supply pretty certain stumblingblocks to enjoyment while in the particular case of fielding the annotation unless extremely capricious would have to be disgustingly full far be it at any rate from the present editor to bury these delightful creations under an ugly crust of parallel passages and miscellaneous erudition the sheets however have been carefully read in order to prevent the casual errors which are wont to creep into frequently reprinted texts and the editor hopes that if any such have escaped him the escape will not be attributed to wilful negligence a few obvious errors in spelling of proper names c which occur in the      version have been corrected but wherever the readings of that version are possible they have been preferred the embellishments of the edition are partly fanciful and partly documentary so that it is hoped both classes of taste may have something to feed upon     authors preface   as it is possible the mere english reader may have a different idea of romance from the author of these littlea volumes and may consequently expect a kind of entertainment not to be found nor which was even intended in the following pages it may not be improper to premise a few words concerning this kind of writing which i do not remember to have seen hitherto attempted in our language  a joseph andrews was originally published in   vols duodecimo  the epic as well as the drama is divided into tragedy and comedy homer who was the father of this species of poetry gave us a pattern of both these though that of the latter kind is entirely lost which aristotle tells us bore the same relation to comedy which his iliad bears to tragedy and perhaps that we have no more instances of it among the writers of antiquity is owing to the loss of this great pattern which had it survived would have found its imitators equally with the other poems of this great original  and farther as this poetry may be tragic or comic i will not scruple to say it may be likewise either in verse or prose for though it wants one particular which the critic enumerates in the constituent parts of an epic poem namely metre yet when any kind of writing contains all its other parts such as fable action characters sentiments and diction and is deficient in metre only it seems i think reasonable to refer it to the epic at least as no critic hath thought proper to range it under any other head or to assign it a particular name to itself  thus the telemachus of the archbishop of cambray appears to me of the epic kind as well as the odyssey of homer indeed it is much fairer and more reasonable to give it a name common with that species from which it differs only in a single instance than to confound it with those which it resembles in no other such are those voluminous works commonly called romances namely clelia cleopatra astraea cassandra the grand cyrus and innumerable others which contain as i apprehend very little instruction or entertainment  now a comic romance is a comic epic poem in prose differing from comedy as the serious epic from tragedy its action being more extended and comprehensive containing a much larger circle of incidents and introducing a greater variety of characters it differs from the serious romance in its fable and action in this that as in the one these are grave and solemn so in the other they are light and ridiculous it differs in its characters by introducing persons of inferior rank and consequently of inferior manners whereas the grave romance sets the highest before us lastly in its sentiments and diction by preserving the ludicrous instead of the sublime in the diction i think burlesque itself may be sometimes admitted of which many instances will occur in this work as in the description of the battles and some other places not necessary to be pointed out to the classical reader for whose entertainment those parodies or burlesque imitations are chiefly calculated  but though we have sometimes admitted this in our diction we have carefully excluded it from our sentiments and characters for there it is never properly introduced unless in writings of the burlesque kind which this is not intended to be indeed no two species of writing can differ more widely than the comic and the burlesque for as the latter is ever the exhibition of what is monstrous and unnatural and where our delight if we examine it arises from the surprizing absurdity as in appropriating the manners of the highest to the lowest or e converso so in the former we should ever confine ourselves strictly to nature from the just imitation of which will flow all the pleasure we can this way convey to a sensible reader and perhaps there is one reason why a comic writer should of all others be the least excused for deviating from nature since it may not be always so easy for a serious poet to meet with the great and the admirable but life everywhere furnishes an accurate observer with the ridiculous  i have hinted this little concerning burlesque because i have often heard that name given to performances which have been truly of the comic kind from the authors having sometimes admitted it in his diction only which as it is the dress of poetry doth like the dress of men establish characters the one of the whole poem and the other of the whole man in vulgar opinion beyond any of their greater excellences but surely a certain drollery in stile where characters and sentiments are perfectly natural no more constitutes the burlesque than an empty pomp and dignity of words where everything else is mean and low can entitle any performance to the appellation of the true sublime  and i apprehend my lord shaftesburys opinion of mere burlesque agrees with mine when he asserts there is no such thing to be found in the writings of the ancients but perhaps i have less abhorrence than he professes for it and that not because i have had some little success on the stage this way but rather as it contributes more to exquisite mirth and laughter than any other and these are probably more wholesome physic for the mind and conduce better to purge away spleen melancholy and ill affections than is generally imagined nay i will appeal to common observation whether the same companies are not found more full of goodhumour and benevolence after they have been sweetened for two or three hours with entertainments of this kind than when soured by a tragedy or a grave lecture  but to illustrate all this by another science in which perhaps we shall see the distinction more clearly and plainly let us examine the works of a comic history painter with those performances which the italians call caricatura where we shall find the true excellence of the former to consist in the exactest copying of nature insomuch that a judicious eye instantly rejects anything outre any liberty which the painter hath taken with the features of that alma mater whereas in the caricatura we allow all licenceits aim is to exhibit monsters not men and all distortions and exaggerations whatever are within its proper province  now what caricatura is in painting burlesque is in writing and in the same manner the comic writer and painter correlate to each other and here i shall observe that as in the former the painter seems to have the advantage so it is in the latter infinitely on the side of the writer for the monstrous is much easier to paint than describe and the ridiculous to describe than paint  and though perhaps this latter species doth not in either science so strongly affect and agitate the muscles as the other yet it will be owned i believe that a more rational and useful pleasure arises to us from it he who should call the ingenious hogarth a burlesque painter would in my opinion do him very little honour for sure it is much easier much less the subject of admiration to paint a man with a nose or any other feature of a preposterous size or to expose him in some absurd or monstrous attitude than to express the affections of men on canvas it hath been thought a vast commendation of a painter to say his figures seem to breathe but surely it is a much greater and nobler applause that they appear to think  but to return the ridiculous only as i have before said falls within my province in the present work nor will some explanation of this word be thought impertinent by the reader if he considers how wonderfully it hath been mistaken even by writers who have professed it for to what but such a mistake can we attribute the many attempts to ridicule the blackest villanies and what is yet worse the most dreadful calamities what could exceed the absurdity of an author who should write the comedy of nero with the merry incident of ripping up his mothers belly or what would give a greater shock to humanity than an attempt to expose the miseries of poverty and distress to ridicule and yet the reader will not want much learning to suggest such instances to himself  besides it may seem remarkable that aristotle who is so fond and free of definitions hath not thought proper to define the ridiculous indeed where he tells us it is proper to comedy he hath remarked that villany is not its object but he hath not as i remember positively asserted what is nor doth the abbe bellegarde who hath written a treatise on this subject though he shows us many species of it once trace it to its fountain  the only source of the true ridiculous as it appears to me is affectation but though it arises from one spring only when we consider the infinite streams into which this one branches we shall presently cease to admire at the copious field it affords to an observer now affectation proceeds from one of these two causes vanity or hypocrisy for as vanity puts us on affecting false characters in order to purchase applause so hypocrisy sets us on an endeavour to avoid censure by concealing our vices under an appearance of their opposite virtues and though these two causes are often confounded for there is some difficulty in distinguishing them yet as they proceed from very different motives so they are as clearly distinct in their operations for indeed the affectation which arises from vanity is nearer to truth than the other as it hath not that violent repugnancy of nature to struggle with which that of the hypocrite hath it may be likewise noted that affectation doth not imply an absolute negation of those qualities which are affected and therefore though when it proceeds from hypocrisy it be nearly allied to deceit yet when it comes from vanity only it partakes of the nature of ostentation for instance the affectation of liberality in a vain man differs visibly from the same affectation in the avaricious for though the vain man is not what he would appear or hath not the virtue he affects to the degree he would be thought to have it yet it sits less awkwardly on him than on the avaricious man who is the very reverse of what he would seem to be  from the discovery of this affectation arises the ridiculous which always strikes the reader with surprize and pleasure and that in a higher and stronger degree when the affectation arises from hypocrisy than when from vanity for to discover any one to be the exact reverse of what he affects is more surprizing and consequently more ridiculous than to find him a little deficient in the quality he desires the reputation of i might observe that our ben jonson who of all men understood the ridiculous the best hath chiefly used the hypocritical affectation  now from affectation only the misfortunes and calamities of life or the imperfections of nature may become the objects of ridicule surely he hath a very illframed mind who can look on ugliness infirmity or poverty as ridiculous in themselves nor do i believe any man living who meets a dirty fellow riding through the streets in a cart is struck with an idea of the ridiculous from it but if he should see the same figure descend from his coach and six or bolt from his chair with his hat under his arm he would then begin to laugh and with justice in the same manner were we to enter a poor house and behold a wretched family shivering with cold and languishing with hunger it would not incline us to laughter at least we must have very diabolical natures if it would but should we discover there a grate instead of coals adorned with flowers empty plate or china dishes on the sideboard or any other affectation of riches and finery either on their persons or in their furniture we might then indeed be excused for ridiculing so fantastical an appearance much less are natural imperfections the object of derision but when ugliness aims at the applause of beauty or lameness endeavours to display agility it is then that these unfortunate circumstances which at first moved our compassion tend only to raise our mirth  the poet carries this very far      none are for being what they are in fault     but for not being what they would be thought  where if the metre would suffer the word ridiculous to close the first line the thought would be rather more proper great vices are the proper objects of our detestation smaller faults of our pity but affectation appears to me the only true source of the ridiculous  but perhaps it may be objected to me that i have against my own rules introduced vices and of a very black kind into this work to which i shall answer first that it is very difficult to pursue a series of human actions and keep clear from them secondly that the vices to be found here are rather the accidental consequences of some human frailty or foible than causes habitually existing in the mind thirdly that they are never set forth as the objects of ridicule but detestation fourthly that they are never the principal figure at that time on the scene and lastly they never produce the intended evil  having thus distinguished joseph andrews from the productions of romance writers on the one hand and burlesque writers on the other and given some few very short hints for i intended no more of this species of writing which i have affirmed to be hitherto unattempted in our language i shall leave to my goodnatured reader to apply my piece to my observations and will detain him no longer than with a word concerning the characters in this work  and here i solemnly protest i have no intention to vilify or asperse any one for though everything is copied from the book of nature and scarce a character or action produced which i have not taken from my i own observations and experience yet i have used the utmost care to obscure the persons by such different circumstances degrees and colours that it will be impossible to guess at them with any degree of certainty and if it ever happens otherwise it is only where the failure characterized is so minute that it is a foible only which the party himself may laugh at as well as any other  as to the character of adams as it is the most glaring in the whole so i conceive it is not to be found in any book now extant it is designed a character of perfect simplicity and as the goodness of his heart will recommend him to the goodnatured so i hope it will excuse me to the gentlemen of his cloth for whom while they are worthy of their sacred order no man can possibly have a greater respect they will therefore excuse me notwithstanding the low adventures in which he is engaged that i have made him a clergyman since no other office could have given him so many opportunities of displaying his worthy inclinations     the history of the adventures of joseph andrews and his friend mr abraham adams     book i    chapter i  of writing lives in general and particularly of pamela with a word by the bye of colley cibber and others   it is a trite but true observation that examples work more forcibly on the mind than precepts and if this be just in what is odious and blameable it is more strongly so in what is amiable and praiseworthy here emulation most effectually operates upon us and inspires our imitation in an irresistible manner a good man therefore is a standing lesson to all his acquaintance and of far greater use in that narrow circle than a good book  but as it often happens that the best men are but little known and consequently cannot extend the usefulness of their examples a great way the writer may be called in aid to spread their history farther and to present the amiable pictures to those who have not the happiness of knowing the originals and so by communicating such valuable patterns to the world he may perhaps do a more extensive service to mankind than the person whose life originally afforded the pattern  in this light i have always regarded those biographers who have recorded the actions of great and worthy persons of both sexes not to mention those antient writers which of late days are little read being written in obsolete and as they are generally thought unintelligible languages such as plutarch nepos and others which i heard of in my youth our own language affords many of excellent use and instruction finely calculated to sow the seeds of virtue in youth and very easy to be comprehended by persons of moderate capacity such as the history of john the great who by his brave and heroic actions against men of large and athletic bodies obtained the glorious appellation of the giantkiller that of an earl of warwick whose christian name was guy the lives of argalus and parthenia and above all the history of those seven worthy personages the champions of christendom in all these delight is mixed with instruction and the reader is almost as much improved as entertained  but i pass by these and many others to mention two books lately published which represent an admirable pattern of the amiable in either sex the former of these which deals in male virtue was written by the great person himself who lived the life he hath recorded and is by many thought to have lived such a life only in order to write it the other is communicated to us by an historian who borrows his lights as the common method is from authentic papers and records the reader i believe already conjectures i mean the lives of mr colley cibber and of mrs pamela andrews how artfully doth the former by insinuating that he escaped being promoted to the highest stations in church and state teach us a contempt of worldly grandeur how strongly doth he inculcate an absolute submission to our superiors lastly how completely doth he arm us against so uneasy so wretched a passion as the fear of shame how clearly doth he expose the emptiness and vanity of that phantom reputation  what the female readers are taught by the memoirs of mrs andrews is so well set forth in the excellent essays or letters prefixed to the second and subsequent editions of that work that it would be here a needless repetition the authentic history with which i now present the public is an instance of the great good that book is likely to do and of the prevalence of example which i have just observed since it will appear that it was by keeping the excellent pattern of his sisters virtues before his eyes that mr joseph andrews was chiefly enabled to preserve his purity in the midst of such great temptations i shall only add that this character of male chastity though doubtless as desirable and becoming in one part of the human species as in the other is almost the only virtue which the great apologist hath not given himself for the sake of giving the example to his readers    chapter ii  of mr joseph andrews his birth parentage education and great endowments with a word or two concerning ancestors   mr joseph andrews the hero of our ensuing history was esteemed to be the only son of gaffar and gammer andrews and brother to the illustrious pamela whose virtue is at present so famous as to his ancestors we have searched with great diligence but little success being unable to trace them farther than his greatgrandfather who as an elderly person in the parish remembers to have heard his father say was an excellent cudgelplayer whether he had any ancestors before this we must leave to the opinion of our curious reader finding nothing of sufficient certainty to rely on however we cannot omit inserting an epitaph which an ingenious friend of ours hath communicated      stay traveller for underneath this pew     lies fast asleep that merry man andrew     when the last days great sun shall gild the skies     then he shall from his tomb get up and rise     be merry while thou canst for surely thou     shalt shortly be as sad as he is now  the words are almost out of the stone with antiquity but it is needless to observe that andrew here is writ without an s and is besides a christian name my friend moreover conjectures this to have been the founder of that sect of laughing philosophers since called merryandrews  to waive therefore a circumstance which though mentioned in conformity to the exact rules of biography is not greatly material i proceed to things of more consequence indeed it is sufficiently certain that he had as many ancestors as the best man living and perhaps if we look five or six hundred years backwards might be related to some persons of very great figure at present whose ancestors within half the last century are buried in as great obscurity but suppose for arguments sake we should admit that he had no ancestors at all but had sprung up according to the modern phrase out of a dunghill as the athenians pretended they themselves did from the earth would not this autokoprosa have been justly entitled to all the praise arising from his own virtues would it not be hard that a man who hath no ancestors should therefore be rendered incapable of acquiring honour when we see so many who have no virtues enjoying the honour of their forefathers at ten years old by which time his education was advanced to writing and reading he was bound an apprentice according to the statute to sir thomas booby an uncle of mr boobys by the fathers side sir thomas having then an estate in his own hands the young andrews was at first employed in what in the country they call keeping birds his office was to perform the part the ancients assigned to the god priapus which deity the moderns call by the name of jack o lent but his voice being so extremely musical that it rather allured the birds than terrified them he was soon transplanted from the fields into the dogkennel where he was placed under the huntsman and made what the sportsmen term whipperin for this place likewise the sweetness of his voice disqualified him the dogs preferring the melody of his chiding to all the alluring notes of the huntsman who soon became so incensed at it that he desired sir thomas to provide otherwise for him and constantly laid every fault the dogs were at to the account of the poor boy who was now transplanted to the stable here he soon gave proofs of strength and agility beyond his years and constantly rode the most spirited and vicious horses to water with an intrepidity which surprized every one while he was in this station he rode several races for sir thomas and this with such expertness and success that the neighbouring gentlemen frequently solicited the knight to permit little joey for so he was called to ride their matches the best gamesters before they laid their money always inquired which horse little joey was to ride and the bets were rather proportioned by the rider than by the horse himself especially after he had scornfully refused a considerable bribe to play booty on such an occasion this extremely raised his character and so pleased the lady booby that she desired to have him being now seventeen years of age for her own footboy  a in english sprung from a dunghill  joey was now preferred from the stable to attend on his lady to go on her errands stand behind her chair wait at her teatable and carry her prayerbook to church at which place his voice gave him an opportunity of distinguishing himself by singing psalms he behaved likewise in every other respect so well at divine service that it recommended him to the notice of mr abraham adams the curate who took an opportunity one day as he was drinking a cup of ale in sir thomass kitchen to ask the young man several questions concerning religion with his answers to which he was wonderfully pleased    chapter iii  of mr abraham adams the curate mrs slipslop the chambermaid and others   mr abraham adams was an excellent scholar he was a perfect master of the greek and latin languages to which he added a great share of knowledge in the oriental tongues and could read and translate french italian and spanish he had applied many years to the most severe study and had treasured up a fund of learning rarely to be met with in a university he was besides a man of good sense good parts and good nature but was at the same time as entirely ignorant of the ways of this world as an infant just entered into it could possibly be as he had never any intention to deceive so he never suspected such a design in others he was generous friendly and brave to an excess but simplicity was his characteristick he did no more than mr colley cibber apprehend any such passions as malice and envy to exist in mankind which was indeed less remarkable in a country parson than in a gentleman who hath passed his life behind the scenesa place which hath been seldom thought the school of innocence and where a very little observation would have convinced the great apologist that those passions have a real existence in the human mind  his virtue and his other qualifications as they rendered him equal to his office so they made him an agreeable and valuable companion and had so much endeared and well recommended him to a bishop that at the age of fifty he was provided with a handsome income of twentythree pounds a year which however he could not make any great figure with because he lived in a dear country and was a little encumbered with a wife and six children  it was this gentleman who having as i have said observed the singular devotion of young andrews had found means to question him concerning several particulars as how many books there were in the new testament which were they how many chapters they contained and such like to all which mr adams privately said he answered much better than sir thomas or two other neighbouring justices of the peace could probably have done  mr adams was wonderfully solicitous to know at what time and by what opportunity the youth became acquainted with these matters joey told him that he had very early learnt to read and write by the goodness of his father who though he had not interest enough to get him into a charity school because a cousin of his fathers landlord did not vote on the right side for a churchwarden in a borough town yet had been himself at the expense of sixpence a week for his learning he told him likewise that ever since he was in sir thomass family he had employed all his hours of leisure in reading good books that he had read the bible the whole duty of man and thomas a kempis and that as often as he could without being perceived he had studied a great good book which lay open in the hall window where he had read as how the devil carried away half a church in sermontime without hurting one of the congregation and as how a field of corn ran away down a hill with all the trees upon it and covered another mans meadow this sufficiently assured mr adams that the good book meant could be no other than bakers chronicle  the curate surprized to find such instances of industry and application in a young man who had never met with the least encouragement asked him if he did not extremely regret the want of a liberal education and the not having been born of parents who might have indulged his talents and desire of knowledge to which he answered he hoped he had profited somewhat better from the books he had read than to lament his condition in this world that for his part he was perfectly content with the state to which he was called that he should endeavour to improve his talent which was all required of him but not repine at his own lot nor envy those of his betters well said my lad replied the curate and i wish some who have read many more good books nay and some who have written good books themselves had profited so much by them  adams had no nearer access to sir thomas or my lady than through the waitinggentlewoman for sir thomas was too apt to estimate men merely by their dress or fortune and my lady was a woman of gaiety who had been blest with a town education and never spoke of any of her country neighbours by any other appellation than that of the brutes they both regarded the curate as a kind of domestic only belonging to the parson of the parish who was at this time at variance with the knight for the parson had for many years lived in a constant state of civil war or which is perhaps as bad of civil law with sir thomas himself and the tenants of his manor the foundation of this quarrel was a modus by setting which aside an advantage of several shillings per annum would have accrued to the rector but he had not yet been able to accomplish his purpose and had reaped hitherto nothing better from the suits than the pleasure which he used indeed frequently to say was no small one of reflecting that he had utterly undone many of the poor tenants though he had at the same time greatly impoverished himself  mrs slipslop the waitinggentlewoman being herself the daughter of a curate preserved some respect for adams she professed great regard for his learning and would frequently dispute with him on points of theology but always insisted on a deference to be paid to her understanding as she had been frequently at london and knew more of the world than a country parson could pretend to  she had in these disputes a particular advantage over adams for she was a mighty affecter of hard words which she used in such a manner that the parson who durst not offend her by calling her words in question was frequently at some loss to guess her meaning and would have been much less puzzled by an arabian manuscript  adams therefore took an opportunity one day after a pretty long discourse with her on the essence or as she pleased to term it the incence of matter to mention the case of young andrews desiring her to recommend him to her lady as a youth very susceptible of learning and one whose instruction in latin he would himself undertake by which means he might be qualified for a higher station than that of a footman and added she knew it was in his masters power easily to provide for him in a better manner he therefore desired that the boy might be left behind under his care  la mr adams said mrs slipslop do you think my lady will suffer any preambles about any such matter she is going to london very concisely and i am confidous would not leave joey behind her on any account for he is one of the genteelest young fellows you may see in a summers day and i am confidous she would as soon think of parting with a pair of her grey mares for she values herself as much on one as the other adams would have interrupted but she proceeded and why is latin more necessitous for a footman than a gentleman it is very proper that you clergymen must learn it because you cant preach without it but i have heard gentlemen say in london that it is fit for nobody else i am confidous my lady would be angry with me for mentioning it and i shall draw myself into no such delemy at which words her ladys bell rung and mr adams was forced to retire nor could he gain a second opportunity with her before their london journey which happened a few days afterwards however andrews behaved very thankfully and gratefully to him for his intended kindness which he told him he never would forget and at the same time received from the good man many admonitions concerning the regulation of his future conduct and his perseverance in innocence and industry    chapter iv  what happened after their journey to london   no sooner was young andrews arrived at london than he began to scrape an acquaintance with his partycoloured brethren who endeavoured to make him despise his former course of life his hair was cut after the newest fashion and became his chief care he went abroad with it all the morning in papers and drest it out in the afternoon they could not however teach him to game swear drink nor any other genteel vice the town abounded with he applied most of his leisure hours to music in which he greatly improved himself and became so perfect a connoisseur in that art that he led the opinion of all the other footmen at an opera and they never condemned or applauded a single song contrary to his approbation or dislike he was a little too forward in riots at the playhouses and assemblies and when he attended his lady at church which was but seldom he behaved with less seeming devotion than formerly however if he was outwardly a pretty fellow his morals remained entirely uncorrupted though he was at the same time smarter and genteeler than any of the beaus in town either in or out of livery  his lady who had often said of him that joey was the handsomest and genteelest footman in the kingdom but that it was pity he wanted spirit began now to find that fault no longer on the contrary she was frequently heard to cry out ay there is some life in this fellow she plainly saw the effects which the town air hath on the soberest constitutions she would now walk out with him into hyde park in a morning and when tired which happened almost every minute would lean on his arm and converse with him in great familiarity whenever she stept out of her coach she would take him by the hand and sometimes for fear of stumbling press it very hard she admitted him to deliver messages at her bedside in a morning leered at him at table and indulged him in all those innocent freedoms which women of figure may permit without the least sully of their virtue  but though their virtue remains unsullied yet now and then some small arrows will glance on the shadow of it their reputation and so it fell out to lady booby who happened to be walking arminarm with joey one morning in hyde park when lady tittle and lady tattle came accidentally by in their coach bless me says lady tittle can i believe my eyes is that lady boobysurely says tattle but what makes you surprizedwhy is not that her footman replied tittle at which tattle laughed and cried an old business i assure you is it possible you should not have heard it the whole town hath known it this halfyear the consequence of this interview was a whisper through a hundred visits which were separately performed by the two ladiesa the same afternoon and might have had a mischievous effect had it not been stopt by two fresh reputations which were published the day afterwards and engrossed the whole talk of the town  a it may seem an absurdity that tattle should visit as she actually     did to spread a known scandal but the reader may reconcile this by     supposing with me that notwithstanding what she says this was     her first acquaintance with it  but whatever opinion or suspicion the scandalous inclination of defamers might entertain of lady boobys innocent freedoms it is certain they made no impression on young andrews who never offered to encroach beyond the liberties which his lady allowed hima behaviour which she imputed to the violent respect he preserved for her and which served only to heighten a something she began to conceive and which the next chapter will open a little farther    chapter v  the death of sir thomas booby with the affectionate and mournful behaviour of his widow and the great purity of joseph andrews   at this time an accident happened which put a stop to those agreeable walks which probably would have soon puffed up the cheeks of fame and caused her to blow her brazen trumpet through the town and this was no other than the death of sir thomas booby who departing this life left his disconsolate lady confined to her house as closely as if she herself had been attacked by some violent disease during the first six days the poor lady admitted none but mrs slipslop and three female friends who made a party at cards but on the seventh she ordered joey whom for a good reason we shall hereafter call joseph to bring up her teakettle the lady being in bed called joseph to her bade him sit down and having accidentally laid her hand on his she asked him if he had ever been in love joseph answered with some confusion it was time enough for one so young as himself to think on such things as young as you are replied the lady i am convinced you are no stranger to that passion come joey says she tell me truly who is the happy girl whose eyes have made a conquest of you joseph returned that all the women he had ever seen were equally indifferent to him oh then said the lady you are a general lover indeed you handsome fellows like handsome women are very long and difficult in fixing but yet you shall never persuade me that your heart is so insusceptible of affection i rather impute what you say to your secrecy a very commendable quality and what i am far from being angry with you for nothing can be more unworthy in a young man than to betray any intimacies with the ladies ladies madam said joseph i am sure i never had the impudence to think of any that deserve that name dont pretend to too much modesty said she for that sometimes may be impertinent but pray answer me this question suppose a lady should happen to like you suppose she should prefer you to all your sex and admit you to the same familiarities as you might have hoped for if you had been born her equal are you certain that no vanity could tempt you to discover her answer me honestly joseph have you so much more sense and so much more virtue than you handsome young fellows generally have who make no scruple of sacrificing our dear reputation to your pride without considering the great obligation we lay on you by our condescension and confidence can you keep a secret my joey madam says he i hope your ladyship cant tax me with ever betraying the secrets of the family and i hope if you was to turn me away i might have that character of you i dont intend to turn you away joey said she and sighed i am afraid it is not in my power she then raised herself a little in her bed and discovered one of the whitest necks that ever was seen at which joseph blushed la says she in an affected surprize what am i doing i have trusted myself with a man alone naked in bed suppose you should have any wicked intentions upon my honour how should i defend myself joseph protested that he never had the least evil design against her no says she perhaps you may not call your designs wicked and perhaps they are not sohe swore they were not you misunderstand me says she i mean if they were against my honour they may not be wicked but the world calls them so but then say you the world will never know anything of the matter yet would not that be trusting to your secrecy must not my reputation be then in your power would you not then be my master joseph begged her ladyship to be comforted for that he would never imagine the least wicked thing against her and that he had rather die a thousand deaths than give her any reason to suspect him yes said she i must have reason to suspect you are you not a man and without vanity i may pretend to some charms but perhaps you may fear i should prosecute you indeed i hope you do and yet heaven knows i should never have the confidence to appear before a court of justice and you know joey i am of a forgiving temper tell me joey dont you think i should forgive youindeed madam says joseph i will never do anything to disoblige your ladyshiphow says she do you think it would not disoblige me then do you think i would willingly suffer youi dont understand you madam says josephdont you said she then you are either a fool or pretend to be so i find i was mistaken in you so get you downstairs and never let me see your face again your pretended innocence cannot impose on memadam said joseph i would not have your ladyship think any evil of me i have always endeavoured to be a dutiful servant both to you and my mastero thou villain answered my lady why didst thou mention the name of that dear man unless to torment me to bring his precious memory to my mind and then she burst into a fit of tears get thee from my sight i shall never endure thee more at which words she turned away from him and joseph retreated from the room in a most disconsolate condition and writ that letter which the reader will find in the next chapter    chapter vi  how joseph andrews writ a letter to his sister pamela   to mrs pamela andrews living with squire booby  dear sistersince i received your letter of your good ladys death we have had a misfortune of the same kind in our family my worthy master sir thomas died about four days ago and what is worse my poor lady is certainly gone distracted none of the servants expected her to take it so to heart because they quarrelled almost every day of their lives but no more of that because you know pamela i never loved to tell the secrets of my masters family but to be sure you must have known they never loved one another and i have heard her ladyship wish his honour dead above a thousand times but nobody knows what it is to lose a friend till they have lost him  dont tell anybody what i write because i should not care to have folks say i discover what passes in our family but if it had not been so great a lady i should have thought she had had a mind to me dear pamela dont tell anybody but she ordered me to sit down by her bedside when she was naked in bed and she held my hand and talked exactly as a lady does to her sweetheart in a stageplay which i have seen in covent garden while she wanted him to be no better than he should be  if madam be mad i shall not care for staying long in the family so i heartily wish you could get me a place either at the squires or some other neighbouring gentlemans unless it be true that you are going to be married to parson williams as folks talk and then i should be very willing to be his clerk for which you know i am qualified being able to read and to set a psalm  i fancy i shall be discharged very soon and the moment i am unless i hear from you i shall return to my old masters countryseat if it be only to see parson adams who is the best man in the world london is a bad place and there is so little good fellowship that the nextdoor neighbours dont know one another pray give my service to all friends that inquire for me so i rest  your loving brother  joseph andrews  as soon as joseph had sealed and directed this letter he walked downstairs where he met mrs slipslop with whom we shall take this opportunity to bring the reader a little better acquainted she was a maiden gentlewoman of about fortyfive years of age who having made a small slip in her youth had continued a good maid ever since she was not at this time remarkably handsome being very short and rather too corpulent in body and somewhat red with the addition of pimples in the face her nose was likewise rather too large and her eyes too little nor did she resemble a cow so much in her breath as in two brown globes which she carried before her one of her legs was also a little shorter than the other which occasioned her to limp as she walked this fair creature had long cast the eyes of affection on joseph in which she had not met with quite so good success as she probably wished though besides the allurements of her native charms she had given him tea sweetmeats wine and many other delicacies of which by keeping the keys she had the absolute command joseph however had not returned the least gratitude to all these favours not even so much as a kiss though i would not insinuate she was so easily to be satisfied for surely then he would have been highly blameable the truth is she was arrived at an age when she thought she might indulge herself in any liberties with a man without the danger of bringing a third person into the world to betray them she imagined that by so long a selfdenial she had not only made amends for the small slip of her youth above hinted at but had likewise laid up a quantity of merit to excuse any future failings in a word she resolved to give a loose to her amorous inclinations and to pay off the debt of pleasure which she found she owed herself as fast as possible  with these charms of person and in this disposition of mind she encountered poor joseph at the bottom of the stairs and asked him if he would drink a glass of something good this morning joseph whose spirits were not a little cast down very readily and thankfully accepted the offer and together they went into a closet where having delivered him a full glass of ratafia and desired him to sit down mrs slipslop thus began  sure nothing can be a more simple contract in a woman than to place her affections on a boy if i had ever thought it would have been my fate i should have wished to die a thousand deaths rather than live to see that day if we like a man the lightest hint sophisticates whereas a boy proposes upon us to break through all the regulations of modesty before we can make any oppression upon him joseph who did not understand a word she said answered yes madamyes madam replied mrs slipslop with some warmth do you intend to result my passion is it not enough ungrateful as you are to make no return to all the favours i have done you but you must treat me with ironing barbarous monster how have i deserved that my passion should be resulted and treated with ironing madam answered joseph i dont understand your hard words but i am certain you have no occasion to call me ungrateful for so far from intending you any wrong i have always loved you as well as if you had been my own mother how sirrah says mrs slipslop in a rage your own mother do you assinuate that i am old enough to be your mother i dont know what a stripling may think but i believe a man would refer me to any greensickness silly girl whatsomdever but i ought to despise you rather than be angry with you for referring the conversation of girls to that of a woman of sensemadam says joseph i am sure i have always valued the honour you did me by your conversation for i know you are a woman of learningyes but joseph said she a little softened by the compliment to her learning if you had a value for me you certainly would have found some method of showing it me for i am convicted you must see the value i have for you yes joseph my eyes whether i would or no must have declared a passion i cannot conqueroh joseph  as when a hungry tigress who long has traversed the woods in fruitless search sees within the reach of her claws a lamb she prepares to leap on her prey or as a voracious pike of immense size surveys through the liquid element a roach or gudgeon which cannot escape her jaws opens them wide to swallow the little fish so did mrs slipslop prepare to lay her violent amorous hands on the poor joseph when luckily her mistresss bell rung and delivered the intended martyr from her clutches she was obliged to leave him abruptly and to defer the execution of her purpose till some other time we shall therefore return to the lady booby and give our reader some account of her behaviour after she was left by joseph in a temper of mind not greatly different from that of the inflamed slipslop    chapter vii  sayings of wise men a dialogue between the lady and her maid and a panegyric or rather satire on the passion of love in the sublime style   it is the observation of some antient sage whose name i have forgot that passions operate differently on the human mind as diseases on the body in proportion to the strength or weakness soundness or rottenness of the one and the other  we hope therefore a judicious reader will give himself some pains to observe what we have so greatly laboured to describe the different operations of this passion of love in the gentle and cultivated mind of the lady booby from those which it effected in the less polished and coarser disposition of mrs slipslop  another philosopher whose name also at present escapes my memory hath somewhere said that resolutions taken in the absence of the beloved object are very apt to vanish in its presence on both which wise sayings the following chapter may serve as a comment  no sooner had joseph left the room in the manner we have before related than the lady enraged at her disappointment began to reflect with severity on her conduct her love was now changed to disdain which pride assisted to torment her she despised herself for the meanness of her passion and joseph for its ill success however she had now got the better of it in her own opinion and determined immediately to dismiss the object after much tossing and turning in her bed and many soliloquies which if we had no better matter for our reader we would give him she at last rung the bell as above mentioned and was presently attended by mrs slipslop who was not much better pleased with joseph than the lady herself  slipslop said lady booby when did you see joseph the poor woman was so surprized at the unexpected sound of his name at so critical a time that she had the greatest difficulty to conceal the confusion she was under from her mistress whom she answered nevertheless with pretty good confidence though not entirely void of fear of suspicion that she had not seen him that morning i am afraid said lady booby he is a wild young fellowthat he is said slipslop and a wicked one too to my knowledge he games drinks swears and fights eternally besides he is horribly indicted to wenchingay said the lady i never heard that of himo madam answered the other he is so lewd a rascal that if your ladyship keeps him much longer you will not have one virgin in your house except myself and yet i cant conceive what the wenches see in him to be so foolishly fond as they are in my eyes he is as ugly a scarecrow as i ever upheldnay said the lady the boy is well enoughla maam cries slipslop i think him the ragmaticallest fellow in the familysure slipslop says she you are mistaken but which of the women do you most suspectmadam says slipslop there is betty the chambermaid i am almost convicted is with child by himay says the lady then pray pay her her wages instantly i will keep no such sluts in my family and as for joseph you may discard him toowould your ladyship have him paid off immediately cries slipslop for perhaps when betty is gone he may mend and really the boy is a good servant and a strong healthy luscious boy enough this morning answered the lady with some vehemence i wish madam cries slipslop your ladyship would be so good as to try him a little longeri will not have my commands disputed said the lady sure you are not fond of him yourselfi madam cries slipslop reddening if not blushing i should be sorry to think your ladyship had any reason to respect me of fondness for a fellow and if it be your pleasure i shall fulfil it with as much reluctance as possibleas little i suppose you mean said the lady and so about it instantly mrs slipslop went out and the lady had scarce taken two turns before she fell to knocking and ringing with great violence slipslop who did not travel post haste soon returned and was countermanded as to joseph but ordered to send betty about her business without delay she went out a second time with much greater alacrity than before when the lady began immediately to accuse herself of want of resolution and to apprehend the return of her affection with its pernicious consequences she therefore applied herself again to the bell and resummoned mrs slipslop into her presence who again returned and was told by her mistress that she had considered better of the matter and was absolutely resolved to turn away joseph which she ordered her to do immediately slipslop who knew the violence of her ladys temper and would not venture her place for any adonis or hercules in the universe left her a third time which she had no sooner done than the little god cupid fearing he had not yet done the ladys business took a fresh arrow with the sharpest point out of his quiver and shot it directly into her heart in other and plainer language the ladys passion got the better of her reason she called back slipslop once more and told her she had resolved to see the boy and examine him herself therefore bid her send him up this wavering in her mistresss temper probably put something into the waitinggentlewomans head not necessary to mention to the sagacious reader  lady booby was going to call her back again but could not prevail with herself the next consideration therefore was how she should behave to joseph when he came in she resolved to preserve all the dignity of the woman of fashion to her servant and to indulge herself in this last view of joseph for that she was most certainly resolved it should be at his own expense by first insulting and then discarding him  o love what monstrous tricks dost thou play with thy votaries of both sexes how dost thou deceive them and make them deceive themselves their follies are thy delight their sighs make thee laugh and their pangs are thy merriment  not the great rich who turns men into monkeys wheelbarrows and whatever else best humours his fancy hath so strangely metamorphosed the human shape nor the great cibber who confounds all number gender and breaks through every rule of grammar at his will hath so distorted the english language as thou dost metamorphose and distort the human senses  thou puttest out our eyes stoppest up our ears and takest away the power of our nostrils so that we can neither see the largest object hear the loudest noise nor smell the most poignant perfume again when thou pleasest thou canst make a molehill appear as a mountain a jewsharp sound like a trumpet and a daisy smell like a violet thou canst make cowardice brave avarice generous pride humble and cruelty tenderhearted in short thou turnest the heart of man inside out as a juggler doth a petticoat and bringest whatsoever pleaseth thee out from it if there be any one who doubts all this let him read the next chapter    chapter viii  in which after some very fine writing the history goes on and relates the interview between the lady and joseph where the latter hath set an example which we despair of seeing followed by his sex in this vicious age   now the rake hesperus had called for his breeches and having well rubbed his drowsy eyes prepared to dress himself for all night by whose example his brother rakes on earth likewise leave those beds in which they had slept away the day now thetis the good housewife began to put on the pot in order to regale the good man phoebus after his daily labours were over in vulgar language it was in the evening when joseph attended his ladys orders  but as it becomes us to preserve the character of this lady who is the heroine of our tale and as we have naturally a wonderful tenderness for that beautiful part of the human species called the fair sex before we discover too much of her frailty to our reader it will be proper to give him a lively idea of the vast temptation which overcame all the efforts of a modest and virtuous mind and then we humbly hope his good nature will rather pity than condemn the imperfection of human virtue  illustration  nay the ladies themselves will we hope be induced by considering the uncommon variety of charms which united in this young mans person to bridle their rampant passion for chastity and be at least as mild as their violent modesty and virtue will permit them in censuring the conduct of a woman who perhaps was in her own disposition as chaste as those pure and sanctified virgins who after a life innocently spent in the gaieties of the town begin about fifty to attend twice per diem at the polite churches and chapels to return thanks for the grace which preserved them formerly amongst beaus from temptations perhaps less powerful than what now attacked the lady booby  mr joseph andrews was now in the oneandtwentieth year of his age he was of the highest degree of middle stature his limbs were put together with great elegance and no less strength his legs and thighs were formed in the exactest proportion his shoulders were broad and brawny but yet his arm hung so easily that he had all the symptoms of strength without the least clumsiness his hair was of a nutbrown colour and was displayed in wanton ringlets down his back his forehead was high his eyes dark and as full of sweetness as of fire his nose a little inclined to the roman his teeth white and even his lips full red and soft his beard was only rough on his chin and upper lip but his cheeks in which his blood glowed were overspread with a thick down his countenance had a tenderness joined with a sensibility inexpressible add to this the most perfect neatness in his dress and an air which to those who have not seen many noblemen would give an idea of nobility  such was the person who now appeared before the lady she viewed him some time in silence and twice or thrice before she spake changed her mind as to the manner in which she should begin at length she said to him joseph i am sorry to hear such complaints against you i am told you behave so rudely to the maids that they cannot do their business in quiet i mean those who are not wicked enough to hearken to your solicitations as to others they may perhaps not call you rude for there are wicked sluts who make one ashamed of ones own sex and are as ready to admit any nauseous familiarity as fellows to offer it nay there are such in my family but they shall not stay in it that impudent trollop who is with child by you is discharged by this time  as a person who is struck through the heart with a thunderbolt looks extremely surprised nay and perhaps is so toothus the poor joseph received the false accusation of his mistress he blushed and looked confounded which she misinterpreted to be symptoms of his guilt and thus went on  come hither joseph another mistress might discard you for these offences but i have a compassion for your youth and if i could be certain you would be no more guiltyconsider child laying her hand carelessly upon his you are a handsome young fellow and might do better you might make your fortune madam said joseph i do assure your ladyship i dont know whether any maid in the house is man or woman oh fie joseph answered the lady dont commit another crime in denying the truth i could pardon the first but i hate a lyar madam cries joseph i hope your ladyship will not be offended at my asserting my innocence for by all that is sacred i have never offered more than kissing kissing said the lady with great discomposure of countenance and more redness in her cheeks than anger in her eyes do you call that no crime kissing joseph is as a prologue to a play can i believe a young fellow of your age and complexion will be content with kissing no joseph there is no woman who grants that but will grant more and i am deceived greatly in you if you would not put her closely to it what would you think joseph if i admitted you to kiss me joseph replied he would sooner die than have any such thought and yet joseph returned she ladies have admitted their footmen to such familiarities and footmen i confess to you much less deserving them fellows without half your charmsfor such might almost excuse the crime tell me therefore joseph if i should admit you to such freedom what would you think of metell me freely madam said joseph i should think your ladyship condescended a great deal below yourself pugh said she that i am to answer to myself but would not you insist on more would you be contented with a kiss would not your inclinations be all on fire rather by such a favour madam said joseph if they were i hope i should be able to controul them without suffering them to get the better of my virtue you have heard reader poets talk of the statue of surprize you have heard likewise or else you have heard very little how surprize made one of the sons of croesus speak though he was dumb you have seen the faces in the eighteenpenny gallery when through the trapdoor to soft or no music mr bridgewater mr william mills or some other of ghostly appearance hath ascended with a face all pale with powder and a shirt all bloody with ribbonsbut from none of these nor from phidias or praxiteles if they should return to lifeno not from the inimitable pencil of my friend hogarth could you receive such an idea of surprize as would have entered in at your eyes had they beheld the lady booby when those last words issued out from the lips of joseph your virtue said the lady recovering after a silence of two minutes i shall never survive it your virtueintolerable confidence have you the assurance to pretend that when a lady demeans herself to throw aside the rules of decency in order to honour you with the highest favour in her power your virtue should resist her inclination that when she had conquered her own virtue she should find an obstruction in yours madam said joseph i cant see why her having no virtue should be a reason against my having any or why because i am a man or because i am poor my virtue must be subservient to her pleasures i am out of patience cries the lady did ever mortal hear of a mans virtue did ever the greatest or the gravest men pretend to any of this kind will magistrates who punish lewdness or parsons who preach against it make any scruple of committing it and can a boy a stripling have the confidence to talk of his virtue madam says joseph that boy is the brother of pamela and would be ashamed that the chastity of his family which is preserved in her should be stained in him if there are such men as your ladyship mentions i am sorry for it and i wish they had an opportunity of reading over those letters which my father hath sent me of my sister pamelas nor do i doubt but such an example would amend them you impudent villain cries the lady in a rage do you insult me with the follies of my relation who hath exposed himself all over the country upon your sisters account a little vixen whom i have always wondered my late lady booby ever kept in her house sirrah get out of my sight and prepare to set out this night for i will order you your wages immediately and you shall be stripped and turned away madam says joseph i am sorry i have offended your ladyship i am sure i never intended it yes sirrah cries she you have had the vanity to misconstrue the little innocent freedom i took in order to try whether what i had heard was true o my conscience you have had the assurance to imagine i was fond of you myself joseph answered he had only spoke out of tenderness for his virtue at which words she flew into a violent passion and refusing to hear more ordered him instantly to leave the room  he was no sooner gone than she burst forth into the following exclamationwhither doth this violent passion hurry us what meannesses do we submit to from its impulse wisely we resist its first and least approaches for it is then only we can assure ourselves the victory no woman could ever safely say so far only will i go have i not exposed myself to the refusal of my footman i cannot bear the reflection upon which she applied herself to the bell and rung it with infinite more violence than was necessarythe faithful slipslop attending near at hand to say the truth she had conceived a suspicion at her last interview with her mistress and had waited ever since in the antechamber having carefully applied her ears to the keyhole during the whole time that the preceding conversation passed between joseph and the lady    chapter ix  what passed between the lady and mrs slipslop in which we prophesy there are some strokes which every one will not truly comprehend at the first reading   slipslop said the lady i find too much reason to believe all thou hast told me of this wicked joseph i have determined to part with him instantly so go you to the steward and bid him pay his wages slipslop who had preserved hitherto a distance to her ladyrather out of necessity than inclinationand who thought the knowledge of this secret had thrown down all distinction between them answered her mistress very pertlyshe wished she knew her own mind and that she was certain she would call her back again before she was got halfway downstairs the lady replied she had taken a resolution and was resolved to keep it i am sorry for it cries slipslop and if i had known you would have punished the poor lad so severely you should never have heard a particle of the matter heres a fuss indeed about nothing nothing returned my lady do you think i will countenance lewdness in my house if you will turn away every footman said slipslop that is a lover of the sport you must soon open the coach door yourself or get a set of mophrodites to wait upon you and i am sure i hated the sight of them even singing in an opera do as i bid you says my lady and dont shock my ears with your beastly language marrycomeup cries slipslop peoples ears are sometimes the nicest part about them  the lady who began to admire the new style in which her waitinggentlewoman delivered herself and by the conclusion of her speech suspected somewhat of the truth called her back and desired to know what she meant by the extraordinary degree of freedom in which she thought proper to indulge her tongue freedom says slipslop i dont know what you call freedom madam servants have tongues as well as their mistresses yes and saucy ones too answered the lady but i assure you i shall bear no such impertinence impertinence i dont know that i am impertinent says slipslop yes indeed you are cries my lady and unless you mend your manners this house is no place for you manners cries slipslop i never was thought to want manners nor modesty neither and for places there are more places than one and i know what i know what do you know mistress answered the lady i am not obliged to tell that to everybody says slipslop any more than i am obliged to keep it a secret i desire you would provide yourself answered the lady with all my heart replied the waitinggentlewoman and so departed in a passion and slapped the door after her  the lady too plainly perceived that her waitinggentlewoman knew more than she would willingly have had her acquainted with and this she imputed to josephs having discovered to her what passed at the first interview this therefore blew up her rage against him and confirmed her in a resolution of parting with him  but the dismissing mrs slipslop was a point not so easily to be resolved upon she had the utmost tenderness for her reputation as she knew on that depended many of the most valuable blessings of life particularly cards making curtsies in public places and above all the pleasure of demolishing the reputations of others in which innocent amusement she had an extraordinary delight she therefore determined to submit to any insult from a servant rather than run a risque of losing the title to so many great privileges  she therefore sent for her steward mr peter pounce and ordered him to pay joseph his wages to strip off his livery and to turn him out of the house that evening  she then called slipslop up and after refreshing her spirits with a small cordial which she kept in her corset she began in the following manner  slipslop why will you who know my passionate temper attempt to provoke me by your answers i am convinced you are an honest servant and should be very unwilling to part with you i believe likewise you have found me an indulgent mistress on many occasions and have as little reason on your side to desire a change i cant help being surprized therefore that you will take the surest method to offend mei mean repeating my words which you know i have always detested  the prudent waitinggentlewoman had duly weighed the whole matter and found on mature deliberation that a good place in possession was better than one in expectation as she found her mistress therefore inclined to relent she thought proper also to put on some small condescension which was as readily accepted and so the affair was reconciled all offences forgiven and a present of a gown and petticoat made her as an instance of her ladys future favour  she offered once or twice to speak in favour of joseph but found her ladys heart so obdurate that she prudently dropt all such efforts she considered there were more footmen in the house and some as stout fellows though not quite so handsome as joseph besides the reader hath already seen her tender advances had not met with the encouragement she might have reasonable expected she thought she had thrown away a great deal of sack and sweetmeats on an ungrateful rascal and being a little inclined to the opinion of that female sect who hold one lusty young fellow to be nearly as good as another lusty young fellow she at last gave up joseph and his cause and with a triumph over her passion highly commendable walked off with her present and with great tranquillity paid a visit to a stonebottle which is of sovereign use to a philosophical temper  she left not her mistress so easy the poor lady could not reflect without agony that her dear reputation was in the power of her servants all her comfort as to joseph was that she hoped he did not understand her meaning at least she could say for herself she had not plainly expressed anything to him and as to mrs slipslop she imagines she could bribe her to secrecy  but what hurt her most was that in reality she had not so entirely conquered her passion the little god lay lurking in her heart though anger and distain so hoodwinked her that she could not see him she was a thousand times on the very brink of revoking the sentence she had passed against the poor youth love became his advocate and whispered many things in his favour honour likewise endeavoured to vindicate his crime and pity to mitigate his punishment on the other side pride and revenge spoke as loudly against him and thus the poor lady was tortured with perplexity opposite passions distracting and tearing her mind different ways  so have i seen in the hall of westminster where serjeant bramble hath been retained on the right side and serjeant puzzle on the left the balance of opinion so equal were their fees alternately incline to either scale now bramble throws in an argument and puzzles scale strikes the beam again bramble shares the like fate overpowered by the weight of puzzle here bramble hits there puzzle strikes here one has you there tother has you till at last all becomes one scene of confusion in the tortured minds of the hearers equal wagers are laid on the success and neither judge nor jury can possibly make anything of the matter all things are so enveloped by the careful serjeants in doubt and obscurity  or as it happens in the conscience where honour and honesty pull one way and a bribe and necessity anotherif it was our present business only to make similes we could produce many more to this purpose but a simile as well as a word to the wisewe shall therefore see a little after our hero for whom the reader is doubtless in some pain    chapter x  joseph writes another letter his transactions with mr peter pounce c with his departure from lady booby   the disconsolate joseph would not have had an understanding sufficient for the principal subject of such a book as this if he had any longer misunderstood the drift of his mistress and indeed that he did not discern it sooner the reader will be pleased to impute to an unwillingness in him to discover what he must condemn in her as a fault having therefore quitted her presence he retired into his own garret and entered himself into an ejaculation on the numberless calamities which attended beauty and the misfortune it was to be handsomer than ones neighbours  he then sat down and addressed himself to his sister pamela in the following words  dear sister pamelahoping you are well what news have i to tell you o pamela my mistress is fallen in love with methat is what great folks call falling in loveshe has a mind to ruin me but i hope i shall have more resolution and more grace than to part with my virtue to any lady upon earth  mr adams hath often told me that chastity is as great a virtue in a man as in a woman he says he never knew any more than his wife and i shall endeavour to follow his example indeed it is owing entirely to his excellent sermons and advice together with your letters that i have been able to resist a temptation which he says no man complies with but he repents in this world or is damned for it in the next and why should i trust to repentance on my deathbed since i may die in my sleep what fine things are good advice and good examples but i am glad she turned me out of the chamber as she did for i had once almost forgotten every word parson adams had ever said to me  i dont doubt dear sister but you will have grace to preserve your virtue against all trials and i beg you earnestly to pray i may be enabled to preserve mine for truly it is very severely attacked by more than one but i hope i shall copy your example and that of joseph my namesake and maintain my virtue against all temptations  joseph had not finished his letter when he was summoned downstairs by mr peter pounce to receive his wages for besides that out of eight pounds a year he allowed his father and mother four he had been obliged in order to furnish himself with musical instruments to apply to the generosity of the aforesaid peter who on urgent occasions used to advance the servants their wages not before they were due but before they were payable that is perhaps half a year after they were due and this at the moderate premium of fifty per cent or a little more by which charitable methods together with lending money to other people and even to his own master and mistress the honest man had from nothing in a few years amassed a small sum of twenty thousand pounds or thereabouts  joseph having received his little remainder of wages and having stript off his livery was forced to borrow a frock and breeches of one of the servants for he was so beloved in the family that they would all have lent him anything and being told by peter that he must not stay a moment longer in the house than was necessary to pack up his linen which he easily did in a very narrow compass he took a melancholy leave of his fellowservants and set out at seven in the evening  he had proceeded the length of two or three streets before he absolutely determined with himself whether he should leave the town that night or procuring a lodging wait till the morning at last the moon shining very bright helped him to come to a resolution of beginning his journey immediately to which likewise he had some other inducements which the reader without being a conjurer cannot possibly guess till we have given him those hints which it may be now proper to open    chapter xi  of several new matters not expected   it is an observation sometimes made that to indicate our idea of a simple fellow we say he is easily to be seen through nor do i believe it a more improper denotation of a simple book instead of applying this to any particular performance we chuse rather to remark the contrary in this history where the scene opens itself by small degrees and he is a sagacious reader who can see two chapters before him  for this reason we have not hitherto hinted a matter which now seems necessary to be explained since it may be wondered at first that joseph made such extraordinary haste out of town which hath been already shewn and secondly which will be now shewn that instead of proceeding to the habitation of his father and mother or to his beloved sister pamela he chose rather to set out full speed to the lady boobys countryseat which he had left on his journey to london  be it known then that in the same parish where this seat stood there lived a young girl whom joseph though the best of sons and brothers longed more impatiently to see than his parents or his sister she was a poor girl who had formerly been bred up in sir johns family whence a little before the journey to london she had been discarded by mrs slipslop on account of her extraordinary beauty for i never could find any other reason  this young creature who now lived with a farmer in the parish had been always beloved by joseph and returned his affection she was two years only younger than our hero they had been acquainted from their infancy and had conceived a very early liking for each other which had grown to such a degree of affection that mr adams had with much ado prevented them from marrying and persuaded them to wait till a few years service and thrift had a little improved their experience and enabled them to live comfortably together  they followed this good mans advice as indeed his word was little less than a law in his parish for as he had shown his parishioners by an uniform behaviour of thirtyfive years duration that he had their good entirely at heart so they consulted him on every occasion and very seldom acted contrary to his opinion  nothing can be imagined more tender than was the parting between these two lovers a thousand sighs heaved the bosom of joseph a thousand tears distilled from the lovely eyes of fanny for that was her name though her modesty would only suffer her to admit his eager kisses her violent love made her more than passive in his embraces and she often pulled him to her breast with a soft pressure which though perhaps it would not have squeezed an insect to death caused more emotion in the heart of joseph than the closest cornish hug could have done  the reader may perhaps wonder that so fond a pair should during a twelvemonths absence never converse with one another indeed there was but one reason which did or could have prevented them and this was that poor fanny could neither write nor read nor could she be prevailed upon to transmit the delicacies of her tender and chaste passion by the hands of an amanuensis  they contented themselves therefore with frequent inquiries after each others health with a mutual confidence in each others fidelity and the prospect of their future happiness  having explained these matters to our reader and as far as possible satisfied all his doubts we return to honest joseph whom we left just set out on his travels by the light of the moon  those who have read any romance or poetry antient or modern must have been informed that love hath wings by which they are not to understand as some young ladies by mistake have done that a lover can fly the writers by this ingenious allegory intending to insinuate no more than that lovers do not march like horseguards in short that they put the best leg foremost which our lusty youth who could walk with any man did so heartily on this occasion that within four hours he reached a famous house of hospitality well known to the western traveller it presents you a lion on the signpost and the master who was christened timotheus is commonly called plain tim some have conceived that he hath particularly chosen the lion for his sign as he doth in countenance greatly resemble that magnanimous beast though his disposition savours more of the sweetness of the lamb he is a person well received among all sorts of men being qualified to render himself agreeable to any as he is well versed in history and politics hath a smattering in law and divinity cracks a good jest and plays wonderfully well on the french horn  a violent storm of hail forced joseph to take shelter in this inn where he remembered sir thomas had dined in his way to town joseph had no sooner seated himself by the kitchen fire than timotheus observing his livery began to condole the loss of his late master who was he said his very particular and intimate acquaintance with whom he had cracked many a merry bottle ay many a dozen in his time he then remarked that all these things were over now all passed and just as if they had never been and concluded with an excellent observation on the certainty of death which his wife said was indeed very true a fellow now arrived at the same inn with two horses one of which he was leading farther down into the country to meet his master these he put into the stable and came and took his place by josephs side who immediately knew him to be the servant of a neighbouring gentleman who used to visit at their house  this fellow was likewise forced in by the storm for he had orders to go twenty miles farther that evening and luckily on the same road which joseph himself intended to take he therefore embraced this opportunity of complimenting his friend with his masters horse notwithstanding he had received express commands to the contrary which was readily accepted and so after they had drank a loving pot and the storm was over they set out together    chapter xii  containing many surprizing adventures which joseph andrews met with on the road scarce credible to those who have never travelled in a stagecoach   nothing remarkable happened on the road till their arrival at the inn to which the horses were ordered whither they came about two in the morning the moon then shone very bright and joseph making his friend a present of a pint of wine and thanking him for the favour of his horse notwithstanding all entreaties to the contrary proceeded on his journey on foot  he had not gone above two miles charmed with the hope of shortly seeing his beloved fanny when he was met by two fellows in a narrow lane and ordered to stand and deliver he readily gave them all the money he had which was somewhat less than two pounds and told them he hoped they would be so generous as to return him a few shillings to defray his charges on his way home  one of the ruffians answered with an oath yes well give you something presently but first strip and be dnd to youstrip cried the other or ill blow your brains to the devil joseph remembering that he had borrowed his coat and breeches of a friend and that he should be ashamed of making any excuse for not returning them replied he hoped they would not insist on his clothes which were not worth much but consider the coldness of the night you are cold are you you rascal said one of the robbers ill warm you with a vengeance and damning his eyes snapped a pistol at his head which he had no sooner done than the other levelled a blow at him with his stick which joseph who was expert at cudgelplaying caught with his and returned the favour so successfully on his adversary that he laid him sprawling at his feet and at the same instant received a blow from behind with the butt end of a pistol from the other villain which felled him to the ground and totally deprived him of his senses  the thief who had been knocked down had now recovered himself and both together fell to belabouring poor joseph with their sticks till they were convinced they had put an end to his miserable being they then stripped him entirely naked threw him into a ditch and departed with their booty  the poor wretch who lay motionless a long time just began to recover his senses as a stagecoach came by the postillion hearing a mans groans stopt his horses and told the coachman he was certain there was a dead man lying in the ditch for he heard him groan go on sirrah says the coachman we are confounded late and have no time to look after dead men a lady who heard what the postillion said and likewise heard the groan called eagerly to the coachman to stop and see what was the matter upon which he bid the postillion alight and look into the ditch he did so and returned that there was a man sitting upright as naked as ever he was borno jsus cried the lady a naked man dear coachman drive on and leave him upon this the gentlemen got out of the coach and joseph begged them to have mercy upon him for that he had been robbed and almost beaten to death robbed cries an old gentleman let us make all the haste imaginable or we shall be robbed too a young man who belonged to the law answered he wished they had passed by without taking any notice but that now they might be proved to have been last in his company if he should die they might be called to some account for his murder he therefore thought it advisable to save the poor creatures life for their own sakes if possible at least if he died to prevent the jurys finding that they fled for it he was therefore of opinion to take the man into the coach and carry him to the next inn the lady insisted that he should not come into the coach that if they lifted him in she would herself alight for she had rather stay in that place to all eternity than ride with a naked man the coachman objected that he could not suffer him to be taken in unless somebody would pay a shilling for his carriage the four miles which the two gentlemen refused to do but the lawyer who was afraid of some mischief happening to himself if the wretch was left behind in that condition saying no man could be too cautious in these matters and that he remembered very extraordinary cases in the books threatened the coachman and bid him deny taking him up at his peril for that if he died he should be indicted for his murder and if he lived and brought an action against him he would willingly take a brief in it these words had a sensible effect on the coachman who was well acquainted with the person who spoke them and the old gentleman above mentioned thinking the naked man would afford him frequent opportunities of showing his wit to the lady offered to join with the company in giving a mug of beer for his fare till partly alarmed by the threats of the one and partly by the promises of the other and being perhaps a little moved with compassion at the poor creatures condition who stood bleeding and shivering with the cold he at length agreed and joseph was now advancing to the coach where seeing the lady who held the sticks of her fan before her eyes he absolutely refused miserable as he was to enter unless he was furnished with sufficient covering to prevent giving the least offence to decencyso perfectly modest was this young man such mighty effects had the spotless example of the amiable pamela and the excellent sermons of mr adams wrought upon him  though there were several greatcoats about the coach it was not easy to get over this difficulty which joseph had started the two gentlemen complained they were cold and could not spare a rag the man of wit saying with a laugh that charity began at home and the coachman who had two greatcoats spread under him refused to lend either lest they should be made bloody the ladys footman desired to be excused for the same reason which the lady herself notwithstanding her abhorrence of a naked man approved and it is more than probable poor joseph who obstinately adhered to his modest resolution must have perished unless the postillion a lad who hath been since transported for robbing a henroost had voluntarily stript off a greatcoat his only garment at the same time swearing a great oath for which he was rebuked by the passengers that he would rather ride in his shirt all his life than suffer a fellowcreature to lie in so miserable a condition  joseph having put on the greatcoat was lifted into the coach which now proceeded on its journey he declared himself almost dead with the cold which gave the man of wit an occasion to ask the lady if she could not accommodate him with a dram she answered with some resentment she wondered at his asking her such a question but assured him she never tasted any such thing  the lawyer was inquiring into the circumstances of the robbery when the coach stopt and one of the ruffians putting a pistol in demanded their money of the passengers who readily gave it them and the lady in her fright delivered up a little silver bottle of about a halfpint size which the rogue clapping it to his mouth and drinking her health declared held some of the best nantes he had ever tasted this the lady afterwards assured the company was the mistake of her maid for that she had ordered her to fill the bottle with hungarywater  as soon as the fellows were departed the lawyer who had it seems a case of pistols in the seat of the coach informed the company that if it had been daylight and he could have come at his pistols he would not have submitted to the robbery he likewise set forth that he had often met highwaymen when he travelled on horseback but none ever durst attack him concluding that if he had not been more afraid for the lady than for himself he should not have now parted with his money so easily  as wit is generally observed to love to reside in empty pockets so the gentleman whose ingenuity we have above remarked as soon as he had parted with his money began to grow wonderfully facetious he made frequent allusions to adam and eve and said many excellent things on figs and figleaves which perhaps gave more offence to joseph than to any other in the company  the lawyer likewise made several very pretty jests without departing from his profession he said if joseph and the lady were alone he would be more capable of making a conveyance to her as his affairs were not fettered with any incumbrance hed warrant he soon suffered a recovery by a writ of entry which was the proper way to create heirs in tail that for his own part he would engage to make so firm a settlement in a coach that there should be no danger of an ejectment with an inundation of the like gibberish which he continued to vent till the coach arrived at an inn where one servantmaid only was up in readiness to attend the coachman and furnish him with cold meat and a dram joseph desired to alight and that he might have a bed prepared for him which the maid readily promised to perform and being a goodnatured wench and not so squeamish as the lady had been she clapt a large fagot on the fire and furnishing joseph with a greatcoat belonging to one of the hostlers desired him to sit down and warm himself whilst she made his bed the coachman in the meantime took an opportunity to call up a surgeon who lived within a few doors after which he reminded his passengers how late they were and after they had taken leave of joseph hurried them off as fast as he could  the wench soon got joseph to bed and promised to use her interest to borrow him a shirt but imagining as she afterwards said by his being so bloody that he must be a dead man she ran with all speed to hasten the surgeon who was more than half drest apprehending that the coach had been overturned and some gentleman or lady hurt as soon as the wench had informed him at his window that it was a poor footpassenger who had been stripped of all he had and almost murdered he chid her for disturbing him so early slipped off his clothes again and very quietly returned to bed and to sleep  aurora now began to shew her blooming cheeks over the hills whilst ten millions of feathered songsters in jocund chorus repeated odes a thousand times sweeter than those of our laureat and sung both the day and the song when the master of the inn mr towwouse arose and learning from his maid an account of the robbery and the situation of his poor naked guest he shook his head and cried goodlackaday and then ordered the girl to carry him one of his own shirts  mrs towwouse was just awake and had stretched out her arms in vain to fold her departed husband when the maid entered the room whos there bettyyes madamwheres your masterhes without madam he hath sent me for a shirt to lend a poor naked man who hath been robbed and murderedtouch one if you dare you slut said mrs towwouse your master is a pretty sort of a man to take in naked vagabonds and clothe them with his own clothes i shall have no such doings if you offer to touch anything ill throw the chamberpot at your head go send your master to meyes madam answered betty as soon as he came in she thus began what the devil do you mean by this mr towwouse am i to buy shirts to lend to a set of scabby rascalsmy dear said mr towwouse this is a poor wretchyes says she i know it is a poor wretch but what the devil have we to do with poor wretches the law makes us provide for too many already we shall have thirty or forty poor wretches in red coats shortlymy dear cries towwouse this man hath been robbed of all he hathwell then said she wheres his money to pay his reckoning why doth not such a fellow go to an alehouse i shall send him packing as soon as i am up i assure youmy dear said he common charity wont suffer you to do thatcommon charity a ft says she common charity teaches us to provide for ourselves and our families and i and mine wont be ruined by your charity i assure youwell says he my dear do as you will when you are up you know i never contradict youno says she if the devil was to contradict me i would make the house too hot to hold him  with such like discourses they consumed near halfanhour whilst betty provided a shirt from the hostler who was one of her sweethearts and put it on poor joseph the surgeon had likewise at last visited him and washed and drest his wounds and was now come to acquaint mr towwouse that his guest was in such extreme danger of his life that he scarce saw any hopes of his recovery heres a pretty kettle of fish cries mrs towwouse you have brought upon us we are like to have a funeral at our own expense towwouse who notwithstanding his charity would have given his vote as freely as ever he did at an election that any other house in the kingdom should have quiet possession of his guest answered my dear i am not to blame he was brought hither by the stagecoach and betty had put him to bed before i was stirringill betty her says sheat which with half her garments on the other half under her arm she sallied out in quest of the unfortunate betty whilst towwouse and the surgeon went to pay a visit to poor joseph and inquire into the circumstances of this melancholy affair    chapter xiii  what happened to joseph during his sickness at the inn with the curious discourse between him and mr barnabas the parson of the parish   as soon as joseph had communicated a particular history of the robbery together with a short account of himself and his intended journey he asked the surgeon if he apprehended him to be in any danger to which the surgeon very honestly answered he feared he was for that his pulse was very exalted and feverish and if his fever should prove more than symptomatic it would be impossible to save him joseph fetching a deep sigh cried poor fanny i would i could have lived to see thee but gods will be done  the surgeon then advised him if he had any worldly affairs to settle that he would do it as soon as possible for though he hoped he might recover yet he thought himself obliged to acquaint him he was in great danger and if the malign concoction of his humours should cause a suscitation of his fever he might soon grow delirious and incapable to make his will joseph answered that it was impossible for any creature in the universe to be in a poorer condition than himself for since the robbery he had not one thing of any kind whatever which he could call his own i had said he a poor little piece of gold which they took away that would have been a comfort to me in all my afflictions but surely fanny i want nothing to remind me of thee i have thy dear image in my heart and no villain can ever tear it thence  joseph desired paper and pens to write a letter but they were refused him and he was advised to use all his endeavours to compose himself they then left him and mr towwouse sent to a clergyman to come and administer his good offices to the soul of poor joseph since the surgeon despaired of making any successful applications to his body  mr barnabas for that was the clergymans name came as soon as sent for and having first drank a dish of tea with the landlady and afterwards a bowl of punch with the landlord he walked up to the room where joseph lay but finding him asleep returned to take the other sneaker which when he had finished he again crept softly up to the chamberdoor and having opened it heard the sick man talking to himself in the following manner  o most adorable pamela most virtuous sister whose example could alone enable me to withstand all the temptations of riches and beauty and to preserve my virtue pure and chaste for the arms of my dear fanny if it had pleased heaven that i should ever have come unto them what riches or honours or pleasures can make us amends for the loss of innocence doth not that alone afford us more consolation than all worldly acquisitions what but innocence and virtue could give any comfort to such a miserable wretch as i am yet these can make me prefer this sick and painful bed to all the pleasures i should have found in my ladys these can make me face death without fear and though i love my fanny more than ever man loved a woman these can teach me to resign myself to the divine will without repining o thou delightful charming creature if heaven had indulged thee to my arms the poorest humblest state would have been a paradise i could have lived with thee in the lowest cottage without envying the palaces the dainties or the riches of any man breathing but i must leave thee leave thee for ever my dearest angel i must think of another world and i heartily pray thou mayst meet comfort in thisbarnabas thought he had heard enough so downstairs he went and told towwouse he could do his guest no service for that he was very lightheaded and had uttered nothing but a rhapsody of nonsense all the time he stayed in the room  the surgeon returned in the afternoon and found his patient in a higher fever as he said than when he left him though not delirious for notwithstanding mr barnabass opinion he had not been once out of his senses since his arrival at the inn  mr barnabas was again sent for and with much difficulty prevailed on to make another visit as soon as he entered the room he told joseph he was come to pray by him and to prepare him for another world in the first place therefore he hoped he had repented of all his sins joseph answered he hoped he had but there was one thing which he knew not whether he should call a sin if it was he feared he should die in the commission of it and that was the regret of parting with a young woman whom he loved as tenderly as he did his heartstrings barnabas bad him be assured that any repining at the divine will was one of the greatest sins he could commit that he ought to forget all carnal affections and think of better things joseph said that neither in this world nor the next he could forget his fanny and that the thought however grievous of parting from her for ever was not half so tormenting as the fear of what she would suffer when she knew his misfortune barnabas said that such fears argued a diffidence and despondence very criminal that he must divest himself of all human passions and fix his heart above joseph answered that was what he desired to do and should be obliged to him if he would enable him to accomplish it barnabas replied that must be done by grace joseph besought him to discover how he might attain it barnabas answered by prayer and faith he then questioned him concerning his forgiveness of the thieves joseph answered he feared that was more than he could do for nothing would give him more pleasure than to hear they were takenthat cries barnabas is for the sake of justiceyes said joseph but if i was to meet them again i am afraid i should attack them and kill them too if i coulddoubtless answered barnabas it is lawful to kill a thief but can you say you forgive them as a christian ought joseph desired to know what that forgiveness was that is answered barnabas to forgive them asasit is to forgive them asin short it is to forgive them as a christian joseph replied he forgave them as much as he couldwell well said barnabas that will do he then demanded of him if he remembered any more sins unrepented of and if he did he desired him to make haste and repent of them as fast as he could that they might repeat over a few prayers together joseph answered he could not recollect any great crimes he had been guilty of and that those he had committed he was sincerely sorry for barnabas said that was enough and then proceeded to prayer with all the expedition he was master of some company then waiting for him below in the parlour where the ingredients for punch were all in readiness but no one would squeeze the oranges till he came  joseph complained he was dry and desired a little tea which barnabas reported to mrs towwouse who answered she had just done drinking it and could not be slopping all day but ordered betty to carry him up some small beer  betty obeyed her mistresss commands but joseph as soon as he had tasted it said he feared it would increase his fever and that he longed very much for tea to which the goodnatured betty answered he should have tea if there was any in the land she accordingly went and bought him some herself and attended him with it where we will leave her and joseph together for some time to entertain the reader with other matters    chapter xiv  being very full of adventures which succeeded each other at the inn   it was now the dusk of the evening when a grave person rode into the inn and committing his horse to the hostler went directly into the kitchen and having called for a pipe of tobacco took his place by the fireside where several other persons were likewise assembled  the discourse ran altogether on the robbery which was committed the night before and on the poor wretch who lay above in the dreadful condition in which we have already seen him mrs towwouse said she wondered what the devil tom whipwell meant by bringing such guests to her house when there were so many alehouses on the road proper for their reception but she assured him if he died the parish should be at the expense of the funeral she added nothing would serve the fellows turn but tea she would assure him betty who was just returned from her charitable office answered she believed he was a gentleman for she never saw a finer skin in her life pox on his skin replied mrs towwouse i suppose that is all we are like to have for the reckoning i desire no such gentlemen should ever call at the dragon which it seems was the sign of the inn  the gentleman lately arrived discovered a great deal of emotion at the distress of this poor creature whom he observed to be fallen not into the most compassionate hands and indeed if mrs towwouse had given no utterance to the sweetness of her temper nature had taken such pains in her countenance that hogarth himself never gave more expression to a picture  her person was short thin and crooked her forehead projected in the middle and thence descended in a declivity to the top of her nose which was sharp and red and would have hung over her lips had not nature turned up the end of it her lips were two bits of skin which whenever she spoke she drew together in a purse her chin was peaked and at the upper end of that skin which composed her cheeks stood two bones that almost hid a pair of small red eyes add to this a voice most wonderfully adapted to the sentiments it was to convey being both loud and hoarse  it is not easy to say whether the gentleman had conceived a greater dislike for his landlady or compassion for her unhappy guest he inquired very earnestly of the surgeon who was now come into the kitchen whether he had any hopes of his recovery he begged him to use all possible means towards it telling him it was the duty of men of all professions to apply their skill gratis for the relief of the poor and necessitous the surgeon answered he should take proper care but he defied all the surgeons in london to do him any goodpray sir said the gentleman what are his woundswhy do you know anything of wounds says the surgeon winking upon mrs towwousesir i have a small smattering in surgery answered the gentlemana smatteringho ho ho said the surgeon i believe it is a smattering indeed  the company were all attentive expecting to hear the doctor who was what they call a dry fellow expose the gentleman  he began therefore with an air of triumph i suppose sir you have travelledno really sir said the gentlemanho then you have practised in the hospitals perhapsno sirhum not that neither whence sir then if i may be so bold to inquire have you got your knowledge in surgerysir answered the gentleman i do not pretend to much but the little i know i have from booksbooks cries the doctor what i suppose you have read galen and hippocratesno sir said the gentlemanhow you understand surgery answers the doctor and not read galen and hippocrates sir cries the other i believe there are many surgeons who have never read these authorsi believe so too says the doctor more shame for them but thanks to my education i have them by heart and very seldom go without them both in my pocketthey are pretty large books said the gentlemanaye said the doctor i believe i know how large they are better than you at which he fell a winking and the whole company burst into a laugh  the doctor pursuing his triumph asked the gentleman if he did not understand physic as well as surgery rather better answered the gentlemanaye like enough cries the doctor with a wink why i know a little of physic tooi wish i knew half so much said towwouse id never wear an apron againwhy i believe landlord cries the doctor there are few men though i say it within twelve miles of the place that handle a fever better veniente accurrite morbo that is my method i suppose brother you understand latina little says the gentlemanaye and greek now ill warrant you ton dapomibominos poluflosboio thalasses but i have almost forgot these things i could have repeated homer by heart onceifags the gentleman has caught a traytor says mrs towwouse at which they all fell a laughing  the gentleman who had not the least affection for joking very contentedly suffered the doctor to enjoy his victory which he did with no small satisfaction and having sufficiently sounded his depth told him he was thoroughly convinced of his great learning and abilities and that he would be obliged to him if he would let him know his opinion of his patients case abovestairssir says the doctor his case is that of a dead manthe contusion on his head has perforated the internal membrane of the occiput and divelicated that radical small minute invisible nerve which coheres to the pericranium and this was attended with a fever at first symptomatic then pneumatic and he is at length grown deliriuus or delirious as the vulgar express it  he was proceeding in this learned manner when a mighty noise interrupted him some young fellows in the neighbourhood had taken one of the thieves and were bringing him into the inn betty ran upstairs with this news to joseph who begged they might search for a little piece of broken gold which had a ribband tied to it and which he could swear to amongst all the hoards of the richest men in the universe  notwithstanding the fellows persisting in his innocence the mob were very busy in searching him and presently among other things pulled out the piece of gold just mentioned which betty no sooner saw than she laid violent hands on it and conveyed it up to joseph who received it with raptures of joy and hugging it in his bosom declared he could now die contented  within a few minutes afterwards came in some other fellows with a bundle which they had found in a ditch and which was indeed the cloaths which had been stripped off from joseph and the other things they had taken from him  the gentleman no sooner saw the coat than he declared he knew the livery and if it had been taken from the poor creature abovestairs desired he might see him for that he was very well acquainted with the family to whom that livery belonged  he was accordingly conducted up by betty but what reader was the surprize on both sides when he saw joseph was the person in bed and when joseph discovered the face of his good friend mr abraham adams  it would be impertinent to insert a discourse which chiefly turned on the relation of matters already well known to the reader for as soon as the curate had satisfied joseph concerning the perfect health of his fanny he was on his side very inquisitive into all the particulars which had produced this unfortunate accident  to return therefore to the kitchen where a great variety of company were now assembled from all the rooms of the house as well as the neighbourhood so much delight do men take in contemplating the countenance of a thief  mr towwouse began to rub his hands with pleasure at seeing so large an assembly who would he hoped shortly adjourn into several apartments in order to discourse over the robbery and drink a health to all honest men but mrs towwouse whose misfortune it was commonly to see things a little perversely began to rail at those who brought the fellow into her house telling her husband they were very likely to thrive who kept a house of entertainment for beggars and thieves  the mob had now finished their search and could find nothing about the captive likely to prove any evidence for as to the cloaths though the mob were very well satisfied with that proof yet as the surgeon observed they could not convict him because they were not found in his custody to which barnabas agreed and added that these were bona waviata and belonged to the lord of the manor  how says the surgeon do you say these goods belong to the lord of the manori do cried barnabasthen i deny it says the surgeon what can the lord of the manor have to do in the case will any one attempt to persuade me that what a man finds is not his owni have heard says an old fellow in the corner justice wiseone say that if every man had his right whatever is found belongs to the king of londonthat may be true says barnabas in some sense for the law makes a difference between things stolen and things found for a thing may be stolen that never is found and a thing may be found that never was stolen now goods that are both stolen and found are waviata and they belong to the lord of the manorso the lord of the manor is the receiver of stolen goods says the doctor at which there was an universal laugh being first begun by himself  while the prisoner by persisting in his innocence had almost as there was no evidence against him brought over barnabas the surgeon towwouse and several others to his side betty informed them that they had overlooked a little piece of gold which she had carried up to the man in bed and which he offered to swear to amongst a million aye amongst ten thousand this immediately turned the scale against the prisoner and every one now concluded him guilty it was resolved therefore to keep him secured that night and early in the morning to carry him before a justice    chapter xv  showing how mrs towwouse was a little mollified and how officious mr barnabas and the surgeon were to prosecute the thief with a dissertation accounting for their zeal and that of many other persons not mentioned in this history   betty told her mistress she believed the man in bed was a greater man than they took him for for besides the extreme whiteness of his skin and the softness of his hands she observed a very great familiarity between the gentleman and him and added she was certain they were intimate acquaintance if not relations  this somewhat abated the severity of mrs towwouses countenance she said god forbid she should not discharge the duty of a christian since the poor gentleman was brought to her house she had a natural antipathy to vagabonds but could pity the misfortunes of a christian as soon as another towwouse said if the traveller be a gentleman though he hath no money about him now we shall most likely be paid hereafter so you may begin to score whenever you will mrs towwouse answered hold your simple tongue and dont instruct me in my business i am sure i am sorry for the gentlemans misfortune with all my heart and i hope the villain who hath used him so barbarously will be hanged betty go see what he wants god forbid he should want anything in my house  barnabas and the surgeon went up to joseph to satisfy themselves concerning the piece of gold joseph was with difficulty prevailed upon to show it them but would by no entreaties be brought to deliver it out of his own possession he however attested this to be the same which had been taken from him and betty was ready to swear to the finding it on the thief  the only difficulty that remained was how to produce this gold before the justice for as to carrying joseph himself it seemed impossible nor was there any great likelihood of obtaining it from him for he had fastened it with a ribband to his arm and solemnly vowed that nothing but irresistible force should ever separate them in which resolution mr adams clenching a fist rather less than the knuckle of an ox declared he would support him  a dispute arose on this occasion concerning evidence not very necessary to be related here after which the surgeon dressed mr josephs head still persisting in the imminent danger in which his patient lay but concluding with a very important look that he began to have some hopes that he should send him a sanative soporiferous draught and would see him in the morning after which barnabas and he departed and left mr joseph and mr adams together  adams informed joseph of the occasion of this journey which he was making to london namely to publish three volumes of sermons being encouraged as he said by an advertisement lately set forth by the society of booksellers who proposed to purchase any copies offered to them at a price to be settled by two persons but though he imagined he should get a considerable sum of money on this occasion which his family were in urgent need of he protested he would not leave joseph in his present condition finally he told him he had nine shillings and threepence halfpenny in his pocket which he was welcome to use as he pleased  this goodness of parson adams brought tears into josephs eyes he declared he had now a second reason to desire life that he might show his gratitude to such a friend adams bade him be cheerful for that he plainly saw the surgeon besides his ignorance desired to make a merit of curing him though the wounds in his head he perceived were by no means dangerous that he was convinced he had no fever and doubted not but he would be able to travel in a day or two  these words infused a spirit into joseph he said he found himself very sore from the bruises but had no reason to think any of his bones injured or that he had received any harm in his inside unless that he felt something very odd in his stomach but he knew not whether that might not arise from not having eaten one morsel for above twentyfour hours being then asked if he had any inclination to eat he answered in the affirmative then parson adams desired him to name what he had the greatest fancy for whether a poached egg or chickenbroth he answered he could eat both very well but that he seemed to have the greatest appetite for a piece of boiled beef and cabbage  adams was pleased with so perfect a confirmation that he had not the least fever but advised him to a lighter diet for that evening he accordingly ate either a rabbit or a fowl i never could with any tolerable certainty discover which after this he was by mrs towwouses order conveyed into a better bed and equipped with one of her husbands shirts  in the morning early barnabas and the surgeon came to the inn in order to see the thief conveyed before the justice they had consumed the whole night in debating what measures they should take to produce the piece of gold in evidence against him for they were both extremely zealous in the business though neither of them were in the least interested in the prosecution neither of them had ever received any private injury from the fellow nor had either of them ever been suspected of loving the publick well enough to give them a sermon or a dose of physic for nothing  to help our reader therefore as much as possible to account for this zeal we must inform him that as this parish was so unfortunate as to have no lawyer in it there had been a constant contention between the two doctors spiritual and physical concerning their abilities in a science in which as neither of them professed it they had equal pretensions to dispute each others opinions these disputes were carried on with great contempt on both sides and had almost divided the parish mr towwouse and one half of the neighbours inclining to the surgeon and mrs towwouse with the other half to the parson the surgeon drew his knowledge from those inestimable fountains called the attorneys pocket companion and mr jacobs lawtables barnabas trusted entirely to woods institutes it happened on this occasion as was pretty frequently the case that these two learned men differed about the sufficiency of evidence the doctor being of opinion that the maids oath would convict the prisoner without producing the gold the parson é contra totis viribus to display their parts therefore before the justice and the parish was the sole motive which we can discover to this zeal which both of them pretended to have for public justice  o vanity how little is thy force acknowledged or thy operations discerned how wantonly dost thou deceive mankind under different disguises sometimes thou dost wear the face of pity sometimes of generosity nay thou hast the assurance even to put on those glorious ornaments which belong only to heroic virtue thou odious deformed monster whom priests have railed at philosophers despised and poets ridiculed is there a wretch so abandoned as to own thee for an acquaintance in publicyet how few will refuse to enjoy thee in private nay thou art the pursuit of most men through their lives the greatest villainies are daily practised to please thee nor is the meanest thief below or the greatest hero above thy notice thy embraces are often the sole aim and sole reward of the private robbery and the plundered province it is to pamper up thee thou harlot that we attempt to withdraw from others what we do not want or to withhold from them what they do all our passions are thy slaves avarice itself is often no more than thy handmaid and even lust thy pimp the bully fear like a coward flies before thee and joy and grief hide their heads in thy presence  i know thou wilt think that whilst i abuse thee i court thee and that thy love hath inspired me to write this sarcastical panegyric on thee but thou art deceived i value thee not of a farthing nor will it give me any pain if thou shouldst prevail on the reader to censure this digression as arrant nonsense for know to thy confusion that i have introduced thee for no other purpose than to lengthen out a short chapter and so i return to my history    chapter xvi  the escape of the thief mr adamss disappointment the arrival of two very extraordinary personages and the introduction of parson adams to parson barnabas   barnabas and the surgeon being returned as we have said to the inn in order to convey the thief before the justice were greatly concerned to find a small accident had happened which somewhat disconcerted them and this was no other than the thiefs escape who had modestly withdrawn himself by night declining all ostentation and not chusing in imitation of some great men to distinguish himself at the expense of being pointed at  when the company had retired the evening before the thief was detained in a room where the constable and one of the young fellows who took him were planted as his guard about the second watch a general complaint of drought was made both by the prisoner and his keepers among whom it was at last agreed that the constable should remain on duty and the young fellow call up the tapster in which disposition the latter apprehended not the least danger as the constable was well armed and could besides easily summon him back to his assistance if the prisoner made the least attempt to gain his liberty  the young fellow had not long left the room before it came into the constables head that the prisoner might leap on him by surprize and thereby preventing him of the use of his weapons especially the long staff in which he chiefly confided might reduce the success of a struggle to a equal chance he wisely therefore to prevent this inconvenience slipt out of the room himself and locked the door waiting without with his staff in his hand ready lifted to fell the unhappy prisoner if by ill fortune he should attempt to break out  but human life as hath been discovered by some great man or other for i would by no means be understood to affect the honour of making any such discovery very much resembles a game at chess for as in the latter while a gamester is too attentive to secure himself very strongly on one side the board he is apt to leave an unguarded opening on the other so doth it often happen in life and so did it happen on this occasion for whilst the cautious constable with such wonderful sagacity had possessed himself of the door he most unhappily forgot the window  the thief who played on the other side no sooner perceived this opening than he began to move that way and finding the passage easy he took with him the young fellows hat and without any ceremony stepped into the street and made the best of his way  the young fellow returning with a double mug of strong beer was a little surprized to find the constable at the door but much more so when the door being opened he perceived the prisoner had made his escape and which way he threw down the beer and without uttering anything to the constable except a hearty curse or two he nimbly leapt out of the window and went again in pursuit of his prey being very unwilling to lose the reward which he had assured himself of  the constable hath not been discharged of suspicion on this account it hath been said that not being concerned in the taking the thief he could not have been entitled to any part of the reward if he had been convicted that the thief had several guineas in his pocket that it was very unlikely he should have been guilty of such an oversight that his pretence for leaving the room was absurd that it was his constant maxim that a wise man never refused money on any conditions that at every election he always had sold his vote to both parties c  but notwithstanding these and many other such allegations i am sufficiently convinced of his innocence having been positively assured of it by those who received their informations from his own mouth which in the opinion of some moderns is the best and indeed only evidence  all the family were now up and with many others assembled in the kitchen where mr towwouse was in some tribulation the surgeon having declared that by law he was liable to be indicted for the thiefs escape as it was out of his house he was a little comforted however by mr barnabass opinion that as the escape was by night the indictment would not lie  mrs towwouse delivered herself in the following words sure never was such a fool as my husband would any other person living have left a man in the custody of such a drunken drowsy blockhead as tom suckbribe which was the constables name and if he could be indicted without any harm to his wife and children i should be glad of it then the bell rung in josephs room why betty john chamberlain where the devil are you all have you no ears or no conscience not to tend the sick better see what the gentleman wants why dont you go yourself mr towwouse but any one may die for you you have no more feeling than a deal board if a man lived a fortnight in your house without spending a penny you would never put him in mind of it see whether he drinks tea or coffee for breakfast yes my dear cried towwouse she then asked the doctor and mr barnabas what mornings draught they chose who answered they had a pot of cyderand at the fire which we will leave them merry over and return to joseph  he had rose pretty early this morning but though his wounds were far from threatening any danger he was so sore with the bruises that it was impossible for him to think of undertaking a journey yet mr adams therefore whose stock was visibly decreased with the expenses of supper and breakfast and which could not survive that days scoring began to consider how it was possible to recruit it at last he cried he had luckily hit on a sure method and though it would oblige him to return himself home together with joseph it mattered not much he then sent for towwouse and taking him into another room told him he wanted to borrow three guineas for which he would put ample security into his hands towwouse who expected a watch or ring or something of double the value answered he believed he could furnish him upon which adams pointing to his saddlebag told him with a face and voice full of solemnity that there were in that bag no less than nine volumes of manuscript sermons as well worth a hundred pounds as a shilling was worth twelve pence and that he would deposit one of the volumes in his hands by way of pledge not doubting but that he would have the honesty to return it on his repayment of the money for otherwise he must be a very great loser seeing that every volume would at least bring him ten pounds as he had been informed by a neighbouring clergyman in the country for said he as to my own part having never yet dealt in printing i do not pretend to ascertain the exact value of such things  towwouse who was a little surprized at the pawn said and not without some truth that he was no judge of the price of such kind of goods and as for money he really was very short adams answered certainly he would not scruple to lend him three guineas on what was undoubtedly worth at least ten the landlord replied he did not believe he had so much money in the house and besides he was to make up a sum he was very confident the books were of much higher value and heartily sorry it did not suit him he then cried out coming sir though nobody called and ran downstairs without any fear of breaking his neck  poor adams was extremely dejected at this disappointment nor knew he what further stratagem to try he immediately applied to his pipe his constant friend and comfort in his afflictions and leaning over the rails he devoted himself to meditation assisted by the inspiring fumes of tobacco  he had on a nightcap drawn over his wig and a short greatcoat which half covered his cassocka dress which added to something comical enough in his countenance composed a figure likely to attract the eyes of those who were not over given to observation  whilst he was smoaking his pipe in this posture a coach and six with a numerous attendance drove into the inn there alighted from the coach a young fellow and a brace of pointers after which another young fellow leapt from the box and shook the former by the hand and both together with the dogs were instantly conducted by mr towwouse into an apartment whither as they passed they entertained themselves with the following short facetious dialogue  you are a pretty fellow for a coachman jack says he from the coach you had almost overturned us just nowpox take you says the coachman if i had only broke your neck it would have been saving somebody else the trouble but i should have been sorry for the pointerswhy you son of a b answered the other if nobody could shoot better than you the pointers would be of no usedn me says the coachman i will shoot with you five guineas a shotyou be hanged says the other for five guineas you shall shoot at my adone says the coachman ill pepper you better than ever you was peppered by jenny bouncerpepper your grandmother says the other heres towwouse will let you shoot at him for a shilling a timei know his honour better cries towwouse i never saw a surer shot at a partridge every man misses now and then but if i could shoot half as well as his honour i would desire no better livelihood than i could get by my gunpox on you said the coachman you demolish more game now than your heads worth theres a bitch towwouse by g she never blinkeda a bird in her lifei have a puppy not a year old shall hunt with her for a hundred cries the other gentlemandone says the coachman but you will be poxd before you make the bettif you have a mind for a bett cries the coachman i will match my spotted dog with your white bitch for a hundred play or paydone says the other and ill run baldface against slouch with you for anotherno cries he from the box but ill venture miss jenny against baldface or hannibal eithergo to the devil cries he from the coach i will make every bett your own way to be sure i will match hannibal with slouch for a thousand if you dare and i say done first  footnote a to blink is a term used to signify the dogs passing by a bird without pointing at it  they were now arrived and the reader will be very contented to leave them and repair to the kitchen where barnabas the surgeon and an exciseman were smoaking their pipes over some cyderand and where the servants who attended the two noble gentlemen we have just seen alight were now arrived  tom cries one of the footmen theres parson adams smoaking his pipe in the galleryyes says tom i pulled off my hat to him and the parson spoke to me  is the gentleman a clergyman then says barnabas for his cassock had been tied up when he arrived yes sir answered the footman and one there be but few likeaye said barnabas if i had known it sooner i should have desired his company i would always shew a proper respect for the cloth but what say you doctor shall we adjourn into a room and invite him to take part of a bowl of punch  this proposal was immediately agreed to and executed and parson adams accepting the invitation much civility passed between the two clergymen who both declared the great honour they had for the cloth they had not been long together before they entered into a discourse on small tithes which continued a full hour without the doctor or excisemans having one opportunity to offer a word  it was then proposed to begin a general conversation and the exciseman opened on foreign affairs but a word unluckily dropping from one of them introduced a dissertation on the hardships suffered by the inferior clergy which after a long duration concluded with bringing the nine volumes of sermons on the carpet  barnabas greatly discouraged poor adams he said the age was so wicked that nobody read sermons would you think it mr adams said he i once intended to print a volume of sermons myself and they had the approbation of two or three bishops but what do you think a bookseller offered metwelve guineas perhaps cried adamsnot twelve pence i assure you answered barnabas nay the dog refused me a concordance in exchange at last i offered to give him the printing them for the sake of dedicating them to that very gentleman who just now drove his own coach into the inn and i assure you he had the impudence to refuse my offer by which means i lost a good living that was afterwards given away in exchange for a pointer to one whobut i will not say anything against the cloth so you may guess mr adams what you are to expect for if sermons would have gone down i believei will not be vain but to be concise with you three bishops said they were the best that ever were writ but indeed there are a pretty moderate number printed already and not all sold yetpray sir said adams to what do you think the numbers may amountsir answered barnabas a bookseller told me he believed five thousand volumes at leastfive thousand quoth the surgeon what can they be writ upon i remember when i was a boy i used to read one tillotsons sermons and i am sure if a man practised half so much as is in one of those sermons he will go to heavendoctor cried barnabas you have a prophane way of talking for which i must reprove you a man can never have his duty too frequently inculcated into him and as for tillotson to be sure he was a good writer and said things very well but comparisons are odious another man may write as well as hei believe there are some of my sermonsand then he applied the candle to his pipeand i believe there are some of my discourses cries adams which the bishops would not think totally unworthy of being printed and i have been informed i might procure a very large sum indeed an immense one on themi doubt that answered barnabas however if you desire to make some money of them perhaps you may sell them by advertising the manuscript sermons of a clergyman lately deceased all warranted originals and never printed and now i think of it i should be obliged to you if there be ever a funeral one among them to lend it me for i am this very day to preach a funeral sermon for which i have not penned a line though i am to have a double priceadams answered he had but one which he feared would not serve his purpose being sacred to the memory of a magistrate who had exerted himself very singularly in the preservation of the morality of his neighbours insomuch that he had neither alehouse nor lewd woman in the parish where he livedno replied barnabas that will not do quite so well for the deceased upon whose virtues i am to harangue was a little too much addicted to liquor and publickly kept a mistressi believe i must take a common sermon and trust to my memory to introduce something handsome on himto your invention rather said the doctor your memory will be apter to put you out for no man living remembers anything good of him  with such kind of spiritual discourse they emptied the bowl of punch paid their reckoning and separated adams and the doctor went up to joseph parson barnabas departed to celebrate the aforesaid deceased and the exciseman descended into the cellar to gauge the vessels  joseph was now ready to sit down to a loin of mutton and waited for mr adams when he and the doctor came in the doctor having felt his pulse and examined his wounds declared him much better which he imputed to that sanative soporiferous draught a medicine whose virtues he said were never to be sufficiently extolled and great indeed they must be if joseph was so much indebted to them as the doctor imagined since nothing more than those effluvia which escaped the cork could have contributed to his recovery for the medicine had stood untouched in the window ever since its arrival  joseph passed that day and the three following with his friend adams in which nothing so remarkable happened as the swift progress of his recovery as he had an excellent habit of body his wounds were now almost healed and his bruises gave him so little uneasiness that he pressed mr adams to let him depart told him he should never be able to return sufficient thanks for all his favours but begged that he might no longer delay his journey to london  adams notwithstanding the ignorance as he conceived it of mr towwouse and the envy for such he thought it of mr barnabas had great expectations from his sermons seeing therefore joseph in so good a way he told him he would agree to his setting out the next morning in the stagecoach that he believed he should have sufficient after the reckoning paid to procure him one days conveyance in it and afterwards he would be able to get on on foot or might be favoured with a lift in some neighbours waggon especially as there was then to be a fair in the town whither the coach would carry him to which numbers from his parish resortedand as to himself he agreed to proceed to the great city  they were now walking in the innyard when a fat fair short person rode in and alighting from his horse went directly up to barnabas who was smoaking his pipe on a bench the parson and the stranger shook one another very lovingly by the hand and went into a room together  the evening now coming on joseph retired to his chamber whither the good adams accompanied him and took this opportunity to expatiate on the great mercies god had lately shown him of which he ought not only to have the deepest inward sense but likewise to express outward thankfulness for them they therefore fell both on their knees and spent a considerable time in prayer and thanksgiving  they had just finished when betty came in and told mr adams mr barnabas desired to speak to him on some business of consequence belowstairs joseph desired if it was likely to detain him long he would let him know it that he might go to bed which adams promised and in that case they wished one another goodnight    chapter xvii  a pleasant discourse between the two parsons and the bookseller which was broke off by an unlucky accident happening in the inn which produced a dialogue between mrs towwouse and her maid of no gentle kind   as soon as adams came into the room mr barnabas introduced him to the stranger who was he told him a bookseller and would be as likely to deal with him for his sermons as any man whatever adams saluting the stranger answered barnabas that he was very much obliged to him that nothing could be more convenient for he had no other business to the great city and was heartily desirous of returning with the young man who was just recovered of his misfortune he then snapt his fingers as was usual with him and took two or three turns about the room in an extasy and to induce the bookseller to be as expeditious as possible as likewise to offer him a better price for his commodity he assured them their meeting was extremely lucky to himself for that he had the most pressing occasion for money at that time his own being almost spent and having a friend then in the same inn who was just recovered from some wounds he had received from robbers and was in a most indigent condition so that nothing says he could be so opportune for the supplying both our necessities as my making an immediate bargain with you  as soon as he had seated himself the stranger began in these words sir i do not care absolutely to deny engaging in what my friend mr barnabas recommends but sermons are mere drugs the trade is so vastly stocked with them that really unless they come out with the name of whitefield or wesley or some other such great man as a bishop or those sort of people i dont care to touch unless now it was a sermon preached on the  0th of january or we could say in the titlepage published at the earnest request of the congregation or the inhabitants but truly for a dry piece of sermons i had rather be excused especially as my hands are so full at present however sir as mr barnabas mentioned them to me i will if you please take the manuscript with me to town and send you my opinion of it in a very short time  oh said adams if you desire it i will read two or three discourses as a specimen this barnabas who loved sermons no better than a grocer doth figs immediately objected to and advised adams to let the bookseller have his sermons telling him if he gave him a direction he might be certain of a speedy answer adding he need not scruple trusting them in his possession no said the bookseller if it was a play that had been acted twenty nights together i believe it would be safe  adams did not at all relish the last expression he said he was sorry to hear sermons compared to plays not by me i assure you cried the bookseller though i dont know whether the licensing act may not shortly bring them to the same footing but i have formerly known a hundred guineas given for a playmore shame for those who gave it cried barnabaswhy so said the bookseller for they got hundreds by itbut is there no difference between conveying good or ill instructions to mankind said adams would not an honest mind rather lose money by the one than gain it by the otherif you can find any such i will not be their hindrance answered the bookseller but i think those persons who get by preaching sermons are the properest to lose by printing them for my part the copy that sells best will be always the best copy in my opinion i am no enemy to sermons but because they dont sell for i would as soon print one of whitefields as any farce whatever  whoever prints such heterodox stuff ought to be hanged says barnabas sir said he turning to adams this fellows writings i know not whether you have seen them are levelled at the clergy he would reduce us to the example of the primitive ages forsooth and would insinuate to the people that a clergyman ought to be always preaching and praying he pretends to understand the scripture literally and would make mankind believe that the poverty and low estate which was recommended to the church in its infancy and was only temporary doctrine adapted to her under persecution was to be preserved in her flourishing and established state sir the principles of toland woolston and all the freethinkers are not calculated to do half the mischief as those professed by this fellow and his followers  sir answered adams if mr whitefield had carried his doctrine no farther than you mention i should have remained as i once was his wellwisher i am myself as great an enemy to the luxury and splendour of the clergy as he can be i do not more than he by the flourishing estate of the church understand the palaces equipages dress furniture rich dainties and vast fortunes of her ministers surely those things which savour so strongly of this world become not the servants of one who professed his kingdom was not of it but when he began to call nonsense and enthusiasm to his aid and set up the detestable doctrine of faith against good works i was his friend no longer for surely that doctrine was coined in hell and one would think none but the devil himself could have the confidence to preach it for can anything be more derogatory to the honour of god than for men to imagine that the allwise being will hereafter say to the good and virtuous notwithstanding the purity of thy life notwithstanding that constant rule of virtue and goodness in which you walked upon earth still as thou didst not believe everything in the true orthodox manner thy want of faith shall condemn thee or on the other side can any doctrine have a more pernicious influence on society than a persuasion that it will be a good plea for the villain at the last daylord it is true i never obeyed one of thy commandments yet punish me not for i believe them alli suppose sir said the bookseller your sermons are of a different kindaye sir said adams the contrary i thank heaven is inculcated in almost every page or i should belye my own opinion which hath always been that a virtuous and good turk or heathen are more acceptable in the sight of their creator than a vicious and wicked christian though his faith was as perfectly orthodox as st pauls himselfi wish you success says the bookseller but must beg to be excused as my hands are so very full at present and indeed i am afraid you will find a backwardness in the trade to engage in a book which the clergy would be certain to cry downgod forbid says adams any books should be propagated which the clergy would cry down but if you mean by the clergy some few designing factious men who have it at heart to establish some favourite schemes at the price of the liberty of mankind and the very essence of religion it is not in the power of such persons to decry any book they please witness that excellent book called a plain account of the nature and end of the sacrament a book written if i may venture on the expression with the pen of an angel and calculated to restore the true use of christianity and of that sacred institution for what could tend more to the noble purposes of religion than frequent chearful meetings among the members of a society in which they should in the presence of one another and in the service of the supreme being make promises of being good friendly and benevolent to each other now this excellent book was attacked by a party but unsuccessfully at these words barnabas fell aringing with all the violence imaginable upon which a servant attending he bid him bring a bill immediately for that he was in company for aught he knew with the devil himself and he expected to hear the alcoran the leviathan or woolston commended if he staid a few minutes longer adams desired as he was so much moved at his mentioning a book which he did without apprehending any possibility of offence that he would be so kind to propose any objections he had to it which he would endeavour to answeri propose objections said barnabas i never read a syllable in any such wicked book i never saw it in my life i assure youadams was going to answer when a most hideous uproar began in the inn mrs towwouse mr towwouse and betty all lifting up their voices together but mrs towwouses voice like a bass viol in a concert was clearly and distinctly distinguished among the rest and was heard to articulate the following soundso you damnd villain is this the return to all the care i have taken of your family this the reward of my virtue is this the manner in which you behave to one who brought you a fortune and preferred you to so many matches all your betters to abuse my bed my own bed with my own servant but ill maul the slut ill tear her nasty eyes out was ever such a pitiful dog to take up with such a mean trollop if she had been a gentlewoman like myself it had been some excuse but a beggarly saucy dirty servantmaid get you out of my house you whore to which she added another name which we do not care to stain our paper with it was a monosyllable beginning with a b and indeed was the same as if she had pronounced the words shedog which term we shall to avoid offence use on this occasion though indeed both the mistress and maid uttered the abovementioned b a word extremely disgustful to females of the lower sort betty had borne all hitherto with patience and had uttered only lamentations but the last appellation stung her to the quick i am a woman as well as yourself she roared out and no shedog and if i have been a little naughty i am not the first if i have been no better than i should be cries she sobbing thats no reason you should call me out of my name my bebetters are worse than mehuzzy huzzy says mrs towwouse have you the impudence to answer me did i not catch you you saucyand then again repeated the terrible word so odious to female ears i cant bear that name answered betty if i have been wicked i am to answer for it myself in the other world but i have done nothing thats unnatural and i will go out of your house this moment for i will never be called shedog by any mistress in england mrs towwouse then armed herself with the spit but was prevented from executing any dreadful purpose by mr adams who confined her arms with the strength of a wrist which hercules would not have been ashamed of mr towwouse being caught as our lawyers express it with the manner and having no defence to make very prudently withdrew himself and betty committed herself to the protection of the hostler who though she could not conceive him pleased with what had happened was in her opinion rather a gentler beast than her mistress  mrs towwouse at the intercession of mr adams and finding the enemy vanished began to compose herself and at length recovered the usual serenity of her temper in which we will leave her to open to the reader the steps which led to a catastrophe common enough and comical enough too perhaps in modern history yet often fatal to the repose and wellbeing of families and the subject of many tragedies both in life and on the stage    chapter xviii  the history of betty the chambermaid and an account of what occasioned the violent scene in the preceding chapter   betty who was the occasion of all this hurry had some good qualities she had goodnature generosity and compassion but unfortunately her constitution was composed of those warm ingredients which though the purity of courts or nunneries might have happily controuled them were by no means able to endure the ticklish situation of a chambermaid at an inn who is daily liable to the solicitations of lovers of all complexions to the dangerous addresses of fine gentlemen of the army who sometimes are obliged to reside with them a whole year together and above all are exposed to the caresses of footmen stagecoachmen and drawers all of whom employ the whole artillery of kissing flattering bribing and every other weapon which is to be found in the whole armoury of love against them  betty who was but oneandtwenty had now lived three years in this dangerous situation during which she had escaped pretty well an ensign of foot was the first person who made an impression on her heart he did indeed raise a flame in her which required the care of a surgeon to cool  while she burnt for him several others burnt for her officers of the army young gentlemen travelling the western circuit inoffensive squires and some of graver character were set afire by her charms  at length having perfectly recovered the effects of her first unhappy passion she seemed to have vowed a state of perpetual chastity she was long deaf to all the sufferings of her lovers till one day at a neighbouring fair the rhetoric of john the hostler with a new straw hat and a pint of wine made a second conquest over her  she did not however feel any of those flames on this occasion which had been the consequence of her former amour nor indeed those other ill effects which prudent young women very justly apprehend from too absolute an indulgence to the pressing endearments of their lovers this latter perhaps was a little owing to her not being entirely constant to john with whom she permitted tom whipwell the stagecoachman and now and then a handsome young traveller to share her favours  mr towwouse had for some time cast the languishing eyes of affection on this young maiden he had laid hold on every opportunity of saying tender things to her squeezing her by the hand and sometimes kissing her lips for as the violence of his passion had considerably abated to mrs towwouse so like water which is stopt from its usual current in one place it naturally sought a vent in another mrs towwouse is thought to have perceived this abatement and probably it added very little to the natural sweetness of her temper for though she was as true to her husband as the dial to the sun she was rather more desirous of being shone on as being more capable of feeling his warmth  ever since josephs arrival betty had conceived an extraordinary liking to him which discovered itself more and more as he grew better and better till that fatal evening when as she was warming his bed her passion grew to such a height and so perfectly mastered both her modesty and her reason that after many fruitless hints and sly insinuations she at last threw down the warmingpan and embracing him with great eagerness swore he was the handsomest creature she had ever seen  joseph in great confusion leapt from her and told her he was sorry to see a young woman cast off all regard to modesty but she had gone too far to recede and grew so very indecent that joseph was obliged contrary to his inclination to use some violence to her and taking her in his arms he shut her out of the room and locked the door  how ought man to rejoice that his chastity is always in his own power that if he hath sufficient strength of mind he hath always a competent strength of body to defend himself and cannot like a poor weak woman be ravished against his will  betty was in the most violent agitation at this disappointment rage and lust pulled her heart as with two strings two different ways one moment she thought of stabbing joseph the next of taking him in her arms and devouring him with kisses but the latter passion was far more prevalent then she thought of revenging his refusal on herself but whilst she was engaged in this meditation happily death presented himself to her in so many shapes of drowning hanging poisoning c that her distracted mind could resolve on none in this perturbation of spirit it accidentally occurred to her memory that her masters bed was not made she therefore went directly to his room where he happened at that time to be engaged at his bureau as soon as she saw him she attempted to retire but he called her back and taking her by the hand squeezed her so tenderly at the same time whispering so many soft things into her ears and then pressed her so closely with his kisses that the vanquished fair one whose passions were already raised and which were not so whimsically capricious that one man only could lay them though perhaps she would have rather preferred that onethe vanquished fair one quietly submitted i say to her masters will who had just attained the accomplishment of his bliss when mrs towwouse unexpectedly entered the room and caused all that confusion which we have before seen and which it is not necessary at present to take any farther notice of since without the assistance of a single hint from us every reader of any speculation or experience though not married himself may easily conjecture that it concluded with the discharge of betty the submission of mr towwouse with some things to be performed on his side by way of gratitude for his wifes goodness in being reconciled to him with many hearty promises never to offend any more in the like manner and lastly his quietly and contentedly bearing to be reminded of his transgressions as a kind of penance once or twice a day during the residue of his life     book ii    chapter i  of divisions in authors   there are certain mysteries or secrets in all trades from the highest to the lowest from that of primeministering to this of authoring which are seldom discovered unless to members of the same calling among those used by us gentlemen of the latter occupation i take this of dividing our works into books and chapters to be none of the least considerable now for want of being truly acquainted with this secret common readers imagine that by this art of dividing we mean only to swell our works to a much larger bulk than they would otherwise be extended to these several places therefore in our paper which are filled with our books and chapters are understood as so much buckram stays and staytape in a taylors bill serving only to make up the sum total commonly found at the bottom of our first page and of his last  but in reality the case is otherwise and in this as well as all other instances we consult the advantage of our reader not our own and indeed many notable uses arise to him from this method for first those little spaces between our chapters may be looked upon as an inn or restingplace where he may stop and take a glass or any other refreshment as it pleases him nay our fine readers will perhaps be scarce able to travel farther than through one of them in a day as to those vacant pages which are placed between our books they are to be regarded as those stages where in long journies the traveller stays some time to repose himself and consider of what he hath seen in the parts he hath already passed through a consideration which i take the liberty to recommend a little to the reader for however swift his capacity may be i would not advise him to travel through these pages too fast for if he doth he may probably miss the seeing some curious productions of nature which will be observed by the slower and more accurate reader a volume without any such places of rest resembles the opening of wilds or seas which tires the eye and fatigues the spirit when entered upon  secondly what are the contents prefixed to every chapter but so many inscriptions over the gates of inns to continue the same metaphor informing the reader what entertainment he is to expect which if he likes not he may travel on to the next for in biography as we are not tied down to an exact concatenation equally with other historians so a chapter or two for instance this i am now writing may be often passed over without any injury to the whole and in these inscriptions i have been as faithful as possible not imitating the celebrated montaigne who promises you one thing and gives you another nor some titlepage authors who promise a great deal and produce nothing at all  there are besides these more obvious benefits several others which our readers enjoy from this art of dividing though perhaps most of them too mysterious to be presently understood by any who are not initiated into the science of authoring to mention therefore but one which is most obvious it prevents spoiling the beauty of a book by turning down its leaves a method otherwise necessary to those readers who though they read with great improvement and advantage are apt when they return to their study after halfanhours absence to forget where they left off  these divisions have the sanction of great antiquity homer not only divided his great work into twentyfour books in compliment perhaps to the twentyfour letters to which he had very particular obligations but according to the opinion of some very sagacious critics hawked them all separately delivering only one book at a time probably by subscription he was the first inventor of the art which hath so long lain dormant of publishing by numbers an art now brought to such perfection that even dictionaries are divided and exhibited piecemeal to the public nay one bookseller hath to encourage learning and ease the public contrived to give them a dictionary in this divided manner for only fifteen shillings more than it would have cost entire  virgil hath given us his poem in twelve books an argument of his modesty for by that doubtless he would insinuate that he pretends to no more than half the merit of the greek for the same reason our milton went originally no farther than ten till being puffed up by the praise of his friends he put himself on the same footing with the roman poet  i shall not however enter so deep into this matter as some very learned criticks have done who have with infinite labour and acute discernment discovered what books are proper for embellishment and what require simplicity only particularly with regard to similes which i think are now generally agreed to become any book but the first  i will dismiss this chapter with the following observation that it becomes an author generally to divide a book as it does a butcher to joint his meat for such assistance is of great help to both the reader and the carver and now having indulged myself a little i will endeavour to indulge the curiosity of my reader who is no doubt impatient to know what he will find in the subsequent chapters of this book    chapter ii  a surprizing instance of mr adamss short memory with the unfortunate consequences which it brought on joseph   mr adams and joseph were now ready to depart different ways when an accident determined the former to return with his friend which towwouse barnabas and the bookseller had not been able to do this accident was that those sermons which the parson was travelling to london to publish were o my good reader left behind what he had mistaken for them in the saddlebags being no other than three shirts a pair of shoes and some other necessaries which mrs adams who thought her husband would want shirts more than sermons on his journey had carefully provided him  this discovery was now luckily owing to the presence of joseph at the opening the saddlebags who having heard his friend say he carried with him nine volumes of sermons and not being of that sect of philosophers who can reduce all the matter of the world into a nutshell seeing there was no room for them in the bags where the parson had said they were deposited had the curiosity to cry out bless me sir where are your sermons the parson answered there there child there they are under my shirts now it happened that he had taken forth his last shirt and the vehicle remained visibly empty sure sir says joseph there is nothing in the bags upon which adams starting and testifying some surprize cried hey fie fie upon it they are not here sure enough ay they are certainly left behind  joseph was greatly concerned at the uneasiness which he apprehended his friend must feel from this disappointment he begged him to pursue his journey and promised he would himself return with the books to him with the utmost expedition no thank you child answered adams it shall not be so what would it avail me to tarry in the great city unless i had my discourses with me which are ut ita dicam the sole cause the aitia monotate of my peregrination no child as this accident hath happened i am resolved to return back to my cure together with you which indeed my inclination sufficiently leads me to this disappointment may perhaps be intended for my good he concluded with a verse out of theocritus which signifies no more than that sometimes it rains and sometimes the sun shines  joseph bowed with obedience and thankfulness for the inclination which the parson expressed of returning with him and now the bill was called for which on examination amounted within a shilling to the sum mr adams had in his pocket perhaps the reader may wonder how he was able to produce a sufficient sum for so many days that he may not be surprized therefore it cannot be unnecessary to acquaint him that he had borrowed a guinea of a servant belonging to the coach and six who had been formerly one of his parishioners and whose master the owner of the coach then lived within three miles of him for so good was the credit of mr adams that even mr peter the lady boobys steward would have lent him a guinea with very little security  illustration  mr adams discharged the bill and they were both setting out having agreed to ride and tie a method of travelling much used by persons who have but one horse between them and is thus performed the two travellers set out together one on horseback the other on foot now as it generally happens that he on horseback outgoes him on foot the custom is that when he arrives at the distance agreed on he is to dismount tie the horse to some gate tree post or other thing and then proceed on foot when the other comes up to the horse he unties him mounts and gallops on till having passed by his fellowtraveller he likewise arrives at the place of tying and this is that method of travelling so much in use among our prudent ancestors who knew that horses had mouths as well as legs and that they could not use the latter without being at the expense of suffering the beasts themselves to use the former this was the method in use in those days when instead of a coach and six a member of parliaments lady used to mount a pillion behind her husband and a grave serjeant at law condescended to amble to westminster on an easy pad with his clerk kicking his heels behind him  adams was now gone some minutes having insisted on josephs beginning the journey on horseback and joseph had his foot in the stirrup when the hostler presented him a bill for the horses board during his residence at the inn joseph said mr adams had paid all but this matter being referred to mr towwouse was by him decided in favour of the hostler and indeed with truth and justice for this was a fresh instance of that shortness of memory which did not arise from want of parts but that continual hurry in which parson adams was always involved  joseph was now reduced to a dilemma which extremely puzzled him the sum due for horsemeat was twelve shillings for adams who had borrowed the beast of his clerk had ordered him to be fed as well as they could feed him and the cash in his pocket amounted to sixpence for adams had divided the last shilling with him now though there have been some ingenious persons who have contrived to pay twelve shillings with sixpence joseph was not one of them he had never contracted a debt in his life and was consequently the less ready at an expedient to extricate himself towwouse was willing to give him credit till next time to which mrs towwouse would probably have consented for such was josephs beauty that it had made some impression even on that piece of flint which that good woman wore in her bosom by way of heart joseph would have found therefore very likely the passage free had he not when he honestly discovered the nakedness of his pockets pulled out that little piece of gold which we have mentioned before this caused mrs towwouses eyes to water she told joseph she did not conceive a man could want money whilst he had gold in his pocket joseph answered he had such a value for that little piece of gold that he would not part with it for a hundred times the riches which the greatest esquire in the county was worth a pretty way indeed said mrs towwouse to run in debt and then refuse to part with your money because you have a value for it i never knew any piece of gold of more value than as many shillings as it would change fornot to preserve my life from starving nor to redeem it from a robber would i part with this dear piece answered joseph what says mrs towwouse i suppose it was given you by some vile trollop some miss or other if it had been the present of a virtuous woman you would not have had such a value for it my husband is a fool if he parts with the horse without being paid for himno no i cant part with the horse indeed till i have the money cried towwouse a resolution highly commended by a lawyer then in the yard who declared mr towwouse might justify the detainer  as we cannot therefore at present get mr joseph out of the inn we shall leave him in it and carry our reader on after parson adams who his mind being perfectly at ease fell into a contemplation on a passage in aeschylus which entertained him for three miles together without suffering him once to reflect on his fellowtraveller  at length having spun out his thread and being now at the summit of a hill he cast his eyes backwards and wondered that he could not see any sign of joseph as he left him ready to mount the horse he could not apprehend any mischief had happened neither could he suspect that he missed his way it being so broad and plain the only reason which presented itself to him was that he had met with an acquaintance who had prevailed with him to delay some time in discourse  he therefore resolved to proceed slowly forwards not doubting but that he should be shortly overtaken and soon came to a large water which filling the whole road he saw no method of passing unless by wading through which he accordingly did up to his middle but was no sooner got to the other side than he perceived if he had looked over the hedge he would have found a footpath capable of conducting him without wetting his shoes  his surprize at josephs not coming up grew now very troublesome he began to fear he knew not what and as he determined to move no farther and if he did not shortly overtake him to return back he wished to find a house of public entertainment where he might dry his clothes and refresh himself with a pint but seeing no such for no other reason than because he did not cast his eyes a hundred yards forwards he sat himself down on a stile and pulled out his aeschylus  a fellow passing presently by adams asked him if he could direct him to an alehouse the fellow who had just left it and perceived the house and sign to be within sight thinking he had jeered him and being of a morose temper bade him follow his nose and be dnd adams told him he was a saucy jackanapes upon which the fellow turned about angrily but perceiving adams clench his fist he thought proper to go on without taking any farther notice  a horseman following immediately after and being asked the same question answered friend there is one within a stones throw i believe you may see it before you adams lifting up his eyes cried i protest and so there is and thanking his informer proceeded directly to it    chapter iii  the opinion of two lawyers concerning the same gentleman with mr adamss inquiry into the religion of his host   he had just entered the house and called for his pint and seated himself when two horsemen came to the door and fastening their horses to the rails alighted they said there was a violent shower of rain coming on which they intended to weather there and went into a little room by themselves not perceiving mr adams  one of these immediately asked the other if he had seen a more comical adventure a great while upon which the other said he doubted whether by law the landlord could justify detaining the horse for his corn and hay but the former answered undoubtedly he can it is an adjudged case and i have known it tried  adams who though he was as the reader may suspect a little inclined to forgetfulness never wanted more than a hint to remind him overhearing their discourse immediately suggested to himself that this was his own horse and that he had forgot to pay for him which upon inquiry he was certified of by the gentlemen who added that the horse was likely to have more rest than food unless he was paid for  the poor parson resolved to return presently to the inn though he knew no more than joseph how to procure his horse his liberty he was however prevailed on to stay under covert till the shower which was now very violent was over  the three travellers then sat down together over a mug of good beer when adams who had observed a gentlemans house as he passed along the road inquired to whom it belonged one of the horsemen had no sooner mentioned the owners name than the other began to revile him in the most opprobrious terms the english language scarce affords a single reproachful word which he did not vent on this occasion he charged him likewise with many particular facts he said he no more regarded a field of wheat when he was hunting than he did the highway that he had injured several poor farmers by trampling their corn under his horses heels and if any of them begged him with the utmost submission to refrain his horsewhip was always ready to do them justice he said that he was the greatest tyrant to the neighbours in every other instance and would not suffer a farmer to keep a gun though he might justify it by law and in his own family so cruel a master that he never kept a servant a twelvemonth in his capacity as a justice continued he he behaves so partially that he commits or acquits just as he is in the humour without any regard to truth or evidence the devil may carry any one before him for me i would rather be tried before some judges than be a prosecutor before him if i had an estate in the neighbourhood i would sell it for half the value rather than live near him  adams shook his head and said he was sorry such men were suffered to proceed with impunity and that riches could set any man above the law the reviler a little after retiring into the yard the gentleman who had first mentioned his name to adams began to assure him that his companion was a prejudiced person it is true says he perhaps that he may have sometimes pursued his game over a field of corn but he hath always made the party ample satisfaction that so far from tyrannising over his neighbours or taking away their guns he himself knew several farmers not qualified who not only kept guns but killed game with them that he was the best of masters to his servants and several of them had grown old in his service that he was the best justice of peace in the kingdom and to his certain knowledge had decided many difficult points which were referred to him with the greatest equity and the highest wisdom and he verily believed several persons would give a years purchase more for an estate near him than under the wings of any other great man he had just finished his encomium when his companion returned and acquainted him the storm was over upon which they presently mounted their horses and departed  adams who was in the utmost anxiety at those different characters of the same person asked his host if he knew the gentleman for he began to imagine they had by mistake been speaking of two several gentlemen no no master answered the host a shrewd cunning fellow i know the gentleman very well of whom they have been speaking as i do the gentlemen who spoke of him as for riding over other mens corn to my knowledge he hath not been on horseback these two years i never heard he did any injury of that kind and as to making reparation he is not so free of his money as that comes to neither nor did i ever hear of his taking away any mans gun nay i know several who have guns in their houses but as for killing game with them no man is stricter and i believe he would ruin any who did you heard one of the gentlemen say he was the worst master in the world and the other that he is the best but for my own part i know all his servants and never heard from any of them that he was either one or the otheraye aye says adams and how doth he behave as a justice prayfaith friend answered the host i question whether he is in the commission the only cause i have heard he hath decided a great while was one between those very two persons who just went out of this house and i am sure he determined that justly for i heard the whole matterwhich did he decide it in favour of quoth adamsi think i need not answer that question cried the host after the different characters you have heard of him it is not my business to contradict gentlemen while they are drinking in my house but i knew neither of them spoke a syllable of truthgod forbid said adams that men should arrive at such a pitch of wickedness to belye the character of their neighbour from a little private affection or what is infinitely worse a private spite i rather believe we have mistaken them and they mean two other persons for there are many houses on the roadwhy prithee friend cries the host dost thou pretend never to have told a lye in thy lifenever a malicious one i am certain answered adams nor with a design to injure the reputation of any man livingpugh malicious no no replied the host not malicious with a design to hang a man or bring him into trouble but surely out of love to oneself one must speak better of a friend than an enemyout of love to yourself you should confine yourself to truth says adams for by doing otherwise you injure the noblest part of yourself your immortal soul i can hardly believe any man such an idiot to risque the loss of that by any trifling gain and the greatest gain in this world is but dirt in comparison of what shall be revealed hereafter upon which the host taking up the cup with a smile drank a health to hereafter adding he was for something presentwhy says adams very gravely do not you believe another world to which the host answered yes he was no atheistand you believe you have an immortal soul cries adams he answered god forbid he should notand heaven and hell said the parson the host then bid him not to profane for those were things not to be mentioned nor thought of but in church adams asked him why he went to church if what he learned there had no influence on his conduct in life i go to church answered the host to say my prayers and behave godlyand dost not thou cried adams believe what thou hearest at churchmost part of it master returned the host and dost not thou then tremble cries adams at the thought of eternal punishmentas for that master said he i never once thought about it but what signifies talking about matters so far off the mug is out shall i draw another  whilst he was going for that purpose a stagecoach drove up to the door the coachman coming into the house was asked by the mistress what passengers he had in his coach a parcel of squinnygut bs says he i have a good mind to overturn them you wont prevail upon them to drink anything i assure you adams asked him if he had not seen a young man on horseback on the road describing joseph aye said the coachman a gentlewoman in my coach that is his acquaintance redeemed him and his horse he would have been here before this time had not the storm driven him to shelter god bless her said adams in a rapture nor could he delay walking out to satisfy himself who this charitable woman was but what was his surprize when he saw his old acquaintance madam slipslop hers indeed was not so great because she had been informed by joseph that he was on the road very civil were the salutations on both sides and mrs slipslop rebuked the hostess for denying the gentleman to be there when she asked for him but indeed the poor woman had not erred designedly for mrs slipslop asked for a clergyman and she had unhappily mistaken adams for a person travelling to a neighbouring fair with the thimble and button or some other such operation for he marched in a swinging great but short white coat with black buttons a short wig and a hat which so far from having a black hatband had nothing black about it  joseph was now come up and mrs slipslop would have had him quit his horse to the parson and come himself into the coach but he absolutely refused saying he thanked heaven he was well enough recovered to be very able to ride and added he hoped he knew his duty better than to ride in a coach while mr adams was on horseback  mrs slipslop would have persisted longer had not a lady in the coach put a short end to the dispute by refusing to suffer a fellow in a livery to ride in the same coach with herself so it was at length agreed that adams should fill the vacant place in the coach and joseph should proceed on horseback  they had not proceeded far before mrs slipslop addressing herself to the parson spoke thusthere hath been a strange alteration in our family mr adams since sir thomass death a strange alteration indeed says adams as i gather from some hints which have dropped from josephaye says she i could never have believed it but the longer one lives in the world the more one sees so joseph hath given you hints but of what nature will always remain a perfect secret with me cries the parson he forced me to promise before he would communicate anything i am indeed concerned to find her ladyship behave in so unbecoming a manner i always thought her in the main a good lady and should never have suspected her of thoughts so unworthy a christian and with a young lad her own servant these things are no secrets to me i assure you cries slipslop and i believe they will be none anywhere shortly for ever since the boys departure she hath behaved more like a mad woman than anything else truly i am heartily concerned says adams for she was a good sort of a lady indeed i have often wished she had attended a little more constantly at the service but she hath done a great deal of good in the parish o mr adams says slipslop people that dont see all often know nothing many things have been given away in our family i do assure you without her knowledge i have heard you say in the pulpit we ought not to brag but indeed i cant avoid saying if she had kept the keys herself the poor would have wanted many a cordial which i have let them have as for my late master he was as worthy a man as ever lived and would have done infinite good if he had not been controlled but he loved a quiet life heaven rest his soul i am confident he is there and enjoys a quiet life which some folks would not allow him hereadams answered he had never heard this before and was mistaken if she herself for he remembered she used to commend her mistress and blame her master had not formerly been of another opinion i dont know replied she what i might once think but now i am confidous matters are as i tell you the world will shortly see who hath been deceived for my part i say nothing but that it is wondersome how some people can carry all things with a grave face  thus mr adams and she discoursed till they came opposite to a great house which stood at some distance from the road a lady in the coach spying it cried yonder lives the unfortunate leonora if one can justly call a woman unfortunate whom we must own at the same time guilty and the author of her own calamity this was abundantly sufficient to awaken the curiosity of mr adams as indeed it did that of the whole company who jointly solicited the lady to acquaint them with leonoras history since it seemed by what she had said to contain something remarkable  the lady who was perfectly wellbred did not require many entreaties and having only wished their entertainment might make amends for the companys attention she began in the following manner    chapter iv  the history of leonora or the unfortunate jilt   leonora was the daughter of a gentleman of fortune she was tall and wellshaped with a sprightliness in her countenance which often attracts beyond more regular features joined with an insipid air nor is this kind of beauty less apt to deceive than allure the good humour which it indicates being often mistaken for good nature and the vivacity for true understanding  leonora who was now at the age of eighteen lived with an aunt of hers in a town in the north of england she was an extreme lover of gaiety and very rarely missed a ball or any other public assembly where she had frequent opportunities of satisfying a greedy appetite of vanity with the preference which was given her by the men to almost every other woman present  among many young fellows who were particular in their gallantries towards her horatio soon distinguished himself in her eyes beyond all his competitors she danced with more than ordinary gaiety when he happened to be her partner neither the fairness of the evening nor the musick of the nightingale could lengthen her walk like his company she affected no longer to understand the civilities of others whilst she inclined so attentive an ear to every compliment of horatio that she often smiled even when it was too delicate for her comprehension  pray madam says adams who was this squire horatio  horatio says the lady was a young gentleman of a good family bred to the law and had been some few years called to the degree of a barrister his face and person were such as the generality allowed handsome but he had a dignity in his air very rarely to be seen his temper was of the saturnine complexion and without the least taint of moroseness he had wit and humour with an inclination to satire which he indulged rather too much  this gentleman who had contracted the most violent passion for leonora was the last person who perceived the probability of its success the whole town had made the match for him before he himself had drawn a confidence from her actions sufficient to mention his passion to her for it was his opinion and perhaps he was there in the right that it is highly impolitick to talk seriously of love to a woman before you have made such a progress in her affections that she herself expects and desires to hear it  but whatever diffidence the fears of a lover may create which are apt to magnify every favour conferred on a rival and to see the little advances towards themselves through the other end of the perspective it was impossible that horatios passion should so blind his discernment as to prevent his conceiving hopes from the behaviour of leonora whose fondness for him was now as visible to an indifferent person in their company as his for her  i never knew any of these forward sluts come to good says the lady who refused josephs entrance into the coach nor shall i wonder at anything she doth in the sequel  the lady proceeded in her story thus it was in the midst of a gay conversation in the walks one evening when horatio whispered leonora that he was desirous to take a turn or two with her in private for that he had something to communicate to her of great consequence are you sure it is of consequence said she smiling i hope answered he you will think so too since the whole future happiness of my life must depend on the event  leonora who very much suspected what was coming would have deferred it till another time but horatio who had more than half conquered the difficulty of speaking by the first motion was so very importunate that she at last yielded and leaving the rest of the company they turned aside into an unfrequented walk  they had retired far out of the sight of the company both maintaining a strict silence at last horatio made a full stop and taking leonora who stood pale and trembling gently by the hand he fetched a deep sigh and then looking on her eyes with all the tenderness imaginable he cried out in a faltering accent o leonora is it necessary for me to declare to you on what the future happiness of my life must be founded must i say there is something belonging to you which is a bar to my happiness and which unless you will part with i must be miserablewhat can that be replied leonora no wonder said he you are surprized that i should make an objection to anything which is yours yet sure you may guess since it is the only one which the riches of the world if they were mine should purchase for me oh it is that which you must part with to bestow all the rest can leonora or rather will she doubt longer let me then whisper it in her earsit is your name madam it is by parting with that by your condescension to be for ever mine which must at once prevent me from being the most miserable and will render me the happiest of mankind  leonora covered with blushes and with as angry a look as she could possibly put on told him that had she suspected what his declaration would have been he should not have decoyed her from her company that he had so surprized and frighted her that she begged him to convey her back as quick as possible which he trembling very near as much as herself did  more fool he cried slipslop it is a sign he knew very little of our secttruly madam said adams i think you are in the right i should have insisted to know a piece of her mind when i had carried matters so far but mrs graveairs desired the lady to omit all such fulsome stuff in her story for that it made her sick  well then madam to be as concise as possible said the lady many weeks had not passed after this interview before horatio and leonora were what they call on a good footing together all ceremonies except the last were now over the writings were now drawn and everything was in the utmost forwardness preparative to the putting horatio in possession of all his wishes i will if you please repeat you a letter from each of them which i have got by heart and which will give you no small idea of their passion on both sides  mrs graveairs objected to hearing these letters but being put to the vote it was carried against her by all the rest in the coach parson adams contending for it with the utmost vehemence  horatio to leonora  how vain most adorable creature is the pursuit of pleasure in the absence of an object to which the mind is entirely devoted unless it have some relation to that object i was last night condemned to the society of men of wit and learning which however agreeable it might have formerly been to me now only gave me a suspicion that they imputed my absence in conversation to the true cause for which reason when your engagements forbid me the ecstatic happiness of seeing you i am always desirous to be alone since my sentiments for leonora are so delicate that i cannot bear the apprehension of anothers prying into those delightful endearments with which the warm imagination of a lover will sometimes indulge him and which i suspect my eyes then betray to fear this discovery of our thoughts may perhaps appear too ridiculous a nicety to minds not susceptible of all the tendernesses of this delicate passion and surely we shall suspect there are few such when we consider that it requires every human virtue to exert itself in its full extent since the beloved whose happiness it ultimately respects may give us charming opportunities of being brave in her defence generous to her wants compassionate to her afflictions grateful to her kindness and in the same manner of exercising every other virtue which he who would not do to any degree and that with the utmost rapture can never deserve the name of a lover it is therefore with a view to the delicate modesty of your mind that i cultivate it so purely in my own and it is that which will sufficiently suggest to you the uneasiness i bear from those liberties which men to whom the world allow politeness will sometimes give themselves on these occasions  can i tell you with what eagerness i expect the arrival of that blest day when i shall experience the falsehood of a common assertion that the greatest human happiness consists in hope a doctrine which no person had ever stronger reason to believe than myself at present since none ever tasted such bliss as fires my bosom with the thoughts of spending my future days with such a companion and that every action of my life will have the glorious satisfaction of conducing to your happiness  leonora to horatioa  a this letter was written by a young lady on reading the former  the refinement of your mind has been so evidently proved by every word and action ever since i had the first pleasure of knowing you that i thought it impossible my good opinion of horatio could have been heightened to any additional proof of merit this very thought was my amusement when i received your last letter which when i opened i confess i was surprized to find the delicate sentiments expressed there so far exceeding what i thought could come even from you although i know all the generous principles human nature is capable of are centred in your breast that words cannot paint what i feel on the reflection that my happiness shall be the ultimate end of all your actions  oh horatio what a life must that be where the meanest domestic cares are sweetened by the pleasing consideration that the man on earth who best deserves and to whom you are most inclined to give your affections is to reap either profit or pleasure from all you do in such a case toils must be turned into diversions and nothing but the unavoidable inconveniences of life can make us remember that we are mortal  if the solitary turn of your thoughts and the desire of keeping them undiscovered makes even the conversation of men of wit and learning tedious to you what anxious hours must i spend who am condemned by custom to the conversation of women whose natural curiosity leads them to pry into all my thoughts and whose envy can never suffer horatios heart to be possessed by any one without forcing them into malicious designs against the person who is so happy as to possess it but indeed if ever envy can possibly have any excuse or even alleviation it is in this case where the good is so great and it must be equally natural to all to wish it for themselves nor am i ashamed to own it and to your merit horatio i am obliged that prevents my being in that most uneasy of all the situations i can figure in my imagination of being led by inclination to love the person whom my own judgment forces me to condemn  matters were in so great forwardness between this fond couple that the day was fixed for their marriage and was now within a fortnight when the sessions chanced to be held for that county in a town about twenty miles distance from that which is the scene of our story it seems it is usual for the young gentlemen of the bar to repair to these sessions not so much for the sake of profit as to show their parts and learn the law of the justices of peace for which purpose one of the wisest and gravest of all the justices is appointed speaker or chairman as they modestly call it and he reads them a lecture and instructs them in the true knowledge of the law  you are here guilty of a little mistake says adams which if you please i will correct i have attended at one of these quartersessions where i observed the counsel taught the justices instead of learning anything of them  it is not very material said the lady hither repaired horatio who as he hoped by his profession to advance his fortune which was not at present very large for the sake of his dear leonora he resolved to spare no pains nor lose any opportunity of improving or advancing himself in it  the same afternoon in which he left the town as leonora stood at her window a coach and six passed by which she declared to be the completest genteelest prettiest equipage she ever saw adding these remarkable words oh i am in love with that equipage which though her friend florella at that time did not greatly regard she hath since remembered  in the evening an assembly was held which leonora honoured with her company but intended to pay her dear horatio the compliment of refusing to dance in his absence  oh why have not women as good resolution to maintain their vows as they have often good inclinations in making them  the gentleman who owned the coach and six came to the assembly his clothes were as remarkably fine as his equipage could be he soon attracted the eyes of the company all the smarts all the silk waistcoats with silver and gold edgings were eclipsed in an instant  madam said adams if it be not impertinent i should be glad to know how this gentleman was drest  sir answered the lady i have been told he had on a cut velvet coat of a cinnamon colour lined with a pink satten embroidered all over with gold his waistcoat which was cloth of silver was embroidered with gold likewise i cannot be particular as to the rest of his dress but it was all in the french fashion for bellarmine that was his name was just arrived from paris  this fine figure did not more entirely engage the eyes of every lady in the assembly than leonora did his he had scarce beheld her but he stood motionless and fixed as a statue or at least would have done so if good breeding had permitted him however he carried it so far before he had power to correct himself that every person in the room easily discovered where his admiration was settled the other ladies began to single out their former partners all perceiving who would be bellarmines choice which they however endeavoured by all possible means to prevent many of them saying to leonora o madam i suppose we shant have the pleasure of seeing you dance tonight and then crying out in bellarmines hearing oh leonora will not dance i assure you her partner is not here one maliciously attempted to prevent her by sending a disagreeable fellow to ask her that so she might be obliged either to dance with him or sit down but this scheme proved abortive  leonora saw herself admired by the fine stranger and envied by every woman present her little heart began to flutter within her and her head was agitated with a convulsive motion she seemed as if she would speak to several of her acquaintance but had nothing to say for as she would not mention her present triumph so she could not disengage her thoughts one moment from the contemplation of it she had never tasted anything like this happiness she had before known what it was to torment a single woman but to be hated and secretly cursed by a whole assembly was a joy reserved for this blessed moment as this vast profusion of ecstasy had confounded her understanding so there was nothing so foolish as her behaviour she played a thousand childish tricks distorted her person into several shapes and her face into several laughs without any reason in a word her carriage was as absurd as her desires which were to affect an insensibility of the strangers admiration and at the same time a triumph from that admiration over every woman in the room  in this temper of mind bellarmine having inquired who she was advanced to her and with a low bow begged the honour of dancing with her which she with as low a curtesy immediately granted she danced with him all night and enjoyed perhaps the highest pleasure that she was capable of feeling  at these words adams fetched a deep groan which frighted the ladies who told him they hoped he was not ill he answered he groaned only for the folly of leonora  leonora retired continued the lady about six in the morning but not to rest she tumbled and tossed in her bed with very short intervals of sleep and those entirely filled with dreams of the equipage and fine clothes she had seen and the balls operas and ridottos which had been the subject of their conversation  in the afternoon bellarmine in the dear coach and six came to wait on her he was indeed charmed with her person and was on inquiry so well pleased with the circumstances of her father for he himself notwithstanding all his finery was not quite so rich as a croesus or an attalusattalus says mr adams but pray how came you acquainted with these names the lady smiled at the question and proceeded he was so pleased i say that he resolved to make his addresses to her directly he did so accordingly and that with so much warmth and briskness that he quickly baffled her weak repulses and obliged the lady to refer him to her father who she knew would quickly declare in favour of a coach and six  thus what horatio had by sighs and tears love and tenderness been so long obtaining the frenchenglish bellarmine with gaiety and gallantry possessed himself of in an instant in other words what modesty had employed a full year in raising impudence demolished in twentyfour hours  here adams groaned a second time but the ladies who began to smoke him took no notice  from the opening of the assembly till the end of bellarmines visit leonora had scarce once thought of horatio but he now began though an unwelcome guest to enter into her mind she wished she had seen the charming bellarmine and his charming equipage before matters had gone so far yet why says she should i wish to have seen him before or what signifies it that i have seen him now is not horatio my lover almost my husband is he not as handsome nay handsomer than bellarmine aye but bellarmine is the genteeler and the finer man yes that he must be allowed yes yes he is that certainly but did not i no longer ago than yesterday love horatio more than all the world aye but yesterday i had not seen bellarmine but doth not horatio doat on me and may he not in despair break his heart if i abandon him well and hath not bellarmine a heart to break too yes but i promised horatio first but that was poor bellarmines misfortune if i had seen him first i should certainly have preferred him did not the dear creature prefer me to every woman in the assembly when every she was laying out for him when was it in horatios power to give me such an instance of affection can he give me an equipage or any of those things which bellarmine will make me mistress of how vast is the difference between being the wife of a poor counsellor and the wife of one of bellarmines fortune if i marry horatio i shall triumph over no more than one rival but by marrying bellarmine i shall be the envy of all my acquaintance what happiness but can i suffer horatio to die for he hath sworn he cannot survive my loss but perhaps he may not die if he should can i prevent it must i sacrifice myself to him besides bellarmine may be as miserable for me too she was thus arguing with herself when some young ladies called her to the walks and a little relieved her anxiety for the present  the next morning bellarmine breakfasted with her in presence of her aunt whom he sufficiently informed of his passion for leonora he was no sooner withdrawn than the old lady began to advise her niece on this occasion you see child says she what fortune hath thrown in your way and i hope you will not withstand your own preferment leonora sighing begged her not to mention any such thing when she knew her engagements to horatio engagements to a fig cried the aunt you should thank heaven on your knees that you have it yet in your power to break them will any woman hesitate a moment whether she shall ride in a coach or walk on foot all the days of her life but bellarmine drives six and horatio not even a pairyes but madam what will the world say answered leonora will not they condemn methe world is always on the side of prudence cries the aunt and would surely condemn you if you sacrificed your interest to any motive whatever oh i know the world very well and you shew your ignorance my dear by your objection o my conscience the world is wiser i have lived longer in it than you and i assure you there is not anything worth our regard besides money nor did i ever know one person who married from other considerations who did not afterwards heartily repent it besides if we examine the two men can you prefer a sneaking fellow who hath been bred at the university to a fine gentleman just come from his travels all the world must allow bellarmine to be a fine gentleman positively a fine gentleman and a handsome manperhaps madam i should not doubt if i knew how to be handsomely off with the otheroh leave that to me says the aunt you know your father hath not been acquainted with the affair indeed for my part i thought it might do well enough not dreaming of such an offer but ill disengage you leave me to give the fellow an answer i warrant you shall have no farther trouble  leonora was at length satisfied with her aunts reasoning and bellarmine supping with her that evening it was agreed he should the next morning go to her father and propose the match which she consented should be consummated at his return  the aunt retired soon after supper and the lovers being left together bellarmine began in the following manner yes madam this coat i assure you was made at paris and i defy the best english taylor even to imitate it there is not one of them can cut madam they cant cut if you observe how this skirt is turned and this sleeve a clumsy english rascal can do nothing like it pray how do you like my liveries leonora answered she thought them very prettyall french says he i assure you except the greatcoats i never trust anything more than a greatcoat to an englishman you know one must encourage our own people what one can especially as before i had a place i was in the country interest he he he but for myself i would see the dirty island at the bottom of the sea rather than wear a single rag of english work about me and i am sure after you have made one tour to paris you will be of the same opinion with regard to your own clothes you cant conceive what an addition a french dress would be to your beauty i positively assure you at the first opera i saw since i came over i mistook the english ladies for chambermaids he he he  with such sort of polite discourse did the gay bellarmine entertain his beloved leonora when the door opened on a sudden and horatio entered the room here tis impossible to express the surprize of leonora  poor woman says mrs slipslop what a terrible quandary she must be innot at all says mrs graveairs such sluts can never be confoundedshe must have then more than corinthian assurance said adams aye more than lais herself  a long silence continued the lady prevailed in the whole company if the familiar entrance of horatio struck the greatest astonishment into bellarmine the unexpected presence of bellarmine no less surprized horatio at length leonora collecting all the spirit she was mistress of addressed herself to the latter and pretended to wonder at the reason of so late a visit i should indeed answered he have made some apology for disturbing you at this hour had not my finding you in company assured me i do not break in upon your repose bellarmine rose from his chair traversed the room in a minuet step and hummed an opera tune while horatio advancing to leonora asked her in a whisper if that gentleman was not a relation of hers to which she answered with a smile or rather sneer no he is no relation of mine yet adding she could not guess the meaning of his question horatio told her softly it did not arise from jealousyjealousy i assure you it would be very strange in a common acquaintance to give himself any of those airs these words a little surprized horatio but before he had time to answer bellarmine danced up to the lady and told her he feared he interrupted some business between her and the gentlemani can have no business said she with the gentleman nor any other which need be any secret to you  youll pardon me said horatio if i desire to know who this gentleman is who is to be entrusted with all our secretsyoull know soon enough cries leonora but i cant guess what secrets can ever pass between us of such mighty consequenceno madam cries horatio i am sure you would not have me understand you in earnesttis indifferent to me says she how you understand me but i think so unseasonable a visit is difficult to be understood at all at least when people find one engaged though ones servants do not deny one one may expect a wellbred person should soon take the hint madam said horatio i did not imagine any engagement with a stranger as it seems this gentleman is would have made my visit impertinent or that any such ceremonies were to be preserved between persons in our situation sure you are in a dream says she or would persuade me that i am in one i know no pretensions a common acquaintance can have to lay aside the ceremonies of good breeding sure said he i am in a dream for it is impossible i should be really esteemed a common acquaintance by leonora after what has passed between us passed between us do you intend to affront me before this gentleman dn me affront the lady says bellarmine cocking his hat and strutting up to horatio does any man dare affront this lady before me dn me harkee sir says horatio i would advise you to lay aside that fierce air for i am mightily deceived if this lady has not a violent desire to get your worship a good drubbing sir said bellarmine i have the honour to be her protector and dn me if i understand your meaning sir answered horatio she is rather your protectress but give yourself no more airs for you see i am prepared for you shaking his whip at him oh serviteur tres humble says bellarmine je vous entend parfaitment bien at which time the aunt who had heard of horatios visit entered the room and soon satisfied all his doubts she convinced him that he was never more awake in his life and that nothing more extraordinary had happened in his three days absence than a small alteration in the affections of leonora who now burst into tears and wondered what reason she had given him to use her in so barbarous a manner horatio desired bellarmine to withdraw with him but the ladies prevented it by laying violent hands on the latter upon which the former took his leave without any great ceremony and departed leaving the lady with his rival to consult for his safety which leonora feared her indiscretion might have endangered but the aunt comforted her with assurances that horatio would not venture his person against so accomplished a cavalier as bellarmine and that being a lawyer he would seek revenge in his own way and the most they had to apprehend from him was an action  they at length therefore agreed to permit bellarmine to retire to his lodgings having first settled all matters relating to the journey which he was to undertake in the morning and their preparations for the nuptials at his return  but alas as wise men have observed the seat of valour is not the countenance and many a grave and plain man will on a just provocation betake himself to that mischievous metal cold iron while men of a fiercer brow and sometimes with that emblem of courage a cockade will more prudently decline it  leonora was waked in the morning from a visionary coach and six with the dismal account that bellarmine was run through the body by horatio that he lay languishing at an inn and the surgeons had declared the wound mortal she immediately leaped out of the bed danced about the room in a frantic manner tore her hair and beat her breast in all the agonies of despair in which sad condition her aunt who likewise arose at the news found her the good old lady applied her utmost art to comfort her niece she told her while there was life there was hope but that if he should die her affliction would be of no service to bellarmine and would only expose herself which might probably keep her some time without any future offer that as matters had happened her wisest way would be to think no more of bellarmine but to endeavour to regain the affections of horatio speak not to me cried the disconsolate leonora is it not owing to me that poor bellarmine has lost his life have not these cursed charms at which words she looked steadfastly in the glass been the ruin of the most charming man of this age can i ever bear to contemplate my own face again with her eyes still fixed on the glass am i not the murderess of the finest gentleman no other woman in the town could have made any impression on him never think of things past cries the aunt think of regaining the affections of horatio what reason said the niece have i to hope he would forgive me no i have lost him as well as the other and it was your wicked advice which was the occasion of all you seduced me contrary to my inclinations to abandon poor horatio at which words she burst into tears you prevailed upon me whether i would or no to give up my affections for him had it not been for you bellarmine never would have entered into my thoughts had not his addresses been backed by your persuasions they never would have made any impression on me i should have defied all the fortune and equipage in the world but it was you it was you who got the better of my youth and simplicity and forced me to lose my dear horatio for ever  the aunt was almost borne down with this torrent of words she however rallied all the strength she could and drawing her mouth up in a purse began i am not surprized niece at this ingratitude those who advise young women for their interest must always expect such a return i am convinced my brother will thank me for breaking off your match with horatio at any ratethat may not be in your power yet answered leonora though it is very ungrateful in you to desire or attempt it after the presents you have received from him for indeed true it is that many presents and some pretty valuable ones had passed from horatio to the old lady but as true it is that bellarmine when he breakfasted with her and her niece had complimented her with a brilliant from his finger of much greater value than all she had touched of the other  the aunts gall was on float to reply when a servant brought a letter into the room which leonora hearing it came from bellarmine with great eagerness opened and read as follows  most divine creaturethe wound which i fear you have heard i received from my rival is not like to be so fatal as those shot into my heart which have been fired from your eyes tout brilliant those are the only cannons by which i am to fall for my surgeon gives me hopes of being soon able to attend your ruelle till when unless you would do me an honour which i have scarce the hardiesse to think of your absence will be the greatest anguish which can be felt by  madam  avec toute le respecte in the world  your most obedient most absolute devote  bellarmine  as soon as leonora perceived such hopes of bellarmines recovery and that the gossip fame had according to custom so enlarged his danger she presently abandoned all further thoughts of horatio and was soon reconciled to her aunt who received her again into favour with a more christian forgiveness than we generally meet with indeed it is possible she might be a little alarmed at the hints which her niece had given her concerning the presents she might apprehend such rumours should they get abroad might injure a reputation which by frequenting church twice a day and preserving the utmost rigour and strictness in her countenance and behaviour for many years she had established  leonoras passion returned now for bellarmine with greater force after its small relaxation than ever she proposed to her aunt to make him a visit in his confinement which the old lady with great and commendable prudence advised her to decline for says she should any accident intervene to prevent your intended match too forward a behaviour with this lover may injure you in the eyes of others every woman till she is married ought to consider of and provide against the possibility of the affairs breaking off leonora said she should be indifferent to whatever might happen in such a case for she had now so absolutely placed her affections on this dear man so she called him that if it was her misfortune to lose him she should for ever abandon all thoughts of mankind she therefore resolved to visit him notwithstanding all the prudent advice of her aunt to the contrary and that very afternoon executed her resolution  the lady was proceeding in her story when the coach drove into the inn where the company were to dine sorely to the dissatisfaction of mr adams whose ears were the most hungry part about him he being as the reader may perhaps guess of an insatiable curiosity and heartily desirous of hearing the end of this amour though he professed he could scarce wish success to a lady of so inconstant a disposition    chapter v  a dreadful quarrel which happened at the inn where the company dined with its bloody consequences to mr adams   as soon as the passengers had alighted from the coach mr adams as was his custom made directly to the kitchen where he found joseph sitting by the fire and the hostess anointing his leg for the horse which mr adams had borrowed of his clerk had so violent a propensity to kneeling that one would have thought it had been his trade as well as his masters nor would he always give any notice of such his intention he was often found on his knees when the rider least expected it this foible however was of no great inconvenience to the parson who was accustomed to it and as his legs almost touched the ground when he bestrode the beast had but a little way to fall and threw himself forward on such occasions with so much dexterity that he never received any mischief the horse and he frequently rolling many paces distance and afterwards both getting up and meeting as good friends as ever  poor joseph who had not been used to such kind of cattle though an excellent horseman did not so happily disengage himself but falling with his leg under the beast received a violent contusion to which the good woman was as we have said applying a warm hand with some camphorated spirits just at the time when the parson entered the kitchen  he had scarce expressed his concern for josephs misfortune before the host likewise entered he was by no means of mr towwouses gentle disposition and was indeed perfect master of his house and everything in it but his guests  this surly fellow who always proportioned his respect to the appearance of a traveller from god bless your honour down to plain coming presently observing his wife on her knees to a footman cried out without considering his circumstances what a pox is the woman about why dont you mind the company in the coach go and ask them what they will have for dinner my dear says she you know they can have nothing but what is at the fire which will be ready presently and really the poor young mans leg is very much bruised at which words she fell to chafing more violently than before the bell then happening to ring he damnd his wife and bid her go in to the company and not stand rubbing there all day for he did not believe the young fellows leg was so bad as he pretended and if it was within twenty miles he would find a surgeon to cut it off upon these words adams fetched two strides across the room and snapping his fingers over his head muttered aloud he would excommunicate such a wretch for a farthing for he believed the devil had more humanity these words occasioned a dialogue between adams and the host in which there were two or three sharp replies till joseph bad the latter know how to behave himself to his betters at which the host having first strictly surveyed adams scornfully repeating the word betters flew into a rage and telling joseph he was as able to walk out of his house as he had been to walk into it offered to lay violent hands on him which perceiving adams dealt him so sound a compliment over his face with his fist that the blood immediately gushed out of his nose in a stream the host being unwilling to be outdone in courtesy especially by a person of adamss figure returned the favour with so much gratitude that the parsons nostrils began to look a little redder than usual upon which he again assailed his antagonist and with another stroke laid him sprawling on the floor  the hostess who was a better wife than so surly a husband deserved seeing her husband all bloody and stretched along hastened presently to his assistance or rather to revenge the blow which to all appearance was the last he would ever receive when lo a pan full of hogs blood which unluckily stood on the dresser presented itself first to her hands she seized it in her fury and without any reflection discharged it into the parsons face and with so good an aim that much the greater part first saluted his countenance and trickled thence in so large a current down to his beard and over his garments that a more horrible spectacle was hardly to be seen or even imagined all which was perceived by mrs slipslop who entered the kitchen at that instant this good gentlewoman not being of a temper so extremely cool and patient as perhaps was required to ask many questions on this occasion flew with great impetuosity at the hostesss cap which together with some of her hair she plucked from her head in a moment giving her at the same time several hearty cuffs in the face which by frequent practice on the inferior servants she had learned an excellent knack of delivering with a good grace poor joseph could hardly rise from his chair the parson was employed in wiping the blood from his eyes which had entirely blinded him and the landlord was but just beginning to stir whilst mrs slipslop holding down the landladys face with her left hand made so dexterous an use of her right that the poor woman began to roar in a key which alarmed all the company in the inn  there happened to be in the inn at this time besides the ladies who arrived in the stagecoach the two gentlemen who were present at mr towwouses when joseph was detained for his horses meat and whom we have before mentioned to have stopt at the alehouse with adams there was likewise a gentleman just returned from his travels to italy all whom the horrid outcry of murder presently brought into the kitchen where the several combatants were found in the postures already described  it was now no difficulty to put an end to the fray the conquerors being satisfied with the vengeance they had taken and the conquered having no appetite to renew the fight the principal figure and which engaged the eyes of all was adams who was all over covered with blood which the whole company concluded to be his own and consequently imagined him no longer for this world but the host who had now recovered from his blow and was risen from the ground soon delivered them from this apprehension by damning his wife for wasting the hogs puddings and telling her all would have been very well if she had not intermeddled like a bas she was adding he was very glad the gentlewoman had paid her though not half what she deserved the poor woman had indeed fared much the worst having besides the unmerciful cuffs received lost a quantity of hair which mrs slipslop in triumph held in her left hand  the traveller addressing himself to mrs graveairs desired her not to be frightened for here had been only a little boxing which he said to their disgracia the english were accustomata to adding it must be however a sight somewhat strange to him who was just come from italy the italians not being addicted to the cuffardo but bastonza says he he then went up to adams and telling him he looked like the ghost of othello bid him not shake his gory locks at him for he could not say he did it adams very innocently answered sir i am far from accusing you he then returned to the lady and cried i find the bloody gentleman is uno insipido del nullo senso dammato di me if i have seen such a spectaculo in my way from viterbo  one of the gentlemen having learnt from the host the occasion of this bustle and being assured by him that adams had struck the first blow whispered in his ear hed warrant he would recoverrecover master said the host smiling yes yes i am not afraid of dying with a blow or two neither i am not such a chicken as thatpugh said the gentleman i mean you will recover damages in that action which undoubtedly you intend to bring as soon as a writ can be returned from london for you look like a man of too much spirit and courage to suffer any one to beat you without bringing your action against him he must be a scandalous fellow indeed who would put up with a drubbing whilst the law is open to revenge it besides he hath drawn blood from you and spoiled your coat and the jury will give damages for that too an excellent new coat upon my word and now not worth a shilling i dont care continued he to intermeddle in these cases but you have a right to my evidence and if i am sworn i must speak the truth i saw you sprawling on the floor and blood gushing from your nostrils you may take your own opinion but was i in your circumstances every drop of my blood should convey an ounce of gold into my pocket remember i dont advise you to go to law but if your jury were christians they must give swinging damages thats allmaster cried the host scratching his head i have no stomach to law i thank you i have seen enough of that in the parish where two of my neighbours have been at law about a house till they have both lawed themselves into a gaol at which words he turned about and began to inquire again after his hogs puddings nor would it probably have been a sufficient excuse for his wife that she spilt them in his defence had not some awe of the company especially of the italian traveller who was a person of great dignity withheld his rage  whilst one of the abovementioned gentlemen was employed as we have seen him on the behalf of the landlord the other was no less hearty on the side of mr adams whom he advised to bring his action immediately he said the assault of the wife was in law the assault of the husband for they were but one person and he was liable to pay damages which he said must be considerable where so bloody a disposition appeared adams answered if it was true that they were but one person he had assaulted the wife for he was sorry to own he had struck the husband the first blow i am sorry you own it too cries the gentleman for it could not possibly appear to the court for here was no evidence present but the lame man in the chair whom i suppose to be your friend and would consequently say nothing but what made for youhow sir says adams do you take me for a villain who would prosecute revenge in cold blood and use unjustifiable means to obtain it if you knew me and my order i should think you affronted both at the word order the gentleman stared for he was too bloody to be of any modern order of knights and turning hastily about said every man knew his own business  matters being now composed the company retired to their several apartments the two gentlemen congratulating each other on the success of their good offices in procuring a perfect reconciliation between the contending parties and the traveller went to his repast crying as the italian poet says      je voi very well que tutta e pace     so send up dinner good boniface  the coachman began now to grow importunate with his passengers whose entrance into the coach was retarded by miss graveairs insisting against the remonstrance of all the rest that she would not admit a footman into the coach for poor joseph was too lame to mount a horse a young lady who was as it seems an earls granddaughter begged it with almost tears in her eyes mr adams prayed and mrs slipslop scolded but all to no purpose she said she would not demean herself to ride with a footman that there were waggons on the road that if the master of the coach desired it she would pay for two places but would suffer no such fellow to come inmadam says slipslop i am sure no one can refuse another coming into a stagecoachi dont know madam says the lady i am not much used to stagecoaches i seldom travel in themthat may be madam replied slipslop very good people do and some peoples betters for aught i know miss graveairs said some folks might sometimes give their tongues a liberty to some people that were their betters which did not become them for her part she was not used to converse with servants slipslop returned some people kept no servants to converse with for her part she thanked heaven she lived in a family where there were a great many and had more under her own command than any paultry little gentlewoman in the kingdom miss graveairs cried she believed her mistress would not encourage such sauciness to her bettersmy betters says slipslop who is my betters prayi am your betters answered miss graveairs and ill acquaint your mistressat which mrs slipslop laughed aloud and told her her lady was one of the great gentry and such little paultry gentlewomen as some folks who travelled in stagecoaches would not easily come at her  this smart dialogue between some people and some folks was going on at the coach door when a solemn person riding into the inn and seeing miss graveairs immediately accosted her with dear child how do you she presently answered o papa i am glad you have overtaken meso am i answered he for one of our coaches is just at hand and there being room for you in it you shall go no farther in the stage unless you desire ithow can you imagine i should desire it says she so bidding slipslop ride with her fellow if she pleased she took her father by the hand who was just alighted and walked with him into a room  adams instantly asked the coachman in a whisper if he knew who the gentleman was the coachman answered he was now a gentleman and kept his horse and man but times are altered master said be i remember when he was no better born than myselfay ay says adams my father drove the squires coach answered he when that very man rode postillion but he is now his steward and a great gentleman adams then snapped his fingers and cried he thought she was some such trollop  adams made haste to acquaint mrs slipslop with this good news as he imagined it but it found a reception different from what he expected the prudent gentlewoman who despised the anger of miss graveairs whilst she conceived her the daughter of a gentleman of small fortune now she heard her alliance with the upper servants of a great family in her neighbourhood began to fear her interest with the mistress she wished she had not carried the dispute so far and began to think of endeavouring to reconcile herself to the young lady before she left the inn when luckily the scene at london which the reader can scarce have forgotten presented itself to her mind and comforted her with such assurance that she no longer apprehended any enemy with her mistress  everything being now adjusted the company entered the coach which was just on its departure when one lady recollected she had left her fan a second her gloves a third a snuffbox and a fourth a smellingbottle behind her to find all which occasioned some delay and much swearing to the coachman  as soon as the coach had left the inn the women all together fell to the character of miss graveairs whom one of them declared she had suspected to be some low creature from the beginning of their journey and another affirmed she had not even the looks of a gentlewoman a third warranted she was no better than she should be and turning to the lady who had related the story in the coach said did you ever hear madam anything so prudish as her remarks well deliver me from the censoriousness of such a prude the fourth added o madam all these creatures are censorious but for my part i wonder where the wretch was bred indeed i must own i have seldom conversed with these mean kind of people so that it may appear stranger to me but to refuse the general desire of a whole company had something in it so astonishing that for my part i own i should hardly believe it if my own ears had not been witnesses to ityes and so handsome a young fellow cries slipslop the woman must have no compulsion in her i believe she is more of a turk than a christian i am certain if she had any christian womans blood in her veins the sight of such a young fellow must have warmed it indeed there are some wretched miserable old objects that turn ones stomach i should not wonder if she had refused such a one i am as nice as herself and should have cared no more than herself for the company of stinking old fellows but hold up thy head joseph thou art none of those and she who hath not compulsion for thee is a myhummetman and i will maintain it this conversation made joseph uneasy as well as the ladies who perceiving the spirits which mrs slipslop was in for indeed she was not a cup too low began to fear the consequence one of them therefore desired the lady to conclude the story aye madam said slipslop i beg your ladyship to give us that story you commensated in the morning which request that wellbred woman immediately complied with    chapter vi  conclusion of the unfortunate jilt   leonora having once broke through the bounds which custom and modesty impose on her sex soon gave an unbridled indulgence to her passion her visits to bellarmine were more constant as well as longer than his surgeons in a word she became absolutely his nurse made his watergruel administered him his medicines and notwithstanding the prudent advice of her aunt to the contrary almost intirely resided in her wounded lovers apartment  the ladies of the town began to take her conduct under consideration it was the chief topic of discourse at their teatables and was very severely censured by the most part especially by lindamira a lady whose discreet and starch carriage together with a constant attendance at church three times a day had utterly defeated many malicious attacks on her own reputation for such was the envy that lindamiras virtue had attracted that notwithstanding her own strict behaviour and strict enquiry into the lives of others she had not been able to escape being the mark of some arrows herself which however did her no injury a blessing perhaps owed by her to the clergy who were her chief male companions and with two or three of whom she had been barbarously and unjustly calumniated  not so unjustly neither perhaps says slipslop for the clergy are men as well as other folks  the extreme delicacy of lindamiras virtue was cruelly hurt by those freedoms which leonora allowed herself she said it was an affront to her sex that she did not imagine it consistent with any womans honour to speak to the creature or to be seen in her company and that for her part she should always refuse to dance at an assembly with her for fear of contamination by taking her by the hand  but to return to my story as soon as bellarmine was recovered which was somewhat within a month from his receiving the wound he set out according to agreement for leonoras fathers in order to propose the match and settle all matters with him touching settlements and the like  a little before his arrival the old gentleman had received an intimation of the affair by the following letter which i can repeat verbatim and which they say was written neither by leonora nor her aunt though it was in a womans hand the letter was in these words  siri am sorry to acquaint you that your daughter leonora hath acted one of the basest as well as most simple parts with a young gentleman to whom she had engaged herself and whom she hath pardon the word jilted for another of inferior fortune notwithstanding his superior figure you may take what measures you please on this occasion i have performed what i thought my duty as i have though unknown to you a very great respect for your family  the old gentleman did not give himself the trouble to answer this kind epistle nor did he take any notice of it after he had read it till he saw bellarmine he was to say the truth one of those fathers who look on children as an unhappy consequence of their youthful pleasures which as he would have been delighted not to have had attended them so was he no less pleased with any opportunity to rid himself of the incumbrance he passed in the worlds language as an exceeding good father being not only so rapacious as to rob and plunder all mankind to the utmost of his power but even to deny himself the conveniencies and almost necessaries of life which his neighbours attributed to a desire of raising immense fortunes for his children but in fact it was not so he heaped up money for its own sake only and looked on his children as his rivals who were to enjoy his beloved mistress when he was incapable of possessing her and which he would have been much more charmed with the power of carrying along with him nor had his children any other security of being his heirs than that the law would constitute them such without a will and that he had not affection enough for any one living to take the trouble of writing one  to this gentleman came bellarmine on the errand i have mentioned his person his equipage his family and his estate seemed to the father to make him an advantageous match for his daughter he therefore very readily accepted his proposals but when bellarmine imagined the principal affair concluded and began to open the incidental matters of fortune the old gentleman presently changed his countenance saying he resolved never to marry his daughter on a smithfield match that whoever had love for her to take her would when he died find her share of his fortune in his coffers but he had seen such examples of undutifulness happen from the too early generosity of parents that he had made a vow never to part with a shilling whilst he lived he commended the saying of solomon he that spareth the rod spoileth the child but added he might have likewise asserted that he that spareth the purse saveth the child he then ran into a discourse on the extravagance of the youth of the age whence he launched into a dissertation on horses and came at length to commend those bellarmine drove that fine gentleman who at another season would have been well enough pleased to dwell a little on that subject was now very eager to resume the circumstance of fortune he said he had a very high value for the young lady and would receive her with less than he would any other whatever but that even his love to her made some regard to worldly matters necessary for it would be a most distracting sight for him to see her when he had the honour to be her husband in less than a coach and six the old gentleman answered four will do four will do and then took a turn from horses to extravagance and from extravagance to horses till he came round to the equipage again whither he was no sooner arrived than bellarmine brought him back to the point but all to no purpose he made his escape from that subject in a minute till at last the lover declared that in the present situation of his affairs it was impossible for him though he loved leonora more than tout le monde to marry her without any fortune to which the father answered he was sorry that his daughter must lose so valuable a match that if he had an inclination at present it was not in his power to advance a shilling that he had had great losses and been at great expenses on projects which though he had great expectation from them had yet produced him nothing that he did not know what might happen hereafter as on the birth of a son or such accident but he would make no promise or enter into any article for he would not break his vow for all the daughters in the world  in short ladies to keep you no longer in suspense bellarmine having tried every argument and persuasion which he could invent and finding them all ineffectual at length took his leave but not in order to return to leonora he proceeded directly to his own seat whence after a few days stay he returned to paris to the great delight of the french and the honour of the english nation  but as soon as he arrived at his home he presently despatched a messenger with the following epistle to leonora  adorable and charmantei am sorry to have the honour to tell you i am not the heureux person destined for your divine arms your papa hath told me so with a politesse not often seen on this side paris you may perhaps guess his manner of refusing me ah mon dieu you will certainly believe me madam incapable myself of delivering this triste message which i intend to try the french air to cure the consequences of a jamais coeur ange au diable if your papa obliges you to a marriage i hope we shall see you at paris till when the wind that flows from thence will be the warmest dans le monde for it will consist almost entirely of my sighs adieu ma princesse ah lamour  bellarmine  i shall not attempt ladies to describe leonoras condition when she received this letter it is a picture of horror which i should have as little pleasure in drawing as you in beholding she immediately left the place where she was the subject of conversation and ridicule and retired to that house i showed you when i began the story where she hath ever since led a disconsolate life and deserves perhaps pity for her misfortunes more than our censure for a behaviour to which the artifices of her aunt very probably contributed and to which very young women are often rendered too liable by that blameable levity in the education of our sex  if i was inclined to pity her said a young lady in the coach it would be for the loss of horatio for i cannot discern any misfortune in her missing such a husband as bellarmine  why i must own says slipslop the gentleman was a little falsehearted but howsumever it was hard to have two lovers and get never a husband at all but pray madam what became of ourasho  he remains said the lady still unmarried and hath applied himself so strictly to his business that he hath raised i hear a very considerable fortune and what is remarkable they say he never hears the name of leonora without a sigh nor hath ever uttered one syllable to charge her with her illconduct towards him    chapter vii  a very short chapter in which parson adams went a great way   the lady having finished her story received the thanks of the company and now joseph putting his head out of the coach cried out never believe me if yonder be not our parson adams walking along without his horseon my word and so he is says slipslop and as sure as twopence he hath left him behind at the inn indeed true it is the parson had exhibited a fresh instance of his absence of mind for he was so pleased with having got joseph into the coach that he never once thought of the beast in the stable and finding his legs as nimble as he desired he sallied out brandishing a crabstick and had kept on before the coach mending and slackening his pace occasionally so that he had never been much more or less than a quarter of a mile distant from it  mrs slipslop desired the coachman to overtake him which he attempted but in vain for the faster he drove the faster ran the parson often crying out aye aye catch me if you can till at length the coachman swore he would as soon attempt to drive after a greyhound and giving the parson two or three hearty curses he cryd softly softly boys to his horses which the civil beasts immediately obeyed  but we will be more courteous to our reader than he was to mrs slipslop and leaving the coach and its company to pursue their journey we will carry our reader on after parson adams who stretched forwards without once looking behind him till having left the coach full three miles in his rear he came to a place where by keeping the extremest track to the right it was just barely possible for a human creature to miss his way this track however did he keep as indeed he had a wonderful capacity at these kinds of bare possibilities and travelling in it about three miles over the plain he arrived at the summit of a hill whence looking a great way backwards and perceiving no coach in sight he sat himself down on the turf and pulling out his aeschylus determined to wait here for its arrival  he had not sat long here before a gun going off very near a little startled him he looked up and saw a gentleman within a hundred paces taking up a partridge which he had just shot  adams stood up and presented a figure to the gentleman which would have moved laughter in many for his cassock had just again fallen down below his greatcoat that is to say it reached his knees whereas the skirts of his greatcoat descended no lower than halfway down his thighs but the gentlemans mirth gave way to his surprize at beholding such a personage in such a place  adams advancing to the gentleman told him he hoped he had good sport to which the other answered very littlei see sir says adams you have smote one partridge to which the sportsman made no reply but proceeded to charge his piece  whilst the gun was charging adams remained in silence which he at last broke by observing that it was a delightful evening the gentleman who had at first sight conceived a very distasteful opinion of the parson began on perceiving a book in his hand and smoaking likewise the information of the cassock to change his thoughts and made a small advance to conversation on his side by saying sir i suppose you are not one of these parts  adams immediately told him no that he was a traveller and invited by the beauty of the evening and the place to repose a little and amuse himself with readingi may as well repose myself too said the sportsman for i have been out this whole afternoon and the devil a bird have i seen till i came hither  perhaps then the game is not very plenty hereabouts cries adams no sir said the gentleman the soldiers who are quartered in the neighbourhood have killed it allit is very probable cries adams for shooting is their professionay shooting the game answered the other but i dont see they are so forward to shoot our enemies i dont like that affair of carthagena if i had been there i believe i should have done otherguess things dn me whats a mans life when his country demands it a man who wont sacrifice his life for his country deserves to be hanged dn me which words he spoke with so violent a gesture so loud a voice so strong an accent and so fierce a countenance that he might have frightened a captain of trained bands at the head of his company but mr adams was not greatly subject to fear he told him intrepidly that he very much approved his virtue but disliked his swearing and begged him not to addict himself to so bad a custom without which he said he might fight as bravely as achilles did indeed he was charmed with this discourse he told the gentleman he would willingly have gone many miles to have met a man of his generous way of thinking that if he pleased to sit down he should be greatly delighted to commune with him for though he was a clergyman he would himself be ready if thereto called to lay down his life for his country  the gentleman sat down and adams by him and then the latter began as in the following chapter a discourse which we have placed by itself as it is not only the most curious in this but perhaps in any other book    chapter viii  a notable dissertation by mr abraham adams wherein that gentleman appears in a political light   i do assure you sir says he taking the gentleman by the hand i am heartily glad to meet with a man of your kidney for though i am a poor parson i will be bold to say i am an honest man and would not do an ill thing to be made a bishop nay though it hath not fallen in my way to offer so noble a sacrifice i have not been without opportunities of suffering for the sake of my conscience i thank heaven for them for i have had relations though i say it who made some figure in the world particularly a nephew who was a shopkeeper and an alderman of a corporation he was a good lad and was under my care when a boy and i believe would do what i bade him to his dying day indeed it looks like extreme vanity in me to affect being a man of such consequence as to have so great an interest in an alderman but others have thought so too as manifestly appeared by the rector whose curate i formerly was sending for me on the approach of an election and telling me if i expected to continue in his cure that i must bring my nephew to vote for one colonel courtly a gentleman whom i had never heard tidings of till that instant i told the rector i had no power over my nephews vote god forgive me for such prevarication that i supposed he would give it according to his conscience that i would by no means endeavour to influence him to give it otherwise he told me it was in vain to equivocate that he knew i had already spoke to him in favour of esquire fickle my neighbour and indeed it was true i had for it was at a season when the church was in danger and when all good men expected they knew not what would happen to us all i then answered boldly if he thought i had given my promise he affronted me in proposing any breach of it not to be too prolix i persevered and so did my nephew in the esquires interest who was chose chiefly through his means and so i lost my curacy well sir but do you think the esquire ever mentioned a word of the church ne verbum quidem ut ita dicam within two years he got a place and hath ever since lived in london where i have been informed but god forbid i should believe that that he never so much as goeth to church i remained sir a considerable time without any cure and lived a full month on one funeral sermon which i preached on the indisposition of a clergyman but this by the bye at last when mr fickle got his place colonel courtly stood again and who should make interest for him but mr fickle himself that very identical mr fickle who had formerly told me the colonel was an enemy to both the church and state had the confidence to sollicit my nephew for him and the colonel himself offered me to make me chaplain to his regiment which i refused in favour of sir oliver hearty who told us he would sacrifice everything to his country and i believe he would except his hunting which he stuck so close to that in five years together he went but twice up to parliament and one of those times i have been told never was within sight of the house however he was a worthy man and the best friend i ever had for by his interest with a bishop he got me replaced into my curacy and gave me eight pounds out of his own pocket to buy me a gown and cassock and furnish my house he had our interest while he lived which was not many years on his death i had fresh applications made to me for all the world knew the interest i had with my good nephew who now was a leading man in the corporation and sir thomas booby buying the estate which had been sir olivers proposed himself a candidate he was then a young gentleman just come from his travels and it did me good to hear him discourse on affairs which for my part i knew nothing of if i had been master of a thousand votes he should have had them all i engaged my nephew in his interest and he was elected and a very fine parliamentman he was they tell me he made speeches of an hour long and i have been told very fine ones but he could never persuade the parliament to be of his opinion non omnia possumus omnes he promised me a living poor man and i believe i should have had it but an accident happened which was that my lady had promised it before unknown to him this indeed i never heard till afterwards for my nephew who died about a month before the incumbent always told me i might be assured of it since that time sir thomas poor man had always so much business that he never could find leisure to see me i believe it was partly my ladys fault too who did not think my dress good enough for the gentry at her table however i must do him the justice to say he never was ungrateful and i have always found his kitchen and his cellar too open to me many a time after service on a sundayfor i preach at four churcheshave i recruited my spirits with a glass of his ale since my nephews death the corporation is in other hands and i am not a man of that consequence i was formerly i have now no longer any talents to lay out in the service of my country and to whom nothing is given of him can nothing be required however on all proper seasons such as the approach of an election i throw a suitable dash or two into my sermons which i have the pleasure to hear is not disagreeable to sir thomas and the other honest gentlemen my neighbours who have all promised me these five years to procure an ordination for a son of mine who is now near thirty hath an infinite stock of learning and is i thank heaven of an unexceptionable life though as he was never at an university the bishop refuses to ordain him too much care cannot indeed be taken in admitting any to the sacred office though i hope he will never act so as to be a disgrace to any order but will serve his god and his country to the utmost of his power as i have endeavoured to do before him nay and will lay down his life whenever called to that purpose i am sure i have educated him in those principles so that i have acquitted my duty and shall have nothing to answer for on that account but i do not distrust him for he is a good boy and if providence should throw it in his way to be of as much consequence in a public light as his father once was i can answer for him he will use his talents as honestly as i have done    chapter ix  in which the gentleman discants on bravery and heroic virtue till an unlucky accident puts an end to the discourse   the gentleman highly commended mr adams for his good resolutions and told him he hoped his son would tread in his steps adding that if he would not die for his country he would not be worthy to live in it id make no more of shooting a man that would not die for his country than  sir said he i have disinherited a nephew who is in the army because he would not exchange his commission and go to the west indies i believe the rascal is a coward though he pretends to be in love forsooth i would have all such fellows hanged sir i would have them hanged adams answered that would be too severe that men did not make themselves and if fear had too much ascendance in the mind the man was rather to be pitied than abhorred that reason and time might teach him to subdue it he said a man might be a coward at one time and brave at another homer says he who so well understood and copied nature hath taught us this lesson for paris fights and hector runs away nay we have a mighty instance of this in the history of later ages no longer ago than the  0 th year of rome when the great pompey who had won so many battles and been honoured with so many triumphs and of whose valour several authors especially cicero and paterculus have formed such elogiums this very pompey left the battle of pharsalia before he had lost it and retreated to his tent where he sat like the most pusillanimous rascal in a fit of despair and yielded a victory which was to determine the empire of the world to caesar i am not much travelled in the history of modern times that is to say these last thousand years but those who are can i make no question furnish you with parallel instances he concluded therefore that had he taken any such hasty resolutions against his nephew he hoped he would consider better and retract them the gentleman answered with great warmth and talked much of courage and his country till perceiving it grew late he asked adams what place he intended for that night he told him he waited there for the stagecoachthe stagecoach sir said the gentleman they are all passed by long ago you may see the last yourself almost three miles before usi protest and so they are cries adams then i must make haste and follow them the gentleman told him he would hardly be able to overtake them and that if he did not know his way he would be in danger of losing himself on the downs for it would be presently dark and he might ramble about all night and perhaps find himself farther from his journeys end in the morning than he was now he advised him therefore to accompany him to his house which was very little out of his way assuring him that he would find some country fellow in his parish who would conduct him for sixpence to the city where he was going adams accepted this proposal and on they travelled the gentleman renewing his discourse on courage and the infamy of not being ready at all times to sacrifice our lives to our country night overtook them much about the same time as they arrived near some bushes whence on a sudden they heard the most violent shrieks imaginable in a female voice adams offered to snatch the gun out of his companions hand what are you doing said he doing said adams i am hastening to the assistance of the poor creature whom some villains are murdering you are not mad enough i hope says the gentleman trembling do you consider this gun is only charged with shot and that the robbers are most probably furnished with pistols loaded with bullets this is no business of ours let us make as much haste as possible out of the way or we may fall into their hands ourselves the shrieks now increasing adams made no answer but snapt his fingers and brandishing his crabstick made directly to the place whence the voice issued and the man of courage made as much expedition towards his own home whither he escaped in a very short time without once looking behind him where we will leave him to contemplate his own bravery and to censure the want of it in others and return to the good adams who on coming up to the place whence the noise proceeded found a woman struggling with a man who had thrown her on the ground and had almost overpowered her the great abilities of mr adams were not necessary to have formed a right judgment of this affair on the first sight he did not therefore want the entreaties of the poor wretch to assist her but lifting up his crabstick he immediately levelled a blow at that part of the ravishers head where according to the opinion of the ancients the brains of some persons are deposited and which he had undoubtedly let forth had not nature who as wise men have observed equips all creatures with what is most expedient for them taken a provident care as she always doth with those she intends for encounters to make this part of the head three times as thick as those of ordinary men who are designed to exercise talents which are vulgarly called rational and for whom as brains are necessary she is obliged to leave some room for them in the cavity of the skull whereas those ingredients being entirely useless to persons of the heroic calling she hath an opportunity of thickening the bone so as to make it less subject to any impression or liable to be cracked or broken and indeed in some who are predestined to the command of armies and empires she is supposed sometimes to make that part perfectly solid  as a game cock when engaged in amorous toying with a hen if perchance he espies another cock at hand immediately quits his female and opposes himself to his rival so did the ravisher on the information of the crabstick immediately leap from the woman and hasten to assail the man he had no weapons but what nature had furnished him with however he clenched his fist and presently darted it at that part of adamss breast where the heart is lodged adams staggered at the violence of the blow when throwing away his staff he likewise clenched that fist which we have before commemorated and would have discharged it full in the breast of his antagonist had he not dexterously caught it with his left hand at the same time darting his head which some modern heroes of the lower class use like the batteringram of the ancients for a weapon of offence another reason to admire the cunningness of nature in composing it of those impenetrable materials dashing his head i say into the stomach of adams he tumbled him on his back and not having any regard to the laws of heroism which would have restrained him from any farther attack on his enemy till he was again on his legs he threw himself upon him and laying hold on the ground with his left hand he with his right belaboured the body of adams till he was weary and indeed till he concluded to use the language of fighting that he had done his business or in the language of poetry that he had sent him to the shades below in plain english that he was dead  but adams who was no chicken and could bear a drubbing as well as any boxing champion in the universe lay still only to watch his opportunity and now perceiving his antagonist to pant with his labours he exerted his utmost force at once and with such success that he overturned him and became his superior when fixing one of his knees in his breast he cried out in an exulting voice it is my turn now and after a few minutes constant application he gave him so dexterous a blow just under his chin that the fellow no longer retained any motion and adams began to fear he had struck him once too often for he often asserted he should be concerned to have the blood of even the wicked upon him  adams got up and called aloud to the young woman be of good cheer damsel said he you are no longer in danger of your ravisher who i am terribly afraid lies dead at my feet but god forgive me what i have done in defence of innocence the poor wretch who had been some time in recovering strength enough to rise and had afterwards during the engagement stood trembling being disabled by fear even from running away hearing her champion was victorious came up to him but not without apprehensions even of her deliverer which however she was soon relieved from by his courteous behaviour and gentle words they were both standing by the body which lay motionless on the ground and which adams wished to see stir much more than the woman did when he earnestly begged her to tell him by what misfortune she came at such a time of night into so lonely a place she acquainted him she was travelling towards london and had accidentally met with the person from whom he had delivered her who told her he was likewise on his journey to the same place and would keep her company an offer which suspecting no harm she had accepted that he told her they were at a small distance from an inn where she might take up her lodging that evening and he would show her a nearer way to it than by following the road that if she had suspected him which she did not he spoke so kindly to her being alone on these downs in the dark she had no human means to avoid him that therefore she put her whole trust in providence and walked on expecting every moment to arrive at the inn when on a sudden being come to those bushes he desired her to stop and after some rude kisses which she resisted and some entreaties which she rejected he laid violent hands on her and was attempting to execute his wicked will when she thanked g he timely came up and prevented him adams encouraged her for saying she had put her whole trust in providence and told her he doubted not but providence had sent him to her deliverance as a reward for that trust he wished indeed he had not deprived the wicked wretch of life but gs will be done said he hoped the goodness of his intention would excuse him in the next world and he trusted in her evidence to acquit him in this he was then silent and began to consider with himself whether it would be properer to make his escape or to deliver himself into the hands of justice which meditation ended as the reader will see in the next chapter    chapter x  giving an account of the strange catastrophe of the preceding adventure which drew poor adams into fresh calamities and who the woman was who owed the preservation of her chastity to his victorious arm   the silence of adams added to the darkness of the night and loneliness of the place struck dreadful apprehension into the poor womans mind she began to fear as great an enemy in her deliverer as he had delivered her from and as she had not light enough to discover the age of adams and the benevolence visible in his countenance she suspected he had used her as some very honest men have used their country and had rescued her out of the hands of one rifler in order to rifle her himself such were the suspicions she drew from his silence but indeed they were illgrounded he stood over his vanquished enemy wisely weighing in his mind the objections which might be made to either of the two methods of proceeding mentioned in the last chapter his judgment sometimes inclining to the one and sometimes to the other for both seemed to him so equally advisable and so equally dangerous that probably he would have ended his days at least two or three of them on that very spot before he had taken any resolution at length he lifted up his eyes and spied a light at a distance to which he instantly addressed himself with heus tu traveller heus tu he presently heard several voices and perceived the light approaching toward him the persons who attended the light began some to laugh others to sing and others to hollow at which the woman testified some fear for she had concealed her suspicions of the parson himself but adams said be of good cheer damsel and repose thy trust in the same providence which hath hitherto protected thee and never will forsake the innocent these people who now approached were no other reader than a set of young fellows who came to these bushes in pursuit of a diversion which they call birdbatting this if you are ignorant of it as perhaps if thou hast never travelled beyond kensington islington hackney or the borough thou mayst be i will inform thee is performed by holding a large clapnet before a lanthorn and at the same time beating the bushes for the birds when they are disturbed from their places of rest or roost immediately make to the light and so are inticed within the net adams immediately told them what happened and desired them to hold the lanthorn to the face of the man on the ground for he feared he had smote him fatally but indeed his fears were frivolous for the fellow though he had been stunned by the last blow he received had long since recovered his senses and finding himself quit of adams had listened attentively to the discourse between him and the young woman for whose departure he had patiently waited that he might likewise withdraw himself having no longer hopes of succeeding in his desires which were moreover almost as well cooled by mr adams as they could have been by the young woman herself had he obtained his utmost wish this fellow who had a readiness at improving any accident thought he might now play a better part than that of a dead man and accordingly the moment the candle was held to his face he leapt up and laying hold on adams cried out no villain i am not dead though you and your wicked whore might well think me so after the barbarous cruelties you have exercised on me gentlemen said he you are luckily come to the assistance of a poor traveller who would otherwise have been robbed and murdered by this vile man and woman who led me hither out of my way from the highroad and both falling on me have used me as you see adams was going to answer when one of the young fellows cried dn them lets carry them both before the justice the poor woman began to tremble and adams lifted up his voice but in vain three or four of them laid hands on him and one holding the lanthorn to his face they all agreed he had the most villainous countenance they ever beheld and an attorneys clerk who was of the company declared he was sure he had remembered him at the bar as to the woman her hair was dishevelled in the struggle and her nose had bled so that they could not perceive whether she was handsome or ugly but they said her fright plainly discovered her guilt and searching her pockets as they did those of adams for money which the fellow said he had lost they found in her pocket a purse with some gold in it which abundantly convinced them especially as the fellow offered to swear to it mr adams was found to have no more than one halfpenny about him this the clerk said was a great presumption that he was an old offender by cunningly giving all the booty to the woman to which all the rest readily assented  this accident promising them better sport than what they had proposed they quitted their intention of catching birds and unanimously resolved to proceed to the justice with the offenders being informed what a desperate fellow adams was they tied his hands behind him and having hid their nets among the bushes and the lanthorn being carried before them they placed the two prisoners in their front and then began their march adams not only submitting patiently to his own fate but comforting and encouraging his companion under her sufferings  whilst they were on their way the clerk informed the rest that this adventure would prove a very beneficial one for that they would all be entitled to their proportions of £ 0 for apprehending the robbers this occasioned a contention concerning the parts which they had severally borne in taking them one insisting he ought to have the greatest share for he had first laid his hands on adams another claiming a superior part for having first held the lanthorn to the mans face on the ground by which he said the whole was discovered the clerk claimed fourfifths of the reward for having proposed to search the prisoners and likewise the carrying them before the justice he said indeed in strict justice he ought to have the whole these claims however they at last consented to refer to a future decision but seemed all to agree that the clerk was entitled to a moiety they then debated what money should be allotted to the young fellow who had been employed only in holding the nets he very modestly said that he did not apprehend any large proportion would fall to his share but hoped they would allow him something he desired them to consider that they had assigned their nets to his care which prevented him from being as forward as any in laying hold of the robbers for so those innocent people were called that if he had not occupied the nets some other must concluding however that he should be contented with the smallest share imaginable and should think that rather their bounty than his merit but they were all unanimous in excluding him from any part whatever the clerk particularly swearing if they gave him a shilling they might do what they pleased with the rest for he would not concern himself with the affair this contention was so hot and so totally engaged the attention of all the parties that a dexterous nimble thief had he been in mr adamss situation would have taken care to have given the justice no trouble that evening indeed it required not the art of a sheppard to escape especially as the darkness of the night would have so much befriended him but adams trusted rather to his innocence than his heels and without thinking of flight which was easy or resistance which was impossible as there were six lusty young fellows besides the villain himself present he walked with perfect resignation the way they thought proper to conduct him  adams frequently vented himself in ejaculations during their journey at last poor joseph andrews occurring to his mind he could not refrain sighing forth his name which being heard by his companion in affliction she cried with some vehemence sure i should know that voice you cannot certainly sir be mr abraham adamsindeed damsel says he that is my name there is something also in your voice which persuades me i have heard it beforela sir says she dont you remember poor fannyhow fanny answered adams indeed i very well remember you what can have brought you hitheri have told you sir replied she i was travelling towards london but i thought you mentioned joseph andrews pray what is become of himi left him child this afternoon said adams in the stagecoach in his way towards our parish whither he is going to see youto see me la sir answered fanny sure you jeer me what should he be going to see me forcan you ask that replied adams i hope fanny you are not inconstant i assure you he deserves much better of youla mr adams said she what is mr joseph to me i am sure i never had anything to say to him but as one fellowservant might to anotheri am sorry to hear this said adams a virtuous passion for a young man is what no woman need be ashamed of you either do not tell me truth or you are false to a very worthy man adams then told her what had happened at the inn to which she listened very attentively and a sigh often escaped from her notwithstanding her utmost endeavours to the contrary nor could she prevent herself from asking a thousand questions which would have assured any one but adams who never saw farther into people than they desired to let him of the truth of a passion she endeavoured to conceal indeed the fact was that this poor girl having heard of josephs misfortune by some of the servants belonging to the coach which we have formerly mentioned to have stopt at the inn while the poor youth was confined to his bed that instant abandoned the cow she was milking and taking with her a little bundle of clothes under her arm and all the money she was worth in her own purse without consulting any one immediately set forward in pursuit of one whom notwithstanding her shyness to the parson she loved with inexpressible violence though with the purest and most delicate passion this shyness therefore as we trust it will recommend her character to all our female readers and not greatly surprize such of our males as are well acquainted with the younger part of the other sex we shall not give ourselves any trouble to vindicate    chapter xi  what happened to them while before the justice a chapter very full of learning   their fellowtravellers were so engaged in the hot dispute concerning the division of the reward for apprehending these innocent people that they attended very little to their discourse they were now arrived at the justices house and had sent one of his servants in to acquaint his worship that they had taken two robbers and brought them before him the justice who was just returned from a foxchase and had not yet finished his dinner ordered them to carry the prisoners into the stable whither they were attended by all the servants in the house and all the people in the neighbourhood who flocked together to see them with as much curiosity as if there was something uncommon to be seen or that a rogue did not look like other people  the justice now being in the height of his mirth and his cups bethought himself of the prisoners and telling his company he believed they should have good sport in their examination he ordered them into his presence they had no sooner entered the room than he began to revile them saying that robberies on the highway were now grown so frequent that people could not sleep safely in their beds and assured them they both should be made examples of at the ensuing assizes after he had gone on some time in this manner he was reminded by his clerk that it would be proper to take the depositions of the witnesses against them which he bid him do and he would light his pipe in the meantime whilst the clerk was employed in writing down the deposition of the fellow who had pretended to be robbed the justice employed himself in cracking jests on poor fanny in which he was seconded by all the company at table one asked whether she was to be indicted for a highwayman another whispered in her ear if she had not provided herself a great belly he was at her service a third said he warranted she was a relation of turpin to which one of the company a great wit shaking his head and then his sides answered he believed she was nearer related to turpis at which there was an universal laugh they were proceeding thus with the poor girl when somebody smoking the cassock peeping forth from under the greatcoat of adams cried out what have we here a parson how sirrah says the justice do you go robbing in the dress of a clergyman let me tell you your habit will not entitle you to the benefit of the clergy yes said the witty fellow he will have one benefit of clergy he will be exalted above the heads of the people at which there was a second laugh and now the witty spark seeing his jokes take began to rise in spirits and turning to adams challenged him to cap verses and provoking him by giving the first blow he repeated      molle meum levibus cord est vilebile telis  upon which adams with a look full of ineffable contempt told him he deserved scourging for his pronunciation the witty fellow answered what do you deserve doctor for not being able to answer the first time why ill give one you blockhead with an s      si licet ut fulvum spectatur in ignibus haurum  what canst not with an m neither thou art a pretty fellow for a parson why didst not steal some of the parsons latin as well as his gown another at the table then answered if he had you would have been too hard for him i remember you at the college a very devil at this sport i have seen you catch a freshman for nobody that knew you would engage with you i have forgot those things now cried the wit i believe i could have done pretty well formerly lets see what did i end withan m againaye      mars bacchus apollo virorum  i could have done it once ah evil betide you and so you can now said the other nobody in this country will undertake you adams could hold no longer friend said he i have a boy not above eight years old who would instruct thee that the last verse runs thus      ut sunt divorum mars bacchus apollo virorum  ill hold thee a guinea of that said the wit throwing the money on the table and ill go your halves cries the other done answered adams but upon applying to his pocket he was forced to retract and own he had no money about him which set them all alaughing and confirmed the triumph of his adversary which was not moderate any more than the approbation he met with from the whole company who told adams he must go a little longer to school before he attempted to attack that gentleman in latin  the clerk having finished the depositions as well of the fellow himself as of those who apprehended the prisoners delivered them to the justice who having sworn the several witnesses without reading a syllable ordered his clerk to make the mittimus  adams then said he hoped he should not be condemned unheard no no cries the justice you will be asked what you have to say for yourself when you come on your trial we are not trying you now i shall only commit you to gaol if you can prove your innocence at size you will be found ignoramus and so no harm done is it no punishment sir for an innocent man to lie several months in gaol cries adams i beg you would at least hear me before you sign the mittimus what signifies all you can say says the justice is it not here in black and white against you i must tell you you are a very impertinent fellow to take up so much of my time so make haste with his mittimus  the clerk now acquainted the justice that among other suspicious things as a penknife c found in adamss pocket they had discovered a book written as he apprehended in cyphers for no one could read a word in it ay says the justice the fellow may be more than a common robber he may be in a plot against the government produce the book upon which the poor manuscript of aeschylus which adams had transcribed with his own hand was brought forth and the justice looking at it shook his head and turning to the prisoner asked the meaning of those cyphers cyphers answered adams it is a manuscript of aeschylus who who said the justice adams repeated aeschylus that is an outlandish name cried the clerk a fictitious name rather i believe said the justice one of the company declared it looked very much like greek greek said the justice why tis all writing no says the other i dont positively say it is so for it is a very long time since i have seen any greek theres one says he turning to the parson of the parish who was present will tell us immediately the parson taking up the book and putting on his spectacles and gravity together muttered some words to himself and then pronounced alouday indeed it is a greek manuscript a very fine piece of antiquity i make no doubt but it was stolen from the same clergyman from whom the rogue took the cassock what did the rascal mean by his aeschylus says the justice pooh answered the doctor with a contemptuous grin do you think that fellow knows anything of this book aeschylus ho ho i see now what it isa manuscript of one of the fathers i know a nobleman who would give a great deal of money for such a piece of antiquity ay ay question and answer the beginning is the catechism in greek ay ay pollaki toi whats your nameay whats your name says the justice to adams who answered it is aeschylus and i will maintain itoh it is says the justice make mr aeschylus his mittimus i will teach you to banter me with a false name  one of the company having looked steadfastly at adams asked him if he did not know lady booby upon which adams presently calling him to mind answered in a rapture o squire are you there i believe you will inform his worship i am innocenti can indeed say replied the squire that i am very much surprized to see you in this situation and then addressing himself to the justice he said sir i assure you mr adams is a clergyman as he appears and a gentleman of a very good character i wish you would enquire a little farther into this affair for i am convinced of his innocencenay says the justice if he is a gentleman and you are sure he is innocent i dont desire to commit him not i i will commit the woman by herself and take your bail for the gentleman look into the book clerk and see how it is to take bailcomeand make the mittimus for the woman as fast as you cansir cries adams i assure you she is as innocent as myselfperhaps said the squire there may be some mistake pray let us hear mr adamss relationwith all my heart answered the justice and give the gentleman a glass to wet his whistle before he begins i know how to behave myself to gentlemen as well as another nobody can say i have committed a gentleman since i have been in the commission adams then began the narrative in which though he was very prolix he was uninterrupted unless by several hums and hahs of the justice and his desire to repeat those parts which seemed to him most material when he had finished the justice who on what the squire had said believed every syllable of his story on his bare affirmation notwithstanding the depositions on oath to the contrary began to let loose several rogues and rascals against the witness whom he ordered to stand forth but in vain the said witness long since finding what turn matters were likely to take had privily withdrawn without attending the issue the justice now flew into a violent passion and was hardly prevailed with not to commit the innocent fellows who had been imposed on as well as himself he swore they had best find out the fellow who was guilty of perjury and bring him before him within two days or he would bind them all over to their good behaviour they all promised to use their best endeavours to that purpose and were dismissed then the justice insisted that mr adams should sit down and take a glass with him and the parson of the parish delivered him back the manuscript without saying a word nor would adams who plainly discerned his ignorance expose it as for fanny she was at her own request recommended to the care of a maidservant of the house who helped her to new dress and clean herself  the company in the parlour had not been long seated before they were alarmed with a horrible uproar from without where the persons who had apprehended adams and fanny had been regaling according to the custom of the house with the justices strong beer these were all fallen together by the ears and were cuffing each other without any mercy the justice himself sallied out and with the dignity of his presence soon put an end to the fray on his return into the parlour he reported that the occasion of the quarrel was no other than a dispute to whom if adams had been convicted the greater share of the reward for apprehending him had belonged all the company laughed at this except adams who taking his pipe from his mouth fetched a deep groan and said he was concerned to see so litigious a temper in men that he remembered a story something like it in one of the parishes where his cure laythere was continued he a competition between three young fellows for the place of the clerk which i disposed of to the best of my abilities according to merit that is i gave it to him who had the happiest knack at setting a psalm the clerk was no sooner established in his place than a contention began between the two disappointed candidates concerning their excellence each contending on whom had they two been the only competitors my election would have fallen this dispute frequently disturbed the congregation and introduced a discord into the psalmody till i was forced to silence them both but alas the litigious spirit could not be stifled and being no longer able to vent itself in singing it now broke forth in fighting it produced many battles for they were very near a match and i believe would have ended fatally had not the death of the clerk given me an opportunity to promote one of them to his place which presently put an end to the dispute and entirely reconciled the contending parties adams then proceeded to make some philosophical observations on the folly of growing warm in disputes in which neither party is interested he then applied himself vigorously to smoaking and a long silence ensued which was at length broke by the justice who began to sing forth his own praises and to value himself exceedingly on his nice discernment in the cause which had lately been before him he was quickly interrupted by mr adams between whom and his worship a dispute now arose whether he ought not in strictness of law to have committed him the said adams in which the latter maintained he ought to have been committed and the justice as vehemently held he ought not this had most probably produced a quarrel for both were very violent and positive in their opinions had not fanny accidentally heard that a young fellow was going from the justices house to the very inn where the stagecoach in which joseph was put up upon this news she immediately sent for the parson out of the parlour adams when he found her resolute to go though she would not own the reason but pretended she could not bear to see the faces of those who had suspected her of such a crime was as fully determined to go with her he accordingly took leave of the justice and company and so ended a dispute in which the law seemed shamefully to intend to set a magistrate and a divine together by the ears    chapter xii  a very delightful adventure as well to the persons concerned as to the goodnatured reader   adams fanny and the guide set out together about one in the morning the moon being then just risen they had not gone above a mile before a most violent storm of rain obliged them to take shelter in an inn or rather alehouse where adams immediately procured himself a good fire a toast and ale and a pipe and began to smoke with great content utterly forgetting everything that had happened  fanny sat likewise down by the fire but was much more impatient at the storm she presently engaged the eyes of the host his wife the maid of the house and the young fellow who was their guide they all conceived they had never seen anything half so handsome and indeed reader if thou art of an amorous hue i advise thee to skip over the next paragraph which to render our history perfect we are obliged to set down humbly hoping that we may escape the fate of pygmalion for if it should happen to us or to thee to be struck with this picture we should be perhaps in as helpless a condition as narcissus and might say to ourselves quod petis est nusquam or if the finest features in it should set lady s image before our eyes we should be still in as bad a situation and might say to our desires coelum ipsum petimus stultitia  fanny was now in the nineteenth year of her age she was tall and delicately shaped but not one of those slender young women who seem rather intended to hang up in the hall of an anatomist than for any other purpose on the contrary she was so plump that she seemed bursting through her tight stays especially in the part which confined her swelling breasts nor did her hips want the assistance of a hoop to extend them the exact shape of her arms denoted the form of those limbs which she concealed and though they were a little reddened by her labour yet if her sleeve slipped above her elbow or her handkerchief discovered any part of her neck a whiteness appeared which the finest italian paint would be unable to reach her hair was of a chesnut brown and nature had been extremely lavish to her of it which she had cut and on sundays used to curl down her neck in the modern fashion her forehead was high her eyebrows arched and rather full than otherwise her eyes black and sparkling her nose just inclining to the roman her lips red and moist and her underlip according to the opinion of the ladies too pouting her teeth were white but not exactly even the smallpox had left one only mark on her chin which was so large it might have been mistaken for a dimple had not her left cheek produced one so near a neighbour to it that the former served only for a foil to the latter her complexion was fair a little injured by the sun but overspread with such a bloom that the finest ladies would have exchanged all their white for it add to these a countenance in which though she was extremely bashful a sensibility appeared almost incredible and a sweetness whenever she smiled beyond either imitation or description to conclude all she had a natural gentility superior to the acquisition of art and which surprized all who beheld her  this lovely creature was sitting by the fire with adams when her attention was suddenly engaged by a voice from an inner room which sung the following song      the song      say chloe where must the swain stray       who is by thy beauties undone     to wash their remembrance away       to what distant lethe must run     the wretch who is sentenced to die       may escape and leave justice behind     from his country perhaps he may fly       but oh can he fly from his mind      o rapture unthought of before       to be thus of chloe possessd     nor she nor no tyrants hard power       her image can tear from my breast     but felt not narcissus more joy       with his eyes he beheld his loved charms     yet what he beheld the fond boy       more eagerly wishd in his arms      how can it thy dear image be       which fills thus my bosom with woe     can aught bear resemblance to thee       which grief and not joy can bestow     this counterfeit snatch from my heart       ye powrs tho with torment i rave     tho mortal will prove the fell smart       i then shall find rest in my grave      ah see the dear nymph oer the plain       come smiling and tripping along     a thousand loves dance in her train       the graces around her all throng     to meet her soft zephyrus flies       and wafts all the sweets from the flowers     ah rogue i whilst he kisses her eyes       more sweets from her breath he devours      my soul whilst i gaze is on fire       but her looks were so tender and kind     my hope almost reachd my desire       and left lame despair far behind     transported with madness i flew       and eagerly seized on my bliss     her bosom but half she withdrew       but half she refused my fond kiss      advances like these made me bold       i whisperd herlove were alone     the rest let immortals unfold       no language can tell but their own     ah chloe expiring i cried       how long i thy cruelty bore     ah strephon she blushing replied       you neer was so pressing before  adams had been ruminating all this time on a passage in aeschylus without attending in the least to the voice though one of the most melodious that ever was heard when casting his eyes on fanny he cried out bless us you look extremely palepale mr adams says she o jesus and fell backwards in her chair adams jumped up flung his aeschylus into the fire and fell aroaring to the people of the house for help he soon summoned every one into the room and the songster among the rest but o reader when this nightingale who was no other than joseph andrews himself saw his beloved fanny in the situation we have described her canst thou conceive the agitations of his mind if thou canst not waive that meditation to behold his happiness when clasping her in his arms he found life and blood returning into her cheeks when he saw her open her beloved eyes and heard her with the softest accent whisper are you joseph andrewsart thou my fanny he answered eagerly and pulling her to his heart he imprinted numberless kisses on her lips without considering who were present  if prudes are offended at the lusciousness of this picture they may take their eyes off from it and survey parson adams dancing about the room in a rapture of joy some philosophers may perhaps doubt whether he was not the happiest of the three for the goodness of his heart enjoyed the blessings which were exulting in the breasts of both the other two together with his own but we shall leave such disquisitions as too deep for us to those who are building some favourite hypothesis which they will refuse no metaphysical rubbish to erect and support for our part we give it clearly on the side of joseph whose happiness was not only greater than the parsons but of longer duration for as soon as the first tumults of adamss rapture were over he cast his eyes towards the fire where aeschylus lay expiring and immediately rescued the poor remains to wit the sheepskin covering of his dear friend which was the work of his own hands and had been his inseparable companion for upwards of thirty years  fanny had no sooner perfectly recovered herself than she began to restrain the impetuosity of her transports and reflecting on what she had done and suffered in the presence of so many she was immediately covered with confusion and pushing joseph gently from her she begged him to be quiet nor would admit of either kiss or embrace any longer then seeing mrs slipslop she curtsied and offered to advance to her but that high woman would not return her curtsies but casting her eyes another way immediately withdrew into another room muttering as she went she wondered who the creature was    chapter xiii  a dissertation concerning high people and low people with mrs slipslops departure in no very good temper of mind and the evil plight in which she left adams and his company   it will doubtless seem extremely odd to many readers that mrs slipslop who had lived several years in the same house with fanny should in a short separation utterly forget her and indeed the truth is that she remembered her very well as we would not willingly therefore that anything should appear unnatural in this our history we will endeavour to explain the reasons of her conduct nor do we doubt being able to satisfy the most curious reader that mrs slipslop did not in the least deviate from the common road in this behaviour and indeed had she done otherwise she must have descended below herself and would have very justly been liable to censure  be it known then that the human species are divided into two sorts of people to wit high people and low people as by high people i would not be understood to mean persons literally born higher in their dimensions than the rest of the species nor metaphorically those of exalted characters or abilities so by low people i cannot be construed to intend the reverse high people signify no other than people of fashion and low people those of no fashion now this word fashion hath by long use lost its original meaning from which at present it gives us a very different idea for i am deceived if by persons of fashion we do not generally include a conception of birth and accomplishments superior to the herd of mankind whereas in reality nothing more was originally meant by a person of fashion than a person who drest himself in the fashion of the times and the word really and truly signifies no more at this day now the world being thus divided into people of fashion and people of no fashion a fierce contention arose between them nor would those of one party to avoid suspicion be seen publicly to speak to those of the other though they often held a very good correspondence in private in this contention it is difficult to say which party succeeded for whilst the people of fashion seized several places to their own use such as courts assemblies operas balls c the people of no fashion besides one royal place called his majestys beargarden have been in constant possession of all hops fairs revels c two places have been agreed to be divided between them namely the church and the playhouse where they segregate themselves from each other in a remarkable manner for as the people of fashion exalt themselves at church over the heads of the people of no fashion so in the playhouse they abase themselves in the same degree under their feet this distinction i have never met with any one able to account for it is sufficient that so far from looking on each other as brethren in the christian language they seem scarce to regard each other as of the same species this the terms strange persons people one does not know the creature wretches beasts brutes and many other appellations evidently demonstrate which mrs slipslop having often heard her mistress use thought she had also a right to use in her turn and perhaps she was not mistaken for these two parties especially those bordering nearly on each other to wit the lowest of the high and the highest of the low often change their parties according to place and time for those who are people of fashion in one place are often people of no fashion in another and with regard to time it may not be unpleasant to survey the picture of dependance like a kind of ladder as for instance early in the morning arises the postillion or some other boy which great families no more than great ships are without and falls to brushing the clothes and cleaning the shoes of john the footman who being drest himself applies his hands to the same labours for mr secondhand the squires gentleman the gentleman in the like manner a little later in the day attends the squire the squire is no sooner equipped than he attends the levee of my lord which is no sooner over than my lord himself is seen at the levee of the favourite who after the hour of homage is at an end appears himself to pay homage to the levee of his sovereign nor is there perhaps in this whole ladder of dependance any one step at a greater distance from the other than the first from the second so that to a philosopher the question might only seem whether you would chuse to be a great man at six in the morning or at two in the afternoon and yet there are scarce two of these who do not think the least familiarity with the persons below them a condescension and if they were to go one step farther a degradation  and now reader i hope thou wilt pardon this long digression which seemed to me necessary to vindicate the great character of mrs slipslop from what low people who have never seen high people might think an absurdity but we who know them must have daily found very high persons know us in one place and not in another today and not tomorrow all which it is difficult to account for otherwise than i have here endeavoured and perhaps if the gods according to the opinion of some made men only to laugh at them there is no part of our behaviour which answers the end of our creation better than this  but to return to our history adams who knew no more of this than the cat which sat on the table imagining mrs slipslops memory had been much worse than it really was followed her into the next room crying out madam slipslop here is one of your old acquaintance do but see what a fine woman she is grown since she left lady boobys servicei think i reflect something of her answered she with great dignity but i cant remember all the inferior servants in our family she then proceeded to satisfy adamss curiosity by telling him when she arrived at the inn she found a chaise ready for her that her lady being expected very shortly in the country she was obliged to make the utmost haste and in commensuration of josephs lameness she had taken him with her and lastly that the excessive virulence of the storm had driven them into the house where he found them after which she acquainted adams with his having left his horse and exprest some wonder at his having strayed so far out of his way and at meeting him as she said in the company of that wench who she feared was no better than she should be  the horse was no sooner put into adamss head but he was immediately driven out by this reflection on the character of fanny he protested he believed there was not a chaster damsel in the universe i heartily wish i heartily wish cried he snapping his fingers that all her betters were as good he then proceeded to inform her of the accident of their meeting but when he came to mention the circumstance of delivering her from the rape she said she thought him properer for the army than the clergy that it did not become a clergyman to lay violent hands on any one that he should have rather prayed that she might be strengthened adams said he was very far from being ashamed of what he had done she replied want of shame was not the currycuristic of a clergyman this dialogue might have probably grown warmer had not joseph opportunely entered the room to ask leave of madam slipslop to introduce fanny but she positively refused to admit any such trollops and told him she would have been burnt before she would have suffered him to get into a chaise with her if she had once respected him of having his sluts waylaid on the road for him adding that mr adams acted a very pretty part and she did not doubt but to see him a bishop he made the best bow he could and cried out i thank you madam for that rightreverend appellation which i shall take all honest means to deservevery honest means returned she with a sneer to bring people together at these words adams took two or three strides across the room when the coachman came to inform mrs slipslop that the storm was over and the moon shone very bright she then sent for joseph who was sitting without with his fanny and would have had him gone with her but he peremptorily refused to leave fanny behind which threw the good woman into a violent rage she said she would inform her lady what doings were carrying on and did not doubt but she would rid the parish of all such people and concluded a long speech full of bitterness and very hard words with some reflections on the clergy not decent to repeat at last finding joseph unmoveable she flung herself into the chaise casting a look at fanny as she went not unlike that which cleopatra gives octavia in the play to say the truth she was most disagreeably disappointed by the presence of fanny she had from her first seeing joseph at the inn conceived hopes of something which might have been accomplished at an alehouse as well as a palace indeed it is probable mr adams had rescued more than fanny from the danger of a rape that evening  when the chaise had carried off the enraged slipslop adams joseph and fanny assembled over the fire where they had a great deal of innocent chat pretty enough but as possibly it would not be very entertaining to the reader we shall hasten to the morning only observing that none of them went to bed that night adams when he had smoaked three pipes took a comfortable nap in a great chair and left the lovers whose eyes were too well employed to permit any desire of shutting them to enjoy by themselves during some hours an happiness which none of my readers who have never been in love are capable of the least conception of though we had as many tongues as homer desired to describe it with and which all true lovers will represent to their own minds without the least assistance from us  let it suffice then to say that fanny after a thousand entreaties at last gave up her whole soul to joseph and almost fainting in his arms with a sigh infinitely softer and sweeter too than any arabian breeze she whispered to his lips which were then close to hers o joseph you have won me i will be yours for ever joseph having thanked her on his knees and embraced her with an eagerness which she now almost returned leapt up in a rapture and awakened the parson earnestly begging him that he would that instant join their hands together adams rebuked him for his request and told him he would by no means consent to anything contrary to the forms of the church that he had no licence nor indeed would he advise him to obtain one that the church had prescribed a formnamely the publication of bannswith which all good christians ought to comply and to the omission of which he attributed the many miseries which befell great folks in marriage concluding as many as are joined together otherwise than gs word doth allow are not joined together by g neither is their matrimony lawful fanny agreed with the parson saying to joseph with a blush she assured him she would not consent to any such thing and that she wondered at his offering it in which resolution she was comforted and commended by adams and joseph was obliged to wait patiently till after the third publication of the banns which however he obtained the consent of fanny in the presence of adams to put in at their arrival  the sun had been now risen some hours when joseph finding his leg surprizingly recovered proposed to walk forwards but when they were all ready to set out an accident a little retarded them this was no other than the reckoning which amounted to seven shillings no great sum if we consider the immense quantity of ale which mr adams poured in indeed they had no objection to the reasonableness of the bill but many to the probability of paying it for the fellow who had taken poor fannys purse had unluckily forgot to return it so that the account stood thus                                     £ s d         mr adams and company dr  0   0          in mr adamss pocket       0 0              in mr josephs

hostess if there was no clergyman in that parish she answered there wasis he wealthy replied he to which she likewise answered in the affirmative adams then snapping his fingers returned overjoyed to his companions crying out heureka heureka which not being understood he told them in plain english they need give themselves no trouble for he had a brother in the parish who would defray the reckoning and that he would just step to his house and fetch the money and return to them instantly    end of vol i
