mr sheridans argument in the case of daly against magee  mr sheridans argument in the case of daly against magee on a motion to discharge the defendant on common bail  london printed and dublin reprinted for j moore no    collegegreen  it may be necessary just to mention for the information of those not of the profession of the law that  a judges fiat is a warrant or authority to the officer of the court to issue a writ marked in such sum as the fiat directs on which writ the defendant is arrested and must either find bail to the amount of such sum or remain in prison  special bail is bail by sureties to the amount of a certain sum  common bail is only an appearance to the action by attorney without any security  in the kings bench michaelmas term  0th geo   daly against magee mr john magee being in confinement under a writ marked for the sum of  000 l at the suit of the plaintiff for defamation by authority of a fiat for that purpose granted by the lord chief justice caused a notice of the following purport to be served on the plaintiffs attorney  sir  counsel on behalf of the defendant will move the court the first opportunity to set aside the order made in this cause on the   th day of june last whereby it was ordered that the defendant should give special bail in this cause to the amount of the sum marked at the foot of the writ of capias ad respondendum which issued in this cause and that the defendants common appearance may be taken and stand without holding him to special bail but if the court should not be pleased to grant such motion counsel will then move the court to vary the said order and that the sum for which the said writ was marked and the defendant thereby required to find bail to such amount may be reduced from  000 l to  00 l and the notice concludes in such case with a tender of bail to the amount of the last mentioned sum  nb similar notices were served in the case of brennan against magee tracy against magee and higgins against magee who had severally obtained fiats on the ground of defamation  mr sheridan my lords i am in this case counsel for mr john magee the alleged proprietor of a news paper called the dublin evening post and i could wish that the notice on his behalf and on which i move had not a double aspect i could wish that it had been confined to his claim of right and not extended to an application for favor  when we move that a common appearance may be taken without holding him to special bail a great question of constitutional and public importance is involved in the subject but when we apply to reduce the sum the application appears like an appeal to the discretion of the court my duty to my client obliges me to submit my observations in each point of view though i should rather argue it in the abstract for another reason i might thereby avoid the strange stuff and material which the plaintiff has introduced as merits into his affidavit and i might thereby avoid to use a dramatic quotation in a case partly theatrical that style of speech which though it may make the unskilful laugh cannot but make the judicious grieve the censure of one of whom outweighs in my mind a whole theater of others  my lords i am in this case with due deference to contend that the learned judge was not warranted by law in issuing his fiat for any sum for that in this case common bail which is no more than an appearance for the party and properly speaking no bail at all is all that the law requires but if your lordships shall be of opinion that the learned judge was authorized by law in issuing such fiat holding the defendant to  000 l bail then i am to submit to your lordships that you are bound in conscience to reduce the sum because you are bound and it is the true spirit of the law to hold him to no greater bail than in your conscience you shall think the plaintiff can recover and here my lords it is necessary to call your attention to the affidavit of the plaintiff it is his case and therefore i presume put in the strongest and best manner that the nature of that case would allow it is the ground upon which a judges fiat for  000 l issued and there never was an affidavit containing the grievance of the party complaining more weak and more defective there is not throughout this affidavit a single per quod the allegded libel is libellous only by forced construction by violent interpretation of an apparently unmeaning poem the damages in amount are so far from approaching to any degree of certainty that it is rather obvious that none were actually sustained it hints at damages which may be not which are suffered and such damages are imaginary they are poetic they are in the fancy the conception of the party interested of him who seeks redress in damages  mr richard daly styles himself in this his affidavit manager of the theater royal in the city of dublin he states that the defendant mr john magee is as he believes printer and publisher of a certain news paper called the dublin evening post in which paper he john magee caused to be published a defamatory poem of the tenor in the affidavit  i should be sorry to feel myself under any necessity to recite this poem to the court it is in truth a very strange composition but may have its merit with those who understand it but as it is the cause of a fiat for  000 l and as it contains or rather is itself the offense for which my client is in duress until he shall procure bail to that amount i have selected and shall faithfully state such passages or parts of this poem as by possibility may be deemed libellous   the gamblers retired and roscius alone  i am free to admit that mr daly being manager of the theater may be the roscius intended by the poet but this concession is somewhat unnecessary as mr daly in his affidavit swears that he is the person so described or in other words that he is roscius  how far this may be a libel on roscius deceased on roscius the companion of cicero the name at least will scarcely be deemed a libel on roscius the companion of higgins  roscius laments  that humble actresses will no longer obedient bend   that  francisco now delights the admiring throng   he then proceeds to kill himself  the tragic tin bent harmless on his breast   then cupid arrives to whom roscius says  does some lady court me to her arms  and buy with brilliant gold my manly charms   cupid replies  there live he said some men of fame well known  for punctual dealing and to candor prone   the wights have money  honesty against cunning has no force   well fleece the villains   here a judge is to conceive and a jury hereafter are to conceive that the lotteryoffice keepers are understood who sometime ago were so successfully and so surprisingly hit i am endeavoring to give to this silly poem all the wicked effect that conjecture can admit  i know the wily plot ricardo cried  the doctor in those schemes is fully tried  the doctor sails to the cambrian shore  then straight to the enchanted fane    the priests the cabalistic numbers cry  the doctor ties them round a pigeons neck   who flies  and on franciscos portal plumes his wings   these are the criminal extracts from the alleged libel a poem full of nonsense ribaldry and bombast not to be matched in a mock tragedy truly farcical were it not that the sum of  000 l has changed the performance to a tragicomedy  for the publication of this poem the defendant has been arrested under a writ issued by authority of a fiat and marked for  000 l  my lords there have been of late and i lament it many bold impudent plain and indefensible libels why are the weakest selected to disgrace the records of the court and to bring contempt upon the justice of the country  and now my lords let me call your attention to what ought to be the material part of an affidavit to warrant a fiat in any case to that part which relates to the damage sustained in this case the single instance in which the plaintiff endeavors to show any special damage he fails in the attempt and the fair inference from his own words is that he has suffered little if any  after swearing that he had expended considerable sums in the embellishment of the theater royal and that he has hitherto supported a good repute and credit he proceeds and states in his affidavit that by the false and scandalous publications concerning him he has already experienced their injurious tendency as a very eminent performer whom he had retained in great britain to act at his theater in this city did from the false and scandalous publications against him express a doubt of his credit and punctuality and that therefore a large and considerable sum must be paid in advance and if it had not been for the interference of some friends he would have been deprived of the advantage of such performer  now what is the inference here  he advanced nothing and the actress came and fulfilled her engagement  take it that he did advance  how much  and where is the magnitude of the injury in advancing to a performer a sum on account if the manager ever intended to pay and this is the only statement of an injury actually sustained  the use of indefinite words in an affidavit may be sometimes very convenient but when injury is to be redressed in damages and the party held to bail the security should be proportioned to the probable redress and the law requires some measure whereby such security may be limited and not extended  the plaintiff in this case feeling perhaps that a fiat for  000 l on the ground he has stated and which i have followed would be as ridiculous as it is outrageous adds that he has children among whom are sour growingup daughters who in their future prospects in life may receive considerable injury and he then swears that he has good reason to be convinced he has suffered damages to the amount of four thousand pounds and upwards  how  by an advance to a performer and the injuries his family or himself may hereafter suffer see my lords the danger that might arise from any man carving the measure of his own redress in estimating the value of the injury he has sustained that which is but ideal will become real and he will tell you he has good reason to be convinced and i beseech your lordships attention to this because it illustrates the doctrine of the law which i shall submit to you with respect to bail in actions of defamation  the plaintiff concludes his affidavit in stating that john magee the defendant gives out that he is a man of very considerable property as well in money as in several news papers why this is introduced i cannot discover it is introduced as true and if true it is a reason for a common appearance because the plaintiff himself alleges a sufficient responsibility in the defendant whom he sues  the defendant john magee has made an affidavit in aid of the present application in which he swears that a writ issued in or as of last trinity term to the sheriffs of the city of dublin marked for the sum of  000 l under authority of a fiat granted by the lord chief justice and founded on an affidavit of richard daly the plaintiff that upon such writ he was arrested in june last that in consequence of a number of vexatious suits and prosecutions against him and in consequence of the proceedings in this cause and from the reiterated abuse he has received in the freemans journal he is extremely injured in his credit insomuch that though he has used every effort in his power he cannot now procure bail in this cause for the amount of the sum marked at the foot of said writ or to any larger amount than  00 l and says he verily believes that the plaintiff has not suffered damage in this cause to any amount whatsoever  your lordships have now before you the facts or merits of the case but i trust your lordships will decide on a great question of public and of constitutional importance without any reference to the particular circumstances of the present case i reject them as unnecessary save only to the second part of the application the reducement of the bail which will also become unnecessary if your lordships shall be of opinion that the defendant is not bound by law to give any security whatever  then my lords i with confidence assert that a common appearance is all the law requires in actions of defamation and to compel any security to any amount is an extortion on the subject and illegal  it is pleasing to observe in what great esteem the law holds personal freedom justly considering the general liberty of the subject as dependant on that of the individual and so tender has the law been of this liberty that no man could be deprived of his personal freedom unless for some criminal flagrant offense injurious to the government under which he lived or for some tortius act committed with force and consequently in breach of the peace which his allegiance and duty required him to keep and preserve it is thus well expressed in cromptons admirable introduction to a late very excellent compilation  i grant that the legal requisition of bail properly called special bail is and has been for many years less confined but then it has been extended from necessity and upon principle as in debt  what is the rule of law  if the debt absolutely amounts to a sum certain then the debtor may be held to special bail but where the demand is not absolute but uncertain and sounds in damages  not so  and the principle is  the plaintiff shall not be the judge of the injury he cannot ascertain because it would make the defendant the victim of the plaintiffs conception  a judge indeed may in several cases grant a fiat to hold a party to special bail but in every case it can only be where the demand is certain as in debt or where the injury is so outrageous that damages must necessarily have been suffered there the judge has some measure some guide but even there he is bound to be moderate for in the language of the bill of rights excessive bail ought not to be required  and here my lords i think i take the doctrine in its utmost latitude in cases of defamation or slander save only two exceptions which i shall mention a judge is not warranted to grant a fiat for the defendant shall be held only to common bail as to special bail cases of defamation are excepted in every authority from the oldest down to cromptons late digest on the subject  the first mention of special bail in slander was in the reign of charles ii and that only in the case of slandering the title of lands previous to that time special bail was required in no case of personal slander afterward special bail was extended to scandalum magnatum and no further so that the two exceptions evidently support the doctrine  in crompton    title bail in trespass assault battery conspiracy false imprisonment there shall be common bail only unless on a motion or order made by the court or a judge your lordships will observe that this saving of motion or order applies only to such actions in which in the first instance common bail is all the law requires and you will observe what follows in slander common bail only unless in slander of title and then common or special in the discretion of the court this is laid down as the law in michaelmas      and the authority adds as the practice after that period  or unless spoken of a person of quality  this complimentary concession was introduced perhaps considering peers as the hereditary legislators of the realm the kings hereditary counselors and forming the court of ultimate appeal and final jurisdiction the welfare of the empire depending in a degree on their good name and reputation so in ray     earl of stampford against goodall in scandalum magnatum the plaintiff may have special bail on motion and order  lord chief baron common in his digest vol i fol  0  enumerates the cases where special bail may be required where the debt or damage in an action of debt detinue trespass action upon the case  except in slander amounts to  0 l special bail so where the damages are uncertain the judges in their discretion may grant special bail as in battery if it appears to be outrageous in conspiracy false imprisonment  in slander of title or scandalum magnatum there in slander special bail is confined to the two instances in the cases where special bail is allowed of right it is founded on the certainty of the injury where it arises from discretion it is measured by the enormity of the offense  in   blackstone     smith against frazer  in trespass and assault the plaintiff made affidavit before forster justice to hold the defendant to bail on the flagrant circumstances of which he directed  00 l bail to be given  my lords there is not any distinction taken with respect to bail between slander written and uttered between defamation by libel or parole  there is no variance as to the doctrine to be found in the books and the principle cannot be affected by the nature or class of the defamation    siderfin     chetwin against skinner it is there laid down in action sur le case pur parole ou outrement null spe bail  i call upon gentlemen to show any distinction taken in any authority between slander written and slander spoken with respect to the doctrine of bail i know there are distinctions between libel and slander spoken i know one has justly a greater degree of criminality annexed to it than the other but with regard to bail i say defamation is the general head including every species of slander written painted engraved spoken ou outrement or otherwise  my lords so tenacious is the law of personal liberty and so tender have judges been with regard to it that even in cases where the law recognized and allowed special bail where even the ground of the application seemed fair and reasonable courts have refused to hold the subject to special bail because the case might not ultimately warrant it  in   strange      heathcot against goslin  the affidavit to hold to bail was that the defendant borrowed  000 l of the plaintiff on bottomree which money is now due and owing to this deponent by virtue of the said bond as thereby may appear  objected that this was no oath of the debt for suppose every penny is paid and a separate receipt taken yet upon the face of the bond the whole will appear due et per curiam it is not sufficient the plaintiff would have made a supplemental affidavit but the court refused to receive it for the act of parliament requires a full oath previous to the issuing the process that defendants may not be harased and therefore in this case the defendant was discharged upon common bail  in the present case mr daly has made a subsequent affidavit but such affidavit could be no ground for the arrest for it was not in esse when the fiat was granted    strange     gammage against watkin  the original debt was under the sum entitled to special bail but the costs swelled it over and the plaintiff had judgment on which he brought debt and held the defendant to bail and now upon motion the court ordered common bail to be accepted for as the original demand did not require bail the addition of costs will not alter the case  and yet my lords here the costs and the original demand were liquidated and in law became one debt but the court in its decision guided by attention and attachment to personal liberty made the distinction in its favor and the like attention and attachment appear to govern in every case    burrow     pomp verse ludrigson  a rule for discharging the defendant upon common bail was made absolute the affidavit to hold him to special bail not being possitive which it is the established rule of the court that it must be this was the case of a merchant in london whose correspondent in sweden had sent him over the accounts from sweden where the debt arose and consequently the plaintiff the merchant in london could only swear to his belief with a reference to the accounts sent to him from sweden the fact itself not being within his own personal knowledge so that the affidavit could not have been more positive than it was unless the correspondent in sweden could have come over to london to swear it    strange   0  rios verse relifante  the affidavit to hold to special bail was made by a merchant in london swearing that the defendant owed the plaintiff   0 l as appears by an affidavit made by the plaintiff in amsterdam which he the deponent believes to be true et per curiam there can only be common bail the oath abroad is no ground and there is nothing but belief which is not sufficient  your lordships will observe that these are commercial cases and from the nature of commerce and the situation of parties connected with it similar cases may every day occur yet we find no attempt at an argument founded on necessity or public benefit to extend the power of the court    strange      claphamson verse bowman the plaintiffs bookkeeper swore that the defendant was indebted to the plaintiff in   00 l for money had and received by the defendant to the use of the plaintiff as this deponent verily believes and the court held it not sufficient to hold the defendant to special bail  this was the case of a bookkeeper swearing as fully as he conscientiously could no merchant keeps his own books because he cannot be a witness to prove any debt due to himself his clerk who must be his witness who should be privy to the dealing and who keeps the account can scarcely extend his oath were he ever so correct beyond the best of his belief yet in such case if the charge be not positive common bail only is allowed    strange      walrond verse fransham an executrix in order to hold the defendant to bail made an affidavit that he was indebted to her testator so much as appears by the books of the testator and it was held insufficient and common bail ordered  here could have been no positive affidavit the creditor was dead the plaintiff was an executrix and sued in such right the office is highly favored in law the assets of which credits may make a principal part are committed for the best purposes and among the first the payment of the testators debts yet in this case the case i say of an executrix suing in the right of another in whom no private or personal interest could be presumed and laying before the court the best foundation in her power  common bail only  compare my lords such cases with the present and can you doubt compare such affidavits with that of mr daly whose present losses are the conjecture surmise apprehension and belief of future injuries  the cases i have quoted are cases within the description and reach of special bail the case of daly is that of defamation entitled only as i apprehend to common bail certainly to no more where no actual damage is sworn to have been suffered certainly not to the extent which confines him before trial to an amount which might be considered as excessive in damages after verdict  but my lords laying aside the parties and the particular circumstances of the case what is the great and important question  if the extensive and extending conscience of a suitor partial to himself in fancied injuries and imaginary ills can impose on the credulity of a judge if the judge may at his discretion hold a subject in prison previous to trial on terms with which he cannot comply the discretion of the judge may become the pleasure of the man where then will be the difference between fiat and letter de cachet if such be the practice we are not safe we have obtained nothing by the glorious revolution we have no security in the great charter in the bill of rights in the habeas corpus the achievements of liberty may decorate the monument of a former constitution or be like standards taken from an enemy hung up old torn and useless save only to show a degraded posterity the virtue and valor of their ancestors  no my lords i trust that a great and able judge will this day add a brighter glory to his name his rank and office than any in the power of majesty to confer by nobly saying what the best have said and what none but the best will say i have been wrong  a generous and a grateful people will applaud bless record the expression and honor even the error that caused it  finis
