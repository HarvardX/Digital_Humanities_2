the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland  vol iv  by mr brook  dublin printed for the author by dillon chamberlain in dame street facing fowness street mdcclxix  the fool of quality or the history of henry earl of moreland chap xvii while harry was speaking ned saw a woman standing before one of the windows and looking earnestly at her he gave a sudden jump and dancing about cried o sir sir my mammy my mammy my mammy there is my mammy there is my mammy as sure as day  run ned instantly cried mr fenton and call james to me  james yonder is the woman who stole ned from his parents have an eye to her do not let her escape order frank to take a horse and go with all speed to mr and mrs fielding that they may come and know of a surety whether ned is their child or not  stay a moment as soon as you have given frank his orders take the rest of the servants and lay hold on this bad woman bring her into the house by force and confine her in one of the back rooms till mr fielding arrives by all neds account she must be a very sad creature and deserves no favor  james went out with alacrity upon his commission and having executed matters with his accustomed punctuality he returned to the company  law sir cried james it is impossible that this woman should be neds mammy as he called her this is some unhappy decayed gentlewoman as innocent of the fact i dare answer as the child unborn i am sorry with all my heart that i had her used so roughly beside sir she is so deaf that she cannot answer to any thing of which she may be accused  when we took her in hand she was terribly frighted come says i mistress you must now give an account of all your wickedness  ennis says she ennis no but enfield five miles beyond enfield with the rev mr catharines  i know nothing said i aloud of your enfields or your catharines but i tell you that you must now answer for the life that you have led dead dead says she god forbid a dear and a good master he was to me i am sure i have lived with him these five years and he gave me money enough to bear my charges but i fell sick at saint albans and spent all and i have been these three days creeping along and begging wherewithal to keep life in me on the way  as you say james cried mr fenton this account seems pretty feasible a deaf servant however is something uncommon and yet i once knew a deaf and dumb man the most ready and apprehensive attendant i ever saw he would instantly collect whatever you wanted from the motion of your lips and the cast of your eye go to her yourself ned and observe her more exactly for if what she says has any truth in it it is impossible she should be your mammy  ned accordingly went but returned under evident confusion and difficulty i dont know what to think sir of this matter cries ned when i look at the gentlewomans face i could swear twenty times over to every feature but when i look at her dress and manners i could again almost swear against her face  neds perplexity added greatly to mr fentons curiosity he got up in haste and went in person to inspect the party when he entered he saw a young woman who looked very pale and sickly but of a genteel appearance and neatly though plainly dressed she cast upon him a sensible and penetrating look and courtesying to him with downcast eyes sir says she your presence tells me that you are master here i know not for what offense your people have confined me but if it is on any suspicion of misbehaviour i have here the certificate of a worthy man and a great saint who vouches at least for the innocence of my conduct  here she presented him with a paper that contained the following words  i certify that the bearer has served me upward of five years in quality of housekeeper and intendant of my family that she is a young woman of distinguished piety and merit and departs at her own desire on some business to london  given under my hand etc marmaduke catharines cl  on reading this mr fenton bowed and made a motion with his hand for her to sit down he then took a pen and paper that lay beside him and wrote to the purpose that he requested her to allow him to detain her certificate for about an hour after which he would return it and endeavor to make her amends for the unbecoming treatment which his people had given her  on casting her eye over the paper she made a low courtesy and said i shall willingly attend sir during your pleasure but hope in the mean time that your charity will afford me a morsel or two of the fragments of your last meal  mr fenton then pulled a bell and having ordered some cold meats and whitewine to be served he bowed and withdrew to his company  ned said he as he entered this woman is just as much the empress of russia as she is your mammy here mr clement look at this certificate i have no reason to doubt the truth of the character given in it for her person and manners are every way conformable i am sorry at heart that i sent in such a hurry for mr and mrs fielding i have thereby raised a sort of expectation in them and it may be very mortifying to have that expectation so suddenly and so wholly defeated  some time after a coach and six frothing horses drove up to the door and mr and mrs fielding alighted with a kind of impatience and trepidation apparent in their countenance as soon as mr fenton had duly received and seated them my dear madam says he to mrs fielding i think myself very unhappy in having given you a deal of unnecessary trouble my poor ned here has been utterly mistaken in the person of the woman whom he took to be his mammy the certificate of her certain residence bears a date even previous to that in which we found him and her deportment is more than a thousand testimonies against her being of the wandering or dissolute class of people be pleased mr fielding to look over this certificate i think it has all the marks of its being genuine  the moment that mr fielding cast his eye on the paper a well known character a well known character indeed he exclaimed it is the hand of mr catharines my tutor my friend the man of the world excepting yourself mr fenton for whom i have the dearest respect and affection no question can be made of any thing to which he sets his affirmative  alas cried mrs fielding then all the hopes we had conceived must again be cast aside here comes our nurse too poor woman in great haste i sent her word that we had found the person whom we suspected to have stolen our child and desired that she would meet me here directly  while mrs fielding spoke nurse entered panting and almost breathless and without saluting or taking any note of the company where she hastily cried where is the boy madam whom you suppose to be your child  ah nurse said mrs fielding we were quite mistaken in the woman whom we suspected to be the kidnapper and so that affair is all over again  i have nothing to say cried nurse to this woman or the other woman but you must not have another bodys child put upon you if he is indeed your son i shall know him in an instant i should know him from all the children that ever were born why nurse cried mrs fielding eagerly do you know of any natural mark or mole or spot by which you could guess at him he had no such spot upon him madam but if he be a living boy he has a mark of my own making that never will out and that is the reason that i never dared to tell you of it what mark nurse what mark tell me instantly i beg you  why madam you must know as how the weather was very cold it being twelfth day in christmas holidays so you and my master were from home on visiting and i had a rouzing fire down and my child stood by my knee being just then twelve months nineteen days old and as sturdy a fellow of his age and inches as any could desire to see so the cat all at once threw down some crockery ware behind me up i started to be sure and run to save the vessels but hearing my child scream i turned much nimbler back again and found him fallen with his little neck against the upper bar of the grate it was well that i didnt die on the spot for then he must have died too so i whipped him up in my arms but he shrieked and roared terribly so i got some softening cream and spread it over the burn and i put a plaster upon that again and i covered the place from day to day so well with his cap that neither you nor my master knew any thing of the matter but the shape of his hurt went so deep into my heart and into my memory that as i was saying and still say i should know him by it again among all the children in all the world  go then my dear nurse cried mrs fielding go immediately and examine if this boy has your mark upon him is this the master madam whom you suspect to be your son it is nurse it is my heart took a liking to him the first moment i saw him he too was stolen from his parents and may as well be my son as the son of another  here nurse made a hasty step or two toward ned but suddenly stopping and turning pale ah madam she cried i wish you would go and try yourself the wound if he has it is just under his right ear for if i should find indeed that he is my very child i shall certainly run mad on the very spot for joy i dare not try nurse i dare not try for the world said mrs fielding i am already all of a tremble i know not how  nurse then plucking up a little resolution stepped suddenly to ned and turned up his hair when giving a loud scream she had just the power to cry out my child my child my child my child and dropped down in an anguishing fit of hysterics  mrs fielding on hearing her nurse cry out rose hastily from her chair and would have gone to embrace her son but falling instantly back she fainted away the poor nurse however was not so happy she broke forth at times into convulsive peals of laughter that made the house ring and again she fell into fits of weeping so outrageous and bitterly desolate as no heart under the temper of adamant could support  while the family were all in bustle applying remedies to their patients mrs fielding recovered and hearing the cries of her nurse she went and kneeled down by her and wept with her and over her while her tears proved a seasonable restorative to herself  as soon as mr fielding found that his lady was well recovered he turned to ned and lifting his hair observed the remarkable seam that the burn had made it is it is my child he tenderly cried o my god how is this wherein have i deserved thy smallest notice or regard that thou should thus visit me with thy wonders and by thy mercies put me to confusion of face  here ned kneeled respectfully down for a blessing which his father silently called upon him with lifted hands and eyes he then raised him and sitting down took him fondly to his bosom thou art thou art my son my beloved son he cried my first and my last the only offspring of my bowels thou shall no more be a wanderer no more be a beggar my babe thrice blessed be our meeting and tenfold blessed thy future fortunes o that our lives my child might be made one whole oblation to him from whom this amazing salvation has come  by this time the nurses distemper was greatly abated though she still continued extremely low and feeble and did not seem to recollect except by faint glimmerings any matter that had passed mr fielding then proposed to take her to town to the physicians observing that there was room enough for her and ned in their carriage and as mrs fielding made no exception the coach was ordered to turn directly to the door  poor ned during this time was as a person who fluctuated between the dread of leaving known and certain enjoyments and the hopes of his possessing somewhat that he had not yet tasted  mr fielding then stepped up in a kind of quick rapture to mr fenton he caught him in his arms my dearest sir he cried i love i respect i revere you even next to my god what can i return you what shall i say to you all that i am or have sinks out of sight from your benefits  i am blessed my dear sir i am blessed beyond expression replied mr fenton in being made an humble instrument of happiness to a worthy man  o sir cried mr fielding what events next to miraculous we came to your door but we were not permitted to pass our carriage broke for the purpose you then told us of this foundling but what likelihood that among millions he should happen to be ours you then proposed an expedient for ascertaining the persons from whom he was kidnapped this expedient failed god however would discover him and had foreordained the means he set upon him an indubitable mark for the purpose none knew of this but his nurse and she has revealed it had any one of these many circumstances been wanting our child must have continued a stranger to us for ever indeed sir said mr fenton they are all concurring proofs that you are under the especial eye of providence but sir i fear we shall have a heavy loss of our friend ned for though he does not want his small faults he is a worthy hearted child and a very pleasant companion o sir cried mr fielding you and master fenton have a right to command both him and us at all times but come ned take leave for the present of your best friends  here ned with filling eyes stepped respectfully to mr fenton and kneeling before him took each of his hands and kissed them crying my father my father whereupon mr fenton tenderly raised him and pressing him affectionately to his bosom cried god be good to you my son and make you a blessing to your true parents and to all your kin  ned then turned to harry and taking him by both hands and looking him fondly in the face o master harry master harry he cried i never shall be able to say the word farewell to you my master harry i was hungry and you fed me i was naked and you clothed me i was a stranger and you took me in the whole world to me was fatherless and friendless when you were father and mother and a whole world of friends to me my true lord and master harry are you not my owner am i not your property your own hard bought bargain did you not purchase me with your stripes and with your precious blood and will you suffer me to be taken away from you my hearts master  here harry swallowing his passion as well as he was able clasped ned in his arms and cried my brother my brother my friend and brother for ever then turning to mr and mrs fielding and wiping his eyes i hope madam i hope sir says he that you will excuse my young friend here for his partiality to a family who have loved him long and very dearly in a little time to be sure he will love and respect you both above all the world though put all together though i grieve to part with him i heartily rejoice at his being found and acknowledged to be the child of such worthy parents and i hope i say that you will not be offended at his concern for parting with his old friends  no my noble creature cried mr fielding we are delighted at the proof that he gives of his gratitude and at the strength of his attachment where he has been so highly obliged  o sir o madam says ned kissing the hands of his parents did you but know the value of what i lose when i leave when i leave  and here he burst afresh into tears  mrs fielding then took ned in her arms and tenderly embracing him cried we do my love we do know the value of the family that you leave and it is the first and the dearest wish of my heart that we should all become as one family and as one household this angel here as you say is your rightful owner and we owe him more on that account than our whole fortune can pay and he shall have you as long and as often as ever he pleases but for this night my darling it would be very unkind not to go with your good nurse your true and loving mammy who has suffered so much for your sake and her case requires that we should take her immediately to the doctors  here ned acquiesced and having taken a weeping leave of all the family not forgetting the meanest servant in the house he stepped slowly into the coach sat down by his nurse and away they drove  as soon as the family of the fieldings were gone harry withdrew to his chamber and locked himself in while mr fenton went to enfranchise his late prisoner  he first returned her certificate to her and then presenting her with twenty guineas he bowed and made a motion with his hand to the door intimating that she was at liberty to depart when she thought proper  having looked several times with silence and surprise now at mr fenton and again at the money i should be very ill deserving of your bounty sir she said should i attempt any longer to impose upon you i am not deaf as you supposed it was only an artifice which i made use of when taken into custody to avoid answering questions that might have brought a worthy family into disgrace but you look so altogether the gentleman and the kind hearted christian that i think i ought to have no reserve of any kind toward you  be pleased then said mr fenton as far as prudence will allow to let me know who and what you are  i hope sir she replied that i am very far from being what i was otherwise i should be the very vilest of the vile wherefore if you will allow a weakly woman to sit i will tell you the whole of my short story with the same openness that i make confession of my sins to him from whom alone i can look for remission  my maiden name was fielding my father was a gentleman of large fortune and good repute he had by my mother a very worthy son who inherits his estate and a very unworthy daughter who now takes the shame of confessing her faults before you  my mother was one of the holiest of women and brought me up to the best of her power in her own principles and practice but she died when i was in the thirteenth year an age when the blood is in the tide of flow before i had acquired a due relish for my duty before the yoke of christ became easy or his burden delightsome  my father then provided me a governess a woman well skilled in french and needlework and other such shewy matters of accomplishment a woman also of much apparent modesty and decorum though inwardly of a debauched and lascivious disposition  there is nothing so pernicious to the breeding and morals of children as their being permitted to keep kitchen company where high fed husseys and pampered fellows form a hotbed of steaming sensuality and guilt  my governess though something elderly took a liking to my fathers clerk a modest young man whom however she had the art to seduce to her wanton purposes  in order to promote her intrigue in my fathers absence at evenings she used to procure collations and after we had eat and drank to propose plays and other matters of innocent merriment as she called them  the chief of our men servants was one guilliam rampant the butler a comely robust fellow and one in whom my father had placed great trust  one night as we were playing at hide and seek this man watched the place where i sought to conceal myself and coming softly and suddenly to me he caught me up under one arm and running with me to a distant apartment he there ruined me  a false shame did not permit me to say any thing of the matter and the villain had afterward the insolence to threaten me that if i did not admit him to further familiarities he would tell what had passed and expose me to the family  at length both the governess and i proved with child of which the housekeeper in private informed my father whereupon my governess was turned with infamy out of doors and i was locked up and confined in a waste room  on the third day of my imprisonment my father entered and having examined me with a stern though sedate severity on my knees and with a flood of tears i confessed the whole affair  the butler was then sent for guilliam said my father if you do not directly marry this strumpet i will hang you for a rape but if you marry her i will give you two hundred pounds to set you going in some poor way on condition that i never see the face of either of you any more  the last terms were immediately complied with a license was sent for we were married in my fathers presence the money was paid down and we were directly turned into the streets  upon this small fund and about a hundred and fifty pounds more which my husband had saved of his vails and wages he set up a gaming tavern to which there was great resort and as he was a very bold sensible and enterprizing man he became extremely agreeable to numbers of his customers among whom there were many persons of fortune and distinction  at length the time of my labor approached i lay for a fortnight in agonies that admitted of little intermission my child died within me and was brought into the world piecemeal  i languished for three months after my delivery without being able to quit my bed and the remembrance of the pangs and miseries that i endured caused me to vow within myself that i would never more have any commerce with mankind  on my recovery therefore i daily rejected the caresses of my husband and every night i bolted myself into my chamber whereupon he began to behave himself with great coldness and distance toward me and to frequent the company of common and lewd women  in about fourteen months after my marriage my husband had a run of dice against him whereby he lost to the amount of fifteen hundred pounds and as he had not wherewithal to discharge the full sum he determined at all events to pay to the last penny of his debts of honor as he called them hereupon he began to raise contributions on the public and after several very bold and successful exploits his person became notorious and he was taken from amidst his righthonourable associates at a gamingtable in london conveyed to newgate tried convicted and executed at tyburn  upon this all our substance was immediately seized by creditors or by the officers of the crown and i was turned into an unknown world without any thing to sustain me save a few shillings in my pocket and the single suit of clothes which i happened to have on my back  i forgot to tell you my dear sir that my worthy but afflicted father had died before this period and this ought to have been the greatest of afflictions to myself but the season of my feelings was not yet come and i barely dropped a slight tear without any sense of remorse for having been in all likelihood his principal executioner  as my brother was now the only person upon earth to whom i had any right to apply for support i accordingly went to his house with an anxious beating heart and sent him in a written state of my very deplorable case but his answer was that if ever i should again appear before his doors he would take me up as a vagabond and transport me to the plantations  wholly desperate by this disappointment and stimulated almost to frenzy my blood boiled in my veins the horrid thoughts of vengeance could alone assuage my raging spirit and i resolved to compass my ends by poison by dagger or any the speediest means for i looked upon my brother as a robber who had despoiled me of my title to my fathers affection and inheritance  for this accursed purpose it was necessary to get near him i sold my clothes and having disguised myself in the dress of a charwoman i engaged as a servant in a cellar over the way  from this place i observed an infant of about two years old who at times was brought to the door by the hand of his nurse and i learned that he was the only child of my brother and that the lives of his parents were wrapped up in him  here i conceived i had found an object on whom i might execute my revenge with better safety to my own person and greater torture to my adversary than by any other method that invention could supply i therefore couched on my watch like a lioness for her prey and spying the child alone i shot across the street caught him up in my arms and away i flew  i hastened with him as fast as i could till i reached the fields i then got under a ditch and stripped him of his gay raiment which i folded in a handkerchief and having cut in pieces an old petticoat and tacked it about him i made my way to a cabin where they sold small ale and spirits and there took up my lodging for the first night  i believe sir i am the greatest instance that ever was of the length to which human nature can go in reprobacy when abandoned of god and unvisited by his gracious motions in the heart the strong bent which my mother had given me to religion caused me only to recoil with the greater force and when my father cast me off i even reproached my god and was at enmity with him for having suffered me to fall into my first offense against virtue  i was yet urged and carried further down the hill of perdition by the example of the licentious set of profligates that daily and nightly frequented my husbands house insomuch that in time i began to relish their profaneness and my tongue as well as ear at length became accustomed to oaths and execrations a vice of all others the most unnatural most shocking and abhorred in our sex  in fine i became an alien and even an enemy to all goodness and i would willingly have been a party in any kind of wickedness save that of personal prostitution and this i avoided merely for fear of a second childbirth which i dreaded more than i dreaded the torments of hell  how pitiable then must have been the case of the unhappy infant who had fallen into my cruel gripe i often suffered him on purpose to weep for hunger and then would lash him for crying that i might please myself as it were with the miseries of my brother in the person of his child  for four years and nine months i led a wandering and mendicant life in which trade my little nephew grew very successful and useful to me so that i began to abate of my severity toward him detested by my relations and outcast from the world i cared for nothing but self and nightly indulged my appetite with the best victuals and liquor that my pocket could afford from the issues of my own petitions and of those of my fellow traveller  one day having passed through enfield where i had raised some petty contributions i spyed an infant on a bank at a distance from any house and instantly the project occurred of exacting the larger charities by his means i looked about and thinking that i was not observed i caught the child up and ran off with all my speed but i had not gone far when i heard a man shouting after me and perceived that i was pursued thereupon i cast down the child with my pouch of provisions and leaving little ned behind me also i made the best of my way through the opposite thicket  as my terrors continued i continued to run till i was all in a glow and faint with fatigue but still keeping forward though slower and slower god conducted me within sight of the parsonage house of mr catharines which i reached with much difficulty and then sunk away on the threshold  i knew nothing further of what passed till i found myself in a warm though coarse bed with one woman holding a bottle of salts to my nose and another presenting me with a cordial i looked about and found myself something revived but on the sight of some meat which was brought to me i again fainted  within some hours after i was seized with pains in all my bones and fell into a raging though intermitting fever mr catharines who was physician to the bodies as well as souls of all his flock visited and prescribed for me and had me attended with great humanity  on the third night i dreamed that an invisible hand came and seizing me by a single hair of my head hurried me aloft through the regions of the air till it held me right over a fiery gulf in the pinnacles of whose flames a variety of demons appeared to hover the horridness of whose figures was indescribable to ears of flesh and blood they all seemed to struggle toward me and to stretch forth their fangs to receive me while my husband guilliam rampant ascended swiftly in the midst and rushing up with a pair of sheers cut the hair that withheld me in twain so down i thought i fell and giving a great shriek i awakened to darkness and inexpressible horrors  though no light was in the room my conscious spirit supplied the office all my transgressions arose minutely and distinctly to memory they appeared substantially as so many fiends within me and round about me and i fell into an agony that threw me into a fit  i awoke again before morning but without any abatement of my terrors or desperation the former objects continued to present themselves before me and no longer able to support existence i groped about for a knife or other instrument of selfdestruction for i said to myself perhaps death may bring rest to the weary and overladen or at least afford some respite before the fearful judgment of final condemnation so finding no other means that suited my desperate purpose i grasped my neck in my hands and exerted my force to strangle myself but nature proved repugnant to the completion of an office against herself and i sunk from my agonies into a second fit  on the breaking of the day mr catharines entered but as the room was darkened i did not know who he was he approached my bed and taking hold of my hand he sighed and said you are very ill poor woman exceeding ill indeed you have more need of a physician for your soul than your body if you please then i will kneel down and pray with you and for you that god may receive your departing spirit  o no sir i cried i cannot pray even to hear a prayer would be worse than hell to me i have no god no savior they have long since departed from me i am a sinner to whom hope can never come omnipotence itself can do nothing for me i feel that if god would he cannot save me except he were to create me over again  and he can create you over again cried the good mr catharines even in this instant he can make you a new nature and a new creature he can save you from all your sins by an inward salvation by pouring the abundance of himself into your bosom  o sir i exclaimed you do not know how vile i am even now i am in hell the fiends have the property and possession of me o if any single soul were to suffer for everlasting what i suffered last night better it were that creation had never been  here i recounted to him my dream with the agonies that i felt and my attempt to destroy myself when the comforting saint cried out good hopes good hopes very excellent hopes indeed these are strong and blessed compunctions i see that the savior of sinners is determined not to lose you be of good cheer here take this julap to recruit your wearied spirits that you may be able to lay open the woundings of your soul to the ministering physician of your dear and loving lord  but do you think sir said i that there is any hope for me hope cried he there is assurance more stable than the marble foundations of the earth god is all love he is nothing but love he never rejected any that once turned unto him his incarnation his whole task and business upon earth his sufferings and crucifixion his agonies and death were chosen and embraced by him for the love and sake of sinners it is in the regions of sinning nepthali in the darkness and shadow of death that the light of the loving jesus delights to spring up but come my dear sister tell me who and what you are lay open with truth and honesty the manifold distempers of your sinsick soul your weakness your poverty your nakedness your pollutions your errors and your emptiness and he who shines in darkness will descend into you my sister and will be your strength and the riches of pardoning mercy to you and will cover your nakedness and purify your pollutions and turn your errors into rectitude and your emptiness into the fullness of the joy and glory of your god  here i made him a full recital of all the passages of my life as openly but much more minutely than i have done to your honor never was man so affected he groaned he sobbed aloud he wet his handkerchief with his tears as though it had been drenched in the river  as soon as i had concluded do you not know me then he cried breaking afresh into tears do you not know me mrs phaebe know you not marmaduke catharines your brothers tutor and your tutor the man from whose lips you used to imbibe instruction with so much avidity ah had i stayed nothing of this would have happened but your brother got me presented to a rich living here and so i left my vineyard and the fruits thereof unguarded oh that accursed rampant i left my lamb to the voracious and remorseless wolf  from your infancy mrs phaebe you were the darling of my affections the day did not seem to shine in which i saw you not your smiles cheered my spirit and your unaffected graces played round my heart  your brother too saw and approved my passion for you what happiness did he not propose to himself in our union we will be brothers he cried my catharines folding me fast in his arms we will be brothers in reality as well as inclination  but those blissful prospects soon vanished away you were seduced my daughter you were seduced from your duty from your god and your lover your brother writ me an account of your fatal falling away and i spent my nights in tears and my days in anguish  ah how you are altered even in person and aspect i could not have known you again sin has taken away the innocence and sweetness of your countenance and spread a cloudiness and stain in the place thereof but you are returned my child you are returned to virtue and piety to yourself and to your god and he will once more beautify you and make you as the kings daughter all glorious within and deck you with living saphirs even the morning stars of the preparation of the appearance of jesus  while the holy man spoke the nether millstone of my heart began to dissolve my agonies and terrors departed from me my breast began to heave with a kindly though sad emotion and a torrent of tears greatly eased my distemper both of body and mind  mr catharines as i afterward learned on hearing of my doleful miscarriage had vowed to himself in secret never to have commerce with womankind  a widowed lady however of large fortune and liberal education but much advanced in years happened to reside in the neighborhood she was first caught by the simple though affecting piety of his discourses from the pulpit she visited and was visited by him she was then further charmed by the luster of his sentiments the sanctitude of his manners and the sweetness of his disposition sir said she to him one day i am by birth a foreigner and neither have children nor any relation of my blood in this kingdom who on my decease may put in for a title to my fortune i blush not to tell you that if i were young and beautiful you are the man of the world whom i would have chosen for my husband but my defects take nothing from your great merits you are as precious in my eyes as if i were deserving of you and i am desirous of making yo umy own for life provided you swear to me before the nuptial knot is tied that my fortune my company and my obedience are all that ever you will require from me in right of our marriage you shall live and shall be as an only son to me and i will have for you at once all the duty of a wife and the tenderness of a mother  i am not insensible of what gibers may say respecting the impropriety of certain appetites at my years but i trust by my conduct to disabuse their opinion and to cause all occasion of stumbling in my neighbor to cease  in the mean time my two capital prospects will be compassed by this scheme the one of giving myself a legal title to your company the other of giving you a legal title to my fortune  a proposal for such a species of marriage answered exactly to mr cathariness vow of celibacy the lady though considerably upward of sixty shone in all the graces and attractions of youth excepting only those personal allurements to concupiscence toward which mr catharines had resolved on an aversion he could therefore form no rational objection to the scheme and within a few weeks they were privately married  while i wept as i told you sir under a kindly remorse for my manifold offenses mr catharines kneeled down and poured forth his prayers beside me with an elocution so warm and so deeply affecting as entered and searched through my heart and my reins and seemed to tear out by the roots all the evil that was in me  as soon as he had ended and that i had thanked him with words half suffocated for the graciousness of his consolations mrs catharines came in would you then sir said she would you monopolize all the charities will you not suffer a sister near the throne of grace who may assist in the under services to the servants of our master  my dear said he tenderly i was about to request your presence here lies on the bed of sickness and perhaps of death the daughter of my patron the sister of my friend and once the dearest object of my affections and prospects for life pray order a chamber for her more becoming her station and my debts to her family  she instantly went out with alacrity and without reply and within a few minutes several female servants entered who gently wrapping me in the clothes wherein i lay conveyed me to a bed ready sheeted and warmed that stood in a small but decent apartment  as soon as i was placed mrs catharines came up and stooping tenderly kissed me and said god be very gracious unto you my daughter  here i was treated with an attention and delicacy that joined with my evil deeds to put me to utter shame however i began to recover apace and within a few days was able to sit up  on the seventh night i had a very singular dream or vision which will never depart my memory and which i trust through life and death will preserve its happy and comforting influence upon me  methought i walked with vast crowds of fine and merry people along a road of a gentle and pleasant descent made easy to the foot like the mall in london  on a sudden my husband guilliam rampant stood beside me i surveyed him with a delight that i had never known before he seemed to surpass in beauty all the persons around us his garments were embellished with gold and gems and his countenance shone with a wonderful luster  come miss phaebe said he gracefully taking me by the hand come with me to yonder paradise where i will weave a garland for you of never fading flowers and treat you to fruits of a heavenly flavor immediately a vast garden opened its blooms and incomparable beauties to my quickened imagination the odours thereof perfumed the air far and wide and the burdened trees reached forth fruits of irresistible temptation  my husband then plucked and gave me to eat of the clusters of the grape and apples of the pine which i seized and devoured with an intemperate relish when happening to look down i perceived that he had got the legs and hoofs of a goat and it instantly occurred that he could be no other than the tempter of our first parents terrified almost to death i did not dare to speak out but lifting up my heart in a secret prayer he and his paradise immediately vanished  at once i found myself in a vast and dreary wilderness whose trees were barren of fruits and the brambles of berries through which there was no path and from whence there was no outlet go on what side i would i had scarce made my way through one thicket when i was presented with another till being spent with fatigue i despaired of any deliverance and sat me down to die  soon after methought mr catharines approached in mean and beggared apparel but with a majestic and stern countenance wretch he cried are you at length come to a knowledge of the evil of your ways are you now come to a sense of your vile and forlorn estate do you find at last that i alone can be your stay and your helper so saying he seized me by the hand and his touch filled my frame with confidence and delight we rose into the air we moved together over a boundless tract of desert from whence the lions roared and the wolves bayed at us at length we alighted at the entrance of a narrow path that led up the ascent of a mountainous country the nearer side was covered with clouds and blasted by tempest through which the farther part seemed to gleam with a faint radiance that promised the rising day  courage said my conductor we must ascend this mountain in spite of all opposition in spite of the toils the difficulties and dangers the pains calamities distresses and discouragements of the way no obstacles i cried shall appal or discourage me i will rejoice in distresses and pains while i have you by my side  hereupon i felt wonderful strength and alacrity i ran up the ascent with a willing and eager pace and proposed in a few minutes to reach the top but alas i was widely out in my account the way became straiter and steeper and rougher i began to fail through fatigue and the edged flints tore my feet and marked my footsteps with blood ah sir i cried this is very grievous indeed peace said he it is very salutary these flints are your kindest friends your truest physicians and the wounds that they give your body will be more than the balm of gilead to the healing of your soul i then summoned all my powers and proceeded though with much anguish which often compelled me to lean with all my weight upon my companion  at length we came to a pass that was thick set and interwoven with briars and thorns and seeing no way i made a full stop good cheer cried my guide this must also be traversed there is no quailing now you must endure to the end my daughter the thorn was pronounced a curse to the first adam and his posterity but your second adam has made it a wreath of living brightness these accordingly are appointed to twist the garland of your blessedness and to make you a partaker of their crown of eternal glory  revived by this promise i rushed into the midst and struggled to get forward though screaming with anguish but when the thorns rent my skin and entered into my body and soul and lodged their stings within me i could endure no longer but casting myself on my conductor o that death that death i cried would put an end to my sufferings he then turned and smiled upon me and taking me under his arm bore me harmless through the remainder then seating me on a bank he placed himself beside me  while i sat still panting with pain and fatigue he bent forward and pulled off his sandals i then saw the large wounds that the spike had made my spirit instantly told me that it was my lord himself under the form of his minister i threw myself prostrate before him my bosom opened wide and taking hold of his feet covered with dust as they were i pressed them to my heart and would have thrust them into my soul when on their touch i felt such an ecstatic transport that if i had not awoke my body could no longer have retained my spirit it must instantly have issued to him who breathed it  the consolation of this dream greatly strengthened and restored me and i hastened to get up that i might delight myself with serving the servants of my benefactors  when mrs catharines rose she found me busied in the basest employments of the kitchen she looked astonished why my dear she cried would you demean yourself in this manner o madam i replied i beseech you to leave me to my own conscience it tells me that even this office is much too honorable for me  when breakfast was ready mr catharines came in from his mornings walk of meditation as he entered i cast myself before him and clasping his knees cried how blessed are the feet of him who brings good tidings of salvation to sinners but above all blessed is he who bears in his own person the image and impression of the prince of peace being much surprised and abashed at my manner of salutation he demanded the reason of it and i told my dream whereupon they were so affected that they both shed tears of tender congratulation  i have already told you sir that mr catharines was physician to the bodies as well as souls of all his parishioners i might have added to all the country about him  for this purpose he provided a little kind of apothecarys shop where he kept all manner of drugs for the sick as well as matters of surgery for the sore and the wounded on these occasions i became his principal deputy and assistant i was myself often astonished at the effects of my application in this way i scarce remember an instance wherein i failed of success a spirit of healing seemed to accompany my walks i have frequently cured those who were given up as irrecoverable by the doctors and surgeons and i never had such heartfelt delight as when on my knees i bathed the feet of the sick or washed the ulcers of the beggar for in them methought the great physician of sinsick souls lay before me who had healed my own woundings and done away my transgressions  i should have told you sir that when mr catharines heard that i had stolen and dropped my little nephew the only child of his best and most beloved friend he that very day dispatched a number of emissaries to enfield and throughout all the adjacent country with orders to make the most diligent search and enquiry after him but alas all our pains and solicitudes both then and afterward proved fruitless this cost me day and night secret deluges of tears and served to imbitter the happiest life that otherwise perhaps could be spent upon earth  about three months ago mrs catharines began to decline and peaceably dropped like overripe fruit into the lap of ourgeneral mother  mr catharines had often desired my permission to write to my brother in my favor but conscious of the injury that i had done him in the person of his child i had hitherto declined the proposal at length however i determined to throw myself at his feet and confess my guilt though without any prospect of obtaining his pardon perhaps said i he may think on some more successful means for the discovery of his son than we have yet hit upon my benefactor approved of my resolution he wrote a letter to my brother by me and within a few days i set out in his chaise for london  on the road i took it into my head once more to make trial of my brothers nature and to present myself before him as an object of his charity for this purpose i dismissed the chaise at st albans i also sent back my little baggage with an account of my project in a note to mr catharines and retained nothing but this poor garb that i have on  on that night i was taken suddenly and extremely ill of a cholic and could keep nothing on my stomach for the six following days i sent to london for a physician who attended and prescribed for me and by the time i was able to creep abroad what with fees to the doctor the apothecarys bill and a still more exorbitant bill from the landlord i had scarce three sixpences left to bear my charges to the city with that sum however i set forward on foot but finding myself still very weak and sickly i was tempted to repine for not having brought more money from home but again i remembered that my master had told me that sufferings were the best friends and physicians to such a sinner i was therefore content and pleased to be once more reduced to the lowest state of beggary and after three days sore travel god was pleased to conduct me to your charitable door  this sir is the letter which my friend wrote in my favor to my brother you see it is open but before you read it i ought to account to you for some touches of uncommon tenderness which mr catharines has expressed toward me  some weeks after the funeral of his lady he and i stood chatting in the front of the house the evening was exceeding pleasant and the maids sat singing and milking the cows before us when the great bull suddenly tearing up the ground with his feet ran furiously at his master on seeing him approach i shrieked and rushed into the house but observing that mr catharines did not follow i turned and ran as precipitately out again there i saw that the terrible creature had pinned him up between his horns against the wall at which he butted with all his force  then casting fear aside i sprung up and seizing the bull by one of his horns would have torn him away from my dear protector but my strength not availing i caught his ear in my mouth and bit it through and through while i endeavored to tear out his eyes with my nails in the mean time a little favorite mastiff scarce bigger than two fists came happily out and leaping up caught the monstrous animal by the nose whereupon he gave a hideous roar and flinging away ran kicking and leaping about the yard  i remembered nothing more till i awoke from a swoon and perceived that mr catharines sat beside me he held one of my hands which he had washed with his tears and which at times he pressed to his lips and again to his bosom  when he had prevailed upon me to swallow a spoonful of cordial o my phaebe my phaebe he cried you have this day offered up your precious life a victim for the preservation of mine and from this day forward my life and all that i am is your property for ever but tell me my phaebe whence could you get in a moment such astonishing intrepidity how attain to the power of acting against nature the constitutional terrors and delicacies of your sex ah sir i replied the book of life tells us that perfect love casts fear away  from that time mr catharines earnestly pressed me to marriage my first and my last and my only love he would say you know that in womankind i can love nothing but you your whole image your every feature is impressed upon my soul i am already wedded to them they are inseparable from my being why then do you wish to have me cast forth from my species as a withered branch without any kind of fruit without one the least little one to bind us up together and carry us down to posterity o sir i would then say let not our nuptials be sullied by any gloom or regret let me first be reconciled if possible to my brother and then dispose of me as you please it is your right so to do  i thank you madam said mr fenton i thank you for your very affecting and still more edifying narrative and i will endeavor to recompense you for the trouble that i have given you by being the bearer of very happy tidings your little nephew has lived with me almost ever since you lost him he has received an education becoming his family and was this day discovered and restored to his parents  my god my christ she exclaimed what a wonder is here how are blind and erring mortals wilfully blind and wilfully erring deserving of such a clue as this to guide them my nephew alive and well discovered and restored this very day to his true parents  i am confounded i am crushed to the center beneath the weight of thy benefits o thou overflowing fountain of mercy and grace  now madam said mr fenton now it is at your election to reveal or suppress the affair respecting your nephew i know sir she replied you proposed this only to try me i desire no advantage from fraud or disguise and could i be so base this letter as you will find would detect and betray me  mr fenton then unfolded the letter and read as follows  to edward fielding esquire friend and brother of my soul i have often reproved and always detested that cruel and impious custom of casting off our friends or kindred on account of their errors or frailty or even of their fall from honor this custom is more especially condemnable and pernicious when it affects the more tender and more pitiable sex the indiscretion of their nearest parents begins the alarm the world follows and increases the cry the wretches like marked deer are driven forth to the hounds and must speedily become a prey to famine and death or for ever be precluded from any return to virtue  had you my dear brother had you given that charity to your only sister which you slightly throw to a common beggar you might have saved her soul alive and have continued a happy parent of a promising son at this day she resented your treatment she rent your child from you you merited the motive but i am grieved at the consequence  as god has been pleased wonderfully to restore your sister to virtue she would rejoice to restore your son to you but it is not in her power he strayed from her within some miles of this place we have used all possible means to recover him but in vain and his loss has cost her seas of tears and years of anguish  receive her then as a precious pearl from the bottom of the deep as a casket of gold and jewels recovered from shipwreck she was dead but is alive again she was lost but is found receive her then i say as an angel of god sent on purpose to effect your own salvation  i know not how it comes to pass that great sinners often become the greatest of saints and in a year a month a day exceed in growth and stature a long life of leisurely righteousness their bows as it should seem being strongly bent the adverse way they dart forward with the greater strength and rapidity it is even so with our precious phaebe she is become a gentle flame of the divine loves and charities while she stands upon earth and bends in her lowliness beneath all creatures the moon of changeable things is put under her feet she treads as it were upon the stars of the galaxy and i behold at a distance and revere the glory of her steps  receive her then i say again as the dearest boon and blessing that heaven can bestow but o restore her to me give her to me according to promise that she may assist to conduct me to that kingdom of little children whereof she is a blessed inhabitant at this very day  yours etc m catharines   you see sir said mrs phaebe smiling you see that mr catharines must be a lover by the extravagance of his praise i see madam said mr fenton that he deservedly loves and greatly deserves also to be beloved but madam if you will be ruled by my advice you will stay here till your brother shall call upon me which i expect he will do in a very little time mean while i will introduce you to a sistersaint who has been long tried and refined in the hottest furnace of affliction  the very next morning mr fielding rode to the door attended only by a single servant as soon as he had saluted mr fenton and sat down he took out a note for  000 l and presented it to him you must not refuse sir said he to relieve my distress by accepting this in part of what i owe you i can spare it without the smallest inconvenience i have lately recovered a tract of land that lies contiguous to mr catharines the worthy man of whom you heard me speak yesterday so that i shall soon have the pleasure of taking possession of a considerable accession to my fortune and at the same time the greater pleasure of embracing so very dear a friend this sum sir said mr fenton comes very seasonably to the relief of a person for whom i have conceived an extraordinary esteem and affection a person who is entitled to my best service and who may also be entitled to your further munificence so saying mr fenton rose went to the door took mrs phaebe by the hand and leading her toward her brother this sir said he is the gentlewoman of whom i spoke and whom i recommend to your tenderest regards  mr fielding looked earnestly and inquisitively at his sister changed color and for a while sat mute with astonishment when suddenly rising and stepping hastily to her he clasped her in his arms and cried aloud my phaebe my dearest phaebe my long lost long sought my long lamented sister have i found you at last are my prayers at length heared and are you once more restored to my bosom my sister ah what must have been your sufferings what have i not suffered myself from the stinging recollection of the barbarity of my behavior but at the time that you applied to me i was exasperated against you by being told you had turned out a common prostitute and from your connection with that reprobate to whom my father had unhappily married you i was ready to believe the worst that could be reported concerning you pardon me however my phaebe do but promise me your pardon and i will endeavor to compensate for my injurious treatment of you  here the sister dropped on her knees and breaking into tears and sobs replied you want no pardon my brother you never wronged me  i deserved all sorts of evils they were due to my transgressions  but i have injured you i fear past forgiveness my brother  it was i who stole your little darling who robbed you of your only child and caused you so many years of sorrow and bitterness  i deserved it i deserved it at your hands exclaimed mr fielding let us then exchange forgiveness my phaebe for our child is restored to us and we remember our sorrows no more so saying his eyes filled and tenderly raising his sister he took her again to his bosom  mr fenton wholly melted by this passionate scene took them jointly in his arms and then silently seated them opposite to each other  my sister said mr fielding you have promised me your pardon before you were acquainted with the extent of my faults our dear father in his last illness made me sit by his side when heaving a deep sigh he thus begun i fear i fear my son that i have greatly wronged your sister i grieve at heart that i had her married to that ruffian rampant with a little less of severity and more of tender admonition she might have arisen from her fall she might have returned to virtue and honor her errors might have been forgotten perhaps restored to rectitude she might have been less wretched and my days might have been longer she was young she was artless and obvious to seduction i myself joined to betray her by that she wolf whom i appointed the guardian of my lamb perhaps as she affirmed her inclination no way concurred with the force that was offered her we ought as far as possible to have covered her shame shame only serves to bronze over a bashful countenance and make it altogether shameless alas my child all things appear quite different at my death from what they did during my lifetime and the pride of blood and the resentment for injured gentility give place to the calls of nature and the feelings of humanity  i intended your sister five thousand pounds but by my will i have cut her off with a shilling lest the villain her husband should come in for any share of our substance wherefore i leave you in my place at once the father the brother and the guardian of my dear child  and here his bursting tears prevented another word  as soon as he was more composed he proceeded i adjure you my son in the name of our common father in the name of that god to whom i am going i adjure you i say to keep a constant watch over the conduct of your still precious sister my son and if such a one may be found to keep in fee some discreet and pious matron who may insinuate into her acquaintance and gain her confidence and preserve her from a further progress in the paths of vice for o the soul of my wrecked child at this hour is infinitely precious in my eyes  i further enjoin you that in case the reprobate her husband should perish by sword or pistol or by the gallows as is most likely you will pay your sister the sum of three thousand pounds but gradually at first as her necessities may crave and the whole on your assurance of her return to virtue  while her brother was speaking mrs phaebe had thrown her apron over her face and by her groans and passionate sobs prevented his proceeding at length she exclaimed wretch parricide that i am i have cut short the sacred life of him who brought me to the world you then loved me my father you still continued to love me though i knew it not and i have murdered the kindest the tenderest of parents but i will die to make atonement i will not survive you my father  mr fielding then arose and stepped affectionately to his sister and taking her in his arms and mixing his tears with hers endeavored to console her you did not my dearest sister you did not murder him he cried you accuse yourself of faults of which you are no way guilty our father was aged and labored under a complication of disorders that must shortly have put a period to all that was mortal in him be comforted then i say be comforted my sister  when mr fielding had resumed his seat and that the violence of his sisters passion had subsided he looked earnestly and tenderly at her i will said he my phaebe at some other time account to you for the motive of my barbarity toward you and how i was imposed upon by the very person whom i kept in pay to give me intelligence concerning you but tell me how it comes to pass that in my life i never saw you look so charmingly even during your infant years you never had such a sweet simplicity such a heavenly childishness of countenance as you now have it is said mr fenton because she is the kings daughter she is all glorious within and the loveliness of her spirit informs and shines through her aspect  but here is a known character that will fully clear up the matter  and so saying he presented him with the letter from mr catharines when at the sight of the superscription mr fielding gave an exclamation of surprise  then unfolding he read it in deep silence but by fits and interruption frequently putting and long holding his handkerchief to his eyes  as soon as he had finished  yes yes my dear catharines my brother he cried the wish of my heart shall be accomplished for us both you shall have your phaebe restored to you and she shall be restored to you with benjamins portion even a double portion  but o my god how wonderful how miraculous is all this to have my only child and my only sister at once restored to me by one and the same hand teach me teach me mr fenton by some new method of gratitude to express a part of the sense of what i owe you  you have already sir cried mr fenton done and said by much too much upon that head and have thereby given me great pain instead of gratification the payment that i get is a treasure hidden from all men save him to whom it is given i will not however do you the offense to return you your bill but shall dispose of it in a manner that i trust will be nearly as equitable mean while my dear friend i most cordially congratulate you on the signal evidences that have been given of the favor of your god to you and of his watchful and intending providence over you and yours i suppose you will soon set out with your amiable sister here on your visit to your friend and brother the worthy mr catharines i shall heartily pray for a blisful issue to the union of the sainted pair and i request you to favor me with a call on your way  within an hour after mr fielding set off for london on horseback and harry accompanied his sister in mr fentons postchaise upon a short visit to his friend ned  as soon as they were departed mr fenton took paper and wrote the following letter to mr catharines  reverend and dear sir allow a stranger but a very warm lover of yours to felicitate you with his whole heart on the success of affairs our precious phoebe was received with transport by her brother and you cannot be more impatient than he is for your union he generously presented me with the enclosed bill for  000 l merely because god had appointed me an humble instrument for doing him some little matter of service though i determined not to accept of any part thereof yet i dreaded to grieve him by an avowed refusal i therefore restore it to you and your phaebe as a matter of equity next to that of returning it to himself it is surely full as proper that your family should take charge of that wherewith providence had been pleased to entrust them as that i should be encumbered with the disposal thereof and indeed my dear sir i am already burdened with more trusts of this nature than i fear i shall be able duly to account for  that your heart may always continue where your true treasure is already laid up is the wish of dear sir etc  when he had folded and sealed his letter he took bills from his pocketbook to the amount of   00 l and on harrys return from london presented them to him here my dear said he here is what will enable you to be more than just to your engagements it will enable you to be generous also and i desire my harry in matters of charity that you may never stint the sweet emotions of your heart for we have enough my child and we are but the stewards of the bounty of our god  here harrys speech was stopped but his silence was more eloquent than a thousand harangues he suddenly threw his arms about his dear dada and hiding his face in his bosom he there vented the tears of that pleasure love and gratitude with which he found himself affected  on the afternoon of the following day harry and arabella went to drink tea with the widow neighbourly who received them with a countenance that spoke an uncommon welcome some other company had arrived before them and rose on their entrance when all were again seated mrs neighbourly very affectionately questioned harry concerning his dada  on hearing the name of master fenton an elderly gentlewoman started pray madam said she eagerly is this master fenton the son of that noble gentleman who lives on the hill he is madam said mrs neighbourly my god exclaimed the stranger can this suckling be the father of the orphan and the widow is this he who goes about turning sorrow into joy who wipes the tears from the afflicted and heals the broken of heart permit me then thou beloved child of the father which is in heaven permit me to approach and throw myself at the feet of my preserver  so saying she rose with a rapturous motion and dropping at harrys knees she clasped his legs and kissed his feet before he could prevent her  poor harry much to be pitied sat astonished abashed and distressed to the last degree at length recollecting and disengaging himself with difficulty my dear madam he cried you hurt me greatly what have i done that you should put me to so much pain  babe of my heart she cried i am the wife of your vindex your own vindex whom you redeemed from beggary and slavery whom you restored to his wretched partner whom you restored to his infant daughter all pining and perishing apart from each other but now united by you my angel in joy and thanksgiving  here her words were suffocated and throwing herself back in her chair she was not ashamed to give way to her tears and putting her handkerchief to her face she vented her passion aloud  harry then rising and going tenderly to her put his arms about her and kissed her forehead and then her lips you owe me nothing my dear mrs vindex said he i am still greatly in your debt i was the very naughty boy who brought your misfortunes upon you but i am willing to make you amends and that will do me a great pleasure instead of the punishment which i deserve  the teatable was now laid and mrs vindex grew more composed when her husband entered leading his daughter by the hand a very pretty little girl of about six years old harry instantly sprung up and running and throwing himself with a great leap upon him he hung about his neck crying how glad i am to see you my dear mr vindex boy of boys cried vindex am i so blessed as to have you once more in my arms  the company then rose and saluted mr vindex and congratulated him on his return to his ancient habitation but harry took him aside and having cautioned him in a whisper not to take any notice of what should pass he stole a bill for   0 l into his hand saying softly it is good first to be honest so there is what i owe you and here also is a small matter for your daughter i did not know till now that we had such a sweet little charge in our family so saying he slipped to him another bill of  0 l and then turning from him stepped carelessly to his seat as though nothing had happened  mean time the astonished vindex was greatly oppressed he did not dare to offend harry by any open intimation of his recent bounty and yet he could feel no ease till the secret should be disclosed he therefore stole softly to the back of our heros chair where unperceived of harry he displayed the bills to the company beckoning at the same time in a way that forbad them to take any notice then raising his hands over his head and lifting his eyes toward heaven he blessed his benefactor in a silently ardent ejaculation and taking an empty seat joined in with the company  while they were in chat the little susanna slipped unnoticed from beside her mamma and veering over toward harry she went on one side and then on the other and surveyed him all about then coming closer she felt his clothes and next his hands in the way as it were of claiming acquaintance with him at length looking fondly up to his face she lisped and said me voud kiss oo if oo voud ask me indeed then said harry me vill kiss oo fedder oo vill or no and so catching her up on his knee he pressed her to his bosom and kissed her over and over again  you all see cried mr vindex it is not one of the elders with whom our susanna has fallen in love my sweet babe cried mrs vindex her little heart instinctively led her to her best friend to the one of all living who best deserved her love miss susanna said mrs clement put me in mind of some very delicate lines in milton respecting our virgin mother for she also refused to kiss the loveliest man that ever was created at least till she was asked   and though divinely brought yet innocence and virgin modesty her virtue and the conscience of her worth that would be wooed and not unsought be won not obvious nor obtrusive but retired the more desirable it is happy said mrs neighbourly for our weakly and overaffectionate sex that god has been pleased to fix a monitor within us who struggles against our inclinations who fights against our affections and is with difficulty won over to acquiesce in our desires i know not else what might become of the most of womankind  but then said mrs vindex are we not rather to be pitied that even when our propensities are warrantable we are prohibited by custom from giving any intimation thereof to the object while the licentious reprobate man roves and riots at large and unreproved beyond the pale over which it is treason for us to look  i do not pity you ladies said mr vindex i do not at all pity you on account of any restraints that custom has laid you under respecting chastity or its environs called decorum the chastity of woman is the only basis upon which the order honor and peace of the world can be built it twists the sacred and endearing chord of society without it there could be no amity no brotherhood upon earth but then surely there is much respect and tenderness due to those from whom such advantages are derived whereas i have observed on the contrary that the most amiable of your sex are generally mated to tyrants to men who being born and appointed their protectors pervert every end of nature and duty and treat with injury contempt and insult the gentle saints whom they should have cherished with their most respectful endearments  the question yet occurs said arabella whether your devils of husbands find us angels or make us such tyrants are like files they serve to smooth and polish whatever they are applied to i was once in company with a man who was called the saintmaker he had married five shrews in succession and made grizels of every one of them before they died  but pray ladies said harry are there no tyrants among the wives i lately took a walk to tower hill and growing hungry i turned in to a little shop of groceries a slender skinny woman of about four foot high stood behind the counter and taking out a sixpence i threw it on the board and desired her to give me the value in almonds and raisins she had scarce weighed my merchandise when a huge jolly looking quaker came up to the hatch door but seemed fearful of opening it the moment the little woman had cast her eye toward him she exclaimed in a shrill and exasperated accent art thee there thou rogue thou hangdog thou gallowsfaced vagabond when gathering up the whole dignity and importance of his person and clapping a hand on each side he cried with an undaunted air  i tell thee mary i fear thee not  ah thou villain she vociferated dares thee then appear in my presence get thee back to thy fellows and husseys on whom thee spendest my substance still however he kept his ground and courageously repeated  i tell thee mary i fear thee not  not fear me sirrah sirrah not fear me says she we shall see that in a twinkling so saying she whipped up the measuring yard and skudding round the counter she flew to the door but he was already vanished as fast as his fat sides would let him and to tell you the truth ladies there was something so authoritative and tremendous in the little bodys voice and manner that i was glad to get out and to skamper after him  the company laughed heartily and mr vindex added i forget the heros name a great general he was and i think a frenchman he won every battle abroad but was sure to be beaten in his turn also as often as he returned home to his wife  well said hercules and the distaff cries harry but to the point the bravest man i know is one peter patience a currier who lives in the suburbs my tutor and i were walking one day through islington when we perceived the likelihood of a scuffle at a distance  as we approached we saw one man making up with great fury to another who would have avoided him and who retiring backward across the street parried his blows and kept him off as well as he could his enraged adversary would then have closed in upon him but grasping his shoulder with a long and very strong arm he still held his enemy aloof who nearly spent all his efforts and blows in the air  never did i see so living a representation of heaven and of hell as was visible in the faces of those two men the muscles of the one were frightfully distorted his eyes shot fire and his mouth frothed with madness while the countenance of the other was as a lake in a summers evening that shows heaven in its bosom and reflects all the beauties of nature around it  be quiet ben he said you know that i would not hurt you you know that i love you what a fool the man makes of himself are you not sensible that i could demolish you with a single blow but i cannot find in my heart to do it be quiet ben i say i see you want to vex me but i will not be vexed by you my dear ben  while the gentle peter was thus expostulating with his exasperated friend mrs patience as it should seem had seen all that passed from an upper casement and flying down stairs and rushing out at the door she seized her husband behind by the hair of his head and tore and cuffed away at a terrible rate  poor peter finding himself thus between two fires gave a slight trip to his male assailant who instantly fell with his shoulder against the pavement and rising with difficulty limped homeward muttering curses all the way  then peter turning meekly to the lady mistress of his house gatty my love says he what have i done to provoke you  o she cried you mean spirited harehearted milkliverd poltroon i will teach you what it is to suffer every fellow to pommel you  sirrah sirrah and still she cuffed i will have you tied down at the foot of the market cross with notice on your breast for all who pass to p  s upon you  then quite angry to see the man so abused to whom i had taken such a fancy i rushed in between man and wife and seized mrs patience by both her hands but wrenching one of them from me she gave me a round cuff on the side of my head i was however too well used to cuffs to matter that much and so catching one of her hands in both of mine i gave her a pluck to me and a foot at the same time and laid her on the broad of her back in the kennel  my friend peter looked quite astonished at this and fearing what might happen to me on the rising up of his wife he tucked me like a gizzard under the wing of a turkey and off he scoured with me down the street while mr clements also made pretty nimbly after us for fear as i suppose that mrs patience when on her legs might take him for one of our company  as soon as we had turned a corner and were out of harms way honest peter set me down my friend says i if you would be advised by me you will not be in a mighty hurry to get back to your wife i see a house of entertainment yonder and i wish to be further acquainted with you adad said he you are the boldest little body that ever i knew you performed a feat to day that made me tremble for you had any other man though used my wife so  but i pass that matter over i see youre too great a hero to be threatened by any one and i should consider that you did what you did for my sake  so saying we all went into a sort of a tavern and being shown to a little parlour i called for a pint of whitewine  as soon as we were seated i took my new acquaintance very lovingly by the hand my dear friend said i i have conceived a great respect and fondness for you and should be glad to know who and what you are i am a currier by trade sir and my name is peter patience you are patience itself indeed said mr clement but your wife as i think has taken the whole trade of the currier into her own hands  peter laughed and replied she is a dear and a sweet girl as ever lay by the side of a man and she loves me as she loves her own soul her blows were sweet blows to me they were the blows of her affection for though i did not matter the strokes of my friend benjamin a single philip yet every one of them went to her heart and she wanted to frighten me from ever taking the like again  but pray says i how happened the quarrel between you and your friend benjamin as you call him why there it is too said peter he also beat me out of his downright and true hearted kindness to me  as this is holiday in the afternoon among us tradefolk ben testy invited me to share of a can of flip at the cat and bagpipes over the way just as we sat down peter says he i am told that your gatty is with child i believe it may be so says i i am glad of it peter with all my heart and so now remember that i bespeak myself gossip why that may happen says i just as matters shall turn out if the child is a boy you shall be one of the godfathers and welcome but if it is a girl this cannot be for my uncle geoffry has already engaged himself and i have some expectations from him and so says he you refuse to admit me for your gossip if it is a girl says i you see that i cannot o he cried i had forgot i was a rascal for proposing it youre of high blood have high relations and so scorn to have connexions with a poor tradesman like me that is not the case indeed my dear ben but  damn your dears says he i will have no more of them you are a covetous scoundrel and value money more than love well says i but will you be patient will you hear reason my friend friend friend says he my curse upon all such friendships i see into you now youre an ungrateful unloving coldhearted villain and i would sooner be godfather to the child of the turk so saying he struck at me and repeated his blows across the table but as i saw that his choler was enflaming more and more i got up and retreated merely intending to defend myself till his passion should be spent upon me but you saw what happened gentlemen which i am heartily sorry for as i fear that my poor dear fellow is much hurt  well said my tutor i have heard many definitions and many disputes concerning the word courage but i never saw the thing itself till this day pray mr peter were you never angry scarce ever sir that i remember at least on my own account for i do not fear any man that steps upon earth and what is it then that should make me angry a man may be angry said mr clement from other motives sure besides that of fear god himself can be angry and yet he cannot possibly fear  i am feelingly assured sir replied the valiant peter that god was never angry in his whole life and that is a long time that has neither beginning nor ending dont you believe the gospel says mr clement the scripture assures us in a hundred places of the anger of god against impenitent sinners i am the son of a clergyman sir said peter and mayhap could quote scripture as well as another the scriptures were written for man but how should man understand them if they were not written according to his own language and to his own passions i will ask you a question sir can you be angry at a mite or a worm which you can crush into nothing at pleasure i think not said my tutor no certainly said peter because you cannot fear a thing that has not power to offend you now all the world is but as a worm or mite to god and neither men nor angels can disturb or affect him with any thing except delight on their acceptance of that happiness which he desires to give to all his creatures  ay but says mr clement you see that gods anger and indignation was so great against sin that nothing could satisfy for it save the death of his beloved son ay but says peter the scripture which you quote tells you that it was not his anger but his love that sent him to us for god so loved the world a very sinful world indeed that he gave his only begotten son to take his death upon the cross and i am as fully assured as i am of my own being that the same gracious god who has already redeemed poor sinners would willingly redeem the poor devils also if they could but find in their hearts to desire his salvation  here catching and clasping his hand my dear peter says i i embrace and wish from my heart that your doctrine may be true i have many tutors mr peter and my dada pays them all with pleasure for the instructions that they give me tell me then mr peter what must he give you for the lesson which you have taught me what lesson my hero a very precious lesson says i a lesson that will always teach me to despise myself for a coward whenever i shall be angry  peter then sprung up without speaking a word and hugged and clasped and kissed me with all his affections then plucking a button from the upper part of my coat i will accept of this token my darling says he and will look at it many a time in the day for your sake  but mr peter says i i think it would be my advantage to keep up an acquaintance with you and this cannot be so well done while your dear gatty is angry with me you must therefore promise me to carry a token to her also as an olive branch of that peace which i want to be made between us i will my love says he i never refuse to give or accept the favors of a friend you must be upon honor then not to reject what i offer you i am upon honor he said  i then slipped something into his hand at which he looked and looked again and then cried out from the overflowings of a good and grateful heart you are either of the blood royal or ought to be so for the man was very poor though so very sensible and well descended and so he looked upon a little as a great matter  here harry closed his narration and all the company gathered about him and nearly smothered him with their caresses in which little susanna came in for her full share  on the following day harry introduced his friend vindex and family to his dear dada who received them with a graciousness that soon dispelled that awkward diffidence and humbling sense of obligations under which the late unhappy preceptor apparently sunk  as soon as it was known abroad that mr vindex enjoyed the patronage and good countenance of mr fenton and his family his former friends resorted to him his acquaintance was sought by all the neighborhood his credit was restored his school daily increased and like job his latter end was far more blessed than his beginning  within a few weeks mr and mrs fielding with their sister phoebe our friend ned and a splendid equipage called and breakfasted at mr fentons and soon after mr fenton and his harry with mr and mrs clement attended their visitants to st albans where all together they spent the happiest night but that this happiness was blended at times with the affecting consideration of parting in the morning  for two succeeding years and upward little interesting happened save that our hero increased in stature and all personal accomplishments and had happily got over the measles and smallpox he was now nearly master of the latin and greek languages he could outrun the raindeer and outbound the antelope he was held in veneration by all masters of the noble science of defense his action was vigor his countenance was loveliness and his movement was grace  harry by this time was also versed in most of the select and interesting portions of history mr clement had instructed him in the use of the globes and maps and as he there led him from clime to clime and country to country he brought him acquainted with the different manners customs laws polities governments rise progress and revolutions of the several nations through which they passed finally said clement you see master fenton that the mightiest states like men have the principles of growth as likewise of dissolution within their own frame like men they are born and die have their commencement and their period they arise like the sun from the darkness of poverty to temperance industry liberty valor power conquest glory opulence and there is their zenith from whence they decline to ease sensuality venality vice corruption cowardice imbecility infamy slavery and so good night  mr fenton now judged it full time to give our hero an insight into the nature of the constitution of his own country a constitution of whose construction poise action and counteraction the lettered mr clement had scarcely any notion and even the learned in our laws and the leaders in our senate but a very confused idea  for this especial purpose he called harry to his closet you are already my love said he a member of the british state and on that account have many privileges to claim and many duties to perform toward your country in particular independent of your general duties to mankind  should it please god to bless your friends with the continuance of your life for eight or ten years longer you will then be a member of the legislature of great britain one of the highest and most important trusts that can be confided by mankind  here my harry i have penned or rather pencilled for your use an abstract in miniature of this wonderful constitution but before i give it for your study and frequent perusal i would give you some knowledge of the claims whereon it is founded as also of the nature of man in his present depraved state and of his several relations as a subject and as a sovereign  man comes into this world the weakest of all creatures and while he continues in it is the most dependent nature neither clothes him with the warm fleece of the sheep nor the gay plumage of the bird neither does he come forth in the vigor of the fool or the fawn who on the hour of their birth frisk about and exult in the blessing of new existence  sacred history indeed intimates that man was originally created invulnerable and immortal that the fire could not burn him stones wound air blast or water drown him that he was the angelic lord and controller of this earth and these heavens that roll around us with powers to see at once into the essences natures properties and distinctions of things to unfold all their virtues to call forth all their beauties and to rule subdue and moderate these elements at pleasure  these truly were godlike gifts illustrious powers and prerogatives and well becoming an offspring produced in the express image of an allpotent allwise and allbeneficent creator  true sir said harry but then we see nothing now of all this greatness and glory man on the contrary is himself subjected to all the elements over which you say he was appointed the ruler he has every thing to fear from every thing about him even the insects and little midges fearlessly attack and sting this boasted lord of the creation and history shows from the beginning of the world that the greatest of all enemies to man is man  this replied mr fenton is continually to remind him of the depraved and guilty state into which he is fallen man indeed is now no better than the remains of man but then these remains are sufficient to prove the luster and dignity of his original state when you behold the ruins of some lofty and spacious palace you immediately form an idea of the original beauty and stateliness of the structure even so in our present feeble and fractured state a discerning eye may discover many traces and fragments of mans magnificent ruin thoughts that wing infinity apprehensions that reach through eternity a fancy that creates an imagination that contains a universe wishes that a world has not wherewithal to gratify and desires that know neither ending nor bound  these however are but the faint glimmerings of his once glorious illumination all his primitive faculties are now lapsed and darkened he is become enslaved to his natural subjects the world is wrested out of his hands he comes as an alien into it and may literally be called a stranger and pilgrim upon earth  all other animals are gifted with a clear knowledge and instant discernment of whatever concerns them mans utmost wisdom on the contrary is the bare result of comparing and inferring a mere enquirer called reason a substitute in the want of knowledge a groper in the want of light he must doubt before he reasons and examine before he decides  thus ignorant feeble deeply depraved and the least sufficient of all creatures in a state of independence man is impelled to derive succor strength and even wisdom from society when he turns a pitying ear and helping hand to the distressed he is entitled in his turn to be heared and assisted he is interested in others others are interested in him his affections grow more diffused his powers more complicated and in any society or system of such mutual benevolence each would enjoy the strength virtue and efficacy of the whole  you have sir said harry here drawn an exceeding sweet picture of society and you know i am but a fool and a novice in such matters but if any other man breathing had given me such a description i should from all my little reading have withstood him to the face look through all the states and associations that ever were upon earth throughout the republics of greece italy asia minor and others the most renowned for urbanity and virtue and yet what do you find them save so many bands of public robbers and murderers confederated for the destruction of the rest of mankind what desolations what bloodshed what carnage from the beginning what a delight in horrors what a propensity in all to inflict misery upon others the malignity of the fiends can i think pierce no deeper  neither is this sir as i take it the extent of their malevolence for when any of these bands or states as you call them have conquered or slaughtered all around them they never fail for want of employment to fall out among themselves and cut the throat of their very confederates and this puts me in mind of what is said by the prince of peace the prince of this world comes and has no part in me and again he says to the purpose that fathers and sons and mothers and daughters shall be divided against each other and that a mans enemies shall be those of his own household  i lately met with a fragment of an epic poem it struck me wonderfully at the time and i recollect some of the lines that contain in my opinion the most genuine the truest picture that ever was drawn of the state of mankind  man comes into this passing world in weakness and cries for help to man  for feeble is he and many are his foes thirst hunger nakedness diseases infinite within his frame without inclemency the wrath of seasons famines pests plagues devouring elements earthquakes beneath the thunders rolling over him age and infirmity on either hand and death who shakes the certain dart behind him these surely one might deem were ills sufficient man thinks not so on his own race he turns the force of all his talents exquisite to shorten the short interval by art which nature left us  fire and sword are in his hand and in his heart are machinations for speeding of perdition  half the world down the steep gulf of dark futurity push off their fellows pause upon the brink and then drop after say then my dearest father tell me whence comes this worse than flinty this cruel heartedness in man why are not all like you why are they not happy in communicating happiness if my eyes did not daily see it in fact as well as in history i should think it impossible that any one should derive pleasure from giving pain to another can it be more blessed to destroy than to preserve to afflict than to gladden to wound than to heal my heart wrings with regret for being cast into a world where nation against nation family against family and man against man are perpetually embattled grudging coveting grasping tearing every enjoyment every property and life itself from eachother  here harry for a while held his handkerchief to his eyes while his fond uncle dropped a silent tear of delight at beholding the amiable emotion of his beloved  take care my harry rejoined mr fenton beware of the smallest tincture of uncharitableness you see only the worse part the outward shell of this world while the kernel the better part is concealed from your eyes there are millions of worthy people and affectionate saints upon earth but they are as a kingdom within a kingdom a grain within a husk it requires a kindred heart and a curious eye to discover them evil in man is like evil in the elements earthquakes hurricanes thunders and lightnings are conspicuous noisy glaring while goodness like warmth and moisture is silent and unperceived though productive of all the beauties and benefits in nature  i once told you my darling that all the evil which is in you belongs to yourself and that all the good which is in you belongs to your god that you cannot in or of yourself so much as think a good thought or form a good wish or oppose a single temptation or evil motion of any kind and what i then said of you may equally be said of all men and of the highest angels now in bliss  no creature can be better than a craving and dark desire no efforts of its own can possibly kindle the smallest portion of light or of love till god by giving himself gives his light and love into it  here lies the eternal difference between evil and good between the creature and the creator the spirits who are now in darkness are there for no other reason but for their desire of a proud and impossible independence for their rejecting the light and love of that god in whom however they live and move and have their desolate being  god is already the fullness of all possible things he has therefore all things to give but nothing to desire the creature while empty of god is a wanting desire it has all things to crave but nothing to bestow no two things in the universe can be more opposite more contrasted  remember therefore this distinction in yourself and all others remember that when you feel or see any instance of selfishness you feel and see the coveting grudging and grappling of the creature but that when you feel or see any instance of benevolence you feel and see the informing influence of your god all possible vice and malignity subsists in the one all possible virtue all possible beauty all possible blessedness subsists in the other  as god alone is love and nothing but love no arguments of our own can reason love into us no efforts of our own can possibly attain it it must spring up within us from the divine bottom or source wherein our existence stands and it must break through the dark and narrow womb of self into sentiments and feelings of good will for others before this child of god can be born into the world  self is wholly a miser it contracts what it possesses and at the same time attracts all that it does not possess it at once shuts out others from its own proposed enjoyments and would draw into its little whirlpool whatever others enjoy  love on the contrary is a giving not a craving an expansion not a contraction it breaks in pieces the condensing circle of self and goes forth in the delightfulness of its desire to bless  self is a poor dark and miserable avaritiousness incapable of enjoying what it has through its grappling and grasping at what it has not the impossibility of its holding all things makes it envious of those who are in possession of any thing and envy kindles the fire of hell wrath and wretchedness throughout its existence  love on the other hand is rich enlightening and full of delight the bounteousness of its wishes makes the infinity of its wealth and it cannot fail of finding without seeking or requiring its own enjoyment and blessedness in its desire to communicate and diffuse blessing and enjoyment  but is it not sir a very terrible thing said harry for poor creatures to be evil by the necessity of their nature  why answered mr fenton how do you wish that matters should have been managed my harry  that all sir at once should have been made so wise and good as never possibly to be otherwise to all eternity  what infinitely wise and powerful and good and happy  as near to infinite sir as possibly could be  any thing less than infinite replied mr fenton must fall infinitely short of it  but supposing that god had made his creatures infinitely and necessarily wise powerful and happy then here would have been as it were an infinity of distinct beings and separate wills unmitted by any connection undisciplined and unarrayed by any subordination and should any cause of contention arise among them the universe must have been turned into a more horrible hell than any that fancy has ever yet formed  i see sir said harry i see in all lights that my wish was absurd impossible and ridiculous  your error my harry consisted in this you took the emptiness darkness and desire in the creature to be the evil of the creature they are indeed the only possible cause of evil in or to any creature but they are exceedingly far from being an evil in themselves they are on the contrary the only the necessary and indispensable foundation whereon any creaturely benefit can be built it is extremely good for the creature to be poor and weak and empty and dark and desiring for hereby he becomes a capacity for being supplied with all the riches powers glories and blessedness of his god  as god is every where in and of himself the fullness of all possible beings and beatitudes he cannot create any thing independent or out of himself they cannot be but by being both in him and by him could it be otherwise could any creature be wise or powerful or happy in and of itself what a poor and stinted happiness must that have been its blessedness in that case must have been limited like its being and how infinitely my child should we then have fallen short of that eternal weight of glory intended for us but god has been graciously pleased to provide better things if we humbly and desirously depend upon him we become entitled to all that he has and that he is he will enlighten our darkness with his own illumination he will inform our ignorance with his own wisdom his omnipotence will become the strength of our weakness he himself will be our rectitude and guide from all error he will purify our pollution put his own robe on our nakedness enrich our poverty with the heartfelt treasures of himself and we shall be as so many mirrors wherein our divine friend and father shall delight to behold the express image of his own person his own perfections and beatitudes represented for ever  o sir exclaimed harry how you gladden how you transport me i shall now no longer repine at my own weakness or blindness or ignorance or insufficiency of any kind since all these are but as so many vessels prepared to contain pearls of infinite price even the riches the enjoyment and fullness of my god never will i seek or desire never will i accept any thing less than himself  you must my child said mr fenton you are still in the flesh in a carnal and propertied world your old man must be fed though not pampered it must be mortified but not slain  you read in the third chapter of genesis how our first father lusted after the sensual fruits of this world how he wilfully broke the sole commandment of his god how he added to his apostasy the guilt of aspiring at independence how he trusted to the promise and virtue of creatures for making him equal in godhead to the creator how in that day he died the fearfullest of all deaths a death to the fountain of life light and love within him and how his eyes were opened to perceive the change of his body into grossness corruption disease and mortality conformable to the world to which he had turned his faith and into which he had cast himself  now had man continued in this state his spirit which had turned from god into its own creaturely emptiness darkness and desire must have so continued for ever in its own hell and misery without the possibility of exciting or acquiring the smallest spark of benevolence or virtue of any kind but god in compassion to adam and more especially in compassion to his yet unsinning progeny infused into his undying essence a small embryon or reconception of that lately forfeited image which in creation had born the perfect likeness of the creator  from hence arises the only capacity of any goodness in man and according as we suppress or quench or encourage and foster this heavenly seed or infant offspring of god within us in such proportion we become evil malignant and reprobate or benevolent and replete with divine propensities and affections  now harry let us turn our eyes to our gross and outward man for as i told you it must be cared for and sustained agreeable to its nature and it is well deserving of our attention for as much as it is the husk the habitation and temple of that godlike conception which when matured is to break forth into never ending glory  lastly this same outward man is further to be regarded by us for as much as his infirmities frailties distemperatures afflictions aches and anguishes are so intimately felt by his divine inmate that they occasionally excite those thousand social charities relations and endearments that with links of golden love connect the brotherhood of man  it is therefore worth while to enquire into the claims and rights of this close though gross companion at least so far as may be requisite for his necessary if not comfortable subsistence upon earth  we find that god has entrusted him with life liberty and strength to acquire property for his sustenance it is therefore his duty to preserve all these trusts inviolate for as they are wedded to his nature what god has so joined let no man put asunder  if these were not my harry the natural inheritable and indefeasible rights of all men there would be no wrong no injustice in depriving all you should meet of their liberty their lives and properties at pleasure for all laws that were ever framed for the good government of men even with the divine decalogue are no other than faint transcripts of that eternal law of benevolence which was written and again retraced in the bosom of the first man and which all his posterity ought to observe without further obligation  the capital apostle saint paul bears testimony also to the impression of this law of rights on the consciences and hearts of all men where he says in the second chapter of his epistle to the romans not the hearers of the law are just before god but the doers of the law shall be justified for when the gentiles which have not the law do by nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are a law unto themselves which show the work of the law written in their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another  but sir interrupted harry i am quite astonished at the fallingoff of the father of mankind so infinitely benefitted and obliged as he was so necessarily dependent also on his omnipotent benefactor how foolish how base how ungrateful how unpardonable as i think was his wonderful apostasy wretched creatures that we are no sound branch to be sure could ever spring from so debased so cankered a stock  let us not be prone to judge of others my harry i am confident as i am of my being that had you or i been in the case and place of adam we should have fallen in like manner he had an old and a very subtle adversary to deal with he felt himself powerful glorious and happy he had no notion that his present state could change for the worse he was yet a novice in existence he could form no conception of the depravity pains and mortality that afterward ensued and he was strongly tempted by sensual objects from without and by the emotions of his creaturely nature within him but of this i am assured harry that if he was the greatest sinner he was also the greatest and most contrite penitent that ever existed as the comparison of his first with his latter state must have given him the most poignant and bitter compunctions and must have caused him with tenfold energy to cling to that rock from which he was hewn but from whence he had fallen  i have already shown you harry that every man has a right in his person and property and that this right is natural inheritable and indefeasable no consent of parties no institution can make any change in this great and fundamental law of right it is universal invariable and unalienable to any man or system of men it is only defeasable in particular cases as where one man by assailing the safety of another justly forfeits the title which he had to his own safety  if human nature had never fallen into a state of inordinate appetence all laws and legal restraints would have been as needless and impertinent as the study and practice of physic in a country exempted from mortality and disease but for as much as all men are tyrants by nature all prone to covet and grasp at the rights of others the great law of safety to all can no otherwise be assured than by the restraint of each from doing injury to any  on this lamentable occasion on this sad necessity of mans calling for help against man is founded every intention and end of civil government all laws that do not branch from this stem are cankered or rotten all political edifices that are not built and sustained upon this foundation of defending the weak against the oppressor must tumble into a tyranny even worse than that anarchy which is called the state of nature where individuals are unconnected by any social band but if such a system could be framed whereby wrong should not be permitted or dispensed with in any man right would consequently ensue and be enjoyed by all men and this would be the perfection of civil liberty  sir says harry i have heard some very learned men affirm that god in whom is the disposal of all lives and all properties has given to some a right of ruling over others that governors are his vicegerents and representatives upon earth and that he has appointed the descendible and hereditary rights of fathers over families of patriarchs over tribes and of kings over nations  in a qualified sense my harry their affirmation may be just all the agents and instruments and dispensers of beneficence whether their sphere be small or great are gods true representatives and vicegerents upon earth he has given authority to the tenderness of parents over their progeny and he has invested patriarchs and kings with the rights of protection but god never gave the vulture a right to rule over the dovecote never gave up the innocent many for a prey to the tyrannous few god never can take pleasure in the breaches of the law of his own righteousness and benignity arbitrary regents are no further of his appointment than the evils of earthquakes and hurricanes as where he is said to give the wicked a king in his anger and to set over the nations the basest of men  the god of all right cannot will wrong to any his service is perfect freedom it is his pleasure to deliver from the land of slavery and the house of bondage he is the god of equity and good will to all his creatures he founds his own authority not in power but beneficence the law therefore of safety and wellbeing to all is founded in the nature of god himself eternal immutable and indispensable  one man may abound in strength authority possessions but no man may have greater right than another the beggar has as much right to his cloak and his scrip as the king to his ermines and crown lands  to fence and to establish this divinely inherent right of security to the person and property of man has been the study and attempt of hermes confucius minos lycurgus solon numa and of all the legislators and systems of civil polity that ever warmed the world with a single ray of freedom  but so strong is the propensity to usurpation in man so dangerous is it to tempt trustees with the investiture of power so difficult to watch the watchers to restrain the restrainers from injustice that whether the government were committed to the one the few or the many the parties entrusted have generally proved traitors and deputed power has almost perpetually been seized upon as property  monarchy has ever been found to rush headlong into tyranny aristocracy into faction and multiplied usurpation and democracy into tumult confusion and violence and all these whether distinct or compounded with eachother have ended in the supremacy of some arbitrary tyrant enabled by a body of military mercenaries to rule oppress and spoil the people at pleasure  how england has come after the many wrecks and ruins which you have read of in history to survive to recover to grow sounder from her wounds and mightier from her discomfitures and to rise superior as we trust to all future external and internal attempts has been owing to the peculiarity of her constitution  her constitution it is true is not yet quit perhaps never ought to be quit of some intestine commotions for though liberty has no relation to party dissension or cabal against government there is yet a kind of yest observable in its nature which may be necessary to the fermentation and working up of virtue to the degree that is requisite for the production of patriotism and publicspirit but when this yest of liberty happens to light upon weak or vapid tempers they are immediately affected like smallbeer casks and rave and boil over in an abundance of factious sputter and turbulence party and faction therefore being the scum and ebullition of this animating yest are sure signs and proofs of the life of liberty though they neither partake nor communicate any portion of its beneficence as rank weeds are the proof of a hot sun and luxuriant soil though they are the detestable consequence of the one and the other  i will endeavor to image and exemplify to you the nature and tendency of these commotions by bringing some of our old plays to the memory of my harry  first there is robins alive and alive like to be if he dies in my hand my mouth shall be bridled my back shall be saddled with sticks and stones and marrowbones and sent to the kings black hall  this is always supposed to be the favorite diversion of the children of a free people where the stick which is fired at one end and handed about through the society represents the light and comfort which they derive from liberty and which they endeavor to keep alive by the quickness of communication and by the supplies of their own breath  they all please themselves with the assurance that liberty is not only alive but alive like to be and they denounce the most heavy and tremendous consequences against any who shall suffer it to expire in their hands their mouth is first to be bridled they must not dare to speak or even mutter their complaints and after being laden with all kinds of grievances and oppressions they are to be led to the gloomy receptacles of their insulting proprietor there to be further dealt with according to his pleasure  four corners and a fool is a most apt and animated representation of those personal and selfish competitions that never fail to intrude into the freest states where the meaning and import of the several contests amounts to the single question of who shall be in place and where all who get in are allowed a prescriptive right of laughing at the expense of those who are kept out  your favorite play of football is a most perfect image or rather counterpart of those dissentions and oppositions that are entitled parties and which are almost peculiar to the british constitution  as soon as the parties for football are formed each enters as affectionately as zealously as furiously in the interests of all and every of the posse with whom he is connected as though they were so many limbs of his proper person though townsmen friends brothers should be arrayed on the opposite side it makes no abatement of warmth or hostility all concerns of kindred and country all memory of former attachments are instantly cast aside or absorbed in the engagement and eagerness for conquest they enter upon action they run labor sweat wrestle while the ball which each party endeavors to bear away from the other represents the public interest or commonweal which is tossed and bandied to and fro and kicked about and almost rent to rags in the heat of the contention  it is however observable that in these football conflicts there are certain boundaries entitled goals emblematical of the constitution within which the parties are enjoined to limit their contention and when some extravagant and dissolute spirits have wantonly born away the ball beyond the said bounds we have seen both parties join in pursuit of such vagrants in order to recover and bring back the ball to the regulated and appointed sphere of its activity  the pacific institution of water my chickens come clock seems an invention of eastern policy and calculated rather to recommend an obsequious dependence on asiatic despotism than as any hieroglyphic of the freedom of grecian roman or gothic commonwealths and yet the time may come when even in britain a minister may arise who shall have the art and address to bribe and corrupt a majority of the legislature with the money of their constituents he will thereby be enabled to take the lead at the head of the representatives of the nation when all shall follow him in implicit and orderly procession each duly and decently attending the posteriors of him who immediately precedes in the arrangement  now harry let us return to the great object first proposed an object in which you are most intimately concerned and which i trust you will invariably assert and support even the liberties and claims of the meanest of your countrymen  salus populi  public safety  security to the persons and properties of the people constitutes the whole of englands polity her empire is imperium legum the sway of law it is the dispensation of beneficence of equal right to all and this empire rises supreme over king lords and commoners and is appointed to rule the rulers to the end of time  other states before now have been compounded like ours of prince peers and people the one few and many united but the error and failure of their constitution was this the people who are the fountain of all power either retained in their own hands an authority which they never were qualified to wield or deputed it to trustees without account without a provident resource or due reserve of potency when those entrusted with government should be found to betray  the people of england on the contrary claim no authority in government neither in the framing administration or execution of the laws by which they consent to be governed they are themselves imaged and as it were epitomized in their three several estates the king represents their majesty the lords their nobility and the commons more immediately their legislative power the constitution is the inheritance of them and their posterity and theirs is the right and duty at all times to watch over assert and reclaim it wherefore as you find in history when any of the three estates have usurped upon the others even when all of them together have dared to violate the frame of this salutary constitution the people to whom it belongs have never failed as on the other days revolution to restore and reinstate it  englands three estates of king lords and commons are parts of the people under covenant with the people and accountable to the people but the people as a people make not any of the said estates they are as a perpetual fountain from whence the three estates arise or rather as a sea of waters in which three exalted waves should claim preeminence which yet shall not be able to depart from their fund but in rotation are dissoluble and resolvable therein  thus however complicated the system of englands polity may be it is all rooted in and branches from the trust of the people the trust of powers which they have granted to be returned in protection and in truth it makes little difference whether the powers in such cases be granted or assumed whoever either receives or assumes such powers save to the ends of beneficence is equally guilty of usurpation and tyranny  government can have no powers save the powers of the people to wit the power of their numbers strength and courage in time of war and in peace of their art and industry and the wealth arising therefrom whoever assumes to himself these powers or any part thereof without the consent of the proprietors is a robber and should at least be divested of the spoil  on the other hand if such powers are granted by the people the people cannot granted them for purposes to which they themselves cannot lawfully apply them no man for instance can arbitrarily dispose of his own life or liberty neither of the whole product of his own labors forasmuch as the lives of himself and his family should be first sustained thereby and his obligations to others fairly and fully discharged he cannot therefore grant an arbitrary disposal of what he has not an arbitrary disposal in himself much less can any man grant a power over the lives liberties or properties of other people as it would be criminal and highly punishable in himself to assail them  hence it follows as evident as any object at noon that no man or body of men can rightfully assume or even accept what no man or body of men can rightfully grant to wit a power that is arbitrary or injurious to others and hence it necessarily follows that all usurpations of such powers throughout the earth with all actual or pretended covenants trusts or grants for the investiture or conveyance of such illicit powers are null and void on the execution and that no man or nations of men can possibly be bound by any consents or contracts eversive of the laws of god and their own nature of common sense and general equity of eternal reason and truth  i beg pardon sir says harry for interrupting you once more but you desire that i should always speak my mind with freedom you have delighted me greatly with the account which you give of the benefits and sweets of liberty and of its being equally the claim and birthright of all men and i wish to heaven that they had an equal enjoyment thereof but this you know sir is very far from being the case and that this animating fire which ought to comfort all who come into the world is now nearly extinguished throughout the earth  o sir if this divine this golden law of liberty were observed if all were restrained from doing injury to any what a heaven we should speedily have upon earth the habit of such a restraint would in time suppress every emotion to evil the weak would have the mightiness of this law for their support the poor would have the benevolence thereof for their riches under the light and delightsome yoke of such a restraint how would industry be encouraged to plant and to multiply the vine and the fig tree how would benignity rejoice to call neighbors and strangers to come and fearlessly partake of the fruits thereof  how has the sacred name of allbenefitting liberty been perverted and profaned by the mouths of madding demagogues at the head of their shouting rabble who mean no other than a licentious unmuzzling from all restraint that they may ravage and lay desolate the works and fruits of peace  but liberty in your system is a real an essential good the only source indeed whence any good can arise i see it i revere it it shines by its own light in the evidence of your description  how is it then sir that there are persons so blind or so bigoted against their own interests and those of their fellows as to declaim with much energy and studied argumentation against this divine inheritable and indefeisible right not of kings as should seem but of humankind  i lately happened in company with a number of discontentedly looking gentlemen whom i supposed to have been abettors of the late king james and friends to the arrogating family of the stuarts among them was one of some learning and great cleverness and he paraded and showed away at a vast rate concerning the divinely inherent right of monarchs implicit submission passive obedience nonresistance and what not  our god said he is one god and the substitutes of his mightiness should resemble himself their power ought to be absolute unquestioned and undivided the sun is his glorious representative in the heavens and monarchs are his representatives and mirrors upon earth in whom he is pleased to behold the reflection of his own majesty  accordingly we find that the monarchs over his chosen people were of his special appointment and that their persons were rendered sacred and awfully inviolable by unction or the shedding of hallowed oil upon them many miscarriages and woeful defaults are recorded of saul as a man yet as a king he was held perfect in the eyes of his people what an unhesitating obedience what a speechless submission do they pay to all his behests though he massacred their whole priesthood to a man in one day yet no murmur was heard no one dared to wag a tongue and much less to lift a finger against the lords anointed  i own to you sir that this last argument staggered me such an express authority of the sacred writings put me wholly to silence say then my dearest father give me the benefit of your enlightening sentiments on this head that i may know on all occasions to give to all men an account of the political faith that is in me  it is extremely surprising rejoined mr fenton that all our lay and ecclesiastical champions for arbitrary power who have raised such a dust and kept such a coil about the divine hereditary and indefeisible right of kings and the unconditional duty of passive obedience in the subject have founded their whole pile of argument and oratory on the divine appointment of the regal government of the jews as the perfect model and ensample whereby all other states are in like manner required to form their respective governments  now if these champions had engaged on the opposite side of the question and had undertaken the argument against arbitrary power they could not have done it more effectually more conclusively more unanswerably than by showing that arbitrary power was the very evil so displeasing to the nature of god that he exhibited his omnipotence in a series of public and astonishing wonders in order to deliver this very people from the grievance thereof and more especially to proclaim to all nations and ages the detestation in which his eternal justice holds all lawless dispensations all acts of sovereign power that are not acts of protection  could these champions again have better enforced the argument against arbitrary power than by showing that this people so miraculously enfranchised but now fat and wantonly kicking under the indulgence of their god had taken a loathing to the righteousness of the dispensations of their deliverer had rejected him as he affirms from reigning over them and had required a king like to the kings of the neighboring nations the very evil from which god had redeemed their forefathers  could these champions further have better demonstrated the miseries the iniquities the abominations of such a government than by reciting the expostulations the tender and earnest remonstrances of god himself on the sufferings that these rebels were about to bring upon themselves from the enormities of an arbitrary and unlimited sovereignty and lastly could they have better recommended to the free and the virtuous to stand out to the death against arbitrary oppression than by showing the obstinacy of these apostate jews when they answered to the compassionating expostulations of their god  nay but we will have a king like all the nations to rule over us  nothing my harry can be more unaccountable more astonishing than the perverseness of that stiffnecked nation  they daily drank the bitterest dregs of slavery they had been galled by double chains and had groaned under an unprecedented tyranny and oppression they cried out to their god and he miraculously delivered them from the land of their misery and from the house of their bondage yet on the first cravings of appetite these soulsensualized wretches desired to be returned to their chains and their fleshpots and longed to groan and gormandise in their old sty  hereupon god gave them flesh and bread to the full and he brought them into a land flowing with milk and honey and abounding with all the good things of this life he made them a free and sovereign people discomfitted their enemies before them and informed their judges with his own spirit for the dispensation of righteousness insomuch that every man sat under his own vine and did what was right in his own eyes and yet they lasciviously petitioned to be subjected to a state of absolute despotism and this for no assigned reason save because it was the fashion make us a king to judge us like to all the nations around us  here god in the same act approves his attributes of mercy and reluctant justice to his erring creatures he punishes their rebellion by no greater a severity than the grant of their request  and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them howbeit protest solemnly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them  and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king and he said this will be the manner of the king that shall reign over you  he will take your sons and appoint them for himself for his chariots and to be his horsemen and some shall run before his chariots and he will appoint him captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to ear his ground and to reap his harvest and he will take your daughters to be confectioners and cooks and bakers and he will take your fields and your vineyards and your olive yards even the best of them and he will take your men servants and your maid servants and your goodliest young men and your asses and put them to his work and ye shall be his servants and ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you and the lord will not hear you in that day  nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of the lord and of samuel and they said nay but we will have a king over us  and now harry what do you gather from all these sacred authorities i gather sir answered harry from the express and repeated declarations of holy writ that whoever he be whether sovereign or subject who does not wish that all men should be limited and restrained from doing injury to any is a rebel to the will of the god of beneficence and an enemy to the wellbeing of humankind  you have exclaimed mr fenton you have in a few words spoke the whole of the matter on what you have said hang all the law and the prophets  again my dear continued mr fenton it is evident from the history that the jews themselves did not pay the smallest regard to the divinely hereditary right of kingship both david and solomon the second and third in succession were established on the throne in direct contradiction to such pretended right and on the succession of rehoboam the fourth king ten of the twelve tribes repented of their submission to an arbitrary monarchy and required the king to consent to a limitation of his authority and to enter into a contract with the people  and they spoke unto rehoboam saying thy father made our yoke grievous now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us lighter and we will serve thee  but when rehoboam by the advice of his sleekheaded ministry refused to covenant with the people the ten tribes cried out what portion have we in david neither have we inheritance in the son of jesse to your tents o israel and thus the ten tribes revolted from the arbitrary domination of the houses of saul and david for as the sacred text says the cause was from the lord  now when these ten tribes sent and called jeroboam he son of nelat and made him king over israel it is most evident that they obliged him to limit the regal authority and to covenant with them for the restoration and reestablishment of their popular rights for in the sixth succession when ahab sat upon the throne the regal prerogative had not yet so far usurped on the constitutional rights of the people as to entitle ahab to deprive his subjects even of a garden for herbs  and ahab said unto naboth give me thy vineyard that i may have it for a garden of herbs because it is near unto my house and i will give thee for it a better vineyard or if it seems good to thee i will give thee the worth of it in money but naboth said to ahab the lord forbid that i should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee so ahab came into his house heavy displeased because naboth had said i will not give to thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread  here we see that the people of israel had so far recovered their originally inherent and hereditary rights that the regal estate had not the privilege of wresting from any subject so much as an herbgarden  this was a mortifying circumstance to royal elevation but power is seldom unfruitful of expedients a method was found of rending away naboths property without his consent under color of the law to which he had consented he was falsely impeached and forfeited his life and inheritance together but god by the signal punishment which he inflicted for this breach on the natural rights of his people evinced to the world how dear they are in the eye of eternal justice  how deplorable then my harry is the suppression of these rights now nearly universal throughout the earth but when people from their infancy and from generation to generation have been habituated to bondage oppression and submission without any tradition or memorial delivered down to them of a happier or more equitable manner of life they are accustomed to look on themselves their possessions and their progeny as the rightful property of their rulers to be disposed of at pleasure and they no more regret the want of a liberty that they never knew than the blindborn regret the want of the light of the sun  before i give you this paper that i have in my hand this epitome or picture in miniature of the incomparable beauties of the britanic constitution it may be requisite to premise a few matters  travelers when they survey a grand egyptian pyramid are apt to enquire by whom the stupendous pile was erected and how long it has stood the assaults of time but when nothing of this can be developed imagination runs back through antiquity without bounds and thence contemplates an object with peculiar veneration that appears as it were to have had no beginning  such a structure is the constitution of great britain no records discover when it had a commencement neither can any annals specify the time at which it was not  william the norman above seven hundred years ago on his entering into the original contract with the people engaged to govern them according to the bonae et approbatae antiquae regni leges the good well approved and ancient laws of the kingdom this constitution was therefore ancient even in ancient times  more than eighteen hundred years are now elapsed since julius caesar in the sixth book of his commentaries bore testimony as well to the antiquity as excellency of the system of the laws of britain he tells us that the venerable order of the druids who then administered justice throughout gaul derived their system of government from britain and that it was customary for those who were desirous of being versed in the said ancient institutions to go over to britain for that purpose  caesar seems to recommend while he specifies one of the laws that was then peculiar to the constitution of britain he tells you that if a woman was suspected of the death of her husband she was questioned thereupon with severity by her neighbors and that if she was sound guilty she was tied alive to a stake and burned to death the very law used in britain by a jury of neighbors to this day  it is hence very obvious that our gothic ancestors either adopted what they judged excellent in the british constitution or rather superadded what was deemed to be excellent in their own  the people who went under the general name of goths were of many different nations who from the northern poured down on the more southern parts of europe  their kings were originally chiefs or generals appointed to lead voluntary armies or colonies for the forming of new settlements in foreign lands and they were followed by a free and independent multitude who had previously stipulated that they should share and enjoy the possessions which their valor should conquer  next to the general in order the officers or principal men of the army were attended on such expeditions by their kinsfolk friends and dependents who chose to attach themselves to their persons and fortunes respectively and such attachments gave these officers great power and consideration  on their conquest or seizure of any tract of country a certain portion thereof was allotted to the general for the maintenance of his person and household the general then divided the remainder among his officers to hold of him in fief at the certain service of so many horse or foot well armed and provided etc and proportioned to the value and extent of the land assigned and the said officers again parcelled out the greatest part of the said possessions among their respective followers to hold of themselves in like manner and service as they held of their general  on the conquest of a country they seldom chose to exterminate the natives or old inhabitants but allotted to them also separate remnants of the land and admitted them to the common and equal participation of such laws or usages as they brought from their own country or chose to adopt  independent of the military services above reserved the prince or chief further reserved the civil service or personal attendance of his feudatory officers at certain times and for certain terms at his general or national court this court was composed of three estates the prince the nobles and such of the priesthood whether pagan or christian as held in fief from the prince and from this national council our parliament took its origin  the feudal officers also on their part reserved the like service and personal attendance of their proper tenants and vassals at their respective courts of judicature and for as much as in such courts no civil or criminal sentence could take place till the voice of the judge was affirmed by the court which consisted of such as were peers or equals to the party accused from thence we derive our free ancient and sacred institution of juries  if we look back upon one of those fief or feudal kings seated high on his throne and encircled with all the ensigns of royalty when we find him entitled the sole proprietor of all the lands within his dominions when we hear his subjects acknowledge that he alone is the fountain from whence are derived all possessions rights titles distinctions and dignities when we see his most potent prefects and nobles with lifted hands and bended knees swearing fealty at his feet who would not take him for an arbitrary and most absolute prince  such a judgment however would have been very premature no prince could be more limited he had not the license of doing hurt to the person or property of the meanest vassal throughout his dominions but was he the less powerful think you for being less absolute quite the contrary while he acted within the sphere of his compact with the people he acted in all the persons and powers of the people though prescribed with respect to evil the extent of his beneficence was wholly unconfined he was not dreaded indeed but on that account he was the more revered and beloved by his subjects he was a part of themselves the principal member of their body in him they beheld with delight their own dignity and strength so gloriously represented and by being the proprietor of all their hearts he became the master of all their hands  o exclaimed harry who would wish after this to be unrestrained from any kind of evil how frightful how detestable is that power which is not exercised in acts of benevolence alone and all who please may be infinite in the stretch of a good will  true my dear said mr fenton  i have now continued he given you the rough and unformed rudiments of our britanic constitution and here i deliver to you my little model of the finished construction thereof as it now stands on the revolution just achieved by his present glorious majesty king william  your reading has informed you and may further inform you of the several steps and struggles whereby this great business was finally effected it was not suddenly brought to pass it was the work of many ages while britain like antaeus though often defeated rose more vigorous and reinforced from every foil of times long passed what stupendous characters what sacred names what watchful councils what bloody effusions what a people of heroes what senates of sages how has the invention of nature been stretched how have the veins of the valiant been exhausted to form support reform and bring to maturity this unexampled constitution this coalescence and grand effort of every human virtue british liberty   here follows mr fentons short system of the beauties and benefits of our constitution but if the reader loves amusement preferable to instruction he is at liberty to pass it over and proceed in the story  the regal estate the king in the constitution of great britain is more properly the king of than a king over the people united to them one of them and contained in them at the same time that he is acknowledged the head of their body he is their principal servant or minister being the deputee of their executive power  his claim to the throne is not a claim as of some matter of property or personal right he does not claim but is claimed by the people in their parliament and he is claimed or called upon not to the investiture of possessions but the performance of duties he is called upon to govern the people according to the laws by which they themselves have consented to be governed to cause justice and mercy to be dispensed throughout the realm and to his utmost to execute protect and maintain the laws of the gospel of god and the rights and liberties of all the people without distinction  and this he swears on the gospel of god to perform  and thus as all others owe allegiance to the king the king himself owes allegiance to the constitution  the existence of a king as one of the three estates is immutable indispensable and indefeisible the constitution cannot subsist without a king but then his personal claim of possession and of hereditary succession to the throne is in several instances precarious and defeasible as in case of any natural incapacity to govern or of an open avowal of principles incompatible with the constitution or in case of overtacts demonstrative of such principles or of any attempt to sap or overthrow a fundamental part of that system which he was called in and constituted and sworn to maintain  though the claim of all kings to the throne of great britain is a limited and deseasible claim yet the world can afford no rival in power or glory to a constitutional sovereign of these free dominions  for the honor of their own body they have invested this their head with all possible illustration he concentrates the rays of many nations they have clothed him in royal robes and circled his head with a diadem and enthroned him on high and they bow down before the mirror of their own majesty  neither are his the mere ensigns or external shows of regency he is invested also with powers much more real than if they were absolute  there are three capital prerogatives with which the king is entrusted which at first sight appear of fearful and dangerous tendency and which must infallibly and quickly end in arbitrary dominion if they were not counterpoised and counteracted  his principal prerogative is to make war or peace as also treaties leagues and alliances with foreign potentates  his second prerogative is to nominate and appoint all ministers and servants of state all judges and administrators of justice and all officers civil or military throughout these realms  his third capital prerogative is that he should have the whole executive power of the government of these nations by his said ministers and officers both civil and military  i might here also have added a fourth prerogative which must have been capitally eversive of the constitution had it not been limited in the original trust i mean a power of granting pardon to criminals had this power been unrestrained all obligations to justice might be absolved at the kings pleasure an evil king might even encourage the breach of law he must unquestionably have dispensed with all illicit acts that were perpetrated by his own orders and this assurance of pardon must as unquestionably have encouraged all his ministers and officers to execute his will as the only rule of their obedience  but god and our glorious ancestors be praised he is restrained from protecting his best beloved ministers when they have effected or even imagined the damage of the constitution he is also limited in appeals brought by the subject for murder or robbery but on indictments in his own name for offenses against his proper person and government such as rebellion insurrection riot and breaches of the peace by murder maim or robbery etc here he is at liberty to extend the arm of his mercy forasmuch as there are many cases so circumstanced so admissive of pitiable and palliating considerations that summum jus or strict justice might prove summa injuria or extreme injustice  all pardonable offenses are distinguished by the title of crimina laesae majestatis sins against the king all unpardonable offenses are distinguished by the title of crimina laesae libertatis sins against the constitution in the first case the injury is presumed to extend no further than to one or a few individuals in the second it is charged as a sin against the public against the collective body of the whole people of the latter kind are nuisances that may endanger the lives of travelers on the high way but more capitally any imagination proved by overt act or evil advice tending to change the nature or form of any one of the three estates or tending to vest the government or the administration thereof in any one or any two of the said estates independent of the other or tending to raise standing armies or to continue them in time of peace without the consent of parliament or tending to give any foreign state an advantage over these realms by sea or by land etc  the king has also annexed to his dignity many further very important powers and prerogatives though they do not so intimately interfere with the constitution as the capital prerogatives above recited  he is first considered as the original proprietor of all the lands in these kingdoms and he founds this claim as well on the conquest by william the norman as by the limited kings or leaders of our gothie ancestors  hence it comes to pass that all lands to which no subject can prove a title are supposed to be in their original owner and are therefore by the constitution vested in the crown on the same principle also the king is entitled to the lands of all persons who die without heirs as also to the possessions of all who are convicted of crimes subversive of the constitution or publicweal  his person while he is king or inclusive of the first estate is constitutionally sacred and exempted from all acts of violence or constraint as one of the estates also he is constituted a corporation and his testemeipso or written testimony amounts to a matter of record he also exercises at present the independent province of supplying members to the second estate by a new creation a very large accession to his original powers bishops also are now appointed and nominated by the king another considerable addition to the royal prerogative his is the sole prerogative to coin or impress money and to specify change or determine the current value thereof and for this purpose he is supposed to have reserved from his original grants of lands a property in mines of gold and silver which are therefore called royalties  as he is one of the three constitutional estates no action can lie against him in any court neither can he be barred of his title by length of time or entry and these illustrations of his dignity cast rays of answerable privileges on his royal consort heir apparent and eldest daughter  the king has also some other inferior and conditional powers such as of instituting fairs and markets and of issuing patents for special or personal purposes provided they shall not be found to infringe on the rights of others he is also entrusted with the guardianship of the persons and possessions of idiots and lunatics without account  i leave his majestys prerogative of a negative voice in the legislature as also his prerogative or rather duty frequently to call the two other estates to parliament and duly to continue prorogue and dissolve the same till i come to speak of the three estates when in such parliament assembled  here then we find that a king of great britain is constitutionally invested with every power that can possibly be exerted in acts of beneficence and that while he continues to move within the sphere of his benign appointment he continues to be constituted the most worthy most mighty and most glorious representative of omnipotence upon earth  in treating of the second and third estate i come naturally to consider what those restraints are which while they are preserved inviolate have so happy a tendency to the mutual prosperity of prince and people  the aristocratical or second estate the nobility or second estate in the constitution of great britain is originally representative the members were ennobled by tenure and not by writ or patent and they were holden in service to the crown and kingdom for the respective provinces counties or baronies whose name they bore and which they represented  a title to be a member of this second estate was from the beginning hereditary the king could not anciently either create or defeat a title to nobility their titles were not forfeitable save by the judgment of their peers upon legal trial and when any were so deprived or happened to die without heirs the succession was deemed too important to be otherwise filled than by the concurrence of the three estates by the joint and solemn act of the parliament or commune concilium regni  these truths are attested by many ancient records and parliamentary acts and although this most highly ennobling custom was at particular times infringed by particular tyrants it was inviolably adhered to by the best of our english kings and was observed even by the worst excepting a few instances till the reign of harry vii who wished to give consequence to the third estate by deducting from the honors and powers of the second  in truth it is not to be wondered that any kings who were ambitious of extending their own power should wish to break and weaken that of the nobility who had distinguished themselves by so many glorious stands for maintenance of liberty and the constitution more particularly during the reigns of john henry iii the second edward and second richard  till harry vii the nobles were looked upon as so many pillars whereon the people rested their rights accordingly we find that in the coalition or grand compact between john and the collective body of the nation the king and people jointly agree to confide to the nobles the superintendance of the execution of the great charter with authority to them and their successors to enforce the due performance of the covenants therein comprised  what an illustrating distinction must it have been when patriot excellence alone approved before the country in the field or the council could give a claim to nobility and compel as it were the united estates of king lords and commons to call a man up to the second seat in the government and steerage of the nation  such a preference must have proved an unremitting incitement to the cultivation and exercises of every virtue and to such exertions achievements and acts of public beneficence as should draw a man forth to so shining a point of light and set him like a gem in the gold of the constitution  the crown did not at once assume the independent right of conferring nobility henry iii first omitted to call some of the barons to parliament who were personally obnoxious to him and he issued his writs or written letters to some others who were not barons but from whom he expected greater conformity to arbitrary measures these writs however did not enoble the party till he was admitted by the second estate to a seat in parliament neither was such nobility by writ hereditary  to supply these defects the arbitrary ministry of richard ii invented the method of ennobling by letters patent at the kings pleasure whether for years or for life or in special or general tail or in feesimple to a man and his heirs at large this prerogative however was thereafter in many instances declined and discontinued more particularly by the constitutional king harry the vth till meeting with no opposition from the other two estates it has successively descended from henry vii on nine crowned heads through a prescription of near a century and a half  next to their king the people have allowed to their peerage several privileges of the most uncommon and illustrious distinction their christian names and the names that descended to them from their ancestors are absorbed by the name from whence they take their title of honor and by this they make their signature in all letters and deeds every temporal peer of the realm is deemed a kinsman to the crown their deposition on their honor is admitted in place of their oath save where they personally present themselves as witnesses of facts and saving their oaths of allegiance supremacy and abjuration their persons are at all times exempted from arrests except in criminal cases a defamation of their character is highly punishable however true the facts may be and deserving of censure during session of parliament all actions and suits at law against peers are suspended in presentiments or indictments by grand juries and on impeachments by the house of commons peers are to be tried by their peers alone for in all criminal cases they are privileged from the jurisdiction of inferior courts excepting on appeals for murder or robbery peers are also exempted from serving on inquests and in all civil causes where a peer is plaintiff there must be two or more knights impanneled on the jury  the bishops or spiritual lords have privilege of parliament but have not the above privileges of personal nobility in all criminal cases saving attainder and impeachment they are to be tried by a petitjury moreover bishops do not vote in the house of lords on the trial of any person for a capital crime  all the temporal and spiritual nobles that compose the house of lords however different in their titles and degrees of nobility are called peers pares or equals because their voices are admitted as of equal value and that the vote of a bishop or baron shall be equivalent to that of an archbishop or duke  the capital privilege or rather prerogative of the house of peers consists in their being the supreme court of judicature to whom the final decision of all civilcauses are confided and referred in the last resort  this constitutional privilege is a weighty counterpoise to his majestys second prerogative of appointing the administrators of justice throughout the nation forasmuch as judges who are immediately under the influence of the crown are yet intimidated from infringing by any sentence on the laws or constitution of these realms while a judgment so highly superior to their own impends  the second great privilege of the house of peers consists in their having the sole judicature of all impeachments commenced and prosecuted by the commons and this again is a very weighty counterpoise to his majestys third prerogative of the executive government of these nations by his ministers since no minister can be so great as not justly to dread the coming under a judgment from which the mightiness of his royal master cannot protect him  the third capital privilege of the house of peers subsists in their share or particular department of rights in the legislature this extends to the framing of any bills at their pleasure for the purposes of good government saving always to the commons their incommunicable right of granting taxes or subsidies to be levied on their constituents but on such bills as on all others the house of lords have a negative a happy counterpoise to the power both of king and commons should demands on the one part or bounties on the other exceed what is requisite  the change of the ancient modus in conferring nobility has not hitherto as i trust been of any considerable detriment to the weal of the people but should some future majesty or rather some future ministry entitle folk to a voice in the second estate on any consideration save that of eminent virtue and patriotservice might it be possible that such ministers should take a further stride and confer nobility for actions deserving of infamy should they even covenant to grant such honors and dignities in lieu of services subversive of the constitution a majority of such a peerage must either prove too light to effect any public benefit or heavy enough to effect the public perdition  the democratical or third estate the election of commoners to be immediate trustees and apt representatives of the people in parliament is the hereditary and indefeisible privilege of the people it is the privilege which they accepted and which they retain in exchange of their originally inherent and hereditary right of sitting with the king and peers in person for the guardianship of their own liberties and the institution of their own laws  such representatives therefore can never have it in their power to give delegate or extinguish the whole or any part of the peoples inseparable and unextinguishable share in the legislative power neither to impart the same to any one of the other estates or to any persons or person whatever either in or out of parliament where plenipotentiaries take upon them to abolish the authority of their principals or where any secondary agents attempt to defeat the power of their primaries such agents and plenipotentiaries defeat their own commission and all the powers of the trust necessarily revert to the constituents  the persons of these temporary trustees of the people during their session and for fourteen days before and after every meeting adjournment prorogation and dissolution of parliament are equally exempted with the persons of peers from arrest and duress of every sort  they are also during their session to have ready access to the king or house of lords and to address or confer with them on all occasions  no member of the house of commons no more than of the house of peers shall suffer or be questioned or compelled to witness or answer in any court or place whatsoever touching any thing said or done by himself or others in parliament in order that perfect freedom of speech and action may leave nothing undone for the publicweal  they have also during session an equal power with the house of lords to punish any who shall presume to traduce their dignity or detract from the rights or privileges of any member of their house  the commons form a court of judicature distinct from the judicature of the house of lords theirs is the peculiar privilege to try and adjudge the legality of the election of their own members they may fine and confine their own members as well as others for delinquency or offense against the honor of their house but in all other matters of judicature they are merely a court of inquisition and presentment and not a tribunal of difinitive judgment  in this respect however they are extremely formidable they constitute the grand inquest of the nation for which great and good purpose they are supposed to be perfectly qualified by a personal knowledge of what has been transacted throughout the several shires cities and boroughs from whence they assemble and which they represent  over and above their inquiry into all public grievances wicked ministers transgressing magistrates corrupt judges and justiciaries who sell deny or delay justice evil counselors of the crown who attempt or devise the subversion or alteration of any part of the constitution with all such overgrown malefactors as are deemed above the reach of inferior courts come under the particular cognizance of the commons to be by them impeached and presented for trial at the bar of the house of lords and these inquisitory and judicial powers of the two houses from which no man under the crown can be exempted are deemed a sufficient allay and counterpoise to the whole executive power of the king by his ministers  the legislative department of the power of the commons is in all respects coequal with that of the peers they frame any bills at pleasure for the purposes of good government they exercise a right as the lords also do to propose and bring in bills for the amendment or repeal of old laws as well as for the ordaining or institution of new ones and each house alike has a negative on all bills that are framed and passed by the other  but the capital the incommunicable privilege of the house of commons arises from that holy trust which their constituents repose in them whereby they are empowered to borrow from the people a small portion of their property in order to restore it threefold in the advantages of peace equal government and the encouragement of trade industry and the manufactures  to impart any of this trust would be a breach of the constitution and even to abuse it would be a felonious breach of common honesty  by this fundamental trust and incommunicable privilege the commons have the sole power over the money of the people to grant or deny aids according as they shall judge them either requisite or unnecessary to the public service theirs is the province and theirs alone to enquire and judge of the several occasions for which such aids may be required and to measure and appropriate the sums to their respective uses theirs also is the sole province of framing all bills or laws for the imposing of any taxes and of appointing the means for levying the same upon the people neither may the first or second estate either king or peerage propound or do any thing relating to these matters that may any way interfere with the proceedings of the commons save in their negative or assent to such bills when presented to them without addition deduction or alteration of any kind  after suchlike aids and taxes have been levied and disposed of the commons have the further right of enquiring and examining into the application of said aids of ordering all accounts relative thereto to be laid before them and of censuring the abuse or misapplication thereof  the royal assent to all other bills is expressed by the terms le roy le veut the king wills it but when the commons present their bills of aid to his majesty it is answered le roy remercier ses loyal sujects et ainsi le veut the king thanks his loyal subjects and so wills an express acknowledgment that the right of granting or levying moneys for public purposes lies solely inherently and incommunicably in the people and their representatives  this capital privilege of the commons constitutes the grand counterpoise to the kings principal prerogative of making peace or war for how impotent must a warlike enterprise prove without money which makes the sinews thereof and thus the people and their representatives still retain in their hands the grand momentum of the constitution and of all human affairs  distinguished representatives happy people immutably happy while worthily represented  as the fathers of the several families throughout the kingdom nearly and tenderly comprize and represent the persons cares and concerns of their respective households so these adopted fathers immediately represent and intimately concentrate the persons and concerns of their respective constituents and in them the collective body or sum of the nation and while these fathers continue true to their adopting children a single stone cannot lapse from the great fabric of the constitution  the three estates in parliament with the king lords and commons in parliament assembled the people have deposited their legislative or absolute power in trust for their whole body the said king lords and commons when so assembled being the great representative of the whole nation as if all the people were then convened in one general assembly  as the institution repeal and amendment of laws together with the redress of public grievances and offenses are not within the capacity of any of the three estates distinct from the others the frequent holding of parliaments is the vital food without which the constitution cannot subsist  the three estates originally when assembled in parliament sat together consulting in the open field accordingly at runningmend five hundred years ago king john passed the great charter as therein is expressed by the advice of the lords spiritual and temporal by the advice of several commoners by name recited et aliorum fidelium and of others his faithful people and in the twentyfirst clause of the said charter he covenants that for having the common council of the kingdom to assess aids he will cause the lords spiritual and temporal to be summoned by his writs and moreover that he will cause the principal commoners or those who held from him in chief to be generally summoned to said parliaments by his sheriffs and bailiffs  in said assemblies however the concourse became so great and disorderly and the contests frequently so high between the several estates in assertion of their respective prerogatives and privileges that they judged it more expedient to sit apart and separately to exercise the offices of their respective departments  as there is no man or set of men no class or corporation no village or city throughout the kingdom that is not virtually represented by their delegates in parliament this great body politic or representative of the nation consists like the body natural of a head and several members which being endowed with different powers for the exercise of different offices are yet connected by one main and common interest and actuated by one life or spirit of public reason called the laws  in all steps of national import the king is to be conducted by the direction of the parliament his great national council a council on whom it is equally incumbent to consult for the king with whom they are connected and for the people by whom they are delegated and whom they represent thus the king is constitutionally to be guided by the sense of his parliament and the parliament alike is constitutionally to be guided by the general sense of the people the two estates in parliament are the constituents of the king and the people mediately or immediately are the constituents of the two estates in parliament  now while the three estates act distinctly within their respective departments they affect and are reciprocally affected by eachother this action and reaction produces that general and systematic control which like conscience pervades and superintends the whole checking and prohibiting evil from every part of the constitution and from this confinement of every part to the rule of right reason the great law of liberty to all arises  for instance the king has the sole prerogative of making war etc but then the means are in the hands of the people and their representatives  again to the king is committed the whole executive power but then the ministers of that power are accountable to a tribunal from which a criminal has no appeal or deliverance to look for  again to the king is committed the cognizance of all causes but should his judges or justiciaries pervert the rule of righteousness an inquisition impeachment and trial impends from whose judgment the judges cannot be exempted  again the king has a negative upon all bills whereby his own prerogatives are guarded from invasion but should he refuse the royal assent to bills tending to the general good of the subject the commons can also withhold their bills of assessment or annex the rejected bills to their bill of aids and they never failed to pass in such agreeable company  lastly to the king is committed the right of calling the two estates to parliament but should he refuse so to call them such a refusal would be deemed an abdication of the constitution and no one need to be told at this day that an abdication of the constitution is an abdication of the throne  thus while the king acts in consent with the parliament and his people he is limitless irresistible omnipotent upon earth he is the free wielder of all the powers of a free and noble people a king throned over all the kings of the children of men but should he attempt to break bounds should he cast for independence he finds himself hedged in and straitened on every side he finds himself abandoned by all his powers and justly left to a state of utter impotence and inaction  hence is imputed to the sovereign head in the constitution of great britain the high and divine attribute the king can do no wrong for he is so circumscribed from the possibility of transgression that no wrong can be permitted to any king in the constitution  while the king is thus controuled by the lords and the commons while the lords are thus controuled by the commons and the king and while the commons are thus controuled by the other two estates from attempting any thing to the prejudice of the general welfare the three estates may be aptly compared to three pillars divided below at equidistant angles but united and supported at top merely by the bearing of each pillar against the others take but any one of these pillars away and the other two must inevitably tumble but while all act on eachother all are equally counteracted and thereby affirm and establish the general frame  how deplorable then would it be should this elaborate structure of our happy constitution within the short period of a thousand years hence possibly in half the time fall a prey to effeminacy pusilanimity venality and seduction like some ancient oak the lord of the forest to a pack of vile worms that lay gnawing at the root or like egypt be contemptibly destroyed by lice and locusts  should the morals of our constituents ever come to be debauched consent which is the salt of liberty would then be corrupted and no salt might be found wherewith it could be seasoned those who are inwardly the servants of sin must be outwardly the servants of influence each man would then be as the trojan horse of old and carry the enemies of his country within his bosom our own appetites would then induce us to betray our own interests and state policy would seize us by the hand of our lusts and lead us a willing sacrifice to our own perdition  should it ever come to pass that corruption like a dark and low hung mist should spread from man to man and cover these lands should a general dissolution of manners prevail should vice be countenanced and communicated by the leaders of fashion should it come to be propagated by ministers among legislators and by the legislators among their constituents should guilt lift up its head without fear of reproach and avow itself in the face of the sun and laugh virtue out of countenance by force of numbers should public duty turn public strumpet should shops come to be advertized where men may dispose of their honor and honesty at so much per ell should public markets be opened for the purchase of consciences with an o yes we bid most to those who set themselves their trusts and their country to sale if such a day i say should ever arrive it will be doomsday indeed to the virtue the liberty and constitution of these kingdoms it would be the same to great britain as it would happen to the universe should the laws of cohesion cease to operate and all the parts be dissipated whose orderly connection now forms the beauty and commonwealth of nature  want of sanity in the materials can never be supplied by any art in the building  a constitution of public freemen can never consist of private prostitutes  within little more than a month harry made himself perfect master of the foregoing system and wrote comments upon it much more voluminous than the text  as he had lost his friend ned who was now under the tutelage of his uncle mr catharines little dicky clement became the principal companion of his hours of amusement and dicky with his good will would never be from his heels  one morning as they strolled up the road some distance from the town harry observed a crowd gathering fast on the way and hastened like others to see what was the matter  as soon as he arrived he perceived mr gripe the constable at the head of the posse with his painted staff of authority exalted in his hand pray what are you about mr constable says harry i am going sir to seize a robber who has taken shelter in yonder waste hovel  and who did he rob  he robbed mr niggards here that is to say his boy here of a sixpenny loaf perhaps the man was hungry said harry and had not wherewithal to buy one pray tell me my lad how the affair was  why master you must know as how mr niggards my master here sent me this morning to the town with a shilling to buy two sixpenny loaves so as i was coming back i met an able looking man who made me afraid with his pale and eager face my good boy says he will you give me one of those loaves in charity i dare not sir says i they are none of my own here says he i will give you my hat for one of them but this i refused as his hat to my thinking was not worth a groat nay says he i must have one of the loaves that is certain for i have a wife and seven children all starving in yonder hovel and while there is bread in the world i cannot but snatch a morsel for them so as i told you i was frighted i gave him one of the loaves without any more words and away he run as fast as his legs could carry him but i followed him with my eye till i saw him safe lodged  here harry wiped his eye and mused awhile tell me truly now my good boy continued he if both those loaves had been your own would you willingly have given one of them to keep the poor man and his family from perishing  i would sir said the lad with a very good will and had i six pence of my own i would have gone back with all my heart and have bought another loaf but my master is a hard man and so i was forced to tell him the truth  here my lad says harry here is a crown go back buy two loaves for your master in place of the one he has lost and keep the remaining four shillings to yourself for your trouble you see mr constable continued he you never can make any thing like felony of this matter the boy confesses that he gave the bread with a very good will and that he would not have informed had it not been for fear of his master  it is very true please your honor replied mr gripe i myself do pity the poor man from my heart and will have nothing more to say in this business  stay awhile says harry perhaps we may find some further employment for you i think i should know the face of yonder man is not that the niggards whom you had in custody the other day and for whose deliverance i paid five and twenty pounds to his creditor the very man sir says gripe  harry then put his hand in his pocket and taking out a small scrap of parchment exclaimed i am glad of what you tell me with all my heart indeed i did not like the looks of the man at the time and that made me accept an assignment of this action here mr gripe take your prisoner to fresh custody in my name away with him to gaol directly as the holy gospel has it he shall not depart thence till he has paid the uttermost farthing no no mr niggards i will not hear a word go and learn hence forward to be merciful yourself if you would look for any mercy from god or man  dicky my dear go back again says harry our neighbor joseph here will see you safe home i will not suffer any one to go in my company for fear of putting the poor man or his family to shame  harry had not advanced fifty paces toward the hovel when his ears were struck with the sound of sudden and joint lamentation and turning he perceived that the inquisitive crowd had gathered at his heels my friends says he i entreat i beseech you to leave me for the present i would not choose any witnesses to what i am about pray oblige me so far as to depart on your own occasions  hereupon being loath to offend him they retired a few steps and stood together aloof attentive to the event of this uncommon adventure  mean while the cry continued with a bitterness that thrilled through every nerve of our hero and as he now approached the place he did his utmost to restrain himself and quell the feelings within him and he drew his hat over his eyes to prevent the parties from seeing the emotion that they caused  the hovel was of mud walls without any roofing but as there was an opening where a door had once been harry stole to the entrance casting an under eye of observation about him  hereupon a woman turned she had been fearfully peering over the wall at the crowd which had not yet dispersed but having notice of harrys entrance she looked toward him and dropped on her knees  o sir she cried if you are the gentleman who owned the loaf for christ his sake i pray you to have mercy upon us money indeed we have not but we have these shreds remaining and we will strip ourselves of our covering to make you a recompense alas alas could we have guessed how my husband came by it we would have famished a thousand times rather than touch a morsel but he dear good man did it all for our sakes for the sake of the heavy burden with which he is overladen ah i would to heaven we were all dead hanged or drowned out of his way he might then walk the world at large and be happy as he deserves  here again she set up her wailing which was accompanied by her seven children with such a woeful consort as the heart of harry could not sustain neither suffer him for a season to interrupt or appease  at length he said with a faultering voice pray be not alarmed madam for i discern that you are a gentlewoman though in a very unhappy disguise the affair of the loaf is settled to your satisfaction and here are ten guineas it is all that i have about me and it is only to show you for the present that you are not quite so friendless in the world as you thought meantime i request that you will all come with me to hampstead where we will try to do something better for you  here the woman looked with an earnest and eager rapture at him may jesus christ she cried be your portion my angel and he is already your portion he is seen in your sweet face and breaks out at your eyes in pity to poor sinners  harry was now stepping forth and the rest prepared to follow him when the poor man who for shame had not yet uttered a syllable gently staid him at the opening turn generous master said he pray turn and hear a small apology for my transgression i am a very unhappy man i have seen better times but i am driven by cruel usage from house and home and maintenance i was going to london to apply to the law for relief when my youngest child who was on the breast fell desperately sick about four days ago as we had no money to hire lodging and had begged the means of life for the two foregoing days we were compelled to take up with this shelterless hovel from hence i frequented the road and for the three last day begged as much as sustained us in coarse bread and water but this morning my boy died and his brothers and i with our sticks and our hands dug his grave that you see yonder and i placed that flag over him to preserve his tender limbs from the pigs and the hounds till it may please heaven to allow me means to bury him according to the holy rites of our church this melancholy office sir detained me so long and exercise had made the appetites of my children so outrageous that i was in a manner compelled to do what i did as i had no coffin nor winding sheet i took the waistcoat from my body and wrapped it about my babe and would willingly have wrapped him with my flesh and my bones that we might quietly have lain in one grave together  harry answered not a word but walking onward before his company plentifully watered the ground with his tears as he passed while the poor man took his youngest son in his arms and the woman her youngest daughter on her back and thus with a leisurely pace they all arrived at mr fentons  the door being opened harry led his nine guests to the back parlour where he instantly ordered plenty of bread and butter and milk for the children with cold meat ale and cakes for the father and mother and this was a matter too customary in this house to be any cause of wonder to any member of the family  as soon as they were refreshed he took them all to his wardrobe where he constrained the parents to take of the very best things for themselves and their children and having so done he walked out and left them to dress  mr fenton was in his study and had just finished a letter as harry entered with a smiling countenance i have been very lucky this morning sir says he i think i have got the prettiest family of boys and girls that is to be found within five shires do you know any thing about them harry nothing further as yet sir than that they and their parents are exceeding poor and have fallen as they say into great misfortunes the mother is a very handsome and genteel young woman and the father a portly and very comely man save that he has a large purple mark on the left side of his face a purple mark cried mr fenton and started go my dear and bring that man to me directly why pray sir do you know him no my love i should not know him though he stood before me but i would give a thousand pound that he may prove the man i mean and that i shall discover on a short examination  by this time the father of our new family was dressed and harry took him by the hand bid him be of good courage and led him in to his uncle he bowed twice with an awful and timid respect while mr fenton rose and looked earnestly at him i rejoice sir says he to find that my son here has been of some little matter of use to you and your family pray take a seat nearer to me sir if you please he tells me you have met misfortunes i also have had my share i think myself nearly of kin to the unhappy and you will singularly oblige me by as much of your story as you shall please to communicate i am interested in it  i have nothing to conceal from your honor answered the stranger and i shall willingly give you an open and faithful narrative of my short but sad history  my name is giffard homely my father was a farmer in easy circumstances near stratford he bound me apprentice to a tanner and when my time was out gave a hundred and twenty pieces to set me up in my business but dying soon after he bequeathed the bulk of his substance to my elder brother  though my brother was a spendthrift i loved him dearly and when his creditors fell upon him i became his bail for two hundred pounds within a few months after he suddenly disappeared and i never could learn further tidings concerning him  a writ was thereupon marked against me and put into the hands of bailiffs but liberty was precious i left all my substance to the possession of my pursuers and passing at a great rate i escaped into lincolnshire  there i joined myself to anthony granger the tanner independent of his trade he held a very beautiful and well parked farm under sir spranger thornhill the lord of the manor and as i served him with great zeal affection and application his affairs prospered mainly under my hands  he had an only child a very lovely girl of about ten years of age her manners like her countenance were extremely engaging and i took vast delight at all leisure hours in teaching her to read and write and in diverting her with a variety of little plays and amusements  i had no intention at that time of gaining her young heart but that happened to prove the miserable consequence and a heavy price it is that my poor dear girl has since paid for her affection  year after year she now grew in stature but much more in loveliness at least in my eyes and yet i flattered myself that i affected her merely for her own sake i used to please myself with the prospect of her being advanced to high fortune and i thought that i would willingly have given her up at the altar to some lord of the land  one hollantide eve a parcel of young folk of us were diverting ourselves about the fire with several pastimes and among the rest the play was introduced of i love my love with an a because she is amiable and so on through the alphabet  when it came to my peggys turn she said i love my love with an h because he is very honest and i never will hate him for his being homely and this might have passed without any observation had she not cast a glance at me and blushed exceedingly which threw me also into equal confusion  as this was the first discovery that i made of her affection it also served to open my eyes to the strength of my own passion and this cost me many a sleepless night and aching heart i did not look upon myself as a sufficient match for her i reflected that it would be very ungenerous to lessen the fortune or happiness of the girl that i loved and i resolved a hundred times to quit the country that my absence might cure both her and myself of our foolish fondness for eachother but though this was what my reason still prompted and approved my heart still held me back as it were for a while longer when i was on the brink of departure  peggy was just arrived to her fifteenth year on the   th of april and was elected by the neighbors to be queen of the following may and to deliver the prizes to the victors at the wake  i had made a vow within myself to forsake her and the country the very day after her regency but in the mean while i could not resist the temptation of showing my address before the queen of my wishes  accordingly on the day i entered the lists among the other young candidates but i will not burden your honor with a particular detail of our insignificant contests you have unquestionably been witness to the like on several occasions  it will be sufficient to inform you that as i had the fortune to get the better at the race and at wrestling when i successively went to receive the respective prizes my peggys eyes danced and her feet went pitapat with joy as i approached her  cudgels came next in play and a little stage of boards was erected for the purpose that the spectators might see with the better advantage i had long learned this art from a famous master in stratford and as i was confident of my superiority i hurt my rivals as little as possible only just sufficient to make them acknowledge that they were foiled  at length one hector pluck a butcher mounted the stage he had it seems been quite an adept at this sport and for ten foregoing years had carried off the prize from several neighboring shires but he was now come to settle near lincoln and was to have been married the following day to a farmers daughter who was one of the fair spectators at the wake  the moment he assailed me i perceived that his passions were up and that his eye was a plain interpreter of the deadliness of his heart he fought cautiously however and kept on a watchful reserve and we had long attacked and defended without any advantage on either part when with a motion and fury quick as lightning he made a side stroke at me and aimed to cut me across the face with the point of his stick this was a blow which i had not time to intercept or even to see the villain however happily missed of his intention for his cudgel being something advanced only bruised my right cheek when instantly i gave him an exasperated stroke on the head and cutting him to the skull laid him sprawling on the stage whereat all who knew me gave a great shout  after some time he rose and advancing a little toward me he stretched out his left hand as if in token of reconciliation while pulling out his butchers knife from a sheath in his sidepocket he with his right hand made a stab at my heart and suddenly leaping off the stage attempted to escape  immediately the blood poured from me in a stream and ran along the boards i found myself growing weak and sitting down on the stage i had the presence of mind to rip open my bosom and taking out my handkerchief i held it to the wound  in the mean time the whole concourse was in an uproar the cry went about that giffard homely was murdered giffard homely was killed my poor dear peggy fell senseless from her throne and was carried home in the fit several horsemen hasted away of their own accord for a surgeon and the butcher was pursued knocked down hard pinioned and conveyed with following curses to the gaol of lincoln  among others who came to condole with me little master billy thornhill our landlords son and heir came running and desired to be lifted up on the stage  as soon as he saw the blood and how weak and pale i looked he broke out into a passionate fit of tears o giffard my giffard my poor giffard be cried i fear you are a dead man you will no more be my holiday companion giffard never more will you go a birding with me or set gins for the rabbits or catch little fishes for me or carry me on your back through the water or in your arms over the mire alack alack what shall i do if i lose you my poor giffard  the surgeon came at full gallop as soon as he had seen the greatness of the gash say your last prayer my friend he cried in a very few minutes you must be a dead man but when he had probed the wound his face turned to cheerfulness a most wonderful escape he cried the weapon has missed your vitals and only glanced along the rib be of good courage i engage in a few weeks to set you once more upon your legs  mean time my loving neighbors made a litter and bed for me of the tents and tentpoles all striving who should carry me and all escorting me home  the good mr granger had been that day confined by a sprain in his ancle and now sat weeping by his child who fell out of one fainting fit into another till she was told that i was brought home and that the doctor had pronounced me out of danger  as soon as i was put to bed and my kind attendants withdrawn mr granger on a crutch came limping and sat down by me he had endeavored to restrain his tears before the crowd but as soon as he was seated they broke out anew  o giffard giffard he cried my dear peggy is very ill and you are very ill and to lose you both at once would be hard upon me indeed  notwithstanding a short fever the doctor happened to keep his promise with the assistance of youth and a good habit and i began to gather strength and recover apace  as soon as i was up and about i observed that miss peggy seemed no longer desirous of restraining her kind looks or her kind offices and this gave me some concern till i also observed that her father took no unbrage or no notice of it  one evening as we sat over a tankard of october giffard says he bluntly what would you think of my peggy for a wife nothing at all sir says i i would not marry your daughter if she would have me tomorrow pray why so giffard peggy is very pretty and deserving as i think of as good a man as you her deservings sir said i are my very objection i scarce know a man in the land who is deserving of her if that is the case giffard her hand is at your service with all my heart o sir i replied i have no suitable fortune but i know you are pleased to banter i am no match for her you are an industrious and a making young man said he and such a one is richer in my eye than a spender with thousands beside you are loving and goodnatured my son and i shall not lose my child by you but gain another child in you as dear to me as herself  here i was so transported so overpowered by the kindness of the dear good man that i could not get out a syllable but sinking before him i eagerly grasped his legs and then his knees and rising went out to vent my passion  in about a month after sir spranger thornhill and my young friend master william honored our nuptials with their presence and all our kind neighbors came crowding to the solemnity and by their joy appeared to be parties in our union  for eight following years never was known a happier family but about that time sir spranger thornhill sickend and died and was attended to the dark mansion of the bodies of his ancestors by the greatest concourse of true mourners that ever was seen in the shire all lamenting that goodness was not exempted from mortality  our dear father could never be said to hold up his head from that day he silently pined after his old friend and patron sir spranger and all our cares and caresses were not able to withhold him from following the same appointed track  never sure was grief like mine and my peggys in looking at each other we saw the loss that we had sustained and while we lay arm in arm often often have we watered the good mans memory with our tears  time however who has many severe sorrows in prospect helps to soften and lessen those that he brings in his train an increasing family of children sweetly tempered like their mother called for all my concern and our young landlord sir william whenever he came from college used to make our house his home and take me with him wherever he went till lord lechmore his guardian took him from the university and sent him abroad with a tutor and servants on his travels  as i had made considerable savings and now looked to have a number of children to provide for i resolved to realize all that i could for the poor things so i built a malthouse and windmill and planted a large orchard with other profitable improvements that cost me to the amount of about eight hundred pounds  while these things were in agitation sir freestone hardgrave one of the knights for our shire came into that part of the country he had lately purchased a fine estate adjoining to the west side of my concern and was a man of vast opulence but a stranger among us at that time  though sir freestone was an old bachelor and had one of the most remorseless hearts that ever informed the shape of man he had yet a pleasing aspect and insinuating address and always applied those qualities to the purpose of betraying alas i was informed but too late of his character that his avarice outgrew even the growth of his wealth and that his desires increased in exact proportion as age happened to deduct from his ability to gratify them  unhappily he cast a greedy eye at my little farm like another lordly ahab he coveted the vineyard of poor naboth and at length compassed his ends by means equally iniquitous  when he proposed to give me more than value for it i answered that i myself had taken a fancy to it for the sake of the dear man who had given it to me in trust for his child and her posterity and that i would not part with it for twenty times an equivalent with this however he did not appear in the least disconcerted but said that he esteemed and affected me the more for my gratitude to the memory of my old benefactor  i was afterward told and learned by dear experience that he never pardoned an offense nor even a disappointment but nothing of this disposition appeared for the present he visited made it his business to meet me in several places sought and seemed quite desirous of cultivating an acquaintance with me did me many little friendly offices among my richer neighbors condescended to toy with my little ones appeared to take a huge liking to my two eldest boys stood godfather to my little girl that is now in her mothers arms said he wondered how i contrived it to maintain so numerous a family upon such slender means and promised to procure me a beneficial post in the collection of the customs  after a course of such specious kindnesses and while my heart glowed with gratitude in the recollection of his favors both past and proposed he came to my house in a mighty hurry my dear homely says he i have just struck up a most advantageous bargain with our neighbor squire spendal but he wants the money immediately i have not the whole about me and yet if i dont pay him down directly some cursed disappointment may intervene do run and bring me all that you have quickly i will repay you within two or three days at furthest  here i hasted with joy to the corner where i had deposited my cash as well for payment of rent as another little matter that i had in my eye and bringing out a leathern bag i laid it on the table there sir said i are two hundred and thirty guineas take but the trouble to count them out and give me a short acknowledgment no said he my dear homely never heed it for the present i will be back with you the moment i have paid the purchase and so saying he caught up the bag and huddled away as fast as his old legs could scamper while i sat still through astonishment my heart misgiving me at the time as if it foreboded the mischiefs that were to follow  i waited with great anxiety for his return till evening when hastening to his lodge i was there informed that he had set out for london five hours before this threw me into a pannick though not altogether without a mixture of hope and so i waited till the three days of his promise should expire mr snack then came to me and demanded the rent he was a lincoln attorney whom lord lechmore had lately preferred to the care of my landlords concerns upon the death of mr kindly the good old agent i told him ingenuously how matters had happened and said i would hurry to london and bring back the money directly  accordingly i posted away and rested not till i arrived at the great city there for seven days successively i besieged the doors of sir freestone hourly knocking and requesting to be admitted to his presence but he was either not up or just gone out or had company with him or was just then very busy and not to be spoken to and so forth  at length when he found that i would not quit his house without an answer he ordered me before him his chariot waited at the gate and he stood dressed in the hall as i approached and bowed with the respect and mortified air of a petitioner he put on a look of the most strange and audacious effrontery i ever beheld who are you friend said he and what may your business be with me i am come an it please your honor humbly to tell you that i am called upon for my rent and to beseech your honor to restore me the two hundred and thirty pieces you had from me the other day here says he to his servants this must be some desperado who is come to rob me in broad day and in the middle of my own people the fellow says i owe him money i know not that i ever saw his face before i desire that you will not suffer such a dangerous villain to enter my doors any more and so saying out he stepped and away he drove  o sir how i was struck to the heart at that instant i snaked out scarce half alive not remembering where i was or whither i was to go alas i was far from making the speed back again that i had done in going i knew not how to show my face to my peggy or her dear little ones whom i had plundered and stripped of their substance by stupidly surrendering it without witnesses or a single line whereby i might reclaim it at length i got home if home it might be called that had then nothing in it or at least nothing for me  mr snack had taken the advantage of my absence to possess himself of my farm and of all that i was worth under color of distraining for rent he had seized every thing even the beds whereon my wife and children lay with all their wearing apparel save what they had on their backs the bill of appraisement which i have here comes to upward of six hundred pounds but when the cattle and other effects were set up to sale the auctionier and bidders proved of mr snacks providing all were intimidated from offering any thing save those who offered in trust for this charitable agent and the whole of my substance went off within the value of one years rent being one hundred and eighty five pounds  never exclaimed mr fenton never did i hear of so barefaced and daring a violation of all laws divine and human and that too under sanction of the most perfect system of law that ever was framed but what will not power effect when unrestrained of conscience when prompted by avarice and abetted by cunning and is there no remedy sir cried out our hero none that i know of my harry save where power opposes power in favor of weakness or wealth opposes wealth in favor of poverty but we will see what may be done mean while let mr homely proceed in his narrative  when my family continued homely were thus turned out of doors an old follower made way for them in his own cottage and retired with his wife and daughter to a cowhouse hard by mean while my loving neighbors supplied them with sufficient bedding and daily kept them in victuals even more than they could eat  while i went slowly to see them stopping and turning every minute toward our old habitation all the horrors of our situation flew upbraidingly in my face and i accused myself as the robber and murderer of eight persons for any one of whom i would have spent my life  when i stooped to enter their lowly roof all trembling and sick at heart i expected to meet nothing but faces of aversion and expressions of reproach but when they all set up a shout of joy at my appearance when they all crowded clasping and clinging about me the violence and distraction of my inward emotion deprived me of sensation and i swooned away  when i revived i cast a look about me and perceived that their grief had been as extreme as their joy was at my arrival ah my peggy i cried how have i undone you by you i got all my possessions and in return i have deprived you of all that you possessed you were every blessing to me and i have repaid you with nothing but misery and ruin  dont be concerned my love says she neither repine at the consequences of your own goodness and honesty you are not as god to see into all hearts the wisest may be deceived and the best as i believe are the most subject to be imposed upon common charity must have supposed that there could not be such a soul as sir freestone upon earth but be of good courage my husband i have good news for you i dreamed that our dear father appeared to me last night dont be disheartened my child says he bear the cross that is laid upon you with a cheerful and free will and all shall be restored to you seven fold upon earth and seventy seven fold in the life that has no ending  when i found that my peggy instead of distaste and upbraiding had nothing but love in her looks and consolation in her expressions i folded her to my bosom and to my soul that went to meet her and i would willingly have made her one with my own being  my neighbors were not as birds of the season they neither despised nor forsook me because of my poverty they came crowding to condole with me they advised me to apply to the law against sir freestone and attorney snack and they offered to contribute toward my journey they also joined in this written testimony of my character and prosperous circumstances before snack made his seizure and two of them have witnessed in this bit of paper that when the alarm came of mr kindlys death and of a strange agents being put in his room they heard my say that i did not matter the worst he could do and saw me count down twenty pieces over and above my years rent  the late frights and fatigues which peggy underwent during snacks operations together with her extremes of joy on my return and of grief at the fit into which i had fallen hastened on her labor and she was delivered before her time of that weakly little babe whom i buried this morning  within six weeks after her childbirth we prepared for our journey our neighbors like the good samaritan had compassion upon him who fell among the thieves they made me up a purse of thirty and five pounds and promised to contribute further toward the carrying on of my suit  we traveled happily by easy journeys of a few miles a day till nine days ago we reached a small village the other side of st albans there we took up our rest for the night at a house that had no sign but set occasional lodgings and sold bread and small drink  as i desired a separate apartment for ourselves we were put into a kind of waste room that had no fastening to the door except a latch after a slender supper we lay down on our floor beds and i stuffed my breeches close under my head with all possible caution we had made an extraordinary journey that day and i was particularly fatigued by carrying several of my tired children successively in my arms so that we all slept but too soundly and when i awoke in the morning neither money nor breeches were to be found  such a loss at another time would have been as nothing to me but in our present circumstances it was a repetition and doubling of all that we had lost before i instantly summoned the people of the house and in a good deal of warmth charged our landlord with the felony telling him that i had been robbed of above three and thirty pounds why master says he i know of nothing to the contrary but it would be very hard indeed if i was to be answerable for the honesty of every one who goes this road if you had given your money in charge to me i would have been accountable for it i believe by the grief you are in that you must have been losers i will therefore forgive you your reckoning and give you a pair of breeches of my own into the bargain but this is all i will do till the law forces me  as there was no remedy at least for the present i accepted his overture and set out but o sir it is impossible to describe the horrors of my soul as i silently stepped along casting an eye of mingled pity and despair upon my children i cursed in secret my own existence and wished for some sudden thunderbolt to crush me into nothing all trust in god or his providence had now wholly forsaken me and i looked upon him as neglecting all other objects of his wrath and exerting his omnipotence against me and mine alone  peggy as i suppose perceived how it was with me and kept behind awhile that she might give way to the present tumult and distemper of my mind at length hoping to administer some matter of comfort to me she came up and silently put a few shillings into my hand saying courage my dear husband all cannot be lost while we have a god who is infinitely rich to depend upon ay said i these are the fruits of your dreams these are your promised blessings that heaven had in store for us and still has in store she replied the same hand that holds the rod holds the comforting staff also tell me not of comfort i cried i see that the face of god is set in blackness and blasting against me but for me it matters not had he not taken me at an advantage he sees that i have eight lives all dearer than my own and he is determined to kill me in every one of them  do not cast from you my love she said the only crutch that the world and the wretched have to rest upon god is pleased perhaps to take all human means from us that he may show forth the wonders of his power in our relief while any other hope is left we are apt to trust to that hope and we look not toward the secret hand by which we are fed and supported but when all is lost all gone when no other stay is left should sudden mercy come upon us our comforter then becomes visible he stands revealed in his greatness and glory before us and we are compelled to cry out with unbelieving thomas my lord and my god  though these pious expostulations of my dearly beloved preacher had little influence at the time for appeasing my own passions i was yet pleased that my peggy had her secret consolations but little imagined that her prophecy approached so near to its completion  for two days we held on living on such bread and milk as we could purchase at the cabbins that had the charity to receive us but my boy who was on the breast grew exceeding sick so we were obliged to shorten our journeys for the two succeeding days partly begging and partly paying for such victuals as we could procure toward evening we came within sight of this town our little money was quite exhausted and our child grown too ill to bear further travel so i looked about and perceived some roofless walls that stood off from the highway and thither we turned and took up our bleak abode  for the three following days i frequented the road and by begging procured what scantily kept my family from perishing mean time my spirit was tamed and subdued by the habit of mortification and i looked up to heaven and cried pardon pardon o my god the offenses and blasphemies of my murmurings against you you formerly blessed me with an over abundance of blessings and that too for a long season and as job justly says shall we receive good at the hand of god and not receive evil  o friend and savior of sinners if thou love whom thou chastenest and receivest those whom thou do scourge when death shall have put a period to the sufferings of mortality may i not humbly look to find grace at the footstool of the throne of thy mercyseat  at length our child died this morning and we buried him in our hovel and watered his grave with the tears that we shed for him and for eachother the rest sir you know till this angel of god was sent to accomplish the prediction of my peggy in all its fullness  here homely concluded and after a pause and a deep sigh mr fenton demanded have you told me the whole of your history mr homely i have so please your honor through every particular of any signification  i am sorry for it pray think again did you never meet with any adventure that is yet unrecited did you never save any person at your own peril  no sir  o now i recollect  some two or three and twenty years ago as i fled from the bailiffs who pursued me as i told you for the bail of my brother i came to the river avon the flood was great and rapid after the late rains and i thought of looking for a place of smoother water for my passage when a gentleman and lady attended by a train of servants came riding along the banks as they rode chatting and laughing a fowler who was concealed in a copse just at hand let fly at a bird whereupon the fiery horse that the gentleman was on took fright and with a bound suddenly plunged into the current whereat the lady gave a loud shriek and fell senseless to the ground the horse rose without his rider and swam down the stream soon after the rider appeared and the attendants were divided between their care of the lady and their lamentations for their master on the edge of the bank then seeing no other help my heart smote me and i cast myself in without reflection i kept aloof however for fear he should grapple at me and sink us both together so i supported and shoved him before me toward land till having reached the bank i laid hold on it with one hand and with the other raised him up within the reach of his servants who had stretched themselves flat upon the brink to receive him then being already drenched and having nothing further to do i turned and swam over and so made my escape  did you ask the name of the party whom you saved in the manner you say no truly sir there was no leisure for such an enquiry  why did you not wait for the recompense that was so justly your due for so great a deliverance  recompense please your honor i could have done no less for the beggar who begs at the corner  noble noble fellow exclaimed mr fenton i am he i am he whom you saved that day my brother  and so saying he arose and caught homely in his arms and pressed and pressed him over again to his bosom while harry all impatient seized hold of homely also and struggled hard to get him to himself from his father  when they were something composed and all again seated ah homely says mr fenton i have sent and made many enquiries after you but not for many years after the day in which you saved me i hated i loathed you for having prolonged my life to such a misery as no other man ever endured o  h that lady that lady  but no matter for the present  and so saying he wiped the swelling tear from his eye  tell me homely  that devil sir freestone  i am not of a malicious temper and yet i wish for nothing more than full vengeance on his head  dont you believe that he went to you with a felonious intention of defrauding you of your property  believe it sir i can swear it the circumstances and their consequences are full evidence thereof  very well said mr fenton though we may not be able to carry a civil action against him we may assail him with better advantage in a criminal way i will draw up and take your deposition myself and tomorrow i will send you with a note to lord portland where more may be done for you my homely than you think  in the mean time you and your family shall take up your abode in the back part of my house and from thence you shall not depart till as your peggys dream has it all your losses shall be restored to you sevenfold upon earth what your portion may be in heaven must be your own care and may the spirit of grace guide you in the way you should go  early the next morning mr fenton sent homely to london with his deposition and several papers accompanied by a letter from himself to lord portland in the evening homely returned and entering with a face of triumph he seized mr fentons hand and eagerly kissing it blessed blessed be the hand he cried that has the power of god among men for good works when i sent in your honors letter i was not detained a moment his lordship made me sit down perused my papers with attention questioned me on the particulars grew enflamed against sir freestone and gave him two or three hearty curses for an execrable villain he then called a gentleman to him who was in waiting and ordered an attachment to be instantly issued against the knight it was accordingly executed upon him and he now lies in newgate god be praised said mr fenton so far there is equity still extant upon earth  it is not unnatural to suppose that mr fentons family were immoderately fond of those whose father had saved the life of their most dear master mr clement in particular took pains and pleasure in forwarding the boys in their letters and mrs clement passed most of her time very happily with peggy and her little girls  frank the butler had been abroad upon an expedition at the time that mr homelys family arrived and did not return till homely had come back from lord portlands he was then informed with joy of the guests they had got and he waited with impatience till the man he longed to see should come out from his master as soon as he appeared he catched one of his hands in both of his and looking lovingly at him cried do i once more behold that happy face mr homely i was the man to whose hands you delivered my precious lord from the devouring of the floods gladly heaven knows would i have sacrificed my own life for the salvation of his but alas i had no skill in contending with the waters and the sure loss of my own life would not have given the smallest chance for the recovery of my master you are the person mr homely to whom god committed that blessed task and trust and mr james and i and all of us have agreed to make up a hundred pound apiece for your children in acknowledgment of the benefit you did us on that day  here homely took frank very affectionately into his arms and with a faultering voice said your offer sir is dear very dear indeed unto me as it is a proof of that love which you all so warmly bear to our common lord and master if there is any occasion i will not refuse this extraordinary instance of your benevolence but our masters influence and bounty are doing much in my behalf and in the mean time i will take it as a very particular favor if you will be pleased to introduce me to my fellow servants of this house  within the following fortnight a servant came on a foaming horse and in a golden livery delivered a letter at the door and rode away directly  the letter ran thus  to henry fenton esquire dear sir the trial of our recreant knight is at hand and if you insist upon it shall be prosecuted to the utmost extent of our laws the wretch indeed deserves to be gibbetted but he has relations of worth and consideration among us they have besought me to shield them from shame on this occasion and i join them in requesting you to accept the enclosed order for three thousand pounds in favor of your client together with his farm and effects which attorney snack shall immediately restore  let me have your answer within three days and believe me  your true as well as obliged servant portland   the day following mr fenton sent harry in his chariot attended by mr james and two servants in livery to return his acknowledgments to the favorite of the king  lord portland received our hero with pleasure and surprise equally evident in his countenance as he unknowingly piqued himself on being one of the finest personages in the nation he secretly respected his own resemblance in another  after a few mutual compliments and some occasional discourse the earl told harry that he must take a private dinner with him we are quite alone says he only two viscounts a baronet and four or five gentlemen of the ministerial quill pray my lord said harry smiling is a dinner the whole of their pension not so sir i confess they are the swiss of the lettered world and fight for pay they were formerly of the opposite junto but they have changed their opinions along with their party and our honor obliges us to give them at least as much in the cause of the crown as they formerly got in the cause of the populace i doubt my lord returned harry that their silence would answer your ends full as well as their oratory unless your treasury could hold out in bribing people to read also very pleasantly severe indeed replied the laughing earl but come the bell calls us to our bit  when dinner was over and cheer circulating with the bottle i would give a good deal to know master fenton said the earl what you and your father think of his majesty and his ministers should i speak my downright sentiments my lord answered harry in some things i might offend and in others appear to flatter o you cannot offend in the least cried the earl we are daily accustomed to be told of all the faults whereof we are or may be or might have been guilty and as to flattery you know it is the food of us courtiers why my lord you want no champion for the present said harry you are all as i perceive on one side of the question and if some one does not appear however impotent to oppose you the shuttlecock of conversation may fall to the ground right very right my sweet fellow rejoined his lordship proceed you shall have nothing but fair play i promise you  to be serious then said harry my father thinks in the first place for i have no manner of skill in such matters he thinks i say that his majesty is one of the greatest warriors and one of the wisest statesmen that ever existed he thinks however that he has attachments and views that look something further than the mere interests of the people by whom he has been elected but he says that those views ought in a measure to be indulged in return of the very great benefits that he has done us he is therefore grieved to find that his majesty has met with so much reluctance and coldness from a nation so obliged  you are a darling of a politician exclaimed the earl but we will not thank you for your compliments till we know what you have further to object against us  my father admits my lord that his majesty and his ministers have reestablished and exhibited in fair and open light the most glorious constitution that ever was constructed but then he apprehends that you are beginning to sap the foundations of the pile that you yourselves erected  as how my dear young mentor by being over bounteous in paying former friends and by being still more profuse in procuring new adherents  child of honor cried the earl another less elegant than yourself would have said that we are sapping the constitution by bribery and corruption you have indeed my harry delicately tempered your admonitions even like the cup of life the sweets with the bitters but what say you gentlemen shall a babe lately from the breast bear away the whole palm from people grown gray in politics  the young gentleman says mr veer the principal of the courtwriters talks wonderfully for one not versed in the subject of which he treats the people of england are stupidly proud and licentiously ungovernable they are the most ignorant and yet most obstinate of any people upon earth it is only by their being selfish that they become in any degree manageable if their voices were not bought they would either give them to persons of their own stupid cast unknowing in our laws or our constitution or to men of an antimonarchal and republican spirit who would be perpetually putting rubs before the wheels of good government  i never knew till now sir returned harry that in order to make people true to their country and their king that is in order to make men honest it was necessary to corrupt them but i have still good hopes that the picture which you have drawn of our governors is not altogether a just one  governors cries veer i spoke not a word of governors you spoke of the people sir says harry and they as i take it are our governors the people our governors this is the most wonderful and the newest doctrine that ever i heard a doctrine even as old as the constitution rejoins harry they are not only our governors but more absolutely so than any so styled his lordship is the only man in company whose person in some instances is exempt from their jurisdiction but his property remains still subjected to their decision  no law can be made in britain but by the people in their proxies and when those laws are made the people are again constituted the judges thereof on their jurytribunals throughout their respective shires as also judges of facts and rights whether civil or criminal throughout the realm  thus their privilege of making laws for themselves in parliament and of judging of the said laws when made on juries composes as it were a rudder whereby the people are admitted gloriously to steer the vessel of their own commonwealth  would it not be a pity then that so great a people should be no other than such as mr veer has described them a parcel of ignorant licentious selfish base venal prostitutes unenlightened by reason and uninfluenced by conscience  if they should be reduced if it is possible i say that they should ever be reduced to so very vile and deplorable a state it can only be by the very measures that mr veer has recommended the character as ye know of a certain old tempter is not over amiable and i should be sorry that any whom i love and respect should follow in his steps  and now gentlemen take the argument home to yourselves the people have the disposal of our lives liberties and properties which of you then would like to have life itself and all that is valuable in it at the arbitration of a pack of wretches who being wholly selfish can have no kindred feelings or compassion for you who being themselves devoid of honor and equity cannot judge according to the one or the other who being already accustomed to influence and prostitution have their ears and hands open to all who would whisper or bribe them to your prejudice  i as a fool gentlemen utter the dictates of wisdom for i speak the sentiments of a much wiser and much better man than myself should a general corruption take place in the land adieu to all virtue adieu to humanity and all social connections all reason and law all conscience and magistracy all public and private weal must vanish or be confounded in one chaos together and from hence it is selfevident that he who debauches the morals of the least of his majestys subjects is an enemy to his king to his country and mankind  i protest said his lordship with some little confusion i never beheld this matter in the same light before but i shall take care to inspect and examine it at better leisure  here the company rose to separate when harry stepping toward veer with an affectionate pleasantry in his countenance mr veer says he i fear i have misbehaved a little to day i am naturally warm and am apt to be too much so on particular subjects o sir says veer i am an old prizefighter and accustomed to cuts but i now know my man and shall hereafter avoid engaging or keep barely on the defensive do me the honor however as old combatants were wont to shake hands at parting in token of hearts free from malice in the contest of love mr veer you never shall foil me cried harry  now my lord if you have any commands for my father pray let me have the pleasure of being your messenger upon my honor my dear boy and that is the oath of a lord you shall not part me for this night at least my father sir will be uneasy i will dispatch one to him directly i have particular designs upon you you must with me to the levee i cannot refuse myself the pleasure of introducing you to his majesty i expect to get credit by you i rather fear my lord that i may do you some disgrace  o cried the earl you think you are not fine enough why truly you will see folk there of much more lustrous attire but let others disgrace their ornaments be you humbly content my child with adorning your dress harry blushed and bowed  when they arrived at court the earl left his young friend awhile in the leveeroom and went to impart some matters to the king in his closet  while our hero stood in the crowd some one came and with birdlime stuck a paper to his back whereon was written in capital letters the fool  however it did not remain long enough to do him much disgrace a young gentleman of a graceful figure and very amiable aspect pressed close behind harry and gently stole the writing away then taking him by the hand requested to speak with him apart  i wonder sir said the stranger who it was that could be so malicious or so base as to fasten this title on your back i am certain he must never have seen your face o sir said harry blushing and smiling together this must have been the office of some old acquaintance it is the title to which i have been accustomed from my infancy and i am well contented to carry it with me to the grave i am much affected sir however by this uncommon instance of your humanity to an unknown pray add to the obligation by letting me know to whom it is that i am so endearingly bound  my name sir is william thornhill i am just arrived from my travels and i would willingly go my long journey over again to become just such another fool as you are  harry seized him by the hand and gave him at once the squeeze and the look of love  sir william thornhill i presume  the same my dear sir  i have been enamoured of your character before i saw you sir william my name is harry fenton i live on hamstead hill i see that your pleasure lies in communicating pleasure i am therefore persuaded you will indulge me with a call at some leisure hour  i will not defer that advantage a single day  i shall have the lougings of a lover till you arrive  here the king entered and all converse was broken off lord portland looking about discovered harry and taking him by the hand led him up and left him standing before his majesty then approaching the royal ear may it please you sire says he this is the son of the gentleman who advanced us two hundred thousand pounds on our expedition from holland  the king turned to harry with a solemn and piercing look and having eyed him for some time he again turned to the earl and cried ay portland this is something this indeed is a gem fit to set in the crown of a monarch he then reached forth his hand and while our hero stooped to kiss it he pressed harrys shoulder with his other hand  my dear child said the king we are much obliged to your father you by inheritance are attached to our crown and you may justly demand whatever we can bestow we humbly thank your majesty answered harry we only claim the privilege of serving you with all our hearts and all our powers  what post would you choose my dear in the army or in the court indeed i should best like to have you about my own person that is the pitch to which i aspire answered harry as soon as i am capable of so high a duty  but why have you been such a stranger said the king had we seen you before i think we should not have forgot you o sire said harry i am but as a bird from the nest and this is the first of my unfledged excursions if a bird cried the king it must be a young eagle not so sire answered harry i should then better support the brightness of the sun that is now before me  i would give one of my kingdoms that you were my son  i am already one of millions of happy sons and daughters who have the glory of calling you their royal father  so saying our hero bowed twice and drew back while the king looked toward him in silence and wonder  after some talk with his courtiers his majesty retired and lord portland took harry and was followed by a number of the young gentry to the ballroom  there the queen at the upper end was seated under a canopy her maids of honor attending and two brilliant ranges of foreign and british ladies were seated on either hand  the earl gave a whisper to the master of the ceremonies and he immediately led harry up to the presence where he had the honor of kissing queen marys fair hand  after some whispering chat between her majesty and lord portland the ball was ordered to be opened by our hero and the lovely young princess of hesse  all eyes were fixed upon them with attention still as night while they moved like homers gods without seeming to press the ground or like a mist before the breeze along the side of some stately hill  as soon as the minuet was closed the princess said softly to harry in french the louvre sir if you please  this was a dance of the newest fashion and was calculated to show forth and exhibit a graceful person in all the possible elegances of movement and attitude  as soon as they had finished the whole assembly could scarce refrain from breaking forth in loud plaudits as at the public theater and a humming of mixed voices and patting feet was heard throughout  when harry had led the princess to her seat and left her with a bow of the most expressive respect he looked about for some lady whom he might choose in succession and spying lady louisa bottom at the opposite side he stepped toward her and bending gracefully offered to lead her forth  she gave him her hand tremblingly and whispered as she rose you are a great stranger sir but we deserve you should be so since we did not treat you with the respect that your merit should have commanded that madam answered harry is not wholly the cause of my distance but there are persons whose loveliness is more formidable to me than an arrangement of sabred hussars with their fierce looking mustaches  harry had no sooner said this than his heart smote him with remorse for though louisa was indeed lovely and that he felt for her the propensities and tenderness of a brother yet she was not of that species of beauty that was formed to fix his heart and he secretly reproached himself for having attempted to raise the vanity or draw the affections of an innocent girl with no further view than of making a parade of his own talents a measure he justly judged unbecoming a man of a spark of honor or integrity  when harry had finished and left louisa on the floor the master of the ceremonies honored sir william thornhill with her hand and after four or five more minuets by the younger folk the parties were appointed and paired for country dances except young lord bottom who refused to step forth and sat apart ruminating and feeding on his own cogitations  the princess and our hero led up the dance and louisa and sir william were appointed the next in course in order to do the principal honors to the two young strangers  as soon as the dances were ended and that all had mixed and chatted and roved about awhile harry observed sir william coming toward him in a little fluster what is the matter my friend says harry pray what has discomposed you  tell me my dear harry that jackanapes in the blue and gold do you know who he is i protest had it not been for the respect i owe the presence i would have chastised him on the spot the dance was no sooner done than he came up with a most provoking sauciness in his look i wonder sir said he at the insolence of one of your rank you ought to have had more modesty than to suffer yourself to be paired with a lady so far above you  o cried harry taking sir william very lovingly under the arm pass this matter over my sweet friend i beseech you that is young lord bottom the very person who i am pretty confident contrived the honor of the pasquinade on my back this day but he is brother to the sweet girl with whom you danced for her sake for my sake forgive him i entreat you but above all forgive him for the sake of his dear father the earl of mansfield one of the noblest nobles and one of the worthiest men that ever stepped on english ground he has been these two years past abroad upon an embassy and while he is promoting the interests of the public has left his own household unchastened and unguided  here the converse of the friends was suddenly broken off the master of the ceremonies came and tapping harry on the shoulder told him that the queen desired to speak with him  when he had with a lowly reverence advanced to the throne you are said the queen the most accomplished cavalier that ever i beheld and had i sufficient youth and beauty i would choose you for my knight to bear my fame through the world i would rather said harry that your majesty would employ me on some more dangerous enterprise how is that said the queen why answered harry your majestys champion could have little or nothing to do as all would willingly acknowledge the justice of his cause  you are cried the queen the loveliest and the sweetest fellow i ever knew my eye has followed you all along and marked you for my own and i must either beg or steal you from our good friend your father i therefore want no token to put me in mind of you but you may want some token to keep your friends in your memory here are two pictures the one is the portrait of our master and sovereign lord justly enriched with diamonds to the value of some thousands the other is the picture of the woman who sits before you lowly simple and unadorned choose which you please  give me the plain picture cried harry with a kind of rapture it shall henceforth become my riches and my ornament  so saying he bent his knee and taking the little portrait he pressed it to his lips with the ardour of an ancient lover in romance then putting it into his bosom he gracefully rose made three retiring bows and went from the presence  o the fool the egregious fool muttered some nobly most nobly done cried others  as harry was following the earl of portland through the palacegate lord bottom came up with the crowd and in a half whisper said you are too great a man to day sir to acknowledge your old acquaintance but not so great a fool retorted harry as not to be taught my distance with those who like lord bottom have a right to look down upon me  after a short but sound sleep harry hurried home to prepare for the reception of his new friend he told mr fenton that sir william was returned how he had been obligingly made known to him in the forementioned instance of his humanity to a stranger and that he had promised to be with them that morning but pray sir dont tell homely a word of the coming of his landlord till we place them as it were by surprise face to face  in about an hour after a chaise and four came rapidly to the door and harry instantly sprung out and caught his friend in his arms before he came to the ground  the two friends entered the parlour caressing and caressed and casting looks of cordial love and delight on eachother my father sir said harry and led sir william by the hand to mr fenton who received him with a countenance of that heartspeaking complaisance which never fails to attach the soul of the person to whom it is directed ah my harry cried sir william i no longer wonder at you i see that you are all that you are by inheritance  but sir continued he you had like to have lost your son last night their majestys were most unwilling to quit their hold of him and i believe in my soul would willingly have adopted him the heir of their crown i should be very sorry sir william replied mr fenton to see a circle about his head that would give him an aching heart i am sure that is the case with the present royal proprietors in a limited monarchy like ours the station of the prince is looked upon with a malignant eye by the envious and at the same time rendered uneasy by the perpetual contests between rights and privileges on the one part and prerogative on the other  moreover sir william i shall never wish to see one of my childs disposition on the throne of great britain i should be jealous of such a person in behalf of my country no people could be more tenacious of their liberties than the swedes till gustavus the son of erie ascended the throne his manners were so amiable his virtues so conspicuous his government so just and he made so popular a use of all his powers that his subjects thought they could never commit enough into his hands but what was the consequence his successors made his power a precedent for their own without attending to the precedent of his administration  thus you see that a prince of qualities eminently popular might prove of dangerous tendency to a free people forasmuch as he might charm the eyes of their jealousy to sleep and so seduce them from that guard which is ever necessary to preclude the encroachments of ambition  but sir william may we not order your horses up you must not think of going till you take a plain dinner with us a supper too sir most joyfully answered the knight i leave london in the morning on a certain expedition and shall not have the pleasure of embracing you again for some time  here the bell was rung and the cattle and carriage disposed of when mr fenton thus addressed the baronet with a smile our harry here sir william never saw a court before it is natural therefore to think that he must have been greatly amused and his young heart deceived by the splendour and parade but you have seen and observed upon many courts of late pray what do you think of the entertainment they afford  as of the dullest of all dull farces answered the knight all the courts that i have seen are nearly of the same cast conceive to yourself sir a stage or theater of comedians without auditors or spectators they are all actors and all act nearly the same part of solemn complaisance and nauseous grimace each intends to impose and yet no one is imposed upon where professions are taken to imply the very reverse of what they express  what do you say to this harry says mr fenton i have very little to say sir in favor of the actors but the actresses as i take it afford better entertainment here sir william and mr fenton laughed and harry upon a wink stepped out to bring in homely as it were by stealth  sir william said mr fenton there is a man come to this house who once saved my life at the risque of his own it is a great many years ago and i have not seen him since the action till very lately i have sent harry for him that you may learn the particulars and advise with me what recompense he ought to receive  if the recompense is to be proportioned to the value of the life he saved my honored sir i should not know where to fix the bounds of retribution and in truth mr fenton from my knowledge of you this day i also hold myself very highly his debtor  at this instant harry led in homely by the hand and left him standing directly opposite to the baronet  homely gazed with all his eyes and stood mute through astonishment  at length he exclaimed bless me  mercy upon me  as sure as i hope for heaven  it is  i think it is my dear young master  sir william at the voice lifted up his eyes to homely and remembering his marked man rose quickly and springing forward embraced him with much familiar affection while mr fenton sat and his harry stood beside him both rapt in their own delicious sensibilities  my dear homely my old companion and brother sportsman cried sir william how in the world comes this about so joyfully so unexpectedly to meet you here  how is your wife and pretty babes i hope you left all well at home  yes please your honor they are all well wonderfully well in this house i assure you for indeed your homely has no other home upon earth  what you tell me is quite astonishing replied the knight no home for you within the manor and demesne of your friend what misfortunes what revolutions could bring this wonder to pass  sit down said mr fenton pray be seated mr homely and give your lord a succinct but deliberate account of the inimitable pair sir freestone and his coadjutor  as soon as homely had told his tale from the commencement of his distresses to his arrival at the hovel he stopped short and said  i have something more to impart  but i hope your honor will pardon me  i am loath to deprive your friends of your company but then my peggy and my boys will be so transported to see your dear face again that i cannot but beseech you to indulge them a minute or two with that blessing  sir william rose with a troubled humanity in his countenance and followed to a back apartment where homely again stopped him short and before he would take him to his peggy he there gave him a minute detail of all his obligations to what he called this wonderful family but pray sir continued he let them know very little of what i have told you for nothing puts them to so much pain as any kind of acknowledgments  after a short visit to peggy and her children sir william returned to his friends with such an inward awe and veneration for their characters as for a while sunk his spirits and solemnized his features this poor man sir said he has been miserably treated but god has been exceedingly gracious to him in casting the shipwreckt wretch on such a happy shore as this but this makes no discharge of any part of my duty toward him  mark me homely i am now of age and lord lechmore has no further authority in my affairs wherefore before i leave this house i will give you a letter of attorney for the whole agency of the manor thank your honor thank your honor cried homely in a kind of transport if i do not prove as faithful to you as another i will do you justice on myself with the first rope i can lay hold on  as for that reprobate snack continued the knight i will take care to be up with him he owes the executors of my father six hundred and seventy pounds i will have that matter put directly in suit and as soon as it is recovered it shall be laid out on a commission for your son my friend tom as i do not choose yet to ask any favor from the ministry lastly that you may no more be distressed for rent i will never accept a penny of it till all your children are decently and competently provided for  o sir exclaimed homely i shall be too rich quite overburdened i shall not know where to lay my treasures not so fast my good friend replied sir william smiling you have not heard of the drawback that i propose to have upon you whenever i reside in the country you are to have a hot dish ay and a cool hogshead too ready for me and my company agreed sir cried homely provided i may have the liberty during your absence to drink your honors health out of that same hogshead  a just reserve said harry laughing  and full as grateful as it is jovial cried mr fenton  why gentlemen rejoined homely a man of spirit would scorn to accept such benefits without making conditions  after twelve oclock at night and an affectionate and tender adieu sir william set out by moonlight for london  the two following days were employed in preparing for homelys departure and a coach and four with a chaise were provided for the conveyance of him and his family  the night before their parting mr fenton desired that homely and his wise should be sent to him to his closet as soon as they entered he closed the door my dear friends said he i may not be up in the morning to take a timely leave of you it may do as well to go through that melancholy office to night  here mrs homely here is some little matter apiece toward beginning a fortune for your three pretty daughters pray homely take care to have it disposed of for them upon good securities here he put three orders upon his banker into peggys hand each consisting of the value of five hundred pieces then turning to homely and taking him straightly in his arms god be with you and your dear peggy my homely he cried and give us all a blessed meeting where friends shall part no more  the distressed homely was past utterance but disengaging and flinging himself at the feet of his patron while peggy kept on her knees weeping and sobbing beside him o he cried at length next to my god o next to my lord and my god  my lord and my master my master and my lord  the next morning before sunrise harry was up and going to homelys apartment embraced him and his wife he then kissed and caressed all the girls and boys round and gave to each of them a gold medal to keep him in their remembrance  they then adjourned to the hall where they found already gathered mr and mrs clement with their little dicky mr james frank andrew and george with mrs hannah susan and sarah etc all deploring the departure of their beloved guests the carriages were at the door and time pressed when homely and his peggy with open arms trembling lips and swelling eyes began to take their leave then homely cried aloud god be with you god be with you never never till i get to heaven shall i meet with such another dear assembly all then broke aloud into tears and sobbings while homely took his weeping peggy by the hand and breaking forth with a heavy heart placed her and his family in the carriages and away they went though in opulent circumstances yet with much more oppressed spirits than when they arrived  mr fenton now judged it time to forward his harrys education especially with respect to his knowledge of the world of the views pleasures manners bents employments and characters of mankind  for this purpose he proposed to leave arabella sole regent of his family and for a few weeks to stay with clement and harry in london there to show him whatever might gratify his curiosity or merit his inspection  while the coach was in waiting and they all stood on the hill the great city being extended in ample view beneath them mr fenton exclaimed o london london thou mausoleum of dead souls how pleasant art thou to the eye how beautiful in outward prospect but within how full of rottenness and reeking abominations they dealers are all students in the mystery of iniquity of frand and imposition on ignorance and credulity thy public offices are hourly exercised in exactions and extortion thy courts of judicature are busied in the sale the delay or perversion of justice they are shut to the injured and indigent but open to the wealthy pleas of the invader and oppressor thy magistracy is often employed in secretly countenancing and abetting the breach of those laws it was instituted to maintain thy charities subscribed for the support of the poor are lavished by the trustees in pampering the rich where drunkenness swallows till it wallows and gluttony stuffs till it pants and unbuttons and stuffs again even the great ones of thy court have audaciously smiled away the gloom and horrors of guilt and refined as it were all the grossness thereof by new inverting terms and palliating phrases while the millions that crowd and hurry through thy streets are universally occupied in striving and struggling to rise by the fall to fatten by the leanness and to thrive by the ruin of their fellows thy offenses are rank they steam and cloud the face of heaven the gulf also is hollow beneath that is one day to receive thee but the measure of thy abominations is not yet full and the number of thy righteous has hitherto exceeded the proportion that was found in the first sodom  that evening they went to the opera where harry was so captivated by the sentimental meltings and varied harmony of the airs that he requested mr fenton to permit him to be instructed on some instrument not by my advice my dear answered mr fenton i would not wish you to attempt any thing in which you may not excel music is a science that requires the application of a mans whole lise in order to arrive at any eminence as it is enchanting in the hand of a master it is also discordant and grateing in its inferior degrees your labors have been employed to much more valuable purposes and i would not as they say give my childs time for a song harry instantly acquiesced with the best temper imaginable as the will of his beloved patron was truly speaking his own will and that he only wanted to know it to be at all times and on all occasions conformable thereto  a few following days were employed in visiting the tower in surveying the armory regalia etc in viewing the royal beasts the monument and exchanges and lastly in contemplating the solemnity of westminster pile with the marbled effigies and monumental deposits of the renowned in death the place as mr fenton affectingly observed to which all the living must finally adjourn  the next night they went to the theater to see the feats of signor volanti the celebrated italian posturemaster ropedancer and equilibrist such wonders are now so common as to be scarce entertaining but at that time they were received with bursts and roars of applause  our hero felt himself attached by the similar excellences of his own activity in another and going behind the scenes he accosted volanti in french signor said he i have been highly entertained by your performance this night and here are five guineas in return of the pleasure you have given me the foreigner looked at harry and then at the money with a kind of astonishment i thank you noble sir he cried my poor endeavors are seldom so liberally rewarded pray how long do you stay with us in about a fortnight so please your nobleness i intend to leave london but before i go i would do something to leave a name behind me a day or two before my departure i will fly from the spire of saint clements church in the sight of all the people and this i will do gratis or rather in acknowledgment of the favors i have received in this kingdom but is it possible to execute what you propose with all ease and safety sir i have done nearly as much three times in germany and once at madrid  here an arch thought struck harry and musing a moment will you permit me said he to be the conductor of this affair allow me only to appoint the day and draw up your advertisement and i will make you a present of twenty pieces agreed sir cried volanti and twenty thousand thanks to confirm the bargain accept these five guineas then in earnest of my engagement my servant here will tell or show you where i am to be found  that night at supper mr fenton remarked an unusual pleasantry in the muscles of his darlings sweetly sober countenance my harry i find said he does not always impart all his secrets to his friends he has certainly some roguish matter in cogitation magicum calls sir cried harry you are a conjurer that is certain why the public as you know sir have put the fool on me from my birth homer says that revenge is sweet as honey to the taste and so i am meditating in turn how to put the fool upon the public and how do you contrive it harry only by acting the old proverb that one fool makes many but pray ask me not about the manner till i bring the business to some bearing  the next day being thursday they all went in mr fentons coach to smithfield where numbers of tents were set up and several drolls and pantomimes etc prepared in imitation of the humors of bartholemew fair the weather was fair and calm and they let down all the glasses that they might see without interruption whatever was to be seen  their coach stopped just opposite to an itinerant stage where a genius who comprised within his single person the two important functions of a tumbler and merryandrew by his successive action and oratory extorted plaudits and huzzas from all the spectators  among the rest a countryman who rode upon a mule sat gaping and grinning by intervals in all the extatic rapture that can be ascribed to enthusiasm while his attention was thus rivetted two knavish wags came and ungirthing his saddle supported it on either hand till a third of the fraternity led his mule away from under him and a fourth came with a three legged horse such as houswives dry their linen on and having jammd it under the saddle they all retreated in peace  the populace were so delighted at this humorous act of felony that instead of interrupting it it only served to redouble their joys and clamours harry too greatly chuckled and laughed at the joke but when he saw the beast led off and that the amazed proprietor on stooping to take the bridle had fallen precipitately to the ground his heart twitched him with a kind of compunction and throwing himself out at the coach window he made all the speed that the press would admit and recovering the mule brought it back to its owner  here friend said he here is your beast again take care the next time that they dont steal your teeth thank you master said the clown since you have been so honest as to give him to me back i will never be the one to bring you to sizes or sessions i am much obliged to your clemency answered harry but pray let me have the pleasure of seeing you safe mounted so saying he held the stirrup while the booby got up and said well my lad very well if we happen to meet at croydon we may take a pot together  mr fenton beheld and contemplated this whole scene with all the cordial gratifications that the heart of man could seel and langhing as his favorite entered the coach my honest friend said he your officiousness might have brought us all into a scrape for had you been given in charge to the constable you would probably have applied to your companions for bail i dont think sir said clement that the action would have been bailable neither could we deny that we saw the stolen beast in his custody in truth gentlemen said harry i partly begin to be of mr veers opinion that the peasantry of england are the most boorish and insensible of all the human species  in the evening they adjourned from coffee to davids harp in fleetstreet in order to hear marmulet the famed genoese musician who performed on the psaltery the viol damor and other instruments not known till then in england  they took mr james with them to partake of the entertainment and were shown to a large room where each paid half a crown at the door  the room was divided into a number of boxes where each company sat apart while they were jointly gratified and charmed by the inimitable execution of the musician  a flask of burgundy was set before mr fenton and his friends while mr hardy and mr hilton who sat in the next box were regaling themselves with a flask of rosa solis  all was silence and attention till there was a pause in the performance then said mr hardy do you know jack that the earl of albemarle is to have a masque on monday night i am sorry to hear it said mr hilton as i am obliged to be out of town i may happen to save something by that said hardy you must lend me your domino indeed i cannot it was torn to fritters in a scuffle as i came out from the last masquerade lend me your masque then that too was lost at the same time but what occasion can you have for a masque hardy i am sure no one will take that for a natural face mine is the face of mars hilton yours that of adonis with which no modern venus will ever be sinitten i promise you i will engage to outrival an army of such jackanapes in an assault on the fair if impudence may compensate for the want of other artillery i believe you may do wonders hardy and it does compensate my friend women take my word and experience for it love nothing of their own resemblance except in the glass they detest any thing that looks like an ambiguity in the sex while what you are pleased to call impudence jack spares their modesty saves them the appearance of an advance on their part and gives them the pleasure of piquing themselves on their extraordinary virtue in case they should happen to make a defense however since you have complimented me on my assurance i will put it to the test on this occasion and go to his excellencys ball without any other vizard save this which nature in her great bounty has bestowed  when our company were on the return to their lodgings harry said mr fenton would you not like to go to this masquerade why sir as i have not yet seen one perhaps it might not be amiss to satisfy my curiosity for once in my life in truth said mr fenton i wish they never had been introduced into this kingdom as they are inlets to intrigue and give countenance to licentiousness however for once in your life as you say you shall be gratified my harry be pleased to tell me sir are they very entertaining they would be extremely diverting my dear if people acted up to the characters that they pretend to represent but on the contrary they have sailors who dont know a point in the compass or the name of a rope in the ship shepherds and shepherdesses who never eloped from the cockney dialect of the city indian queens who can say nothing as to their subjects or their sovereignty gods and goddesses totally ignorant of their own history in the mythology and italian cardinals who will swear you in the phrase of a yorkshire foxhunter  but what shall we do for tickets harry i dont care to apply to my friends for fear of discovering that we are in town o sir said mr james i am acquainted with his excellencys major domo and can procure you as many tickets as you please  mr fenton assumed to himself for the present the appointment of harrys character and dress as the plainness of your garb has hitherto said he been a masque and disguise to your internal ornaments the brilliancy of your dress shall now on the other hand disguise and conceal the simplicity of your manners  about two hours before the opening of the ball harry wrapped himself in a cloak of black bays and stepped into a hackney coach with mr james who had promised to introduce him to his friend mr dominic in order for him to reconnoitre the several scenes of operation before the action began  the major domo received harry with the utmost complacence for he held his masque in his hand and the loveliness of his aspect shone with peculiar luster through the blackness of his attire  after surveying several apartments they passed through the long room and entered by an arched gateway into a kind of saloon at the upper end of which was a pedestal of about five feet in height whereon a celebrated statue of the hercules farnese had formerly stood  harry eyed it attentively and conceiving a sudden frolic he instantly cast away his cloak clapped on his mask and winged helmet grasped his caduceus with his right and laying his left on the top of the pedestal sprung lightly up and threw himself into that attitude to which the statuaries have formed their mercury when just prepared for flight  his headpiece was of thinly plated but polished gold buckled together at the joining by four burning carbuncles his jacket was of genoa silk died in ultra marine exceeding the tint of an egyptian sky it was braced close to his body with emerald clasps that showed the finess of his proportion to inimitable advantage and over the whole in celestial confusion were sown stars of different magnitudes all powdered with diamonds  the moment that harry cast himself into his posture mr dominic started back seven or eight paces and raising his hands with stareing eyes and a mouth of open amazement at length he exclaimed stay a little my dear sweet master do now do but stay just as you are for a minute and you will oblige me past expression i will be your own for ever  so saying he turned off and running to an adjacent apartment where their majestys with the princess of denmark the princess of hesse and the chief of the court were gathered he told his master aloud that he had the greatest curiosity to show him that human eye ever beheld  all rose with precipitation and crowded after the earl and the royal pair as close as decency would admit till they came to the saloon and beheld with astonishment the person shape attitude and attire of our hero  some doubted but most believed that he was a real statute placed there by his excellency on purpose for a surprise sir fielding who was the acknowledged connoisseur of the age and was in fact what the people of taste call an elegans formarum spectator exclaimed with some vehemence never never did i behold such beauty of symmetry such roundings of angles where where my lord could you get this inestimable acquisition others cried phidias phidias never executed the like all the works of praxiteles were nothing to it  the earl however was well apprised of the deception and knew that our mereury was no part of his property  son of maia said he aloud what tidings from heaven  a message answered harry from my father jupiter to their majestys  and pray what may your errand intend  matters of highest importance that they are the favorite representatives of my father upon earth and that while their majestys continue the monarch of a free and willing people they are greater than if they were regents of a universe of slaves  all buzzed their applause and admiration  it must be he whispered the king  it can be no other cried the queen  albemarle whispered his majesty we have marked this youth for our own keep your eye upon him and do your best endeavors to engage and bind him to us  in the mean time harry on delivering his celestial message flew like a feather from his post and casting his cloak about him vanished into an adjoining closet  the company now began to gather fast and harry stealing from his retreat kept his cloud about his sky and mingled in the crowd mr clement had accompanied mr fenton in dominos they soon discovered harry and were highly diverted by the account which he gave them of his metamorphosis into a statue  while the assembly was dividing into pairs and chatty parties a phenomenon entered that drew all their attention the honorable major gromley the lustiest and fattest young man in the kingdom advanced without a masque in petticoats a slobbering bib and apron he carried a large round of bread and butter in one hand while lady betsy mnit an elderly miss of about three feet high held his leading strings with her left and in her right brandished a birch rod of lengthened authority his governante pressed him forward and seemed to threaten chastisement for his delay while the jolly broad foolish humourous half laughing half crying baby face of the major extorted peals of laughter from all who were present and this is sufficient to convince us that the performers of the ancient drama could not possibly in masks excite the passions of nature no excellence of voice or gesture of action or emphasis could compensate for the exclusion of the immediate interpreters of the soul the living speech of the eye and varied expression of the countenance  after the major had leisurely traversed the full length of the room and inimitably executed the whole of his part he retired to undress and assume a new appearance  mean while two females entered in very unusal habits the first was dressed in a choice collection of old english and scotch ballads from chevy chase and the fragment of hardy canute down to barbara allen and the babes in the wood the other was all hung from top to bottom with lookingglasses  immediately the crowd gathered about them all who were fond of their own history preferable to that of others paid their homage in a circling throng to the queen of the lookingglasses while the few who preferred instruction were intent in perusing the fair who was covered with knowledge but the lady of the mirrors did not long retain her votaries her glasses were all emblems of her own disposition they were the glasses of scandal and calumny and represented the human species in the most distorted view some lengthened and some widened their objects  measure while others wholly in and turned them topsy turvy all  away in disgust from such prospects or their own persons and the reflecting lady was justly lest to glitter apart from society  the next who entered was a goliath all sheathed in complete steel he advanced with slow and majestic steps to the sideboard and asking for a flask of champain turned it down without taking it once from his head he then demanded another and another and so on till the providore who had looked and longed in vain to see him drop ran pannicstruck to his master and in a half whisper said my lord your cellars will scarcely suffice to quench the thirst of one man here he has already turned down fifteen flasks of champain and still is unsatisfied and calls for more then give him fifteen hogsheads replied the earl laughing and if that will not answer send out for another set  in the mean time the mailed champion had withdrawn from the sideboard and with a large drinking glass in his hand advanced till he got into the midst of the assembly he then turned a little instrument that was fixed in a certain part of his double cased armor and filling the glass to the brim he unclasped the lower part of his bever and accosting a peruvian princess who stood just opposite permit me the honor madam says he of drinking your highnesss health so saying the liquor was out of sight in a twinkling will your royal highness continued he be pleased to try how you relish our european wines i am obliged to you sir said she i am actually athirst then raising her mask below she pledged him to the bottom her companion a shining arcadian advanced and requested the same favor then another and another lady and several others in succession all of whom he graciously gratified till he was nearly exhausted some of the men then pressed to him and entreated for a glass no no gentlemen said he go and be served elsewhere i am a merchant for ladies alone i import no liquors for vile male animals  our former acquaintance mr hardy had adventured according to promise without a masque after looking about a while for some object of his gallantry he fixed upon a lady of a very elegant shape and sprightly appearance  when they had bandied between them some occasional chat of more smartness than humor and more wit than meaning he called for a favorite air and led the fair one a minuet in which they both performed assez bien  he now began to grow more warm in his addresses if your face madam said he should happen to be answerable to the enchantments of your form and the siren in your voice i beseech you to keep that mask on for ever the safety of mankind is interested in my request but suppose said she that my face should happen to prove an antidote to the danger of my other charms then madam let me see it by all means and make haste i pray you before i am past remedy i see said she tittering i see that you are already more than half a dying man poor wretch i pity you and have taken it into my head to slay you outright in order to put you out of pain  so saying she drew her mask on one side and showed him indeed a very lovely countenance but while his flood of complimentary eloquence was just upon breaking forth hush sir cried the lady i will not hear a syllable till you first return the compliment that i have paid you and let me see what you have got under that vizard of yours here hardy in spite of impudence stood mute with astonishment the lady burst into a laugh the joke was caught and spread like wild fire the laugh grew universal all eyes were on poor hardy and a hundred tongues cried at once your masque sir your masque take off your masque for the lady this was something more than human assurance could stand hardy retired with precipitate confusion and justly suffered for the presumption of his boasted facility of conquests over the fair  our hero had hitherto kept himself concealed being secretly ashamed of the luster of his apparel but at mr fentons desire he laid his cloak aside and instantly all the eyes of the assembly were upon him in order to avoid their gaze he advanced into the throng where a parcel of circling females asked him a number of insignificant questions to which he returned in kind answers pretty nearly as insignificant  at length a diana approached whose diamond crescent was of the value of a princely ransom she took him carelessly by the hand and said come brother mercury let us give these mortals a sample of what we coelestials can perform lead where you please madam said harry i cannot miss my way while i tread in the light of so fair a moon  the lady called to the orchestre for a saraband and all made ample room attentive to the motions of the shining pair  the dance began and the spectators in a manner suppressed their breathing for fear of giving or receiving the smallest interruption the performers stepped music their action was grace and they seemed with difficulty retained to the floor over which they moved they ended and the assembly was still mute with astonishment till they broke out into a general murmur of praise  mr mercury said diana the story of argus tells us that you were formerly accustomed to set folk to sleep but for the present you have opened all eyes to observation ah madam answered harry could i have guessed at the moon that was to shine this night i should have assumed a very different character what character i pray you that of endymion madam i wish she whispered that you were a prince or that i were a peasant and so saying she turned from him and mixed in the crowd  harry was next addressed by a shepherdess and again by a nun but he declined as honorably as he could to tend the flock of the one or to be the cause of any breach of vows in the other observing to her that she had already taken the veil the boys a fool said she i know said harry  a gipsy then accosted and taking him by the hand will you be pleased sir to be told your fortune said she by no means my sweet voiced cassandra answered harry i would avoid above all things prying into futurity knowledge sir is surely desirable and above all foreknowledge not so said harry foreknowledge of evil would but double the misery and foreknowledge of good would deprive me of hope by certainty and hope is a blessing perhaps preferable to possession tell me sir and tell me truly did you ever yet see the girl that you could like yes madam two or three for whom i have conceived a very tender friendship but no one yet for whom i have conceived a passion ah then mr mercury said the gentle prophetess i have only to desire the last cast of your office when i am dead be so grateful as to waft my friendly spirit to the shades of elysium there to join dido and other unfortunate lovers  so saying she turned and retired with a sigh that entered and sunk into the heart of our hero  the company now began to depart when the earl of albemarle coming up to harry took him a little apart and throwing his arm over his shoulder pressed him to him and said my dear fellow you have done me signal honor this night pray double the favor to me by letting me see you again speedily and as often as you can for the present you must not go till their majestys have spoke with you not to night so please your excellency answered harry at all other times i shall be ready to attend and serve their majestys without any masque  the next morning mr fenton was much surprised by a visit from the great man mr dominic had apprised his master where he was to be found during breakfast the earl pressed eagerly for harrys attendance at court and promised every advantage and honor that the crown could bestow you must pardon me my lord said mr fenton i am willing to advance to you two hundred thousand pounds more toward his majestys present expedition against the french whom i look upon to be our natural and salutary enemies they are as carthage was to rome they hold us in exercise and keep a quarrelsome people from falling out among themselves indeed my lord i am desirous of gratifying my royal master with any thing except the sacrifice of my child i cannot part with him till his education is completed and then if he answers my expectations i doubt i may be more unwilling to part with him than ever  in the afternoon our company went again to the tower to see as well as to hear the recent story of the great lion and the little dog  they found the place thronged and all were obliged to pay treble prices on account of the unprecedented novelty of the show so that the keeper in a short space acquired a little fortune  the great cage in the front was occupied by a beast who by way of preeminence was called the kings lion and while he traversed the limits of his straitened dominions he was attended by a small and very beautiful black spaniel who frisked and gambolled about him and at times would pretend to snarl and bite at him and again the noble animal with an air of fond complacence would hold down his head while the little creature licked his formidable chops their history as the keeper related was this  it was customary for all who were unable or unwilling to pay their sixpence to bring a dog or cat as an oblation to the beasts in lieu of money to the keeper among others a fellow had caught up this pretty black spaniel in the streets and he was accordingly thrown into the cage of the great lion immediately the little animal trembled and shivered and crouched and threw itself on its back and put forth its tongue and held up its paws in supplicatory attitudes as an acknowledgment of superior power and praying for mercy in the mean time the lordly brute instead of devouring it beheld it with an eye of philosophic inspection he turned it over with one paw and then turned it with the other and smelled to it and seemed desirous of courting a further acquaintance  the keeper on seeing this brought a large mess of his own familydinner but the lion kept aloof and refused to eat keeping his eye on the dog and inviting him as it were to be his taster at length the little animals fears being something abated and his appetite quickened by the smell of the victuals he approached flowly and with trembling ventured to eat the lion then advanced gently and began to partake and they finished their meal very lovingly together  from this day the strictest friendship commenced between them a friendship consisting of all possible affection and tenderness on the part of the lion and of the utmost confidence and boldness on the part of the dog insomuch that he would lay himself down to sleep within the fangs and under the jaws of his terrible patron  a gentleman who had lost the spaniel and had advertised a reward of two guineas to the finder at length heared of the adventure and went to reclaim his dog you see sir said the keeper it would be a great pity to part such loving friends however if you insist upon your property you must even be pleased to take him yourself it is a task that i would not engage in for five hundred guineas the gentleman rose into great wrath but finally chose to acquiesce rather than have a personal dispute with the lion  as mr fenton had a curiosity to see the two friends eat together he sent for twenty pounds of boiled beef which was accordingly cut in pieces and given into the cage when immediately the little brute whose appetite happened to be eager art the time was desirous of making a monopoly of the whole and putting his paws upon the meat and grumbling and barking he audaciously flew in the face of the lion but the generous creature instead of being offended by his impotent companion started back and seemed terrified at the fury of his attack neither attempted to eat a bit till his favorite had tacitly given permission  when they were both gorged the lion stretched and turned himself and lay down in an evident posture for repose but this his sportive companion would not admit he frisked and gamboled about him barked at him would now scrape and tear at his head with his claws and again seize him by the ear and bite and pull away while the noble beast appeared affected by no other sentiment save that of pleasure and complacence  but let us proceed to the tragic catastrophe of this extraordinary story a story still known to many as delivered down by tradition from father to son  in about twelve months the little spaniel sickened and died and left his loving patron the most desolate of creatures for a time the lion did not appear to conceive otherwise than that his favorite was asleep he would continue to smell to him and then would stir him with his nose and turn him over with his paw but finding that all his efforts to awake him were vain he would traverse his cage from end to end at a swift and uneasy pace then stop and look down upon him with a fixed and drooping regard and again lift his head on high and open his horrible throat and prolong a roar as of distant thunder for several minutes together  they attempted but in vain to convey the carcass from him he watched it perpetually and would suffer nothing to touch it the keeper then endeavored to tempt him with a variety of victuals but he turned from all that was offered with loathing they then put several living dogs into his cage and these he instantly tore piecemeal but left their members on the floor his passions being thus inflamed he would dart his fangs into the boards and pluck away large splinters and again grapple at the bars of his cage and seem enraged at his restraint from tearing the world to pieces  again as quite spent he would stretch himself by the remains of his beloved associate and gather him in with his paws and put him to his bosom and then utter under roars of such a terrible melancholy as seemed to threaten all around for the loss of his little playfellow the only friend the only companion that he had upon earth  for five days he thus languished and gradually declined without taking any sustenance or admitting any comfort till one morning he was found dead with his head lovingly reclined on the carcass of his little friend they were both interred together and their grave plentifully watered by the tears of the keeper and his loudly lamenting family  but to return  when our company were on their way from the tower to their lodgings sir said harry what we have just seen reminds me of the opinion of my friend peter patience that one who is fearless cannot be provoked you saw how that little teasing petulant wretch had the insolence to fly in the face of his benefactor without offending or exciting in him any kind of resentment true harry for the lion was sensible that his testy companion was little and impotent and depended upon him and had confidence in his clemency and therefore he loved him with all his faults anger however in some cases is not only allowable but becomes a duty the scripture says be angry but sin not we ought to feel and fear for others and lust violence and oppression of every sort will excite the indignation of a generous and benevolent person though he may not fear for himself  after supper harry appeared to ruminate and said how comes it sir that creatures not endued with reason or conscience shall yet in the affections that are peculiarly called humane exceed even most of the human species you have seen that it was the case between the lion and little dog  it was the opinion my harry of an ancient philosopher that god was the soul and spirit of brutes and this he judged from observing that what we call instinct was incomparably wiser more sagacious and more accomplished for attaining its ends throughout its sphere of action than the most perfect human reason now had this philosopher instead of saying that god was the soul of brutes barely alleged that he ruled and dictated within them he would not have gone a tittle wide of the truth  god indeed is himself the beauty and the benefit of all his works as they cannot exist but in him and by him so his impression is upon them and his impregnation is through them  though the elements and all that we know of nature and creature have a mixture of natural and physical evil god is however throughout an internal though often a hidden principal of good and never wholly departs from his right of dominion and operation in his creatures but is and is alone the beauty and beneficence the whole glory and graciousness that can possibly be in them  as the apostle says the invisible things of god are made manifest and visible by the things that are seen he is the secret and central light that kindles up the sun his dazzling representative and he lives enlightens and comforts in the diffusion of his beams  his spirit inspires and actuates the air and is in it a breath of life to all his creatures he blooms in the blossom and unfolds in the rose he is fragrance in flowers and flavor in fruits he holds infinitude within a speck and opens his world of wonders in the minims of nature he is the virtue of every heart that is softened by a sense of pity or touch of benevolence he coos in the turtle and bleats in the lamb and through the paps of the stern bear and implacable tygress he yields forth the milk of loving kindness to their little ones even my harry when we hear the delicious enchantment of music it is but an external sketch a distant and faint echo of those sentimental and rapturous tuneings that rise up throughout the immensity of our god from eternity to eternity  thus all things are secretly pregnant with their god and the lover of sinners the universal redeemer is a principle of good within them that contends with the malignity of their lapsed state and thus as the apostle speaks all nature is in travail and groaneth to be delivered from the evil till the breath of the love of god shall kindle up the final fire out of which the new heavens and new earth shall come forth as gold seven times refined to shine for ever and ever  harry agreeable to his covenant with signor volanti had penned the following advertisement and inserted it in all the public papers to wit  on saturday next between the hours of ten and twelve in the forenoon the celebrated dominico jachimo tonino volanti will take his flight from the spire of clements steeple and alight at the distance of two bows shot on the strand and this he will perform before the eyes of all people  on the impatiently expected morning harry took mr clement with him in a hack chaise and found an innumerable concourse as well of the gentry in their coaches as of the populace on foot london had poured forth its numbers to behold this astonishing flight the windows were all eyes on every side and the house tops were hung with clusters of people as of bees  after harry had surveyed the crowd with inward titillation he whispered to clement and said you shall see now what a sudden discomfiture i will make of this huge army  he then put forth his head and said to all around dont ye yet perceive my friends what fools we are all made dont ye remember that this is the first of april  he had scarce spoke the words when they spread from man to man and soon were muttered throughout the assembly and then louder and more loud the first of april the first of april was repeated all about  the company now began to be in motion all heads were instantly withdrawn from the late thronged windows and the house tops began to be cleared with a shameful caution  immediately was heard the rolling of many wheels and the lashing of many whips while every coachman pressed through the crowd impatient to deliver his honorable freight from the public shame but the populace now began to relish a joke that was so much against their betters and in peals of laughter and united shouts of triumph they echoed and reechoed after them april fools april fools  among others lord bottom had come with his friend rakely in an elevated phaeton of which his lordship was charioteer as they happened to brush close by harrys carriage swearing and puffing and lashing and cursing at the crowd harry cried to his old enemy you need not be in so violent a hurry my lord perhaps you are not so great a foot as you imagine  the fools of fashion were scarce withdrawn when a long and strong rope was let down from the top of the steeple to which it was fastened at the upper end a man then laying hold on it below dragged it along through the crowd and braced it at a great distance to an iron ring that was stapled into a post purposely sunk on a level with the pavement they then brought a large and well stuffed feather bed and fixed it under the cord where it joined the ring  in the mean time volanti appeared on the top of the steeple and bending cautiously forward and getting the cord within an iron groove that was braced to his bosom he pushed himself onward and with a kindling rapidity flew over the heads of the shouting multitude poising himself with expanded legs and arms as he passed till he was landed without damage on his yielding receiver and in the very next papers harry published the following advertisement to wit  before the first of april next signor dominico jachimo tonino volanti by the help of canvas wings contrived for the purpose proposes to fly over sea from dover to calais and invites all his london friends to come and see him set out  on the evening of the following monday our company went to the kings theater and mr clement told mr fenton by the way how harry had made double fools of the citizens first in bringing them together and then in sending them away  the moor of venice was the appointed entertainment for the night mr montfort was to perform the part of othello mrs montfort that of emilia and miss bracegirdle their young ward the part of desdemona  all was carried on to the satisfaction of the audience till they were somewhat advanced in the fourth act when lord mohun as milton has it flown with insolence and wine entered and seated himself in one of the stageboxes  he gave his whole attention and applause to the fair desdemona and as soon as the act was over he slipped behind the scenes and began to address her in a strain of licentious gallantry but as miss bracegirdle answered him with a cold kind of disdain his nobility was piqued and catching her about the neck he thrust his hand into her bosom  the girl instantly shrieked and montfort coming up forbear my lord said he the young gentlewoman is virtuous and of good education and such treatment is unbeseeming a man of honor virtue and education among actors and actresses exclaimed his lordship hence vile plebeian and know your distance better and so saying he proceeded to an action of still greater indecency  the unhappy montfort then cried i will not suffer such usage from any man under the crown i am her guardian it is my duty to protect her and at the same time he pushed away his lordship with some violence a blow a blow cried mohun and from a vagabond too wretch take the instant chastisement of your insolence then springing back he suddenly plucked out his sword and ran the worthy montfort through the body who immediately dropped and expired on the spot  the women instantly uttered shriek after shriek and falling on the body sent forth repeated cries of the bitterest lamentation the audience were then in an uproar and called aloud to know the meaning of the disturbance when an actor hastily advanced to the front of the stage and with wringing hands informed them of what had happened  our hero thereupon started up and putting one hand between the spikes he vaulted high over them into the stage and drawing out his sword he ran about searching for and enquiring after the murderer as did some other gentlemen who hastened round for the purpose but lord mohun for the present had made his escape and though he was afterward indicted the great ones contrived means for quashing the affair and he was never brought to trial  the blood of the good montfort however was not long unattoned lord mohun shortly after fell by the hand of the duke of hamilton in a duel behind montague house  harry had now seen whatever london could exhibit of elegant curious or pleasing and mr fenton judged it time to hold up to him the melancholy reverse of this picture to show him the house of mourning the end of all men to show him the dreary shades and frightful passages of mortality which humanity shudders to think of but through which human nature of necessity must go  for this purpose he took him to the general hospital where death opened all his gates and showed himself in all his forms but the great poet on this occasion has anticipated all description   immediately a place before his eyes appeared  sad noisome dark a lazarhouse it seemed wherein were laid numbers of all diseased all maladies of ghastly spasm of racking torture qualms of heartsick agony  all fevrous kinds convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs intestine stone and ulcer cholic pangs daemoniac phrenzy moping melancholy and moon struck madness pining atrophy dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums dire was the tossing deep the groans  despair tended the sick busiest from couch to couch and over them triumphant death his dart shook but delayed to strike though often invoked with vows as their chief good milton while mr fenton led his pupil through groaning galleries and the chambers of death and disease harry let down the leaf of his hat and drew it over his eyes to conceal his emotions all that day he was silent and his countenance downcast and at night he hastened to bed where he wept a large tribute to the mournfully inevitable condition of mans miserable state upon earth  the next day mr fenton took him to the bethlehem hospital for idiots and lunatics but when harry beheld and contemplated objects so shocking to thought so terrible to sight when he had contemplated i say the ruin above all ruins human intelligence and human reason so fearfully overthrown where the ideas of the soul though distorted and misplaced are quick and all alive to horror and agony he grew sick and turned pale and suddenly catching his uncle by the arm come sir let us go said he i can stand this no longer  when they had reached home and that harry was more composed are all the miseries sir said he that we have witnessed these two days the consequences of sin even so indeed my harry all these and thousands more equally pitiable and disgusting are the natural progeny of that woebegetting parent nor are those miseries confined to hospitals alone every house nay every bosom is a certain though secret lazarhouse where the sick couch is preparing with all the dismal apparatus for tears and lamentations for agonies and death  since that is the case sir who would laugh any more is it not like feasting in the midst of famine and dancing amid the tombs  all things in their season my dear provided that those who laugh be as though they laughed not remembring that they must weep and provided that those who weep be as though they wept not having joy in their knowledge that the fashion of this world quickly passes away  on the following day mr fenton returned to hamstead but left three thousand pounds with harry and mr clement to be disposed of at their discretion among the poor of the several parishes of london and westminster  for this beneficent purpose they applied to the clergy and churchwardens of the respective parishes but did not wholly trust to their recommendation they witnessed in person the merits of the several objects after the example of their divine master they went about doing good changing the face of affliction into cheer turning the voice of mourning into songs of thanksgiving lightening every burden supplying every want and binding up the broken of heart  one evening as our companions were drinking tea in the templeexchange coffeehouse a man advanced in years but of a very respectable appearance got up and addressed the assembly  gentlemen said he among the several hospitals and other charitable foundations that have done honor to the humanity of the inhabitants of this city there is one still wanting which as i conceive above all others would give distinction to the beneficence of its founders it is a house for repenting prostitutes an assylum for unhappy wretches who have no other home to whom all doors are shut to whom no haven is open no habitation or hole for rest upon the face of the earth  most of them have been seduced from native innocence and modesty by the arts of cruel men many have been deceived under promise and vows of marriage some under the appearance of the actual ceremony and afterward abandoned or turned forth to infamy by their barbarous and base undoers shall no place then be left for repentance even to those who do repent forbid it charity forbid it manhood man is born the natural protector of the weakness of woman and if he has not been able to guard her innocence from invasion he ought at least to provide a reception for her return to virtue  i have the plan of this charitable foundation in my pocket and if any of you gentlemen approve my proposal and are willing to subscribe or to solicit your friends to so beneficent a purpose i request your company to the leg tavern over the way  here the speaker walked toward the door and was followed by harry and clement and thirteen or fourteen more of the assembly  when a flask of port was brought and the company seated round a large table the gentleman produced his plan with a summary of the rules and institutes for the conduct of the house which he proposed to call the magdalenhouse a plan which has since been espoused and happily executed by others without ascribing any of the merit to the first projector  as all present applauded the manner of the scheme and intention of the charity each of them subscribed from a hundred to twenty pounds till it came to harrys turn who subscribed a thousand pounds in mr fentons name  i suppose sir said one of the company that your largest contributions will arise from the ladies as the whole is intended for the benefit of the sex i shall not answered the gentleman apply to a single lady on this occasion not one of them will dare to contribute a penny lest it should be thought that they partly allow in themselves the vices that they can pardon or patronize in others it is this that makes the case of the wretches whom we are about to befriend deplorable beyond measure they are first betrayed by our sex and then driven out to irretrievable infamy and misery by their own for women to women are as turkeys to turkeys do but cast a little dirt upon the head of any one of them and the rest of the flock combine in an instant to pick out her eyes and to tear her to pieces  mr mole a learned philosopher and a man of principal figure in the present company then addressed the projector and said if you will admit me sir into partnership in the conduct of your scheme i will engage to levy contributions to the amount of some thousands over and above the hundred i have already subscribed you are heartily welcome sir replied the gentleman either to join or take the conduct of the whole upon yourself provided the good is done i care not by what means all my ends will be answered i wish to be nameless that is not fair neither said another of the company you mr goodville had the trouble of contriving this business and you ought at least to have the honor if not the conduct of your own plan  mr goodville mr goodville exclaimed clement in a surprise eagerly staring at him and recollecting as from a dream the altered features of his quondam friend and benefactor pray sir do you remember any thing of one clement a worthless young fellow whom once in your goodness you condescended to patronize clement clement cried mr goodville getting up and hastening to him and catching him in his arms my dear my dear clement my man of merit and misfortunes how rejoiced am i to find you god be praised god be praised it is at length in my power to do something material for you but come with me to another room i have something to say to you we will leave these gentlemen the while to think further of the plan that lies before them  when mr goodville and clement had withdrawn mr mole said one of the company you are concerned in a number of these public benefactions yes gentlemen answered mole i believe there is no charitable institution of any note in london in which i am not a trustee and to which i am not a contributer for though i do not set up for sanctification by faith yet i think i may pretend to some justification by charity let the vulgar herd pay their priesthood for cheating them out of their senses i give nothing to the fat impostors or their lucrative fable my substance is little enough for myself and the poor why pray sir said harry are you not a christian no indeed master answered mole nor any man who has sense enough to think for himself be pleased then cried harry to hand me that paper a moment here sir i dash my name and contribution from the list of the subscribers he who denies glory to god in the highest can never have peace or good will toward men and so sir you shall never be the almoner of a penny of my money  you talk as you look my dear cried mole like one just eloped from the nursery where you were affrighted by tales of ghosts and hobgoblins i acknowledge gentlemen the benefit and beauty of morality in its fullest extent and had jesus the christian prophet confined himself to his system of moral precepts i think he would justly have been esteemed the greatest philosopher and legislator that ever breathed but when he or rather his disciples in his name in order to enhance the authority of their mission pretended to divinity in their master the low bred and ignorant wretches pulled together against the grain and compounded such a strange medley of fighting inconsistencies and selfevident absurdities as are wholly eversive of every principle of right reason and common sense they taught that god was made a man that in order to expiate the sins of the world the innocent was appointed to suffer for the guilty that the sins of all offenders were to be imputed to one who had never offended and that the righteousness of him who had never offended was to be imputed to criminals of the deepest dye that the creator submitted himself to the malignity of his creatures and that god himself died a shameful death on the cross and this gentlemen makes such a heap of ridiculous incoherencies such contradictions in sense and terms as exceeds even the worship of apes and serpents leeks and onions and the other garbage of egypt  you are a villain and a thief and a liar cried harry altogether enflamed with choler mole on hearing these terms of highest affront and reproach instantly caught up a bottle and threw it at our heros head but it happily missed him and only bruised the fleshy part of the shoulder of the gentleman who sat next harry instantly sprung up and made at mole while the company rose also and attempted to interfere but some he cast on one hand and some on the other and overturning such as directly opposed him he reached mole and with one blow of his fist on the temple laid him motionless along the floor then looking down on his adversary i should be sorry said he that the wretch would die in his present state of reprobacy here drawer run quickly and bring me a surgeon then returning to his place he sat down with great composure  after a pause he looked around i hope gentlemen said he that none of you are hurt indeed i am much concerned for having in any degree contributed to your disturbance but had any of you a dear benefactor and patron to whom you were bound beyond measure whom you loved and honored above all things could ye bear to hear him defamed and vilified to your face no certainly answered one no man could bear it cried another but pray asked a third how came you to call the gentleman a thief  because replied our hero he attempted to rob me of my whole estate he endeavored to thieve from me the only friend i had in the universe the friend of my heart the peace and rest of my bosom my infinite treasure my never ending delight the friend without whom i would not choose to be without whom existence would become a curse and an abhorrence unto me happy young creature exclaimed an elderly gentleman i understand you you mean your christ and my christ the friend who has already opened his early heaven within you  by this mr mole began to move whereupon harry rose and putting his hand in his pocket here gentlemen said he is one guinea for the surgeon and another for the reckoning when my companion returns be pleased to tell him i am gone to our lodgings for i will not stay to hold further converse or altercation with that bane of society that pest which the rulers in darkness have commissioned to spread contagion distemper and death among men  harry went early to bed but lay restless and much disturbed in his spirit all night mr clement had heared the particulars of our heros behavior which he partly disapproved but as he saw him already dejected he did not choose to expostulate with him for the present  the next day they returned to hamstead where mr fenton notwithstanding the constrained smiles of his harry observed an unusual cloud and uneasiness in his countenance i want to speak with you my love said he and beckoning him into his closet he took him affectionately by the hand and made him sit beside him what is the matter my dear said he looking concernedly in his face what is it that has disturbed the peace of the bosom of my beloved  ah sir cried harry i am indeed very unhappy i doubt that i am partly losing my faith and the fear of that has given me inexpressible horror it is like tearing me from a fort out of which there is no home or rest for me in the universe  here harry made a recital of the late affair to his patron and having closed his narrative is not this very wonderful sir said he how or where in the world could this mole have mustered together such arguments against reason such appearances against truth how must the vulgar and illiterate be staggered by such objections when even i who have been bred as i may say at the feet of such a gamaliel have not been able to answer them otherwise than by the chastisement which the blasphemer received at my hand  here mr fenton smiled and said dont be alarmed my love we shall quickly dispel the thin mists of infidelity that were collected to shut the sun of righteousness from your eye i confess indeed that this spawn of antichrist has compiled a summary of all that has ever been uttered against the lamb who was slain from the foundation of the word yet he is but a mole in nature as well as name and he with his brothermoles know no more and see no further than the little heap of dirt and rubbish that the working of their own purblind and floundering reason has cast about them  sacred depths and stupendous mysteries belong to this matter and when you are able to bear them they shall be clearly and fully unfolded to you my harry in the mean space a few simple observations will suffice to reestablish the peace of your sweet and pious heart  as christianity was instituted for the salvation of the vulgar the principal truths thereof are very obvious and plain and want no learning no letters to inculcate or teach them they speak the language of nature and all nature is expressive of the sense and the sound thereof whatever is within you whatever is without you cries aloud for a savior for sin has been as the mezentius of whom you read in virgil who bound the bodies of the dead to the persons of the living thus it is that the sin of fallen angels and of fallen man has bound change and corruption distemperature and death to the elements to the vegetables to animals and even to the immortal image of god himself in the humanity so that all things cry out with the apostle saint paul who shall deliver me from the body of this death so that all things cry out with the apostle saint peter save lord or i perish  these are inevitable truths my harry which all men at some time must feel throughout their existence whether they read them or not and he alone who never experienced nor ever shall experience frailty error or sickness pain anguish or dissolution is exempt from our solar system of salvation from sin  but what sort of a savior is it for whom all things cry so loudly is it a dry moralist a legislator of bare and external precepts such as your molephilosopher required our christ to be no my darling no the influence and existence of the redeemer of nature must at least be as extensive as nature herself  things are defiled and corrupted throughout they are distempered and devoted to death from the inmost essence of their being and nothing under him in whom they live and move and have their being can redeem can restore them  o sir exclaimed harry his countenance brightening up why could i not think of this i should then have been able to foil my malignant adversary even at his own weapons  our jesus himself continued mr fenton appeals to the truth i have told you where he says to the sick of the palsy son be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven thee but when the pharisees thereupon concluded that he blasphemed he demonstrated his influence in and over the soul by the sensible evidence of his operation and influence in and over the body what reason ye in your hearts said jesus whether is it easier to say thy sins be forgiven thee or to say rise up and walk then said he to the sick of the palsy arise and take up thy couch and go to thine house and immediately he rose up before them and took up that whereon he had been carried and departed to his own house glorifying god  here it was necessary for the performance of this wonderful and instantaneous cure that jesus should instantly operate in and through every member nerve and fiber of the sick of the palsy and it was equally necessary for that purpose that the sick of the palsy should have lived and have had his being in jesus in like manner also his sins must have been pardoned by an inward salvation by imparting to the will of the sinner a new and rectified will and by informing his spirit with a detestation of evil and a love of goodness and virtue  but pray sir if it is not too profound a mystery for me be pleased to inform me how god could be made man for this was one of the principal objections of mole  god was never made man my harry god cannot be debased he could not degrade himself by any change into manhood though he could exalt and assume humanity into god neither could god die or suffer to this christ himself who was god and man bears testimony where he cries out in the agonies of his suffering humanity my god my god why have thou forsaken me and again where crying with a loud voice he said father into thy hands i commend my spirit  but you are leading me something deeper than i chose to go for the present  from eternity god saw that should he produce any creatures in his own image to be glorious by his likeness and happy by his communication he must of necessity create them intelligent and free and that consequently as creatures they must be finite and that as creatures who were free they should also be fallible  he therefore saw that all might fall and he also foresaw that some would fall but his graciousness had provided two infallible remedies for this evil of fallibility he had provided a savior and he had also provided suffering the savior was to restore them by an inward redemption by a reinfusion and new birth of his own nature in their essence and suffering was to prepare and open his way by humbling their pride by mortifying their lust and thus compelling them to unfold their hearts to their own happiness  indeed had no creature ever fallen god could not have been duly glorified to all eternity millions of his infinitely amiable qualities must have lain an inscrutable secret to worlds upon worlds while all his creatures were happy in him and participated of him no distinction could be duly made between them and their creator had evil never been goodness would have sunk unspeakably in the sense of its value which is now infinitely heightened and glorified by the contrast free grace and free mercy on the part of our god and penitence and thanksgiving on the part of humbled sinners would have been prevented of their thousand endearing connections and all the amities and charities throughout the brotherhood of man all the melting and fond relations which the vinechrist infuses throughout his ingrafted branches bearing blossoms and fruits of divine fragrance and flavor must ever have remained unblessing and as dead from eternity to eternity  but our god my child is as powerful as he is gracious and wise to bring light out of darkness and life out of death and infinite and ever enduring good out of the limited and short state of transitory evil  to prove that no being beneath himself could stand of their own sufficiency god permitted his two principal creatures the most immediate and most glorious representatives of his divine perfections to fall off from their allegiance and consequently from their happiness with all their progeny the first was the angel lucifer who fell through pride and the second was the man adam who fell through lust these two capital sins of pride and of lust are the genuine parents of all moral and natural evil of all the guilt and misery that ever did or ever can arise throughout duration and our heavenly father in his love has appointed intense suffering to abate and abase the one and to mortify and slay the other that transgressors may finally be capable of his mercy through the salvation and grace of his christ  the first of these archfelons deemed himself worthy of deity and being unexperienced in the power with whom he had to contend he attempted to arrogate all worship to himself and to rob his divine benefactor of glory and godhead  the second of these felons was tempted by the first to aspire through his own merits at a godlike independence to cast off his allegiance to the author of his being and to expect intelligence and knowledge from the sensual fruits of this world after which he lusted he accordingly took and eat of the tree that was pregnant with all the goods and all the evils of this external elementary and transient system according to his faith it was done unto him according to his lust his desire was accomplished his nature became a partaker of temporary nature and he fell with his progeny into all the depravity and evils that the sin of fallen lucifer had introduced into these vast regions now made more exceedingly corrupt and sinful by the sin of fallen adam  why pray sir demanded harry had lucifer any concern in this world before the fall of our first parents  yes my dear all the space that is now occupied by this earth and these elements with the sun moon and stars to an inconceivable extent was once the heaven and dominion of lucifer and his angels but when by their apostasy from the light and love and goodness of god they had caused darkness and malignity envy rage and uproar and every species of evil and horror to be predominant throughout their kingdom god determined by a new creation to take it out of their hands accordingly he compacted it into the present system of temporary nature whose duration is to be measured by the revolution of our luminaries until the appointed period of the great consummation when all the malignity that remains and is compacted therein shall be finally done away  to this truth moses bears testimony where he tells you that at the commencement of creation darkness was upon the face of the great deep and again where he tells you that the tree of the knowledge of the goods and evils of this world sprung up even in the midst of the paradise of god but it is altogether impious and blasphemous to suppose that god would create evil or infuse a tendency thereto into any of his works again the same truth is attested by many passages of the sacred writings where lucifer or satan tells christ to his face that this world with all its glories are his portion and property that they were delivered unto him and that he gives them to whomsoever he will and again where christ calls him the prince of the air and again where he says the prince of this world comes and has no part in me  now when god by his new creation had delivered this system of things from the influence and dominion of evil spirits they became altogether prisoners in their own darkness but when adam the second lord of this vast domain by a second apostasy had brought additional sin and evil into temporary nature the paradise of god that was over all vanished and the new guilt of adam opened a new and wide gate for the readmission of lucifer into his ancient possessions and he remains a prince and a ruler in the elements and hearts of men unto this evil day  these two capital apostates lucifer and adam who had thus robbed their kind god of their affections and allegiance were thereafter represented by the two thieves who suffered in company with christ who reached out to them a bleeding arm of his mercy on either hand the one accepted his grace and on that day entered paradise along with his lord the other rejected the christ with contempt and reproach and therefore if ever reclaimable must be constrained by suffering to open his heart to redemption when after a process of many many agonizing ages blaspheming and indignantly spurning at the power of his punisher he may be compelled to cry out o seed of the woman heal heal the head thou have crushed and admit me also though last to some part the least portion of thy pardoning salvation  these two my harry even lucifer and adam were also the thieves among whom the traveller fell going from jerusalem to jericho from the city and place of peace to the place of destruction he represented the wretched race of fallen man whom lucifer and their first father had robbed of all their substance and stripped of their robe of righteousness and wounded and left half dead in trespasses and sins neither did the law or the priesthood avail any thing for their cure till jesus the good samaritan had compassion upon them and bound up their wounds pouring therein the oil of his grace and the wine of his gladness and expended two pence even the two precious pence of his own body and blood for perfecting their recovery  but my dearest sir said harry if my question does not intrude pray how was it consistent with justice that the sufferings of the innocent should atone both for and instead of the guilty for this also was one of moles cardinal objections  your question said mr fenton falls aptly in its place when adam as i have told you apostatised from his god and lusted after the gross and sensual fruits of this world and fed upon them and thereupon became a partaker of their nature and malignity he fell from his paradise and sovereignty together and he became a poor subject and miserable slave to all the evils and inclemencies of that temporary nature over which he had been constituted a throned lord and controuler  here was a deep and a woeful fall my harry from sovereignty to slavery from eternity into time from immortality into corruption from bliss into misery and from life into death the very state in which the wretched heirs of his fallen nature find themselves at this day how then was he to rise if ever to rise again could this be effected by any powers of his own if he did not stand in the state of his strength how shall he recover and be able to reascend in the state of his weakness how think you my harry a self evident impossibility answered harry  here then continued mr fenton we find the universe of man depraved fallen and sunk into the darkness of sin and error into the dungeon of gross and corruptible flesh and circled about and closed in by the barriers and gates of death and these prisons were to be broken through these gates were to be burst open before he could reenter upon light and immortality all the enemies who had conquered man sin satan and temptation were also to be conquered but how was this to be done a world lay at stake and the great question was whether the whole race of man should continue in endless guilt and misery or be restored to everduring purity and blessedness wherefore what all the powers of creation were not able to attempt jesus in the humanity undertook to accomplish  here you see my child that justice had little to do in the case it was not the justice of punishment but the mercy of deliverance that the love of our heavenly father required justice indeed affirmed that suffering was due to sin and was the necessary attendant and consequence thereof but this also the love of our christ willingly took upon himself he conquered suffering through sufferings and was thereby made the perfect and accomplished captain of our salvation he entered into our flesh he went through all the passages of this vale of tears and region of misery into which we were fallen through poverty contempt rejection reproach through all that the rage and rancour of men and devils could inflict his bloody sweat and anguishing horrors of hell bonds buffetings spittings scourgings the bloody mockery of a thorny crown and all the soulrending tortures of an agonizing crucifixion till at last he triumphantly cried it is finished and gave up the ghost from the cross he descended into the grave from the grave again he rose in glory and ascended into heaven where he led captivity captive and showed the powers of darkness bound that he might lead all the followers of his beatific cross in his own divine process to conquest through sufferings to glory through abasement to exaltation through humiliation through death unto life and through the calamities of time to a never ending ever blessing ever joyful eternity  but sir said harry was the humanity of our blessed savior the same as ours is for so the scripture seems to intimate where it says he was made man like unto us in all things sin only excepted  this was only spoken answered mr fenton with respect to his outward humanity his creaturely soul indeed and the flesh which he derived from his mortal mother were even as ours are sin only excepted but these were only as the husk or case of his internal and divine humanity which was conceived from the essence of the father by the operation of the holy spirit in the womb of a pure virgin it was this humanity to which jesus was intimately united and that became one with the ever blessed trinity and it was of the ubiquity of this humanity that christ speaks when he says to nicodemus no man has ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven even the son of man which is in heaven but when the external humanity of jesus was by suffering and death prepared to be swallowed up of glory the whole christ was then assumed up into godhead he saw all things in jesus as they were and shall be from eternity to eternity and though the glory of his personal appearance may be visible in certain places yet he is invisibly present in all places and in all hearts begetting in them a new birth of his own divine humanity that their bodies may also be fashioned like unto his glorious body and that when our corruptible shall have put on incorruption and when that our mortal shall have put on immortality we all may be made one as he is in the father and the father in him that we also may be one in them an elevation sure well worth the hardest striving the highest ambition  thus i have shown you my harry the inevitable necessity of the suffering of our innocent christ for the salvation of guilty sinners and this also shows you the equal necessity of his taking upon himself the external imputation of the sins for which he suffered that he might thereby be inwardly imputed to us and become to us and in us the lord our righteousness and be to us a better adam a second and divine father regenerating us to a birth of his own heavenly nature and thus as the first adam died unto god and lived to fallen nature there was a necessity that christ as well in his own person as his redeemed progeny should die to the fallen nature that through him they might live again unto god  o thank you thank you sir cried harry i shall henceforth be enabled to give an account to all who ask of the faith that is in me but pray did the divine humanity of our christ suffer in the crucifixion  i believe it did harry even as our souls are found to suffer in our bodies though of a nature so very different from them it was the suffering of this divine humanity that caused such violent repugnance and convulsions in nature that shut up the world from light even at mid day that rent the rocks that opened the graves and gave up the dead to attend their lord and revive in the life of his resurrection  will you be pleased sir to indulge me in one question more could not god in his omnipotence have affected the salvation of man by some other means than the suffering of our dear christ i think were it to be done again i would rather forfeit my salvation than that he should endure such agony on my account  i will not pretend my harry to give limits or directions to the measures of my god neither to say what he might or might not do within his own world and with regard to his own creatures but it is certain that he chose the most effectual method for compassing his great and eternal purpose that infinite love could dictate infinite wisdom contrive and infinite power execute o my harry how unutterably endeared must this measure make our god to the universe of his creatures and that to all eternity it is herein that the nature of our god is revealed it is hereby alone that he could ever have been duly known known to be the god of love to be nothing but love in this his wonderful work of mercy transcending mercy and of grace transcending grace that he might bring us to glory transcending glory  in this stupendous work of redemption i say jesus makes himself as it were little that we may become great he stoops into manhood that he may exalt us into god he came not arrayed in the fools coat of the luster of this despicable world nor in the weakness of its power nor in the meanness of its dignity but over his immensity he threw the appearance of limitation and with time he invested his eternity and his omnipotence put on frailty and his supremacy put on subjection and with the veil of mortality he shrouded his beauty that he might become familiar to us that we might behold and converse with him face to face as man converses with man and grows fond of his fellow  before the incarnation god was feared in his thunders and adored in the majesty and magnificence of his works but it is in the meek and lowly jesus that he becomes the object of affection in the bleeding the suffering the dying jesus we behold him with weeping gratitude we love him with a love of passion and burning a love that languishes for him that cannot bear to exist without him  how could that perverse people shut their eyes to the divinity of their gracious messiah while he gave such hourly and occular proofs of the power and extent of his godhead in and over all things while he went about doing good carrying healing in his breath in his touch in his garments while the lame sprung up as a bounding roe at his bidding while the tempest heared his voice and was still and the sea spread itself as a carpet beneath the foot of its creator while the deaf ear was opened and the dumb tongue loosed to utterance while he poured the beams of his light upon the newopening eyes of the blindborn gazer and while in death and amidst the tombs his word was life and resurrection  thus my harry you find yourself united to your savior by many endearing and intimate connections by creation by redemption by brotherhood by fatherhood in the flesh in the spirit by his being bone of your bone and spirit of your spirit by being the firstborn of many brethren and by being the divine father of a new and celestial progeny  but what need we further the world from the beginning is fraught with him and speaks of him the world is in itself no other than a history of the two capital and eternally important truths the greatness of the fall in lucifer and adam and the greatness of the redemption in jesus christ these truths are engraven in the rocks as deep as the center they are written on both sides of every leaf in nature all that is within us all that is without us utters forth the same language proclaims the same tidings aloud all ceremonials all institutions of divine authority all ancient predictions and prophecies were pregnant with and in travail of the great deliverance to be achieved by the shiloh who was to come they give us a previous history of his whole process upon earth from his birth to his resurrection as circumstantially as minutely as though it were a bare transcript of what had recently passed before their eyes but i shall only dwell a minute on three principal articles first that messiah was to be god  secondly that he was however to be a suffering messiah  and thirdly that he was to give himself to death for the salvation of sinners  first with respect to his divinity daniel says i saw in the night visions and behold one like unto the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the ancient of days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away again isaiah behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called wonderful counselor the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever  secondly with respect to his character of rejection and suffering who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not he was oppressed and he was afflicted he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb so opens he not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death isaiah  david too says dogs have compassed me the assembly of the wicked have enclosed me they pierced my hands and my feet they part my garments among them and cast lots for my vesture  but a bone of him shall not be broken  they shall look on him whom they pierced  thirdly with respect to his being a willing offering for sin isaiah says in the same chapter surely he has born our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all jeremiah too   here mr fenton was interrupted his man frank entered booted and all bespattered with dirt and having whispered something in his masters ear mr fenton turned aside his head to hide his concern from harry and stepping to his closet locked himself in  but it may be thought full time to return to the headbranch of this noble family  nearly nine years had now elapsed since the earl and his lady had seen or heared of their harry except by two or three anonymous notes in a year giving a short account of his health and accomplishments insomuch that time and long absence had in a measure worn him from the regrets of the family excepting his brother richard on whom harrys generosity in taking his quarrel upon himself had left an affecting and indelible impression  lord richard was indeed sweetly dispositioned by nature and of an aspect and person extremely elegant and as he had tutors in all branches in which he chose to be instructed he learned sufficient by way of amusement to render him one of the most accomplished youths in the nation he was also naturally unassuming and modestly disposed but the unremitted adulation of domestics and dependents with the complimentary artillery of all the neighbors and visitants could not fail of some impression at least so far as to make it evident that he was conscious of his condescension when he became familiar with you  he was however easy to all who applied to him for any favor exceeding charitable to the poor and particularly fond of our harrys fostermother and kind to her for harrys sake  with such amiable qualities he was esteemed and beloved of all and became the little idol of the adjacent country insomuch that when he was seized with the small pox the apprehension and anxiety for him was universal and the great mansion house was hourly circled by people who came crowding to enquire concerning his danger  the eruption was but slight only a few spots on his face and other parts so that my lady was in high triumph on observing that the beauty of her darling should not be defaced but ah how frail is the foundation on which mortality builds for happiness who can ensure it who can arrest it for an hour for a moment on the eleventh day when the physicians pronounced that all was promising and full of hope lord richard was suddenly taken with convulsions and in less than an hour expired  lady enna countess of moreland from whom the seat had been newly denominated ennas field or enfield was present at the death of all that she held most precious upon earth she had never left his chamber since he had taken to his bed and was now carried off in a deep and deathlike swoon she never after recovered her senses except by deplorable starts to lament that she was the most wretched of all that ever were created and on the second day she also expired and was interred in the same tomb with the offspring of her body and the idol of her heart  never was seen such a concourse at any funeral since the funeral of jacob on which all egypt attended they crowded from a distance of thirty miles round but when they saw the old and revered patron of the country all covered with sad and solemn weeds when they beheld his countenance exceeding all pomp of sorrow and conceived the weight and wringing that was then at his heart envy was quite blunted and robbed of its sting they now lamented the living more than they mourned the dead and the poorest among the poor looked down with an eye of compassion upon the great man now rendered as they deemed more pitiable and desolate even than themselves without child or kindred without any to continue his name or his honors without any who could claim a share in his wealth or his woe without any cause of further comfort or further care upon earth  during the following week the earl kept his chamber and would admit of no visitor till mr meekly arrived  mr meekly had long estranged himself to enfield he had gone elsewhere seeking the houses of mourning and breathing peace and consolation wherever he went but as soon as he heared of the affliction of his noble friend he hastened to help him to bear up under the weight of his calamity he entered and seating himself in silence beside the earl he there wept near an hour without uttering a syllable  my lord was the first who spoke mr meekly said he my heart gratefully feels this melting proof of your love you weep for me my friend because you see and kindly feel that there is no other comfort for me on this side the grave  god forbid god forbid said mr meekly the best and greatest of all comforts is coming to you my lord eternal truth has promised it and he will make it good to you blessed blessed are they who mourn for they shall be comforted  ah mr meekly replied the earl the comfort that you mention is promised only to the deeply contrite and broken of heart to those who duly lament the baseness of their offenses against so great and good a god neither do i despair my friend but that i also may finally share some portion of that same comfort for as i feelingly acknowledge myself the greatest of all sinners so i wish for grace to make me the greatest of penitents  god be praised cried meekly for the grace already given there was a time my lord when as you told me you had nothing of these divine dispositions when the world as you said seemed to hold out happiness to you in either hand when fortune title precedence circling honors about you and within you youth and health and a revelling flow of blood and spirits wholly disguised and concealed the state of your nature from you when they hid from you your own body of frailty distemper sin and death and left you no occasion to call out for a savior as you felt nothing from which you desired to be saved but god has now been graciously pleased to send you his monitors and to call upon you by affliction that you in your turn may call upon him who alone can give you consolation  it is not my lord to the mourners for sin alone to whom comfort is promised the state of suffering and mourning is in its nature extremely salutary and of happy tendency to man and it is therefore that the suffering jesus has pronounced it blessed  the god of all love takes no delight in the sufferings of his poor and pitiable creatures neither would he have made this state of our mortality a vale of tears and a state of misery had it not been in order to conduct us through transitory evils to ever enduring bliss where he himself will wipe all tears from our eyes  when adam by his apostasy and falling off from his maker had converted all the goods of this temporary state into evil incitements to lust covetousness and sensuality god determined by a gracious reverse to turn all the evils of corrupt and fallen nature into means of enduring good to his fallen and frail creatures he therefore appointed pain affliction distress and disease to be his ministers his monitors and preachers within us to convince us of all the evil of our depraved and mortal nature to wean us from a world that is full of false promises but empty of true enjoyment to remind us that we are strangers and pilgrims upon earth to turn our eye to the star that has visited us from on high and finally through our sufferings to accomplish the great work of his own salvation in us  thank you thank you mr meekly these are comforting things indeed they pluck comfort from the very depth and abyss of affliction i love that my god should be lovely to my heart you have now rent the dark veil that long hung before my eyes and the sun of righteousness breaks upon me through the clouds of my mortality  but what of death mr meekly what of death my friend i am interested in the question my time is approaching when this body shall fall to dust and all these organs of sensation be utterly cut off what remains what then shall follow by what means shall my spirit attain the powers of new perception or am i to lie in the grave in a state of total insensibility till the last trumpet shall sound my nature shrinks i confess from a total deprivation of the sense of existence  it is no way evident to me my lord that body or at least such gross bodies as we now have are necessary to the perceptions and sensibilities of our spirit god himself is a spirit an allseeing allhearing alltasting allsmelling allfeeling allknowing and allgoverning spirit he who made the eye shall he not see he who made the ear shall he not hear wherefore as our spirits are the offsprings of his divine spirit we may justly presume them endowed with like capacities but if body is necessary to the perception of spirit as zoroaster the illuminated philosopher seems to intimate where speaking of god he says whose body is light and whose soul is truth in this case i say we may reasonably suppose that when our spirits shall be parted from these gross and frail bodies they shall be instantly clothed upon with more pure and permanent bodies or as i rather think that those pure and permanent bodies are already forming and pregnant within our gross and corruptible bodies and that when the midwife death shall deliver us from the dark womb of our woeful travail and mortality we shall immediately spring forth into incorruption and glory  of this my lord i am confident as i am of my being that he who by faith has already put on christ shall break through death in the brightness of the body of his new birth incorruptible immortal and blessed to all eternity  tell me then my dearest meekly what mean you by the body of this new birth for alas i am but too apt to cry out with nicodemus how can these things be  i mean my lord the forming of christ within us our being formed anew of a divine seed of our second adam even as our gross bodies were formed in the womb from a corruptible seed of the old adam i mean the clothing of our spirits with the heavenly substantiality of the spiritual body and blood of the heavenly jesus himself for as the apostle says there is a spiritual body as there is a carnal body i mean a body the same as that in which the believing thief entered paradise with his lord on the day of the crucifixion i am the resurrection and the life says jesus whosoever believes in me though he were dead yet shall he live and he who lives and believes in me shall never die death shall become a new and divine birth unto him and the great apostle says there are celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another and again he says for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens  these are great things indeed mr meekly and full of hope as well as incitements to divine ambition  but why my lord should a new birth from jesus christ be thought wonderful is there any thing more wonderful in it than in the forming and unfolding of the whole stupendous mechanism of the body of our old man from a scarce visible speck of entity is there any thing more wonderful in it than in the growth and unfolding of any common vegetable from some latent principle or invisible speck in the seed which not all the optics and glasses of a galilaeo should be able to discover were not these the known facts of every day and hour incredulity would have laughed the supposition to naught but i think i have got about me something most surprizingly analagous and apposite to the nature and manner of our new birth in jesus  mr meekly then put his hand to his pocket and took out a lump of matter in form like a long and huge maggot evidently without motion apparently without life and hard and incrusted all about to the feeling  what have you got there my friend said the earl an old worm my lord that at this instant is pregnant with the birth of a new creature impossible cried the earl the thing is absolutely dead the body of the old worm is dead indeed my lord but there is certainly a principle of a new life within it that will soon manifest itself in the birth of a very beautiful and wonderfully glorious creature and this you will find if you leave it for a few days where it may get the fostering warmth of the sun through one of your windows have you ever seen the fly they call the dragonfly my lord  yes and have admired the elegance of its shape the mechanism of its double wings and the luster of its irradiations  this mass my lord of apparently insensible matter is now actually pregnant with one of the same species the parent through whose death it is to attain life was no other as you see than a vile and grovelling maggot who once fed and took its delight in the stench and ordure of a jakes but the new creature that is to be born from it will be quite of a different nature and tendency it will loath the food and occupation of its foul progenitor it will soar sublime over carnal and earthly things it will drink the dews of heaven and feed on the consummate nectar and fragrance of flowers  this indeed mr meekly rejoined the earl is to make the invisible things of god visible even to the naked eye by the things that are seen  while my lord and his friend were thus deeply in discourse mr john the housesteward came in and told his master that one waited in the hall with a letter for him  a letter cried the earl what can i have to say john to any letters or any of the writers thereof  but something is due to humanity and it shall be paid desire him to step in  hereupon a stranger entered whose figure instantly caught the eyes and attention of the earl and his companion in an astonished captivity the youth was dressed in simple fustian and his dark brown locks tied behind with a black riband flowed carelessly between his shoulders while some of the front straying curls as in sport alternately shaded and discovered a part of his lovely countenance he bowed he moved attraction and gracefully advancing toward my lord he again bowed laid a letter before him on the table and then silently retired backward a few steps  they viewed him they gazed upon him as it had been the sudden vision of an angel of light mr meekly was not able to utter a word neither had my lord the power to lay a finger on the paper that was directed to him till mr meekly at last giving a great stroke on the table cried suddenly out i would lay a thousand pounds of it it is he it is he  my heart tells me he can be no other but your harry clinton  here harry sprung forward and casting himself precipitately at the feet of the earl he clasped his knees with an eager reverence crying my father my honored my dear my dear father and broke into tears  my lord all in a tremor attempted to raise him to his arms and harry perceiving this rose and threw himself into the bosom of his father but the earl gently and fondly put him off a little and gazing intently at a countenance that appeared to him lovely above all that was lovely in the circle of creation he gathered new strength and catching harry to his breast he exclaimed in a transport let me die let me die since i have seen thy face my son  end of the fourth volume advertisement as the author found it impracticable to condense all his matter within the compass of the
