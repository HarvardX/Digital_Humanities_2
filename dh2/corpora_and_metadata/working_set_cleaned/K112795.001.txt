is not my desire to shelter these papers under the patronage of the president of the royal society but to seize this opportunity of publicly testifying the sincere respect and regard i entertain for your character and to acknowledge the obligations that i owe to sir joseph banks  these considerations will i trust be received as an apology by the public and will i hope induce you to pardon the liberty i have taken in requesting your friendly acceptance of these little volumes as a faint pledge of the veneration and gratitude of  dear sir your most obliged and most faithful humble servant george colman richmond april         preface driving the other day through the city  driving for alas at present writing i cannot very well walk  i observed in different panes of the extended window of an eminent linendraper a conspicuous bill exhibiting these words in very large characters the goods of this shop to be sold cheap the owner leaving off trade  though it is not my intention to shut up shop and though i shall not probably leave trade till life leaves me yet meditating at that moment on the few pages necessary to be prefixed to these miscellaneous volumes i could not help comparing my stock of essays prefaces letters remarks odes epistles epigrams prologues and epilogues with other literary fragments to the bales pieces and remnants of my frriend the linendraper  in one respect indeed our situations are exactly similar we are both obliged to evacuate our several warehouses and though we may both on this occasion bring forward some stale commodities yet we both offer all our prime goods much below prime cost  nay says a critic but your case and that of your friend are not as you pretend exactly similar he is under a necessity of disencumbering himself of all his wares good bad or indifferent but from you we have a right to expect and demand a selection alas my honored sir a selection is now out of my power many of these pieces since first printed and published have been reprinted and republished without the privity or consent of the author and ten to one if the breath was out of his body but some other collection of this sort would be offered to the public under his name much less select than the present swelled with articles of which in the first instance he was not the retailer or manufacturer and for which he ought not dead or alive to be made or thought responsible  of the contents of these miscellanies a short summary is given at the conclusion of each volume yet it appears necessary to speak more at large in the style of a catalogue raisonnee of some of the particulars  the first volume consists entirely of essays a style of writing to which the author has always betrayed a great propensity this inclination led him at a very early period to offer the paper that opens the volume to the conductors of the adventurer who honored it with acceptance and insertion some time before the disstinguished era when the illustrious mr town introduced himself to the notice of the public under the title of the connoisseur  the series of papers under the names of the genius and the gentleman were chiefly undertaken with a view of promoting the interest of the publications in which they appeared and with some thoughts of longer duration but other avocations intervening they were discontinued as abruptly as they were begun for every thing in these papers the editor is responsible except for the epistle to a friend at the conclusion of no xi written by mr lloyd  the numbers of terraefilius were written and published at the time of their several dates during a party to oxford in company with my old friends and schoolfellows thornton and churchill neither of whom however took any part in that publication though thornton on our return frankly owned his regret at not having joined his old coadjutor  the second volume opens with a string of letters and other articles written for the same purpose as the main part of the essays in the first acting in concert with men whose names i loved and whose memories i revere a certain splenetick author who confessedly dates the dawnings of his genius from his juvenile effusions in a weekly journal speaks in his usual style of egotism with great contempt of the writers and sharers in newspapers for my part not conscious of having written any thing in them for which i ought to be ashamed i am free to confess my having written in them nor indeed ought he to blush at his earliest connections but rather to pride himself and assume more consequence than he now challenges if possible from the reflection of having conveyed his loose thoughts and tritical essays to the public through the same channel with the manly lucubrations of pulteney and boling broke  the two prefaces to the plays of massinger and beaumont and fletcher though conveying no literary doctrines which i do not avow are not however to be strictly taken as coming from me as the editor of either of those publications for which i do not consider myself as responsible the critical reflections were thrown together at the instance of mr garrick to serve his old subject davies who converted from an actor into a bookseller had purchased the remaining copies of coxeters edition of the works of massinger to which he added the critical reflections as a preface of the edition of the plays of beaumont and fletcher i never saw a line to the best of my recollection till near two volumes were printed i afterward revised the proof sheets and by degrees interested myself still more in the publication for which i had no other motive than the desire of preventing a probable loss to a person who had hazarded a very considerable sum on the undertaking  the appendix to the second edition of the translation of terence is inserted in these volumes for the reasons assigned in the postscript to that appendix now first published to which postscript i beg leave to refer the reader  in this detail of the several parts of this compilation one of the first attempts at verse that presents itself is an ode to oblilivion and an ode to obscurity in speaking of which i may say of this farrago as othello of the story of his life  i ran it over even from my boyish days these odes were indeed a piece of boys play with my schoolfellow lloyd with whom they were written in concert in those days when we had so little grace as to ridicule our poetical masters joking perhaps too licentiously with the prettynesses of one poet and the obscurities of another we were not however insensible to their real merits and excellencies nor desirous to depreciate them and if the time of the publication cannot be admitted as an apology it should be remembered that there are few writers who have not in some part of their career indulged themselves in similar liberties and been guilty of the like transgressions repentance in these cases as in most others comes too late to redeem the offense nescit vox missa reverti the elegy of isis and the poem of the triumphs of isis are in vain excluded from the collections of their respective authors they have been given to the world with the names of the writers in other miscellanies and their native spirit and vigor has kept them alive in spite of the efforts of their unnatural parents to stifle or overlay them  the law student has already been twice before the public though not exactly in the same shape as at present first in lloyds poems and afterward in a collection entitled the oxford sausage entirely consisting of pieces written by oxonians lloyd was removed to cambridge as i was to oxford yet i was concerned in the first of those publications and a stranger to the second the truth is that lloyd wanted materials to fill a volume undertaken by subscription and this little poem contributed with some variations to supply the deficiency  the next article will perhaps at first sight startle the reader the rolliad an heroic poem familiar however as the title may appear to his ear and eye he may be assured that the present work had a being and a name long before the existence of the popular and political work lately known under that title  the reader i fear will soon discover that there is no other affinity or similarity between the two poems what is in a name and even that name was given to the several works on different principles for commentators must agree that the political rolliad derives its title like the odyssey the aeneid and the henriade from the name of the hero while our rolliad owes its denomination to the greatness of the event or the action like the iliad the jerusalem and paradise lost  the cobbler of cripplegates letter to r lloyd was written in concert with garrick and with churchills knowledge and privity sent to lloyd for insertion in his monthly publication lloyd on the receipt of it consulted churchill on the propriety of printing such an attack upon himself and his friends in that point says churchill drily you must judge for yourself he did judge for himself and published it and considering the literary squabbles of that period which this letter tended to ridicule i think he judged rightly  this article reminds me of mentioning what i had nearly forgot that the epigram at the end of the cocklane ghost intelligence was a jeu desprit of garrick  the recapitulation of some of these circumstances will perhaps be less interesting to the reader than to the writer whom they affect most sensibly by recalling to his mind the memory of many pleasant hours never never to return  o noctes cn que deum  sollicitae jucunda oblivia vitae the several articles in the second and third volumes distinguished in the summary of contents by an asterisk were written since the work was first committed to the press and were indeed the chief amusements of the writer in the intervals of ease and leisure during a severe and long illness two or three of them but two or three and those very short have that illness for their subject and the thirtyninth psalm comes so close to the original which so naturally resolves itself into blank verse that he is almost afraid of having misnamed it by styling it an imitation  these and other additions are now humbly offered to his readers not without hopes of contributing to their entertainment and indeed many parts of this collection have already been so favorably received that the writer is unwilling to suppose that by thus bringing together his detached pieces he shall be considered as binding twigs to compose a rod for himself while he is amused with the thoughts of making up a nosegay for his friends and for the public  prose on several occasions the adventurer no  0 saturday september   th      concretam exemit labem purumque reliquit aetherium sensum atque aurai simplicis ignem virgil no speck is left of their habitual stains but the pure ether of the soul remains dryden nothing sooner quells the ridiculous triumph of human vanity than reading those passages of the greatest writers in which they seem deprived of that noble spirit that inspires them in other parts and where instead of invention and grandeur we meet with nothing but flatness and insipidity  the pain i have felt in observing a lofty genius thus sink beneath itself has often made me wish that these unworthy stains could be blotted from their works and leave them perfect and immaculate  i went to bed a few nights ago full of these thoughts and closed the evening as i frequently do with reading a few lines of virgil i accidentally opened that part of the sixth book where anchises recounts to his son the various methods of purgation which the soul undergoes in the next world to cleanse it from the filth it has contracted by its connections with the body and to deliver the pure aetherial essence from the vicious tincture of mortality this was so much like my evenings speculation that it insensibly mixed and incorporated with it and as soon as i fell asleep formed itself into the following dream  i found myself in an instant in the midst of a temple which was built with all that magnificent simplicity that distinguishes the productions of the ancients at the east end was raised an altar on each side of which stood a priest who seemed preparing to sacrifice on the altar was kindled a fire from which arose the brightest flame i had ever beheld the light which it dispensed though remarkably strong and clear was not quivering and dazzling but steady and uniform and diffused a purple radiance through the whole edifice not unlike the first appearance of the morning  while i stood fixed in admiration my attention was awakened by the blast of a trumpet that shook the whole temple but it carried a certain sweetness in its sound which mellowed and tempered the natural shrillness of that instrument after it had sounded thrice the being who blew it habited according to the description of fame by the ancients issued a proclamation to the following purpose by command of apollo and the muses all who have ever made any pretensions to fame by their writings are enjoined to sacrifice upon the altar in this temple those parts of their works which have hitherto been preserved to their infamy that their names may descend spotless and unsullied to posterity for this purpose aristotle and longinus are appointed chief priests who are to see that no improper oblations are made and no proper ones concealed and for the more easy performance of this office they are allowed to choose as their assistants whomsoever they shall think worthy of the function  as soon as this proclamation was made i turned my eyes with inexpressible delight toward the two priests but was soon robbed of the pleasure of looking at them by a crowd of people running up to offer their service these i found to be a groupe of french critics but their offers were rejected by both priests with the utmost indignation and their whole works were thrown on the altar and reduced to ashes in an instant the two priests then looked round and chose with a few others horace and quintilian from among the romans and addison from the english as their principal assistants  the first who came forward with his offering by the loftiness of his demeanor was soon discovered to be homer he approached the altar with great majesty and delivered to longinus those parts of his odyssey which have been censured as improbable fictions and the ridiculous narratives of old age longinus was preparing for the sacrifice but observing that aristotle did not seem willing to assist him in the office he returned them to the venerable old bard with great deference saying that they were indeed the tales of old age but it was the old age of homer  virgil appeared next and approached the altar with a modest dignity in his gait and countenance peculiar to himself and to the surprise of all committed his whole aeneid to the flames but it was immediately rescued by two romans who ran with precipitation to the altar delivered the poem from destruction and carried off the author between them repeating that glorious boast of about forty lines at the beginning of the third georgick   tentanda via est qua me quoque possim tollere humo victorque virum volitare per ora primus ego in patriam mecum etc after him most of the greek and roman authors proceeded to the altar and surrendered with great modesty and humility the most faulty part of their works one circumstance was observable that the sacrifice always increased in proportion as the author had ventured to deviate from a judicious imitation of homer the latter roman authors who seemed almost to have lost sight of him made so large offerings that some of their works which were before very voluminous shrunk into the compass of a primer  it gave me the highest satisfaction to see philosophy thus cleared from erroneous principles history purged of falsehood poetry of fustian and nothing left in each but genius sense and truth i marked with particular attention the several offerings of the most eminent english writers chaucer gave up his obscenity and then delivered his works to dryden to clear them from the rubbish that encumbered them dryden executed his task with great address and as addison says of virgil in his georgicks tossed about his dung with an air of gracefulness he not only repaired the injuries of time but threw in a thousand new graces he then advanced toward the altar himself and delivered up a large paquet which contained many plays and some poems the paquet had a label affixed to it which bore this inscription to poverty  shakespeare carried to the altar a long string of puns marked the taste of the age a small parcel of bombast and a pretty large bundle of incorrectness notwithstanding the ingenuous air with which he made this offering some officiates at the altar accused him of concealing certain pieces and mentioned the london prodigal sir thomas cromwell the yorkshire tragedy etc the poet replied that as those pieces were unworthy to be preserved he should see them consumed to ashes with great pleasure but that he was wholly innocent of their original the two chief priests interposed in this dispute and dismissed the poet with many compliments longinus observing that the pieces in question could not possibly be his for that the failings of shakespeare were like those of homer whose genius whenever it subsided might be compared to the ebbing of the ocean which left a mark upon its shores to show to what a height it was sometimes carried aristotle concurred in this opinion and added that although shakespeare was quite ignorant of that exact economy of the stage which is so remarkable in the greek writers yet the mere strength of his genius had in many points carried him infinitely beyond them  milton gave up a few errors in his paradise lost and the sacrifice was attended with great decency by addison otway and row threw their comedies upon the altar and beaumont and fletcher the two last acts of many of their pieces they were followed by tom durfey etherege wycherley and several other dramatic writers who made such large contributions that they set the altar in a blaze  among these i was surprised to see an author with much politeness in his behavior and spirit in his countenance tottering under an unwieldy burden as he approached i discovered him to be sir john vanbrugh and could not but smile when on his committing his heavy load to the flames it proved to be his skill in architecture  pope advanced toward addison and delivered with great humility those lines written expressly against him so remarkable for their excellence and their cruelty repeating this couplet  cursed be the verse how well soever it flow that tends to make one worthy man my foe the ingenious critic insisted on his taking them again for said he my associates at the altar particularly horace would never permit a line of so excellent a satirist to be consumed the many compliments paid me in other parts of your works amply compensate for this slight indignity and be assured that no little pique or misunderstanding shall ever make me a foe to genius pope bowed in some confusion and promised to substitute a fictitious name at least which was all that was left in his power he then retired after having made a sacrifice of a little paquet of antitheses and some parts of his translation of homer  during the course of these oblations i was charmed with the candor decency and judgment with which all the priests discharged their different functions they behaved with such dignity that it reminded me of those ages when the offices of king and priest centered in the same person whenever any of the assistants were at a loss in any particular circumstances they applied to aristotle who settled the whole business in an instant  but the reflections which this pleasing scene produced were soon interrupted by a tumultuous noise at the gate of the temple when suddenly a rude illiterate multitude rushed in led by tindal morgan chubb and bolingbroke the chiefs whose countenances were impressed with rage whch art could not conceal forced their way to the altar and amidst the joyful acclamations of their followers threw a large volume into the fire but the triumph was short and joy and acclamation gave way to silence and astonishment the volume lay unhurt in the midst of the fire and as the flames played innocently about it i could discover written in letters of gold the words the bible at that instant my ears were ravished with the sound of more than mortal music accompanying a hymn sung by invisible beings of which i well remember the following verses  the words of the lord are pure words even as the silver which in the earth is tried and purified seven times in the fire  more to be desired are they than gold yea than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb  the united melody of instruments and voices which formed a concert so exquisite that as milton says it might create a soul under the ribs of death threw me into such ecstasies that i was awakened by their violence  the genius number i lemmata si quaeris cur sint adscripta docebo ut si malueris lemmata sola legas mart mottoes why mottoes sir you cry i will tell you sir the reason why it is that dull prose dull prose succeeding you may at least find verse worth reading  a genius is a character purely modern and of so late an origin that it has never yet been described or defined in any treatise essay lexicon or dictionary it is now however become almost universal the originals are indeed so numerous and the features so strong that it requires but little skill to take an exact likeness i am myself an acknowledged genius and since it is no more than drawing my own picture i cannot better introduce myself to the reader than by giving at one stroke a rough draught of my own character and that of the numerous fraternity by way of preliminary paper or frontispiece if you please to the ensuing speculations  the ancients according to their wonted narrowness of soul honored a very small portion of the human race with this appellation he who to extraordinary talents had added extraordinary application after the most arduous efforts toward excellence in some one art or science was perhaps at last fortunate enough to extort this distinction the more generous moderns demand only the first requisites and even those like the places of men ballotted into the militia may be supplied by substitutes vanity or assurance may pass in the modern muster for superior faculties the genius endowed with them needs neither diligence nor assiduity supported by confidence he disdains to halt along on the crutches of application so far from being versed merely in one science he runs round the whole circle at his pleasure knowledge is rained down on his head like manna from heaven and he has no care but to gather it as it falls almost every man is an adept in every art acquires learning without study improves his good sense without meditation writes without reading and being full as well acquainted with one thing as another is an unquestionable genius or what is more extraordinary maintains his right to that title without knowing or even pretending to know any thing at all  there is a certain reverend and affecting biographer in this town who pens almost every six weeks the memoirs of several unfortunate great men and among them of many a genius in order to show the characters of his heroes at full length he takes up their adventures even from their boyish days and fairly sets down a plain account of their life character and behavior beginning with their birth parentage and education so that the reader may see at one glance by what steps they have gained the topmost round of the ladder in imitation of so great an example i will endeavor to trace the genius almost from his birth to his sublimest stage of excellence genius is indeed universally allowed to be the gift of nature we cannot therefore be surprised to find it like hercules exerting its strength in the cradle  the cradle indeed may be considered as a mere hotbed for the raising of genius which is a plant of so delicate a nature that it is often nipt in the bud there never was a child as its parents will tell you who did not soon give evident tokens of the brightest parts by doing and saying ten thousand witty things which were never done or said before since the infancy of cain and abel the wit of a child like that of a monkey which is a very wise animal and we are told could speak if it would consists in mischief and the more spirit little master possesses the more entertaining he is to the company i remember that i was once taken so much notice of for my wit and humor in pulling off a grave gentlemans wig that it afterward betrayed me into several scrapes by playing the same tricks over again upon dull fellows who had not such strong ideas of pleasantry it may not be amiss to observe here that practical strokes of humor are those in which a genius takes the most delight  at school the young genius will begin to heighten our expectations of his future abilities his parts indeed will be too brilliant to attend the instructions he might receive there but his spirit will have more room to display itself he may be at the bottom of his class but he will be at the head of every scrape he may be deficient in greek and latin make false concord in his prose and be guilty of false quantities in his verse yet before he leaves school he will not be unacquainted with the world will walk familiarly into a tavern know the best songs at comuss court and the names and persons of the kindest ladies upon town but when once relieved from scholastic restraints as his sphere will be more noble his fame will become more eminent if he is entered at either of our universities the tameness of an academical life being ill adapted to the vivacity of his disposition he will spend all his time in covent garden by way of being in genteel company if he is sent abroad because forsooth his wise parents or guardians imagine that the discipline of our own universities is not strict enough he will soon convince them that the government of foreign academies is infinitely more lax he will speedily distinguish himself by his uncommon spirit and after shooting a waiter killing his friend in a duel or perhaps contaminating the sixty descents in the house of a german baron by decoying his daughter he may ride post out of the continent and be glad to embark in a storm in order to get safe footing in old england  old england is indeed the noblest theater in the universe for a genius here he may go through all the changes and diversities of his character at pleasure here he may send his mistress to parade through the streets in a gilt chariot drawn by pyebald horses he may at the same time be so deeply engaged at play that his own chariot may stand at the door of arthurs till eight in the morning he may ride his own matches at newmarket and perform new miracles against time and weight and number of horses every season in a word he may indulge his vivacity in every ebullition of genius from tossing off his quarts of champagne to shooting himself through the head  with this spirit and vivacity may a genius of quality and estate employ himself but as talents are the gift of nature and riches the mere favors of fortune it happens unluckily that many a genius is reduced to the mean resources of trade or profession to support himself in these cases if the warmth of a genius is not abated it involves him in many difficulties the spirit of the clerk in a comptinghouse may perhaps betray him into a forgery and the evil genius of the apprentice may tempt him to commit depredations on the till  the young physician of genius instead of throwing that solemnity into his countenance which would make him look as if he had himself taken the potion he should prescribe adopts a whimsical air and soon loses his credit with the old practitioners the apothecaries and his brotherattendants at the hospital by laughing at the farce of physic and swearing that water gruel is of infinitely more service than the whole materia medica a genius of this species sometimes retrieves himself by recurring irregularly to physic and hawking a nostrum  the lively student at the inns of court has too sublime a turn of mind to follow his profession he gives the attorneys a contempt for him by endeavoring to converse with them facetiously and is seen walking the streets in an illegal bagwig instead of prudently wearing the businessfollowing bob he may be found oftener behind the scenes at the playhouse than in the courts of justice and if he is a prodigious genius indeed he even writes for the stage  the exploits of a modern genius in high life are indeed no where to be equalled except by the productions of a modern genius in low life as an author his works are not to be estimated according to the quality but the quantity of them and they are sold wholesale and retail to one set of booksellers as another set of booksellers in moorfields sell those of his predecessors  by the pound he is not only capable of writing in any science but he will undertake to write in all sciences at once he will publish in one day detached parcels of biography architecture husbandry gardening and cookery he will be at one and the same time the author of a long history the translator of a voluminous foreign writer the inventor of a novel the conductor of a review the doer of a magazine and the manager of a newspaper in comparison to him tully shall appear to have written a volume no bigger than the primer and the iliad shall shrink into a nutshell longinus from his great learning was denominated a walking musaeum and our genius from the number and quality of his productions may be more familiarly styled a circulating library  such an author am i the genius history shall stand still for events and i will transcribe the newspapers as the annals of politics and literature ere my pen shall cease to go on loose papers such as these will scarce engage the attention of a moment and will be hastily scribbled over at the teatable just when the whim shall sieze me or any amusing thoughts come uppermost in the whirl of my imagination the reader therefore must not expect me at certain periods since i shall always pop abruptly in upon him sometimes he may see me once sometimes twice in a week and sometimes perhaps not above once in a fortnight i hope to wait on him again very soon and as i have here said something of my disposition and situation i propose in my next to give an exact description of my person  the genius number ii  homer tydeus of person small what then great heroes may be little men  notwithstanding the eminent advantages resulting from the many rare talents and qualities necessarily included in that illustrious character described in my first paper under the title of a genius i am i must confess neither the most completely happy nor most universally accomplished man in the creation nature who has in some instances been lavish in her bounties to me has in others been rather too unkind and indeed remarkably niggard of her favors vanity for example she has so exuberantly poured upon me that my portion to say no more of it is at least sufficient to embolden me to venture forth as an author and yet my sensibility is at the same time unfortunately so nice and exquisite that it becomes a perpetual thorn in the sides of that very vanity laying it open to every slight attack and rendering it too easily wounded by the petulance of folly the slanders of envy the gross jests of buffoonery or the malice of a review  but the greatest drawback which nature has in my case made on that vanity and selfapplause which contributes more or less to the happiness of every man and woman in the world is most unfortunately external visible to all eyes open to general observation and liable to ridicule from the dullest fellow that casts a look upon my person peculiarities of figure whether in make size or complexion have always been deemed an inexhaustible source of ridicule to the associates of the man who possesses them he whose person is remarkable seems to be considered as a butt planted by nature for all other men to shoot their wit at the coarse humor of our own vulgar however blind to mental blemishes is sharpsighted as a lynx to external defects and exerts itself as liberally on genteeler passersby as on their own humpbacked companion whom they jocularly entitle my lord homer represents the gods themselves as laughing at the ugly awkward blacksmith divinity of vulcan tully in his dialogues de oratore recommends it to an orator to be pleasant and facetious on personal defects though perhaps rather unadvisedly and unsuitably to the grave dignity of that profession and now we are got so deep in learned quotations i defy the scholar to find in lucian aristophanes theophrastus or any other author ancient or modern a greater profusion of wit and humor bestowed on any one subject than shakespeare has lavished in his several descriptions of falstaff shallow and bardolph on a fat man a lean man and a man with a red nose happy indeed would it be for any other man especially if he be a wit and a genius who bears about in his person this native fund of pleasantry if he could say with falstaff and with equal justice too i am not only witty myself but also the cause of wit in other men  let not however the partial reader conclude too hastily from what has been said that i pretend to the honor of the deformity of scarron the crookedness of pope the blindness of milton or homer or even the long nose or no nose of tristram shandy not to make any further delay of introduction after having so long announced myself to the good company the truth and the whole truth is that i am of a remarkable low stature a sort of diminutive plaything of madam nature that seems to have been made like a girls doll to divert the good lady in her infancy a little  without a tittle otop an human figure in miniature a makeweight in the scale of mortality a minim of nature a mannikin not to say minnikin and indeed rather an abstract or brief chronicle of mans fair proportions than a man at large my person indeed is not formed in that excellent mould of littleness which as in some insects and animals becomes beautiful from the nice texture and curious composition of its parts i may be seen it is true without the help of a microscope and am not even qualified to rival the dwarf coan by being exhibited to my worthy countrymen at sixpence apiece i am however so low in stature that my name is hardly ever mentioned without the epithet little being prefixed to it the moment that my person presents itself among strange company the first idea that strikes the beholders is the minuteness of the figure and a whisper instantly buzzes round the room lord what a little creature as i walk along the street i hear the men and women say to one another there goes a little man  in a word it is my irreparable misfortune to be without out my shoes little more than five feet in height eating of daisyroots we are told will retard a mans growth if the french alimentary powder or any other newinvented diet would at once elevate me and surprise my friends i would go through a long regimen to be raised ever so little nearer heaven i think i could not endure to have my limbs stretched to a nobler length in the bed of procrustes but if i could be rolled out like dough or paste or extended by relaxation like a rope or an eels skin in dry weather i believe i should readily assent to it for there is no impossibility existing in nature or recorded in scripture at the truth of which i am more apt to repine than that no man is able to add a cubit to his stature  when the camel applied to heaven for some amendment in his figure jupiter says the fabulist cropped his ears for his impertinence i should be very loath like some of my cotemporaries of the quill by any means to endanger my ears and yet nothing but the back of the camel being placed on my little body could make me wish more ardently than i do at present for an happy alteration in it for not to mention the natural inconveniences of being trampled on and run over in a crowd almost pressed to death by huge fellows and fat old women in machines and stagecoaches deprived of all pleasure at sights and shows by taller persons taking their places before me  not to dwell i say on these and several other circumstances of the same nature it provokes me to find that though i can sometimes as absolutely forget my littleness as if i was as big as goliath yet my friends and acquaintance cannot for one moment lose the consideration of it the minuteness of my person so entirely governs their idea of my character that they are not able to detach the contemplation of one from the other and from the mere credit of having a larger quantity of clay and dirt put together in their huge frames than myself they become as beatrice terms it such valiant pieces of dust that a man who has room enough in his bosom for more gall than a pigeon must be moved with indignation if they think of my marriage they set themselves to consider what fairy they shall find for me or whether it would not be better to cross the breed by providing me an amazon they would have my chariot like queen mabs made out of an hazelnut and as to an house the case of a treble hautboy were a mansion for me  a very intimate friend of mine one day inadvertently betrayed to me that his wife always spoke of me by the name of the baby but afterward in order to mend the matter he added that she had no contemptible opinion of my person for that she always said she never saw such a little man that was so strait in families where i visit growing lads of thirteen or fourteen years of age are called out to stand back to back with me and measure whether there is any difference between their height and mine and once i remember on my visit to an acquaintance newlymarried being introduced to the bride who was a fine tall woman but a prude or a wit i cannot tell which she held her head so high without making the least inclination of her body that i could as easily have scaled the monument as have come at the tip of her chin without the help of a pair of steps one day just after the passing of the broadwheel act being on the road on a little poney the man of the turnpike seeing me and my nag approach cried out nay nay this must be above weight i am sure and closing the gate left me to go over the place appointed for weighing the wagons another time after having dined at a noblemans house i was honored with the use of his lordships chariot to carry me home but was desired first to set down another of the company at st jamess coffeehouse my fellow traveller if i may so call him was one of the biggest and tallest men in the kingdom and was at least four and twenty stone in weight thus ridiculously coupled like a lean rabbit and a fat one we engaged the attention of the whole street particularly of the company at arthurs who stood laughing as we passed by to see the body of the chariot inclined all one way as if we were driving on the slope of a hill though the wheels ran on as smoothly and evenly as madam catharinas clockwork equipage on a parlour floor but i must declare that the most ridiculous distress i ever underwent was when my unfortunate curiosity carried me to see that wonderful phenomenon of nature the italian giant scarce less than eight feet high while the rest of the company were walking under his arm he seemed to expect that i should have crept between his legs and when i offered to present him with the usual gratuity he absolutely refused to accept it saying that he thought it full as great a curiosity to see me as i could possibly think it to see him  in short my situation is almost as ridiculous as that of gulliver in brobdignag and though i cannot like him be carried to the ridge of a housetop by a monkey or be stuck upright by an unlucky lad in a marrowbone yet every day brings with it fresh instances of mortification  but there is no circumstance moves my spleen more forcibly than the insolence of those whose stature very little exceeds my own and who seem to look down on such urchins as myself with a consciousness of their happy superiority one of these always affects to call me the little man and another small gentleman a great actor i mean whom in some future histriomastix some nescio quid majus rosciade i may possibly take a peg or two lower is fond of sidling up to me in all public places as secondrate beauties commonly contrive to take a dowdy abroad with them for a foil for my own part though i could wish to be taller i never made use of any undue arts to appear so i am content to submit my littleness fairly to the world i never suffered my hat to rise into the air with a staring kevenhuller and i would as soon appear in stilts as be lifted from the ground by double soles or high heels to my shoes i rather endeavor to console myself by looking abroad into the world for great men of another order than those described by sergeant kite and so successful have been my researches of this kind that i could set down a long catalogue of persons eminent in the state in the professions in arts and sciences not to mention authors and actors who are scarce taller than myself so that in this respect we may fairly pronounce in favor of the present period as lord clarendon has declared of his own that it was an age in which there were many great and wonderful men of that size i do not know whether in this extremity of war any new raised regiment offers bountymoney for volunteers five feet high but we flatter ourselves that in case an invasion should take place we could form a corpse infinitely more formidable than the late king of prussias useless tall regiment  i cannot close this paper without returning my thanks to the learned university of oxford and to the illustrious queensbury family for having published the abovementioned papers of lord clarendon in which there is much matter of consolation to gentlemen of the like height and dimensions with myself it there appears that most of his lordships intimate friends were great and wonderful men of low stature mr hales he tells us was one of the least men in the kingdom and one of the greatest scholars in europe mr chillingworth was of a stature little superior to mr hales of his friend sidney godolphin he says that there never was so great a mind and spirit contained in so little room so large an understanding and so unrestrained a fancy in so very small a body of sir lucius carey afterward lord falkland who was but little taller than sidney godolphin he speaks so highly that i cannot resist the temptation of gratifying myself and all other little men by transcribing the description of his person hoping it may serve to recommend us to the favor of the world and particularly to the good graces of the ladies who are desired to take notice that sir lucius married for love and made a most excellent husband lord clarendon speaks thus of him  with these advantages he had one great disadvantage which in the first entrance into the world is attended with too much prejudice in his person and presence which was in no degree attractive or promising his stature was low and smaller than most men his motion not graceful and his aspect so far from inviting that it bad somewhat in it of simplicity and his voice the worst of the three and so untuned that instead of reconciling it offended the ears so that no body would have expected music from that tongue and sure no man was less beholden to nature for it is recommendation into the world but then no man sooner or more disappointed this general and customary prejudice that little person and small stature was quickly found to contain a great heart a courage so keen and a nature so fearless that no composition of the strongest limbs and most harmonious and proportioned presence and strength ever more disposed any man to the greatest enterprise it being his greatest weakness to be too solicitous for such adventures and that untuned tongue and voice easily discovered itself to be supplied and governed by a mind and understanding so excellent that the wit and weight of all he said carried another kind of luster and admiration in it and even another kind of acceptance from the persons present than any ornament of delivery could reasonably promise itself or is usually attended with and his disposition and nature was so gentle and obliging so much delighted in courtesy kindness and generosity that all mankind could not but admire and love him  after this extract from lord chancellor clarendon i beg leave to address myself to all little men who are desirous to become great and wonderful like sir lucius entreating them to meditate attentively for that end on the following maxim of that other great chancellor lord bacon which maxim may also serve as a sort of moral to this long paper on a short man whosoever has any thing fixed in his person that does induce contempt has also a perpetual spur in himself to rescue and deliver himself from scorn  the genius number iii sardonychas smaragdos adamantas iaspidas uno versat in articulo stella mart stellas bespankled over at every point diamonds pearls rubies on each single joint  after having kept the discourse entirely to myself and made myself the delightful subject of that discourse for two whole papers i am glad of an opportunity to relieve my readers by publishing the two following letters  to the genius crutched friars june         sir i am a plain man but i can see how this world goes for all that and indeed to find out where the shoe pinches requires no very fine feelings in him that wears it my grievance is no small one i assure you give me leave therefore to submit my case to you and the public a case which affects not myself alone but more or less many thousands also of honest peaceable married men in his majestys dominions  the family matter which i have to lay before you is relative to dress an article which you periodical speculatists have always made a particular object of your animadversion do not imagine sir that i trouble you merely to vent my spleen against some new fashion that i have discovered some unforeseen inconveniences in the leaving off hoops or mean to declaim against the immodesty of going without stays i do not care one farthing whether petticoats are long or short stomachers high or low or whether the innumerable yards of rich stuff are employed in trimming or flouncing or in sweeping the ground i have no quarrel or concern with the vagaries of the fashion all i complain of is the exorbitant expense of a womans dress let the fashion be what it will an expense so enormous that i can clothe myself and four boys from top to toe for less than one third of the money that goes to deck out my wife who protests after all to every other woman she sees that she has not a gown to her back  you must know sir that the greater part of my life has been spent in mercantile business in which i got together a very considerable fortune and which i was at last prevailed on to quit by my wifes continued remonstrances that my application to it injured my health though i must confess i have scarce known a happy hour since i quitted my comptinghouse still however i consider as every man ought that a shilling is a serious thing and keep a regular account of my family expenses instead of allowing my wife pinmoney as it is called i pay all her bills milliners mercers etc and carry them to the bad side of my accounts with my own hand and it grieves me to the heart to see so much good money lavished away upon gewgaws and frippery things ten times worse than canvas staytape and buckram in a tailors bill such a cloud of ruffles doubleruffles trebleruffles caps aprons and handkerchiefs such a deluge of gauze muslin blond and brussels lace and then from ludgate hill rich silks at so high a price at the rate of  i blush to own it  even of twenty shillings per yard though indeed i remember when i could have purchased whole bales of the same sor for no more than three or four till the coxcombs of my own sex enhanced the price by making them up into foolscoats and birthday suits for themselves  this sir you will allow to be a heavy expense yet all this is nothing absolutely nothing in comparison to the grand object of my present application after my wifes efforts at finery and magnificence had taken as i supposed their full swing she made another stroke which my folly and compliance has suffered her by little and little to carry to such an immoderate length that this new piece of extravagance has cost me several thousand pounds in hard money unfortunately for me a little scrub jew who called himself a merchant because he carried on a sort of pedlars traffic in jewels among his tribe used to dine sometimes at my house and soon contrived to talk my good woman into a taste for diamonds a scriveners wife too in the neighborhood happened at that time to have jewels in her ears so that to humor my wife little tubal was ordered to furnish her with a pair of diamond tops for so i think they called them these however were scarce purchased and the tops well fixed in her ears before it was found indispensibly requisite to have bobs or drops to them which also the insinuating smouse soon provided for her the good humor which these occasioned was but of short duration for alas sir my wife soon told me that these were but poor trumpery baubles and at best only fit for her dishabille and as a lady of quality had promised to take her to court it was absolutely necessary that she should have a pair of large handsome earrings which by the help of our friend she soon had and which were so very brilliant and set in such a fine transparent fashion that the countess who was to accompany her turned pale with envy at the fight of them since then sir i am ashamed to confess to you that i have been teazed and wheedled into giving her a diamond necklace with an appurtenance dangling to it which the charge in the bill has taught me to call esclavage and since that again a diamond girdlebuckle a pair of diamond shoebuckles a sprig made up of garnets and diamonds and what provokes me worse than all the rest a diamond nosegay or bouquet as she christens it which comes to more than a younger childs fortune her affection for me has also induced her to wear my picture in miniature set round with diamonds for a bracelet besides which her fingers are perfectly cramped with rings single brilliants hooprings topazes and amethysts without number she has scarcely the free motion of her knuckles and joints they are placed five six seven or eight deep below one another and it is absolutely impossible for her to wear more unless like the indian women she was also to bore her nose  this sir is the groaning evil of my wifes dress and my case which might once have been reckoned singular now becomes every day less and less uncommon formerly indeed rich jewels as they shine in the crown of monarchs seemed also to be appropriated to those illustrious characters which approached nearest to that rank and dignity but now they are worn indiscriminately by the wife of a duke or a citydeputy by a princess of the blood or a lady of pleasure i can remember the time when women of an ordinary rank never dreamt of such extravagance when they were contented with pebbles and paste instead of diamonds wore french beads for pearls and colored glass for precious stones at present every woman seems as familiar with diamonds as cleopatra was of old and to hear them boast how cheap and plentiful they are grown of late years in england one would almost imagine that they were inhabitants of voltaires good country of eldorado where as i read lately in a translation of his candide the soil consisted of gold and diamonds lay like stones and pebbles in the streets and highways  my good wife is pleased at times to expatiate on the economy and good management of laying out money on these trinkets they are says she the only parts of dress whose value remains undiminished and on which the cost is not entirely thrown away they have an intrinsic worth and they as well as plate may be regarded as so much riches in bank which like a note may be converted into cash whenever one pleases this is fine talking truly it is well known that the setting and the fashion and the like come to above half the money that is paid for them though indeed the expense is so great taken altogether that the buyer is often obliged to try the real value of his purchases by setting his jewels up to auction and coining his plate like the bankrupt frenchman into specie for my part i never see my wife in all her finery without being immediately led to a contemplation of the immense sums which she carries about her when i consider the common rate of interest i cannot help calculating her ears her neck her hands and her feet each at so much per annum and when i further reflect how much more per cent i could have made of my money in the fair way of trade she seems to lie like some cruel excise upon my goods a merchant can scarce ever afford to make a purchase even of land his whole principal being wanted to answer the demands of his business how then can he support the loss of so much money lying dead on his wifes toilet what profit can arise from her earrings or shoebuckles and where are his quick returns from her sprig or her bouquet should he suffer a bill of exchange to be protested in order to pay his ladys jeweller or should he run the risk of seeing the precious stones themselves in the hands of his assignees an estate in land indeed will afford some profit to the owner of it but the barren brilliants produce neither corn nor grass yield neither rent nor habitation and serve no one end on this side of temple bar at least except that of making the husband poor and the wife proud  the bad effect which these ornaments have on the minds of the wearers might furnish no weak arguments against the use of them so much finery must be shown and for what end does a woman dress unless it be in order to be seen with what transport did my wife attend to the city scheme of an assembly at haberdashershall where i dare say her magnificence has since created no small disquiet in the family of many an alderman i have already been reproached by more than one of the common council on this occasion who have themselves shown no more power to check this domestic evil than i exerted they talk however very loudly of the imprudence of trusting a wife with such valuables they tell me it is absolutely putting an independent fortune into her hands i have heard twenty stories of diamondnecklaces and aigrets being sent by distressed ladies to the pawnbrokers and my attorney assures me that he has the jewels of a lady of quality lying in his strong box as a pledge for a thousand pounds lost at play for which she had too much tenderness to trouble her husband i have also heard another story of a lady who robbed herself and prevailed on her kind husband to purchase for her a second time her own diamonds newset of the jeweller who had received the stolen goods at her hands  you mr genius seem to me to be something of a wag and so perhaps you may laugh at my remonstrances but in my mind it is a very serious affair and deserves much consideration to bring in a bill for some wise sumptuary law would perhaps not be quite unworthy the attention of the legislature i consulted a sergeant at law some time ago on this head he informed me that in the uncommon extent of his reading he had met with a recital of one or two laws of this nature but that they had been obsolete time out of mind in one of these it was declared how many rows of lace a man might wear on his coat according to his degree from a duke to an esquire and in another it was solemnly enacted that no person beneath the rank of a peer should wear a coat so short as to show his posteriors  this sir was the sum of the grave gentlemans counsel hoping also some wholesome advice from you or at least that my case may induce you to draw up a table of sumptuary laws for the benefit of the ladies or more properly speaking for the benefit of their husbands i remain  sir your wellwisher and humble servant humphry gubbins   my little geno i have read your description of yourself with a deal of glee and would give a thousand pounds tomorrow to be just such another tight little thing as you are a fine sporting figure i warrant how much do you weigh why did not you tell us that  but no matter  i will hold six to one you dont ride above nine stone saddle and bridle and all together  but hark ye my little buck the reason of my writing to you at present is this you must know that i have laid lord  a thousand guineas play or pay with a good many bets depending on the same lay that i get a man to ride a little yorkshire galloway of mine not thirteen hands and a half by jupiter five and twenty miles within the hour i intended to ride myself and have been in training for that end these six weeks but it will not do i cannot bring myself to less than twelve stone three pounds and five ounces do what i will i have used exercise without measure eat scarce any thing and wore five flannel waistcoats all the hot weather and yet i am over weight after all now i will tell you what my little genius if you will ride for me it is a dead affair the minute you appear on the course the odds i am sure will run ten to one in my favor so if you will ride you shall go halves in the wager i will bear you harmless from all losses and if you have a mind for the job and it is in your way i will recommend you to the jockey club as a proper man to make up the sportsmans calendar  yours j f almacks june    p s i have just read an account in the newspaper of the surprising little horse from guadalupe but two feet

war says vincent wing in his almanac begets poverty poverty peace now as some at least of the parties engaged in the present contest seem to be nearly whirled round to that part of the circle of events described by the learned philomath in the lines abovementioned all considerate persons begin to look forward to the consequences of such a revolution the sagacious gentlemen at the smyrna have already deliberated what part of our conquests we shall sorego and what we shall retain it was but the other day that i saw a political junto in a corner of the room with a map of america lying before them and heard their final resolution not to restore an acre of canada though they were a little disconcerted by a sugarmerchant from the city who happened to drop in at the time and declared with an oath that the nation was undone if we agreed to give up guadalupe the dealers in the stocks at garraways and jonathans are locking up all their ready money in the funds and calculating at how much per cent advance they shall be able to sell out on the proclamation of peace and in the mean time some of the gentlemen at arthurs with many other persons at both ends of the town are attentively considering the consequences of a peace in diminishing or increasing the emoluments of their several places employments or professions a friend of mine a very honest gentleman who is an agent in the city told me last week that if he was but so happy as to see the war continue for only four years more he should make an estate and ride in his coach and six and it was but the next day that another intimate acquaintance who has an employment in the waroffice declared to me that he should lay down his chariot immediately upon a peace for my own part none of the various considerations just enumerated take hold on me i have i am sorry to say it no money in the funds and no employment under the government and as to politics since these are not times when authorincendiaries are hired to take up the bellows to kindle the embers of sedition or paid for laying them down again what has a genius to do with such considerations on the war or the peace libels public or private are alas attended only with fines imprisonment and the pillory waving therefore all other reflections i shall consider this important event come when it may as a mere moralist and endeavor to trace out the most probable effects of a peace on the manners and principles of the good people of great britain  i think i may venture to prognosticate that its first visible effects will be manifest in our dress so that every lady and gentleman may be said to carry about them a kind of badge of peace and reconciliation by adopting that foreign air of which we are so great admirers i have no apprehension that our home manufactures will stand still and that the industrious artists of spitalfields whom public spirit has of late so much encouraged will be left to starve for want of due employment but i think i foresee a whole packet of tailors haircutters and milliners coming over in every vessel and new patterns for caps and handkerchiefs with the true paris cut for clothes sent by every mail there seems to have been much decency and chaste reserve in the habit of both sexes during the war but as we are allowed to be a very imitative though not an inventive nation i have some dread of the new fashions to be introduced after the peace then perhaps we may again see among the ladies uncovered shoulders naked breasts and legs revealed above the ancle and among the men short jerkins white hats and redheeled shoes in order to prevent these and other irregularities i would humbly propose that before the treaty is concluded a congress of dressers friseurs and tyrewomen plenipotentiary be appointed to meet in some neutral country and that in the mean time wooden dolls dressed a la mode de pais be reciprocally sent over between the cities of london and paris the better to adjust the preliminaries  the large cargoes of tailors etc which the peace will waft over will however be very inadequate to the number of english gentlemen and milors angloises that will immediately set sail for france not for the sake of interest but dissipation a bridge from dover to calais would perhaps hardly render the emigrations of our people more frequent paris will then be considered as an addition to the number of our places of public resort and visited with as much readiness as tunbridge bath or scarborough this is a field which affords so much room for observation that perhaps i may think it worth while to collect my materials on the spot and may date some of my future papers from a hotel at paris in the mean time as our ministry and parliament will undoubtedly turn their thoughts toward the reduction of the national debt necessarily increased by an expensive though glorious war my skill in politics cannot suggest a better measure or more equitable tax to their consideration than an heavy duty on the exportation of fools  the ladies who have justly complained of the dearth of men during the war will i dare say concur with me in the propriety of this new tax and to oblige them i would propose that all importations of volunteers from abroad and other recruits may be permitted dutyfree at the same time i cannot but congratulate my fair countrywomen on the great plenty of males which the peace must produce we shall no longer see a row of disconsolate females sitting like superannuated maidens unsollicited at a ball or a lady of fashion reduced to the necessity of figuring in with the butler the officers of disbanded regiments will be glad to supply the deficiencies of half pay by the accession of a large portion with a wife and the brave gentlemen of the militia no longer embodied or traversing the country to distant encampments will add to the public meetings and assemblies of their own counties the brilliancy of a red coat and cockade without the terror that such a dress commonly brings with it and as much harmlessness as a sword in the scabbard these newcommissioned soldiers may rejoice at the thought of having wiped off the contempt that once cleaved to the name of militia and the ladies may be happy to take an hero to their arms who can fight for his country without being sent out of it in a word this is one of the most jocund ideas that peace affords bath bristol margate brighthelmstone etc will again become the scenes of pleasure and delight and the gallant warriors who have deserved so well of mars now devoted to venus in her turn have nothing to do but to recommend themselves to the favor of the fair sex and endeavor to repair the ravages of war by determining with captain plume  to raise recruits the matrimonial way  but the joy which the gaiety of these contemplations inspires is much allayed by considering the unhappy situation of the daily weekly morning and evening retailers of news during the time of war a battle in germany a fort stormed in the west indies or a nabob created in the east is worth forty shillings to every paper that reprints the particulars from the gazette extraordinary nay a town taken or a town lost is equally to the advantage of these halfsheet historians and the perpetual curiosity kept alive by the public anxiety sells off whole quires of uninteresting details of births deaths marriages and bankruptcies how great then must be the dread of the consequences of peace to the proprietors of the swarm of advertisers gazetteers ledgers journals chronicles and evening posts a peace which will lie heavier on their papers than the double duty on the stamps my good friend mr h baldwin of white friars has already expressed to me his fears on this occasion he fairly tells me to my face that though the genius were to stand in the front of his paper three times a week the public attention would flag without great incidents and alarming paragraphs he further acquaints me that in order to recommend the st jamess chronicle he has engaged an ingenious gentleman who besides translating the mails touching up collectors paragraphs and writing occasional letters from the hague has also a sufficient portion of invention and philosophy having finished his education at st johns college cambridge to draw up accounts of earthquakes meteors and eruptions of aetna and vesuvius notwithstanding all this he requires my further assistance these i protest are matters with which i am very little acquainted yet i will strive to use the newspaper phrase to establish correspondences of another sort i will use my interest to oblige the public like boccalini with the freshest advices from parnassus or if my intelligence from that quarter should fail i hope at least to be able as well as some of my cotemporaries to produce a dialogue from among the dead  flectere si nequeo superos acheronta movebo the happiest circumstance which i can recollect in favor of these persons employed in the eternal continuation of modern history is that a peace gives consequence and dignity to several events which would be sunk and neglected during the tumult of a war we all remember to have seen the whole nation at such a period split into parties concerning the possibility of a servant girls subsisting for a month on a few crusts of bread and a pitcher of water while the wits of the age drew their pens and were ready to spill their last drop of ink on each side of the question at such a period a rabbitwoman or a fortune tellers a quack or a bottle conjurer engages the attention and engrosses the conversation of the whole town and a quarrel between a dancer and his mistress or a dispute between a couple of operasingers is of as much importance as the dissension between two generals the violence of the british spirit of party will always create fuel for its own flame to feed upon when it can no longer rage abroad it will commit devastations at home when it has no occasion to exert itself in vindication of liberty and property it will vent itself on trifles and the politicians of britain like the patriots of lilliput will divide concerning the height of shoeheels or the manner of breaking of eggs  among these domestic considerations there is one in particular which presses on my mind but though i feel its force i am quite at a loss to express my sensations the idea is indeed too big and lofty and so far above the pitch of these mean essays that i seem like the poet of old to receive an admonition from some superior to have recourse to more familiar subjects i shall therefore leave to some greater matter the endeavor to give to posterity the portrait of a king happy in the love and admiration of his subjects proud of calling every briton

sown so thick in the writings of poets and philosophers we do not in this degenerate age think ourselves sure to breathe the pure air of innocence and ancient simplicity the minute we have got out of the smoke of london we do not perceive a gradual declension of vice at every milestone or discover morality upon every haycock the clown who works at plough and cart nay even the tender of sheep for whom we have so much respect in pastoral and romance excite our veneration little more than a linkboy or a hackneycoachman the very milkmaid with her pail on her head engages our esteem no more than her fellow laborers who carry the yoke about our streets and so little do we expect to find the manners of the golden age prevail among our rusticks that we see without remorse or surprise some bumkin phillis condemned to the gallows for the murder of her bastard child or a refractory damon committed to the house of correction set in the stocks or sent abroad for a soldier  but though we have surmounted these prejudices perhaps we still retain some antiquated ideas of the manners of the country scarce less remote from those which at present reign there than even the manners of arcadia we are apt to take it for granted that there yet remains among them a strong leaven of that roughness and rusticity which was so long considered as their distinguishing characteristick it is scarce half a century ago since the inhabitants of the distant counties were regarded as a species almost as different from those of the metropolis as the natives of the cape of good hope their manners as well as dialect were entirely provincial and their dress no more resembling the habit of the town than the turkish or chinese but time which has enclosed commons and ploughed up heaths has likewise cultivated the minds and improved the behavior of the ladies and gentlemen of the country we are no longer encountered with hearty slaps on the back or pressed to make a breakfast on cold meat and strong beer and in the course of a tour of great britain you will not meet with a highcrowned hat or a pair of red stockings politeness and taste seem to have driven away the horrid specter of rudeness and barbarity that haunted the old mansion house and its purlieus and to have established their seats in the country  it is certainly to the intercourse between the town and country of late so much more frequent that this extraordinary change must be imputed every traveller that goes down to cumberland or cornwall carries in some sort the town along with him and inevitably leaves some tincture of it behind him and every visit which an honest rustic pays to london insensibly files off some of the rust of the country formerly indeed when that the roads were dark and ways were mire as milton expresses it in one of his sonnets a journey into the country was considered as almost as great an undertaking as a voyage to the indies the old family coach was sure to be stowed according to vanburghs admirable description of it with all sorts of luggage and provisions and perhaps in the course of the journey a whole village together with their teams were called in aid to dig the heavy vehicle out of the clay and to drag it to the next place of wretched accommodation which the road afforded thus they traveled like the caravan over the deserts of arabia with every disagreeable circumstance of tediousness and inconvenience but now the amendment of the roads with the many other improvements of traveling have in a manner opened a new communication between the several parts of our island the people venture forth and find themselves enabled to traverse the country with ease and expedition stagecoaches machines flys and postchaises are ready to transport passengers to and fro between the metropolis and the most distant parts of the kingdom the lover now can almost literally annihilate time and space and be with his mistress before she dreams of his arrival even a troop of geese and turkies may be driven from the country to town in a shorter time than a nobleman and his family could have taken the journey heretofore and the gamester offers to bet that he can go from london to edinburgh in twelve hours in short the manners fashions amusements vices and follies of the metropolis now make their way to the remotest corners of the land as readily and speedily along the turnpike road as of old miltons sin and death by means of their mavelous bridge over the chaos from the infernal regions to our world  the effects of this easy communication have almost daily grown more and more visible the several great cities and we might add many poor country towns seem to be universally inspired with an ambition of becoming the little londons of the part of the kingdom wherein they are situated the notions of splendour luxury and amusement that prevail in town are eagerly adopted the various changes of the fashion exactly copied and the whole manner of life studiously imitated the country ladies are as much devoted to the cardtable as the rest of the sex in london and being equally tired of making puddings and tarts or working screens and carpets they too have their routes and crowd as many of their neighbors as they can get together into their apartments they too have their balls and concerts by subscription their theaters their mall and sometimes their rural ranelagh or vauxhall the reading female hires her novels from some country circulating library which consists of about an hundred volumes or is trundled from the next market town in a wheelbarrow and the merchant or opulent hardwareman has his villa three or four miles distant from the great town where he carries on his business the nobleman and country squire no longer affect an oldfashioned hospitality or suffer the locusts of the country to eat them up while they keep open house and dispense victuals and horns of beer like the ancient convents to all comers but more fashionably display the elegance of their taste by making genteel entertainments the same french cooks are employed the same wines are drank the same gaming practiced the same hours kept and the same course of life pursued in the country as in town the force of this illustrious example influences the whole country and every male and female wishes to think and speak to eat and drink and dress and live after the manner of people of quality in london  there is no popular subject of satire on which the modern common places of wit and ridicule have been exhausted with more success than on that of a mere cockney affecting the pleasures of the country the dusty house close to the road side the halfacre of garden the canal no bigger than a washhand basin etc have all been marked out with much humor and justice but after all it is not unnatural for a tradesman who is continually pent up in the close streets and alleys of a populous city to wish for fresh air or to attempt to indulge a leisure hour in some rural occupation and he who prevails on himself to give up the enjoyments which nature has thrown into our laps in the country for a poor imitation of the follies of the town is infinitely more ridiculous lycurgus passed a law in sparta to prevent the importation of foreign vanities and not only expressly forbad the continuance of strangers in the city for fear of their corrupting the people but for the same reasons would not permit his own people to travel frequent intercourse will undoubtedly produce similarity of manners but the present communication between the various quarters of our islands are so far from being to be lamented that it is only to be wished and recommended that they may produce real refinements and improvements of a valuable nature at the same time let it be considered by our country gentlemen and ladies that no benefit can arise from changing one set of follies for another and that the vices of the town never appear so truly ridiculous or so thoroughly contemptible as when they are aukwardly practiced in the country  the genius number vi thursday august  0      alque ita mentitur sic veris falsa remiscet primo ne medium medio ne discrepet imum hor slander and seeming in the tale so mixed a thousand lies and some small truths betwixt from end to end so cunning and compact it is hard to part the falsehood from the fact  slander is an elegant and refined art which has been brought to such a wonderful perfection that it is not only universally practiced and thoroughly understood but is become the soul of polite conversation and one of the most agreeable amusements of private life formerly an infant lie fearful of detection and almost ashamed to show itself in public made its way but slowly in the world but now the grossest falsehood comes abroad with the utmost confidence and peremptorily challenges our notice and attention not content with a general assertion of any fact it delights to be minute and circumstantial enters into particulars tells you the manner how the time when the place where and gives the names of all the parties concerned such a report having gone round to every coffeehouse and got into every private family having been universally told and almost as universally credited comes at last to the ears of the persons who have been the unconscious subjects of it then the whole story proves entirely groundless but they whose reputation has been thus sported with have no remedy except the consciousness of their own integrity unless they choose to make a genteel retaliation on their next neighbor or to encounter with the air it might be deemed too severe an act of censorial authority to discountenance so polite an entertainment and might perhaps put some of the best company to silence yet since it is but of late that slander has at its very birth come forth like pallas from the head of jupiter armed at all points hedged round with circumstance and lackered over with probability it may not be incurious to enquire who are these active ministers of falsehood that set it so firmly on its legs and bring it so early to maturity i shall therefore dedicate the present paper to the description of two of these ingenious characters each of which rough draughts the reader who is at all conversant with the world will i am sure be able to apply to more than one original  lady jacyntha scandal is a woman of the first fashion and her house is the daily resort of the first company her reputation it is true is not quite unstained but the blemishes of her character like the spots in the sun are overcome by the splendour of her quality by the force of a genteel malice and pleasant ill nature together with an happy assurance that enables her to throw off the reserve of her sex she is universally acknowledged to be a wit the smartness of her repartees bespeaks uncommon vivacity and her exquisite turn for the double entendre denotes an admirable pruriency of imagination she will tell a story to a room full of mixed company almost rich enough in its circumstances for the highwrought memoirs of a woman of pleasure without using one indelicate expression without offending the chastest ear or betraying the least consciousness that she is all the while on the very brink of indecorum she receives all her visitors with the most perfect good breeding but the instant that any one of them departs he becomes the subject of her pleasantry and ridicule to those that stay behind she cannot raise our idea of her own character but she can lessen our opinion of anothers in a word her ladyship is the fear and delight the envy and scorn the honey and gall of the great world nobody thinks well of her but nobody speaks ill of her and every body visits her  neither love nor honors nor riches nor any other worldly pleasure can give half so much delight to lady jacyntha scandal as the gratification of her dear passion for mischief and there are likewise certain other female geniusses who love a little witty malice better than their prayers several of these are frequently assembled at lady jacynthas and it is to the ingenuity of this petticoat junto that the strange reports which alarm the whole town are often owing they are not contented with the more than usual poignancy of their chitchat over the teatable but set themselves to invent important slanders and to devise the surest means to give them color if some palefaced london coquette some hagged member of the cabal worn to the bone with paint and late hours is offended with the ruddy bloom of some new toast from the country it is here that she meditates revenge and it is suddenly proclaimed or as the phrase is reported that the innocent young lady has been detected in the grossest familiarities with one of her fathers footmen or if a duchess has piqued some of the junto by excluding them from her route or leaving them uninvited to a ball her rank will so little avail to exempt her from the like treatment that the slander will rather be aggravated in proportion to the dignity of its object  never did statesman study more attentively the art of political lying or stockjobber use more stratagems to raise or sink the value of the funds than are used by the ingenious junto to send forth an injurious report with secrecy nobody knows on what authority the story is founded which every body repeats and it is as impossible to trace the slander up to its source as to discover the head of the nile i have observed indeed that it commonly takes its rise in the most distant quarter from that where the parties reside whom it is intended to affect when a person of high rank is destined for the victim an emissary is dispatched to set the story abroach at some obscure coffeehouse in the city whence it speedily marches to its head quarters near the court or if perhaps some rich banker and his family are to be made a sacrifice it is whispered about the politer part of the town that a certain great house near the royal exchange has stopped payment sometimes the curious tale seems to have traveled out of the country and sometimes like the great fire of london it breaks out in several quarters of the town at once however come whence it may true or false probable or improbable down it goes and the dear witty sweet mischievous creatures who invented it practice ten thousand additional little arts to give it credit they do not believe indeed that the thing happened just as it is related but then there must be something in it say what they will or else how could there be such a number of particulars they have heard too good souls nay they know that the parties themselves are very uneasy at the story and have taken a great deal of pains to discredit it which looks very suspicious for why should they be so concerned if  in part at least it were not true or suffer their peace to be broken by a mere idle report with such candor and humanity do lady jacyntha and the rest of these good sort of people express their sentiments and at the same time many of the most intimate friends of the persons reviled repeat the slander or at least make no efforts to contradict it yet where is the offense or injury it was not their invention you know and they only joined in the common talk of the town  lord bacon somewhere remarks that great inquisitiveness and curiosity concerning the affairs of others is one of the chief characteristicks of envy it would be unpardonable to attribute so black a passion to a fine lady and yet it is certain that no mortal was ever more strongly possessed of that inquiring spirit than lady jacyntha scandal she will hold long conferences for the sake of intelligence with her mantuamaker or milliner and has an admirable knack at drawing the secrets of families from servants and children by these and the like means she is acquainted with the private business and private pleasures of the whole town nobody knows so well as her ladyship what ladys diamonds are in pawn what dukes estate was lately mortgaged what lords sisters fortunes are not paid off what poet keeps a mistress what young man and woman are clandestinely married or what grave judge has been caught in a frolicksome vein at a game of romps with his cookmaid such are the anecdotes which she is eager to learn and her assiduity in collecting them is only to be equalled by her industry in making them public  equally attached to slander but of the other sex and of a lower rank is the pert volatile prating scribbling jacky tattle jacky is the son of an attorney of furnivalsinn and was originally intended for his fathers profession but the strength of his genius soon drew him from the desk and carried him amongst underactors underauthors and women of the town in which company he soon converted his pertness into assurance and wonderfully improved his natural talents for lying and defamation slander may indeed be said to be his passion and to spread it his daily employment and as birds are observed to peck the finest fruit so this fluttering tomtit always aims his petulant attacks at the fairest characters the company with which he associates naturally deal in detraction his folly induces him to give credit to the slander and his vanity often urges him publicly to interfere in it he is also a great writer of anonymous epistles from unknown friends as well as incendiary letters from secret enemies he sometimes amuses himself with sending letters and paragraphs to the newspapers in which he sometimes appears as a sixlined epigrammatist and is confidently said to be the author of several articles in the new review if ever you observe an impertinent fellow in the next box at a coffeehouse listening to your private conversation with a friend or casting his eye over a letter which you are reading or writing that is jacky tattle  or if you see a strange townfly fluttering at the playhouse staring every body out of countenance and buzzing about the theater now in the orchestra now in the greenboxes and byandby behind the scenes that is jacky tattle  poor jackys courage is unhappily not quite adequate to his malignity so that his indiscretions have sometimes betrayed him into punishment for his slanders yet his appetite for detraction must be gratified he considers himself as a formidable adversary to several characters of merit and is thoroughly persuaded that the ladies all believe him to be a wit and a fine gentleman  the genius number vii tuesday september        hic vir hic est tibi quem promitti saepius audis

shore and in our times the golden age restore  notwithstanding the rigor of some critics which would entirely preclude the choice of temporary subjects there are no parts of periodical publications which have been more favorably received at their first appearance or afforded more entertainment afterward than such as were founded on matters merely fugitive and peculiar to the time in which they were written such pieces become a kind of supplement to history they furnish the curious with anecdotes and it is from these materials that the literary virtuoso collects the manners fashions and customs of his ancestors the tatlers and spectators for instance serve almost as effectually as a gallery of pictures to show the habits in vogue at that period and are at the same time a kind of historical register of the prevailing pleasures and the objects of public attention in the perusal of these papers we seem to be endued like janus with a sort of backward face that enables us to take a clear retrospective view of times past we spend evenings at the clubs of our fathers some of whom may perhaps have been mohocks and gain admittance to the toilets of our mothers and grandmothers we read not without satisfaction comments on the performances of actors whom we never saw we look upon the celebrated trunkmaker with a veneration equal to that of his cotemporaries and are hugely entertained at powells puppetshew  it is to be considered that periodical writers converse more familiarly with the public than any other authors they are allowed nay expected to chat of themselves the play the opera and are even in danger of being neglected if they omit to discourse on the popular topics of conversation our good advice for we are all sagacious monitors of the public must not be obtruded on our readers but must seem to be ushered in by the occasion and to take its color from the times the present complexion of the people is such that i find it absolutely vain and ridiculous to attempt writing to them on any other subject than that of the royal wedding and coronation my printer too has most earnestly requested me to give what he calls a touch on the times and to say something on these great occasions he tells me that there is scarce one of his customers who would not sooner give a guinea for a nights lodging on the floor at greenwich or five for the sake of sitting eight and forty hours in westminster abbey than part with twopence halfpenny for the genius unless it treats of those solemnities scarce a paragraph of news relating to any other matters will go down the proceedings of the court of claims the ladies coronation robes and the aldermens coronation wigs furnish out the most interesting articles of intelligence the master of an alehouse in the next lane to my apartments has hung out a paper lanthorn to advertise the neighborhood that he sells the best mecklenburg purl and coronation porter the theaters are i doubt not both employed in the preparation of entertainments suitable to the splendour and joy of these happy celebrities and a famous fieldpreacher has to my knowledge already anticipated the archbishop in a coronation sermon  i have also lately been honored with a packet of letters from several correspondents not one of which but relates to these two grand occasions of festivity many i find are sollicitous to know what will become of the genius and into what corner he will squeeze his little body at the coronation a gentleman who signs himself timothy cautious tells me that in case i have no ticket i may easily be conveyed into the hall undiscovered in some old countesss pocket or be rolled up and overshadowed by the full bottom of a noblemans periwig a lady gives herself the trouble to recapitulate the advantages and disadvantages of my person on this occasion and informs me that indeed i may be put any where but that unfortunately i shall be able to see no where another correspondent who subscribes himself coke junior and dates from the inner temple says that he hopes i have secured a place in westminsterhall and adds but i do not know what he means by it that he should be glad to see me appear there oftener than i used to do the two following letters are i think the most proper of any i have received to submit to my reader at full length to them therefore i shall devote the rest of this paper  the first comes from a lady and is as follows  to the genius sir i have often lamented that i did not live in those illustrious ages of the world when our sex was allowed to distinguish itself by acts of prowess and chivalry i should have delighted to have traversed the deserts and to have rescued innocent virgins in distress the degeneracy of the present times has often been the cause of my sore affliction and there is no circumstance from which i have ever in my life reaped so much consolation as from the thoughts of the approaching coronation which solemnity still retains some leaven of the ancient manners of this kingdom of which i can vouch no stronger testimony than the wellknown ceremony of the champion in westminster hall but there is however even in this some deficiency which i am ready and willing to supply since the king has graciously thought fit to adorn this high festival with the presence of a queen it is surely a dishonor to her merits and an indignity to the whole sex that one should be wanting to vindicate her beauty when a champion appears to assert the rights of his majesty tilts and jousts and tournaments were originally instituted almost entirely in honor of the ladies and a total neglect of them in such ceremonies reflects disgrace on our national gallantry a noble spaniard would be shocked to think of it to prevent this dishonor and to preserve the glory of the nation i do most humbly propose myself as a lady championess and intend to enter the hall properly accoutred and properly attended immediately after the departure of the champion i have already trained and disciplined a milkwhite palfrey for this purpose and mean to be attended with none other than the genius for my dwarf of which i hereby give you notice that you invest yourself with suitable habiliments and otherwise prepare yourself for this awful occasion  thalestris dymoke given this thirtieth of august       the other letter comes from a

would in general almost as soon wish for a plague as an easterly wind but now i pray for it every hour in the day in short sir these thoughts have filled my brains so long and possessed themselves so entirely of my imagination that the wind has got up into my head and is attended with all the symptoms of a poetical vertigo modern odes are you must alallow the most flatulent of all compositions you

the politics and morals of the state the peoples various manners i will relate  the learned and honorable trustees of the british museum well knowing and duly considering the great work in which i am engaged and thoroughly weighing the infinite importance of it to the morals of the people of great britain have graciously resolved to afford me every assistance in their power and given orders to the proper officers for my constant admission to the readingroom with free leave to peruse such old papers and scarce manuscripts as my curiosity may lead me to look into they have also further shown themselves so favorably inclined to me and my undertakings that they have set apart a certain angle of the room for my particular use wherein there is erected an elegant machine curiously contrived by mr burnet cabinetmaker in the strand and known by the name of the geniuss readingdesk this machine in consideration of my diminutiveness is constructed somewhat on the principles of that used by gulliver in brobdignag and has often enabled me to manage the most unwieldy volumes with ease as well as by means of its steps to climb up to the top of the page of many a tall folio the modern artificers of furniture have cultivate no taste in movables with more success than that which they call the book fashion which is an ingenious method of reducing teachests to the shape and semblance of octavos and duodecimos as well as bedes and other necessary utensils of a larger size to the figure of quartos and folios these goods may be had neatly gilt and lettered at the warehouse of any fashionable upholsterer but where could such a mode be followed with such strict propriety as in the construction of the implements of literature on your first entrance into the room you would take the geniuss reading desk for an irregular heap of books of different sizes thrown carelessly one upon another and as it is usual to preserve some analogy between the mock volumes and the moveable which takes their form commonly appropriating popes letters the spectators etc to the teatable and waste paper histories etc to the closet in like manner the artist has ingeniously raised the steps of my desk upon statius and scaliger and up ton and step ney and mount any etc with many other curious conceits of the like nature not unworthy the genius of an upholsterer a waggish cantab who popt into the room the other day after having examined the desk with great attention told me that he sound the genius like bays had certain mechanical helps for wit and christened it after the university style of punning my gradus ad parnassum  a few days ago as i was studiously employed at this desk and preparing to say a word or two to the public as it were ex cathedra a sagacious friend of mine belonging to the museum who is for ever peering with his purblind eyes into some curiosity or brushing with his learned nose the dust from some rare manuscript threw a bundle of papers before me this choice packet appeared upon examination to have been formerly in the possession of sir thomas more our great chancellor of worthy and facetious memory to whom it was addressed by petrus aegidius or as some translators call him peter giles of antwerp the very person to whom the chancellor inscribed his history of utopia this manuscript contains a full detail of the laws manners customs etc of the inhabitants of the island of anemolia taken from memory by petrus aegidius like sir thomas mores own narrative from the relation of raphael this country as well as several others mentioned in these papers is i find taken notice of in the utopia and sir thomas speaking cursorily of the people calls them superbi magis quam sapientes a proud rather than a wise nation my veneration for manuscripts is not so implicit as to think with some antiquarians that every old paper is worthy to be printed which has not yet been in print but as i look upon this to be of an extremely curious nature i shall put it to the press with all convenient speed and my friend abovementioned has for the benefit of the illiterate cheerfully submitted to the labor of a translation this valuable narrative is written originally like the utopia in very elegant latin and the genuine papers for the satisfaction of the virtuosi shall lie till the time of publication at mr beckets bookseller in the strand in the mean time i have thought proper to amuse my readers with the following extracts made here and there from different parts of this valuable work and i believe that most persons will readily concur with me merely from this specimen that anemolia must be the most extraordinary country under the sun  anemoliorum lingua suavior auditu verbis abundantior fidelior animi interpres mutila ipsi autem etc apud m s there is no language in the world more sweet more copious and better adapted to express the meaning of the speaker than that of the anemolians and yet what is very wonderful the anemolians themselves never make use of it in conversation but having discarded their own native tongue just after it had arrived to its highest pitch of perfection they have by a kind of general infatuation adopted the harsher dialect of their neighbors and natural enemies the achorians the children of the lowest artificers are early instructed in the achorian language and are much ashamed if they happen by chance to express themselves in their mother tongue from this strange national folly the achorians have assumed an air of great superiority and affect to regard the anemolians as little better than barbarians so very unaccountable and yet so deeply rooted is this contempt for their native language that during the short time i sojourned among them a grammar of its rudiments and principles was burnt by the common hangman and a very ingenious author was condemned to be starved to death for having compiled an anemolian dictionary  their passion for literature such as it is is so violent that the number of their publications is incredible they have indeed among their ancient authors several excellent writers on almost every subject but these like their language are grown obsolete for the anemolians are such wonderful lovers of novelty that they indulge a desire for literary trash almost as intemperate and irregular as the longings of pregnant women or rather like the false appetite of green sickness girls for chalk oatmeal and unripe fruit several thousand printed sheets of paper are published every morning as many at noon and as many more every evening besides which a vast variety of thin volumes containing certain sippets of philosophy morality and the arts make their appearance with every new moon but most of these hourly daily and monthly publications are calculated merely for the amusement of the hour in which they come forth and grow immediately afterward as dull useless and unentertaining as a last years almanac hence these publications are in the phrase of that country very properly styled periodical the art of writing is indeed nearly fallen into utter contempt among them and become a mean handicraft business and wretched manufacture so venal a profession is exercised by few or none of any reputation whence it happens that though their new books are almost innumerable the number of their writers is exceedingly small four or five persons being the sole authors of every work in every science in each of which they acquit themselves with equal dexterity  the anemolians affect an uncommon love for natural freedom but their aim in this as in most other particulars appears to be mercenary endeavoring to gain pecuniary advantages to themselves by converting their liberty into property according to these principles the common inhabitants of every town and district within the kingdom set themselves to public sale by auction once in seven years two or three and sometimes four or five or six or seven of superior rank appear as purchasers at the same place on which occasions the highest bidder is the buyer by these means the venal commonalty often extort large sums being paid for like cattle at so much per head and yet they have frequent cause to repent of their bargain though it is but common justice to add that the purchasers also frequently pay more for them than they are worth  p s having proceeded thus far in translating the passages i have selected from the ms i find that my extracts are too large to come within the compass of one paper i am therefore obliged to reserve the rest among which are many curious particulars relating to the ladies for my next with whch i shall present the reader as soon as possible  the genius number ix saturday september         quod te per genium dextramque deosque penates obsro and obestor vitae

present ills with comforts past and be with your first fortunes blessed as last  as the following letter is the first of any consequence with which i have been favored from a female hand the preference due to a lady must be my apology for deferring the rest of the manuscript relating to the anemolians to my next paper  to the genius sir when i inform you that i am just raised from the humble condition of plain mrs greenfield to the honor of being the lady of a member of parliament when i tell you that my husband was at the last general election chosen by a great majority of voters for one of the most eminent countytowns in the kingdom when i further add on good authority that the petition intended to have been preferred against him is withdrawn and that he seems likely to sit out his seven years in the honorable house of commons when i send you sir all this seeming good news it only serves to acquaint you in other words that i am one of the most unhappy women upon earth that my husband is an undone man and that my dear children though born to some estate are in danger of being thrown upon the wide world to earn their uncertain bread  but that which adds the greater acuteness to my misery is the sad and sudden revolution of our fortune for we are not only hurried to certain destruction but drawn from a state of the most perfect tranquillity i have now been married almost fourteen years my husband always behaved to me with the truest tenderness and affection the whole study of my life has been to promote his happiness and our little family has all that while lived comfortably in a cheap country upon a very moderate fortune but alas the late general election has entirely reversed our situation you must know sir that our county like many others is unhappily split into little parties and sactions and a perpetual contest is kept alive by the two most opulent persons in it which of them shall have the credit with the great folks above as the phrase is of managing the rest a noble peer in our neighborhood who is the person that carries on this important dispute with a wealthy baronet did us the honor of a visit about a year ago earnestly entreating my husband to appear with another gentleman in his lordships interest as a joint candidate for the countytown in opposition to two others supported by the baronet my husbands vanity and ambition took the alarm in an instant and he was all on fire for the honor of representing so respectable a place in parliament only two small objections presented themselves the first was that his property lying chiefly in the funds his landed estate did not quite amount to the yearly value which it seems is required as a necessary qualification and the second was that his property taken all together would by no means enable him to defray the numerous and heavy expenses of a contested election both these objections were however without much difficulty surmounted my husband had indeed at first some scruples of conscience on the first article as neither he nor i could think it possible for him to take the oath of qualification with his seat without the requisite addition to his estate an eminent lawyer fetched from the inns of court in london on purpose soon solved this difficulty and made out a qualification in form by means of an hocuspocus conveyance from my lord to my husband by which they tell me that my husband has enlarged his estate though i know too well that he has not added to his income as to the second objection that was immediately got over by his lordships declaration that he meant to defray the whole expense of the election himself my husband therefore cheerfully presented himself as a candidate but i must not forget to mention that though he was brought in by the noble lord as the whole country will tell you for nothing it cost us very near a thousand pounds there were several unforeseen incident expenses created chiefly by the zeal of my husbands best friends and those who were most warm in his interest of which expenses as he seemed to be the immediate cause though incurred without his direction he was ashamed to carry in the bills to his lordship at the close of the contest which had cost the parties both together above thirty times that sum  but this loss as it was the first so it would have been the least and most easily to be put up with if my husband had been so fortunate as to have lost his election i must repeat to you sir that he was chosen by an indisputable majority and i repeat it to you not without sorrow as i now too late discover the wisdom of the legislature in demanding such a qualification in property since i see that a large estate is necessary to keep up the consequence even of a dependent member as well as to support the real dignity of independence the change in my husbands situation is much less extraordinary than the alteration in his ideas he is no longer contented with being a plain country gentleman as heretofore but considers himself as a kind of public character our house is now thrown open to all comers and goers and all the honest freemen must be indulged with the run of our cellar and kitchen we have treated the worshipful corporation more than once and every private gentleman must be loaded with civilities in proportion to his influence and interest my husband was formerly of some use to the country merely by acting in the commission of the peace but he has now on the death of his lordships brother been appointed colonel of our militia at our last assizes he was unanimously chosen to be foreman of the grand jury and now that his presence is become of so much consequence in the county i know that he will think it indispensibly requisite for him always to fill the chair at the sessions these and several other countydignities with which i plainly foresee he will be honored will not be maintained without extraordinary expenses besides those which must inevitably attend the necessary journies between town and country  from my mention of journies you will immediately conclude that we have an house in town to take one was indeed the first resolution which my husband made after his election and that we are already in possession of a very handsome house in one of the most fashionable parts of the town is no inconsiderable circumstance of my unhappiness we came to london time enough you may be sure to attend the coronation and several of the electors being drawn up to town by the same great occasion my husband hired a room at the price of an hundred guineas for our own and their accommodation to see the procession these little acts of kindness my dear says he to me done for a small expense at a time when they appear disinterested go as far as twentyfold that sum in seasons of commotion and distress indeed nothing seems to terrify him so much as the apprehensions of being thought niggardly in his notions and narrow in his economy he has of late frequently reprehended me for the plainness of my dress and tells me that the lady of a member of parliament especially the representative of a place of so much consequence ought to make a genteel appearance i am in great fear of his presenting me with some jewels he has already provided a splendid equipage and has put the servants into laced liveries and moreover insists on our having a mancook for says he i shall often bring home some of my brother members to dinner and you know my dear they are used to good living and must have their things well done  as my husband has hitherto always behaved in a prudent and reasonable manner this strange extravagance would almost persuade me that he was out of his senses if i did not see that a foolish infatuation and i know not what idea of being in parliament has seized his mind this he tells me is the crisis of his fortune and that his success in his election will prove the making of his family a seat in parliament he looks upon as a mere earnest of the honors which he is hereafter to enjoy he assures me again and again that the most eminent persons in the kingdom have risen to their present dignities by the sole force of parliamentary talents and that for his own part he has no doubt of making his way now he has once got into the road of preferment he seems so sure to carry his point that he even threatens to take no notice of any of his relations but such as shall show him due attention and respect and he has just determined to send our eldest boy who is about nine years of age to westminster school because he thinks he has discovered in the lad something of an oratorical turn i am very well assured from all his conversation and behavior that his vanity prompts him to believe that he shall make himself of consequence in parliament and i am very much afraid that he will open his mouth almost immediately after he has taken his seat and expose himself in public for i who am partial to him yet know him too well to imagine that any success can attend his efforts to shine in eloquence or politics you may smile perhaps sir and think that i consider the matter too minutely but i am fully persuaded that he often means to try the strength of his talents as a speaker on me and the little circle of familiar friends that drop in to visit us he takes up every thing in a style of argument and authority runs the easy chat of conversation into politics and talks with much vehemence for a long time together upon subjects which neither i nor any of my female acquaintance can at all comprehend he tells me over and over alone and in company that there is a great scene opening upon us that the commencement of a new reign and a new parliament must of course produce great events and that those who have the ablest talents for the business of the house will be the most certain to distinguish themselves and reap the greatest share of honor and profit  for my part sir i am no mrs western and pretend to no skill in politics neither am i of opinion that a candidates being possessed of wealth enough to bribe his constituents ought to recommend him to their choice but i am fully satisfied that a considerable degree of poperty is necessary to his integrity since without it the greatest talents will not avail to preserve his independence my husband for example publicly declares and seems to affect a consequence from it that he shall always go with his lordship he seems indeed to be so involved in his parliamentary system that he has quite lost sight of his domestic economy while he is bringing his vast schemes to bear he will be every day hastening his ruin the success with which he is so elevated is a piece of good fortune that brings destruction along with it for what advantage can be derived from any preferment which requires a man to make his expenses amount to above double the value of his receipts i can account easily enough for the manner in which we are to support our way of living during the present year and the same foresight convinces me that it will be absolutely impossible for us to go through another the follies of most married men are charged on their wives but this i am sure has from first to last been pursued as well as undertaken much against my consent it was with a heavy heart that i saw my husband enter into this project and it was with still greater uneasiness i saw him persist in his townscheme since i am well convinced that our journey to london must end like sir francis wrongheads in a journey into the country again  i am sir your

did the same we do at home and by another name though known believed that city like our own  i have received the following note in consequence of the extract from the latin manuscript with which i presented my readers a few days ago  to the genius plague on your anemolians and nonsense and stuff if you have any faults to find with us honest britons why dont you tell us so in plain english  yours john trot   i am sorry to have excited master john trots indignation but if his objections to my pursuing the subject are insuperable i hereby give him fair warning not to peruse the present paper i shall only observe that travelers writing chiefly for the instruction and entertainment of their own countrymen while they describe the manners of foreign nations and exhibit remote scenes are apt like other scenepainters to work in distemper and draw things and persons larger than the life that they may strike at a distance this perhaps is in some measure the case with our present author the remaining extracts are as follow  mulieres quidem etc apud ms the anemolian women are equal in beauty even to the circassians and have also learned from some europeans who were cast away on their coast the same method of preserving that beauty from the ravages of the most cruel of distempers this uncommon beauty would give them almost an absolute power over the men if they did not themselves use their utmost efforts to dim its luster and to nip their growing charms in the bud or to destroy them in their full bloom for as the indelicate females among the hottentots twine the fat and entrails of animals round their arms and legs and rub their bodies with filth thinking thereby to heighten their charms and render their figures more agreeable so the women of anemolia not content with that portion of charms which heaven has allotted them are perpetually retouching by art the beautiful originals of nature till they become the most execrable daubs that ever were beheld if a prince had a palace built of handsome stone or perhaps the finest marble beautifully variegated by the hand of nature in the quarry should you not esteem him a madman to cover it with plaster and rough cast what then shall we say of the women of a nemolia who pollute the sacred temples of their persons by encrusting them with a coat of ceruss and deadening the native vivacity of their features with an artificial enamel a practice so unnatural has i find betrayed me into metaphor and allusion but the fact as heaven shall prosper me is literally true first they varnish their faces necks and arms like a whitened wall and then they lay fantastic colorings red brown or black according to their various imaginations upon that ground some females have the art of blanching their necks with a curious preparation which hardens on their bosoms like mortar in a building and like that too will abide all the changes of the seasons for an whole year but this process requires time and confines the lady that submits to it for some weeks during the time that i was in anemolia i remember it was once the darling piece of scandal among the ladies of quality in niroe the capital of that country that a noblemans daughter who for a few days ceased to appear at public places had absconded in order to be delivered of an illegitimate child but the real truth was that the young lady lay in bed a month merely to bring the crust on her neck to a proper consistency and bake it as it were in an oven and at the end of that period she entirely defeated the malice of her enemies and confuted their slander by coming forth with a ghostly bosom and as dead a white as alabaster the greatest misfortune attending this and every other practice of the like nature is that it soon utterly destroys that exquisite beauty which at first it serves but to eclipse the mixtures used for these purposes are it seems composed of poison so that few retain any of their original charms after they are three or four and twenty years of age and many of them even before that period become horrible to look upon one of the prevailing beauties at court at my arrival in anemolia was in a few weeks afterward struck blind another object of public admiration soon after lost all her teeth at once and a third was suddenly deprived of the use of her limbs as it were by a stroke of the palsy and became bedridden such dreadful occurrences happened daily and yet the rising generation of females continued the practice this among many other follies was originally imported from achoria where it is not quite so wonderful that it should prevail for the women of that country being naturally of a dark and dingy complexion and destitute of the delicacy peculiar to those of anemolia more readily recur to the resources of art to mend the imperfection of nature  i have presented the reader with the above passage because i think it extremely curious but i cannot help fancying that our author has transgressed the bounds of credibility in this part of his narrative it is impossible that any females should be guilty of such detestable wickedness or give into such gross absurdity the accurate reader will easily conjecture from some peculiarities of expression in the above extract that i have rendered the original with great exactness the translation is indeed very literal except that i have here and there taken the liberty to soften some phrases of indignation and reproach which would be esteemed vulgar in our tongue though they have a certain dignity in the learned languages but to proceed from our ms  the women of anemolia conscious of the attraction of their form and vain of the elegance with which they flatter themselves they have embellished it are fond of displaying all its various excellencies their arms are uncovered up to the elbow their necks and bosoms are laid bare or thinly shaded with transparent veils of the most delicate texture the same vanity induces them to lavish on their persons a profusion of ornaments of gold and silver and precious stones and as many ribbands as an heifer of old going to the altar as a sacrife they long ago discarded the simple national habit of anemolia to adopt the fantastic dresses of the achorians and so fearful are they of failing to keep pace with that nation in the various changes and revolutions of their garb that may i perish if it be not truth  the clothes of the chief people in the kingdom men as well as women are manufactured and made up in achoria and transported thence by the first fair wind to anemolia  porro autem apud anemolios meretricum quaestus etc apud ms moreover among the anemolians the trade of courtezans excessive drunkenness the open exercise of profane swearing and all manner of gaming are undoubtedly licensed by the laws of the land i had not time indeed to make a very nice scrutiny into their constitution and go regularly through the three hundred thousand volumes in which their laws are enrolled but am nevertheless assured that i cannot be deceived in this circumstance because the vices abovementioned are so openly practiced even under the nose of the magistrates that i am very confident they must have obtained the sanction of public authority as soon as the evening comes on a large number of loose women are ordered to issue forth into the streets and to use their utmost efforts to decoy passengers into certain houses appointed for their reception stated quarters of the metropolis are particularly dedicated to the purposes of riot and debauchery where lust drunkenness and blasphemy hold their constant reign while in other districts of the capital some of the first dignitaries of the state principally concerned in the legislature have instituted societies of gaming and indeed there are few polite families which have not their meetings of this nature  the open practice of so many exorbitant vices i must confess created in me much astonishment at my first arrival in the kingdom but i was on further reflection inclined to consider this extraordinary license not to say licentiousness as the effect of deep policy the promiscuous commerce with loose women is perhaps encouraged in order to turn the minds of the young men from any attempt at adultery which it seems was formerly too prevalent in anemolia but the trade of courtezans is not only thus authorized but the benevolence of the public has also instituted nurseries for their education appointed noble provisions for them in their pregnancy as well as receptacles for their children and a comfortable retreat for themselves  it were also to be wished on account of some small inconveniences at present subsisting that the courtezans were obliged to wear a numbered ticket like the porters and hackney coaches among you in england and made responsible to certain commissioners for their behavior in their profession  drunkards and profane swearers as well as common beggars are i suppose suffered to infest the public streets like the intoxicated slaves which the lacedaemonians exhibited to their children in order to deter others from those odious practices and scandalous ways of life but why every mode of gaming is pursued among them with so much zeal and vehemence unless it be a part of their religion i am quite at a loss to determine or comprehend on the same principles with those abovementioned suits at law are embarrassed with a thousand perplexities prolonged by the most tedious delays and loaded with most heavy expenses the wise cause of all these troubles attending legal disputes is merely to deter the citizens from idle litigations which is evident from their proceedings in matters of a criminal nature there the offender is brought to an immediate trial his offense is immedately examined with the utmost expedition and the sentence of the law put into immediate execution upwards of three hundred criminals being publicly hanged every new moon   i was particularly desirous of laying the above paragraph before the reader though it contains little else than mere matter of reflection because i think nothing so much illustrates a book of voyages and tends so much to the improvement of the reader as the sagacious and just observations with which the traveller is commonly so kind as to oblige him  but to proceed from our author  quod ad religionem attinet etc apud ms as to the religion of the country as i hinted above i am not able to give a very clear account of it i was indeed in doubt for some time whether the anemolians had any system of worship established among them but observing that there was one day which the commonalty devoted to pleasure and dissoluteness i found upon enquiry that it was their usual manner of celebrating the sabbath so far from being destitute of a religion they may be said to be over run with religions as a different persuasion prevails in every street nay almost in every house they have many wise teachers learned in matters of divinity among their artizans and mechanics and there are also several sagacious elderly females who take upon them the care of instructing their own and the other sex in all points of religious faith some of them maintain polytheism others are given to deism and a great number of them are religiously devoted if i may use the phrase on this occasion to atheism the europeans who were thrown on the coast introduced christianity among them but i am sorry to say it the true faith has not taken deep root in anemolia some indeed among them persons of the purest lives were struck with the force and dignity of its precepts and readily embraced the tenets of christianity but scoffers at its doctrines soon arose without number and several authors of the most eminent abilities and elevated rank have made it their particular study to write against its doctrines miracles etc though it must be owned that there have not been wanting full as able advocates on the other side of the question  vereor hercle ne etc apud ms i am almost afraid that what i am now going to relate will hardly obtain credit as it is so diametrically opposite to the course of things in every other part of the globe few if any of the anemolians die a natural death such as are not put to death by the hands of justice or accidents or suddenly taken off by apoplexies palsies or the like fall by selfmurder the rage of suicide comes on regularly like the moultingtime of birds at a particular season of the year which commences at the fall of the leaf mechanics and other people of mean condition commonly hang or drown themselves statesmen generally die by poison and most of the nobility fall on their swords or shoot themselves through the head about the middle of november every pond is filled with carcases and dead bodies hang on every tree i was extremely shocked at this impious prodigality of their lives but the survivors among the natives are not at all affected by it and behold the daily suicides committed by their nearest relations without the least emotion they told me that it was constitutional either originally in their natures or generated in them by the climate they further assured me that if i remained long among them the fogs which are so thick and frequent in that country would by degrees oppress my spirits and fill me with a horror of life and all its attendant vexations  other reasons might indeed be assigned  however i was so shocked and alarmed at this information that i departed from their country the first opportunity  the genius number xi thursday october         multa fero ut placem genus irritabile vatum cum scribo and supplex populi suffragia capto hor the spleen of testy authors to subdue to bribe the public voice by flattery too an humble author much i learn to bear that when i write my writings they may spare  swift by way of describing a reigning controversy of those times has left us a most droll and humourous account of a battle of the books in st jamess library and boileau in his lutrin has with equal pleasantry brought the two adverse parties in his poem together in a booksellers shop where they break out into open war and convert the books into weapons of offense many harmless volumes are torn from their shelves and fly through the air as thick as hail and many a french divine lies sprawling beneath the weight of hardbound poetry heavy systems of philosophy and huge bodies of the law  such a description as that of the french writer would i think be peculiarly applicable to the frequent and violent quarrels among authors the republic of letters is in a kind of perpetual civil war and the beginning of every winter may be considered as the opening of a new literary campaign the short summer truce hardly kept with good faith is soon violated and while heroes suspend the shedding of blood in war authors contend which shall spill most ink in controversy one discharges the blunderbuss of his wit and out comes an ode a second after whetting the rusty sword of his genius cuts you with a satire a third  but it is endless to go through all the weapons of elegy song epigram etc and recite the whole artillery of wit  to it they go pelemele and instead of making a general attack on vice and folly confine themselves to individual knaves and fools and fall on one another it is fortunate enough for all new adventurers in these literary engagements that they do not make war exactly after the manner described by boileau but that every author throws his work like a bomb into the town leaving it to do what mischief it may without immediately levelling the volume itself at the head of his antagonist if that were the case as at the booksellers in the lutrin we have among us many authors that would be most formidable adversaries even to homer himself writers who could overwhelm all the poets and philosophers of antiquity with a deluge of literature and carry all before them in a torrent of folios quartos and duodecimos of their own composition  one would imagine that every author is a natural enemy to every other author and that the pursuit of letters which should refine and humanize the mind serves only to embitter it no princes can be more jealous of a neighbors growing power than some authors of a cotemporarys infant fame in their own reputation too they are tender even to soreness and do not consider that all who court applause may at the same time be said to solicit censure accordingly each writer has his flatterers and his enemies and if he is vain enough to listen to the adulation of one set of men and weak enough to feel the malice of the other he becomes the most unhappy being upon earth the very nature of his employment betrays him and his quarrels to public ridicule other men differ and are reconciled in secret but the contention of authors is studiously carried on in the most open manner and they cut each other to pieces like prizefighters for the diversion of the rest of the world  the great success of one or two giant satyrists of transcendant abilities has tempted almost every puny witling to imagine that same and infamy are at his disposal he gives you to understand that unless you pay due homage to his extraordinary genius your name shall be registered in the black scroll of disgrace and he stands like a fretful porcupine ready to dart his quills at all that make him angry there are however a few considerations not unworthy the attention of a writer so subject to irritability he may undoubtedly be of infinite consequence to himseif every man especially every author is so but it is ten to one if he is of equal consequence to the public his works indeed if they are the result of genius may engage their attention but his private differences will most probably be thought impertinent i do not know a more ridiculous circumstance than a couple of scribblers both big with vanity calling each other fool and blockhead it is exactly the scene of vadius and trissotin in moliere which i am surprised that no one in this age of authors has translated for the english stage  another reflection which might curb their headstrong pegasus if he runs riot on the high road of satire is that after all let him write ever so bitterly and ever so well the public are candid and impartial and will give him credit no farther than he confirms their own sentiments and echoes back their own opinion pope himself has not been able to rob the eternal butt of his invective colley cibber of one grain of applause that is due to him and the united efforts of both him and swift powerful as they were were levelled in vain against dryden vanburgh steel and i will not add addison the best answer that an author can make to another who calls him dull that dreadful sentence is to write as well as he can and if he is not able to confute him that way he becomes his own satirist but the chief consideration which should abate the severity of irritated writers is the danger of failing in their attempt to maim and murder reputations to hack and hew and gash at random is indeed what any butcherly scribbler may attempt but to keep up the fine edge of true satire requires a very masterly hand and if his satire proves uncouth and his execution coarse it turns back with tenfold force upon himself and fastens on him the odious imputation of malice without wit and envy without abilities  but the worst consequence flowing from this ill blood between the writers of our times is that it discourages many men possessed of noble talents from exerting them in the cause of literature fearful of being engaged in this illiberal warfare they will not venture to commit their pieces to the press they would patiently abide the correction of fair critieism but do not care to provoke unmannerly censures  in this temper of mind the following lines seem to have been written at least it was the perusal of them which threw me into the above vein of

husband kind and to a servants failings often blind never paying by a sottish phrenzy led a broken bottle with a broken head  of all the qualifications of the mind which are not positive virtues i do not know any that is more desirable than good humor no quality renders the possessor more easy and happy in himself or recommends him more forcibly to other people virtue itself receives additional luster abates the rigid severity of its character and takes its most ravishing graces and embellishments from such a disposition a disposition so amiable in its nature that even a man of loose principles when of so agreeable a turn often conciliates to himself many friends and wellwishers the men at least allow that he is a pleasant fellow court his company and account him nobodys enemy but his own while the women call him a dear agreeable creature and declare that though to be sure he is a wild devil it is quite impossible to be angry with him  it is hardly saying too much in favor of this quality to assert that it is one of the first requisites in society for though strict honor and integrity are of more essential value in the grand purposes of human life yet good humor like small money is of more immediate use in the common commerce of the world there is no situation in life no engagement in business or party of pleasure wherein it will not contribute to mitigate disappointments or heighten enjoyment a husband friend acquaintance master or even servant however faithful or affectionate will occasion many miserable hours to himself as well as to those with whom he is connected if his virtues are not seasoned with good humor and whether he is a partner for life or a partner in a countrydance an associate in great and mighty undertakings or a companion in a postchaise he should on every occasion cherish and keep alive this agreeable disposition  some persons may almost be said to be of a goodhumoured complexion and seem to be constitutionally endued with this amiable turn of mind a blessing for which they may thank heaven with the same kind of gratitude that he ought to feel who experiences the comforts of being born in a delightful and temperate climate my fellowcountrymen i think are many of them deficient in that airy pleasantness and cheerful temper that distinguishes this quality and as our climate while it answers all the purposes of use and plenty yet seldom affords us blue skies or tempts us to cool grots and purling streams to lie down on the damp grass or to those other rural delights so often mentioned by the poets so the english themselves though overflowing with humanity and benevolence suffer clouds of gloomy thoughts to come over their minds and however they must be allowed to be goodnatured are seldom remarkable for being goodhumoured yet this halfvirtue is worth cultivation as it bestows new charms on that real one good humor is the fairweather of the soul that calms the turbulent gusts of passion and diffuses a perpetual gladness and serenity over the heart and he that finds his temper naturally inclined to break out into sudden bursts of fretfulness and illhumour should be as much upon his guard to repress the storm that is for ever beating in his mind as to fence against the inclemencies of the season we are naturally attached even to animals that betray a softness of disposition we are pleased with the awkward fondness and fidelity of a dog montaigne could discover agreeable music in the goodhumoured purring of his cat and though our modern grooms and jockies bestow all their attention on make color eyes and feet yet the best writers on horsemanship consider a good temper as one of the best qualities in a horse  we should be the more attentive to encourage and preserve this pleasing quality because many people lose it by little and little in the progress of their lives the thoughts of interest frequently proves a growing rust and canker in the mind and the many troubles and embarrassments attending worldly pursuits often sour the temper and entirely destroy the spirit of cheerfulness and good humor that prevailed in the artless and undesigning season of our youth i do not know a more disagreeable companion than a man who having set out in life with vast and vain hopes of advancement together with a mighty consciousness of his own merit has not been able to sustain the shock of disappointment but has permitted his misfortunes to embitter his disposition such a man overflows with gall on every occasion and discharges the spleen that rises within him on all his fellow creatures he disturbs the peace of the family to which he belongs and poisons the happiness of every company to which he is admitted but the disquiet that he brings with him wherever he comes is nothing but an evidence of his own misery and weakness of soul how much more is he to be imitated who meets the strokes of fortune with an even temper who suffers neither reproach nor distress to ruffle his good humor and is as hamlet describes his friend as one in suffering all that suffers nothing life is like a game at backgammon and if an unlucky throw comes we must make the best of it and play on without grumbling at our ill luck but who would venture to sit down to the table with a man who could not bear an adverse cast without turning over the board in a fury and throwing the dicebox at the head of his companion the character of sir thomas more though peculiarly illustrious for unshaken integrity was in no instance more winning and amiable than in true pleasantry and good humor his cheerful behavior on the scaffold and in every particular relative to his death is familiar to all but there is no circumstance in which the evenness of his mind is more truly delineated than in his behavior to his family on his resignation of the chancellorship the way in which he discovered it to his wife bespoke the most genuine good humor when he went out of church it was always usual for some of his officers to go to his lady and acquaint her of his departure but the sunday after his resignation he went himself up to her pew and bowing gravely said  madam my lord is gone she who was accustomed to the facetiousness of his manner did not immediately comprehend his meaning but on his explaining the matter to her as they went home she began to upbraid him for his shameful inattention to his interest upon which without being at all disconcerted by this conjugal lecture he took occasion to turn the discourse by finding fault with some part of her dress  this absolute command of temper and pleasant vein is surely to be envied and he who sees the goods of fortune fall from him not only without shaking his fortitude but also without abating the gaiety of his heart may fairly be said to possess an uncommon share of good humor  surly is a man of an easy fortune humane and benevolent in his nature and as dogberry says honest as the skin between his brows but he has contracted a kind of habitual peevishness and every common occasion of life affords him matter of offense the instant he rises in the morning he is disquieted with the appearance of the weather and pours forth execrations on the climate and when he sits down to breakfast the water is smoaked the butter rank the bread heavy the newspaper dull and insipid and his servant sulky or impertinent yet all the while he has no malice in his mind and means no harm to any creature in the world he has a thousand good qualities which the quickness of his temper converts into petulance and ill humor he is a great lover of wit but cannot bear the least piece of pleasantry on himself and the most innocent jest touches him to the quick he will bestow twenty pounds in an act of charity or do the kindest offices to serve an acquaintance in distress and the next moment quarrel with his friend for disturbing his reflection by humming an operatune thus surly lives much esteemed and little beloved and though every body thinks well of him there are very few that care to cultivate his acquaintance  but if the want of good humor is so conspicuous in a man of how many charms does it deprive one of the other sex softness is their distinguishing characteristick but though like milk they are naturally smooth yet like milk they create particular disgust when they turn sour no female character is more offensive than a shrew and the impolite spirit of the english law has provided very rough treatment for termagants and prepared the severest discipline for the cure of a scold the greatest reproach on an old maid that character so much dreaded and ridiculed in the female world is her ill humor and crossness is the worst part of a prude on the contrary good humor like the cestus encircles the fair one with new beauties and is an antidote to the ravages of age and the smallpox it is the best part of the portion with a virtuous wife and a most amiable feature in the face of a queen  among our own sex there is no race of men more apt to indulge a spirit of acrimony and to remit their natural good humor than authors they come abroad indeed with a consummate selfsatisfaction and delight but the least shock given to their vanity taints the mind and converts all their pleasantry to rancour the flame of emulation often kindles into envy and these mettlesome gentlemen press so furiously onward to the goal of fame that they are sometimes driven to the necessity of jostling one onother in the course for my part i would rather choose to consider myself on a journey than in a race and surely it is better and pleasanter to jog on in an easy trot regardless who is left behind or who is gone before than to whip and spur a jaded genius and in the heat of furious spleen and blind rage to be carried perhaps on the wrong side of the post  good humor is the happiest state of mind for a writer as well as for every other man why should an author suffer every hornet of the press to ruffle his temper or dip his pen in gall and prepare wormwood draughts to sweeten the ill blood of a cotemporary he that causelessly and malignantly traduces another writes a libel on himself as the highwayman who makes an attack upon the road is in fact a greater enemy to himself than to the harmless traveller such a poor wretch we know as well as the rest of the gang will be brought to justice sooner or later but no body cares to have their deaths lie at his own door as for the genius though he ventures to become a censor he will never descend to the office of executioner even the muse of satire should possess her graces and her productions like the sweetbrier should delight and refresh the senses by their fragrance while they are armed for our annoyance if we cannot exercise the instruments of wit we can at least lay by the weapons of offense and ill nature and the candor of the british public will always countenance the faintest efforts to railly the reigning vices and foibles of the age with cheerfulness pleasantry and good humor  the genius number xiii saturday december          corpore in uno frigida pugnabant calidis humentia siccis mollia cum duris sine pondere habentia pondus hanc deus et melior litem nature diremit ovid in the same mass did hot cold moist and dry the soft and hard the light and heavy vie till all these jarring elements at strife nature and heaven composed and called to life  talking the other evening with a friend who is somewhat of a philosophical turn and loves to deal in abstruse speculations he fell by degrees into a whimsical vein and endeavored to amuse himself and me by considering physically not to say metaphisically the probable causes to which the strange diversities of temper and understanding among mankind are owing at one time he supposed that several fortuitous circumstances at our birth might produce this variety and that such an accident as the dilation or compression of the head by the hand of the nurse or the midwife might determine the infants future qualities and mould a hero out of a coward or squeeze a poet or a philosopher into a fool he had also some conceits about the homunculus which however i shall not presume to explain at present as a reverend friend of mine who is deeply versed in those studies has promised to oblige me with a distinct paper on that subject he then considered the notions of planetary influence according to which all the various actions and dispositions of the human species are governed solely by the stars on this occasion he assured me that an eminent astronomer of his acquaintance was very fatal at casting nativities and moreover that the late revolution in the ministry was absolutely foretold last year in partridges almanac he dwelt a little on the supposition of the stubborn race of mortals being formed from the stones thrown as is related by ovid over the heads of deucalion and pyrrha from thence he made a quick transition to that kindred hypothesis which supposes that our frames are kneaded out of clay in pursuance of which he thought it was natural to imagine that the affections of the mind take their tincture from the vessel in which they are enclosed and are impregnated like water with the qualities of the purer or baser earth through which they make their way  with these reflections the bottle and the coversation as is usual among englishmen ended together and i retired to my rest yet i found it impossible to shake off at once the vein of thought which we had been indulging for three or four hours together and sleep itself instead of totally dispossessing my mind of those ideas rather opened and enlarged my imagination to pursue them still further  the gentle reader is seldom averse to accompanying the gentle writer in his slumbers wherefore i shall venture to relate my dream  i was scarce asleep when i fancied myself to be transported on a sudden to the verge of the gulf of chaos where by the transient glimmering of an interrupted light which now and then flashed upon me i saw the four elements lying in confusion on the boundless deep wherein as milton has described it  hot cold moist and dry four champions fierce srive for the mastry and to battle bring their embryon atoms   i was much affected with the horror of my situation and expected every moment to be plunged ten thousand fathom deep into the gulf that lay before me when there emerged from the waves if i may so call them of this elemental ocean a being of a mild and benevolent aspect who after landing on an eminence at some distance beckoned me toward him with a sort of caduceus which he held in his hand and which was formed in the shape of a lizard to signify that he was a friend to mankind my fear had deprived me of all power of motion but the power of his rod drew me insensibly to his side as it were by a charm his person was manly and noble a serene cheerfulness was diffused over his countenance his garment was thrown loosely over him somewhat after the fashion of a heralds coat and on the four quarters of it were delineated the figures of the mole the whale the salamander and the camelion as symbols of the four elements over which as it appeared he presided  my son says he i am the genius of the elements in the vast abyss now before us lie all the future race of mankind as it were in embrio it is the business of certain spirits over which i preside to select from thence the crude materials of which all human beings are composed you i know are curious not only to enquire into the various dispositions of your fellow creatures but to investigate the causes to which their different manners and principles are owing these causes i am now going to declare to you wherefore attend  every mortal is composed of the four elements but not in equal proportions nor each mortal in the same degrees with another on the contrary men are severally more or less agitated with this or that passion or animated with a greater or smaller proportion of genius according to the nature of the particular element that predominates in their frame which prevailing element whether it be earth water air or fire creates the ruling passion and influences every circumstance of their lives  in yonder quarter continued the genius are formed the sons and daughters of earth those mortals i mean who take their existence chiefly from that element these are for the most part of a heavy and inanimate disposition of grovelling souls and dull minds and may be rather said to vegetate than to live a few and very few of the female sex are composed of this element and these are sluttish in their houses slatternly in their persons and churlish to their friends relations and husbands those of the male sex that owe their origin principally to earth are those miserly muckworms who place their sole happiness in amassing vast sums of money those locusts and caterpillars who eat out the substance of others by extortion and usury from this element also are fabricated the race of stupid critics and heavy commentators halfphilosophers entire logicians dry metaphysicians and muddling politicians together with the whole tribe of wretched scribblers whom your countrymen have so properly distinguished by the denomination of grubs the particles of which these mortals are formed weigh down their minds and prevent their soaring to any thing lofty or sublime for the same reason that fathers according to the principle of that famous chancellor lord coke cannot take an estate by inheritance from their sons viz because land or earth being of a heavy nature cannot ascend there are however among mortals of this terrene composition some who possess solid parts and sound understandings and many whose minds are not barren or unfruitful if they labor to improve them by due cultivation  on the banks of that lake said the genius pointing to another quarter are created that part of the human species who draw their life and being from water these are commonly found to be cold and phlegmatic in their disposition men who shelter their native dullness and inactivity under the names of caution and prudence who damp the generous warmth of youth repress the ardour of enterprise and quench the flame of genius women who can cry when they please soaking sots who are far ever moistening their clay till they grow maudlin in their liquor and weep lovers who whine away their days in despair till at last they take the loversleap into their kindred sea or drown like blind puppies in rosamonds pond tragic authors and actors who want fire and draw tears from no eyes but their own all these owe their origin to water among these watery souls there are indeed some few that may be considered as salutiferous springs that are beneficial to their fellow creatures or like noble rivers which are an ornament as well as blessing to the country through which they pass  now said the genius raising his head turn your eyes upward and behold the region from whence they take their being who are composed chiefly of air these are in general of a light and volatile disposition often fed with vain hopes and pleased with empty trifles hence are derived the gay race of beaux and fops who flutter like butterflies about the polite world and in this airy sphere are formed coquettes jilts and those females who are enraptured with romance or eternally dying with the vapors hence descend poets projectors and castlebuilders without number who seem to be perpetually endeavoring to climb up to the region from whence they came and the long train of dependants who seem to have almost learnt to live like the camelion on their native element the air hence come the light troop of essayists pamphleteers sonneteers epigrammatists etc whose productions have their beginning in air and end in fire of this element too are composed some daring souls who take their bold flight like eagles and soar to the noblest heights though never without being followed for a time with a multitude of crows choughs and ravens who pursue them with hoarse and dissonant cawings and disturb earth and heaven with their clamor  lastly continued the genius behold the bright district where those mortals are formed who are composed principally of fire these are for the most part of a warm and passionate nature amongst whom the virtues and vices are to be found in their extremes here too you may find men of hot heads and ladies of warm constitutions hence comes the termagant who is all rage and fury and the hero who is all glory and gunpowder hence also comes the spirited race of bucks bloods libertines and freethinkers hence too are derived many of those glorious and sublime sages heroes princes poets and philosophers whose genius throws a luster all around them and who seem to be placed like beacons amidst the human species to hold forth lights to the rest of the world  happy said the genius is he who has learnt to temper the irregularities of his frame so as to prevent the evil effects of the element that prevails in his composition happier still is that man in whom the elements are mixed in the nearest proportion to each other  at these words whether from sudden noise sufficient rest a desire to reply or from what other cause i know not  i awoke  the genius number xiv thursday december         vester camaenae vester in arduos tollor

springs my fancy lead  bath and tunbridge and cheltenham and scarborough and the other watering places of this kingdom although many miles distant from the metropolis and some of them scarce to be brought within the compass of a days journey even in this age of expedition when the flying wagon is no extraordinary phaenomenom may yet be justly considered as places of public diversion belonging to the town the rooms in no wise resemble other country assemblies where the squire commands respect and derives additional authority from being in the commission of the peace and the balls are quite in a different style from a dance at the assizes where the aldermens wives and daughters set off with the newest patterns from london are admitted to drop a curtsy to the ladies of the representatives for the town or country or perhaps even to the lady lieutenant on the contrary the company of these places make up the same fantastical medley nay consists of the very same persons as occasionally compose the groupe in the places of entertainment in and about london and while we are sure to encounter the wellknown faces that haunt every house and garden whose doors are thrown open to receive them notwithstanding the real distance we can scarce suppose ourselves beyond the limits of the bills of mortality any more than we are apt to fancy ourselves out of town when we have just got off the stones toward vauxhall or ranelagh  in this light at least i was tempted to consider this matter in a late trip to bath  with this only difference in town the company is brought together for a few hours only and though some may have repaired thither on foot some in equipages decorated with bloody hands and coronets and others in coaches distinguished by square plates of painted tin yet on their separation who can tell what becomes of his late associates any more than where they came from at bath and the like places each person may be said not only to exhibit himself for a time but even to live in public he resides in a house of glass and all his words actions pleasures and attachments are known to the whole circle of the little world he inhabits neither my lord nor my lady who disdain to sin in private nor the petty trespasser who loves to be snug in his offenses are exempt from observation almost every body descants on the characters of others and almost every body exposes his own it is a kind of general hob or nob or give and take as shakespeare explains the phrase between all the good company the old the young the rich the poor the sick the well english french germans swiss and italians all live here together as it were in one family and with as little emotion of mutual concern or regard as those who are really of one family commonly have for each other  bath no more owes its entire support to mere invalids than the universities are filled with real students or than the temple coffee houses are totally maintained by lawyers that have business or childs and batsons by physicians that have practice if every saunterer in the pumproom was to be strictly interrogated concerning the motive of his coming thither or the manner of his passing his time there dissipation play and intrigue would appear to have drawn after them a larger retinue than the gout or the cholick a person who is fond of taking an estimate of manners and principles might find here much matter of speculation for my own part being too poor to game too well to drink the waters too dull or too brisk too wise or too foolish too insensible or too what you will to fall in love i remained an idle spectator of the busy scene before me and like a dull geographer without pretending to account for the nature of the soil or to discover the several springs and mines that lay underneath i contented myself with taking a cursory survey of the place and drawing out a map from what appeared on the face of the country  it affords abundant matter of congratulation to this kingdom that notorious games of hazard such as the e o tables and the like are at length banished from these places as well as from the masquerade and ridotto there are still it is true to be found several hungry cormorants eager to feed on the ignorant or unwary and studious to make use of the opportunities arising from the promiscuous mixture of the cheat and the dupe the gentleman and the sharper they however who are weak enough to fall a prey to these sharks of society are the less to be pitied as they seem to devote themselves to destruction with their eyes open the characters of these vagrant gamblers are generally notorious he therefore who ventures his hundreds against the last stake of a fellow whom he would not admit into his house or speak to but across the cardtable surely suffers himself to be robbed while he feels the hand of the cutpurse in his pocket and has no more right to complain of ill treatment than if he had descended to play with linkboys and pick pockets in a night cellar  far be it from me to endeavor with rude hand to force open the cabinet of love or to unlock the secrets of the temple of cupid love however determined on secrecy is apt to break out and betray itself unawares to make itself known by a thousand little inadvertencies and absurdities in our conduct the involuntrary emotions of tenderness rather therefore would i admonish these sweet triflers in the supposed words of cassio to desdemona  let us be wary let us bide our loves in order to which let them abstain from billing and cooing in public from rolling of eyes and squeezing of hands and joining of knees under the table idleness and curiosity are ever on the watch and scandal like virgils fame has as many eyes as tongues it is a maxim at bath and all other public places that when a young couple have been partners at a ball for two nights together every other point is settled between them whereon the banns of marriage are published in the rooms long before the time for their declaration any where else making love may be and no doubt is a very engaging entertainment to the parties concerned but there is no scene of courtship which does not appear exttemely ridiculous in the eyes of an indifferent spectator  but if the sparks of honorable love are in these common haunts of men to be thus cautiously repressed from bursting into a blaze what shall we say to the unwarrantable ebullitions of the spirit of intrigue if a fine lady just broke loose from her husband or a warm widow lately relieved from the yoke of matrimony have a mind to give their passions full play why need they advertise their intentions to the whole world or if a sprightly young fellow has subdued some frail piece of female virtue is it not cruel to make his conquest public in a word why should both parties prefer an open scorn of virtue and decorum to the concealment of their vices it would be too rigid and unreasonable to debar persons of spirit entirely from their pleasures i would only advise them to be temperate and discreet in the use of them the cuckoldly husband might put his horns quietly into his pocket if he was not industriously pointed out for a monster and the world might wink hard at female frailties if they did not provoke attention and peremptorily challenge observation open gallantries are sure to become the subject of towntalk and the rumor of bath and tunbridge intrigues is as quickly calculated through the best company as a box on the ear indiscreetly dealt at ranelagh  there is no part of these mixed assemblies which i am apt to consider with more compassion than those unfortunate young females whose wise relations are fond of carrying them to and fro from one public place to another by way of introducing them early to the knowledge of the world or as the means of getting them a husband there is indeed no situation where a decent and amiable behavior in a young lady would be more conspicuous but those who have been formed on the abovementioned system of education have commonly lost all their domestic graces without having acquired any allurements in exchange for them they know the rules and customs of public places without being in the least acquainted with the manners of the world which are not to be collected in a giddy life of perpetual dissipation or learnt with the graces of a minuet and the figure of a country dance or picked up by chance at the lottery table as a proof of which it seldom happens that these female pupils of flirtation contract an advantageous match though they often fall a prey to the professed rake or libertine or if that is not the case they are hawked about from place to place till the bloom is off the plum when to pursue the allusion many nauseate the fruit so soon is grown dead and stale in the market which perhaps they would have gathered with pleasure if it had been left to hang its due time upon the tree  if there are any characters of this motley drama that move our mirthful indignation more powerfully than all the others it is the swarm of humble retainers to the great that are for ever buzzing in the ear of nobility the easy intercourse between persons of different ranks which this place affords is particularly grateful to these spunges as hamlet terms them who delight to soak up the countenances of people of fashion this numerous tribe is made up of both sexes and happy is he or she who can be occasionally called in to fill up a vacant corner in her graces party at quadrille and how woeful is the mortification if they should fail to edge themselves into his lordships teadrinking such selfmade dependants who are engendered by the smiles of the great like flies or maggots out of carrion by the rays of the sun have no idea of any distinction between persons except that which title bestows on them they seem indeed to suppose themselves noble and genteel by reflection though they sink in the estimation of others in proportion as they rise in their own they are considereed in general as runners to the great that fetch and carry come and go as they are bid though they flatter themselves that they mix in the polite world they live but in the suburbs and outskirts of gentility they are in truth but a mean appendage to the great a higher but yet more infamous degree of pages and lacquies to hold up the tail of nobility or rather a contemptible part of the train itself a narrow edging or border a kind of beggars tape that binds the hem of quality  the late and evermemorable richard nash esquire whose name is almost as much revered at bath as that of the great bladud himself for some few years before his death published proposals for printing by subscription the history of bath and tunbridge many who subscribed largely to this work contrary to the case of all other subscriptions would have been much disappointed and offended if it had ever made its appearance so that the price of subscription might be considered as hushmoney to keep the intrigues and gallantries of the nobility in silence the original papers containing many curious anecdotes are fallen into my hands and unless the dukes and dutchesses peers and peeresses in general and others the gentry of this realm will subscribe their five guineas to me the genius as nobly as they did to the first author the work shall certainly come out in the mean time the manuscripts are lodged in the hands of an eminent counsel as it is said was the case with some of popes epistles and satires that we may be enabled to go just upon the edge of libel and scandalum magnatum those who would not have their adventures and amors recorded in this secret history may take the gentle hint i now give them and send in their subscriptions to the printer of this paper in the mean time i would recommend it to messrs wiltshire and simson at bath as well as to the proprietors of the pumproom and masters of the coffeehouses to hang the rooms with the st jamess chronicle  the genius number xv saturday january         ubi quid datur oti illudo chartis  hor when i have nothing else to do i play at whist quadrille or lu  on my return home a few evenings ago i found lying on my table a soiled knave of diamonds bearing evident marks of having served in several campaigns which i found on examination to come from my old acquaintance mrs marrcourt and to contain an invitation written in her own old english black letter to a private party at cards on monday the fourth of january  mrs marrcourt is the widow of a gentleman who had a place in the household and at her husbands death obtained by the interest and solicitation of some powerful friends an annual pension of a hundred and fifty pounds having had as she often says herself a very genteel education and always lived in a polite sphere she entertains the most profound respect for all persons of fashion as well as an implicit veneration for all the manners appurtenances and dependences of quality wherefore notwithstanding the narrowness of her income she never could endure the thoughts of being exiled from the great world but has been reduced to several shifts to maintain the appearance of a tolerable footing in it being now grown aged and infirm she cannot well crawl through the park in fair weather or along the best paved streets to pay her morning visits she is however in possession of the cast sedan of a countess of her acquaintance by whom she was honored with it as a present seven years ago but being unable to pay her chairmen the usual rates for weekly attendance she drives a hard bargain and retains them at an under price whence it often happens that her two chairmen are not only in liveries of two different colors but she is obliged to be carried by all the rawboned unpractised fellows who jumble along in a rough trot as uneasy as a stagecoach over the stones and no sooner have they learnt to pace along in the true human amble and become capable of better business than they desert the good old lady and their places are supplied by a fresh pair of hackney novices so that she has the breakingin of most of the twolegged colts in town she has apartments in one of the old palaces gratis and during the summermonths because she would not for the world be so ungenteel as to stay in london she takes a twopenny lodging at greenwich or richmond she constantly visits at several great houses and though often shut out by perseverance and the utmost goodbreeding she is sometimes let in and perhaps if there is no particular company asked to stay dinner the ladies treat her with a haughty familiarity and style her plain marrcourt and the facetious men of fashion make mock love to her compliment her in the strain of wellbred raillery on her person beauty taste and other qualifications freely indulging themselves in all those liberties which young fellows conscious and vain of their rank are apt to take with their inferiors  yet even from this kind of connection with people of distinction does mrs marrcourt derive no small degree of consequence she remembers the day she bought her last pound of tea by recollecting it was the same on which she dined at his lordships she talks familiarly of lady harriot and lady mary and is reckoned by all the lower gentry of her acquaintance to be a mighty genteel sort of body and to keep none but the very best of company  i waited on mrs marrcourt on the evening appointed but perceived immediately on my entrance into her apartments that although she had given her assembly the modest appellation of a private party she had in fact collected all the company she was able with a particular view to bring together some persons of rank and dignity her two rooms the largest of which is scarce bigger than a cabin and the least a mere closet were so crowded that it was with the utmost difficulty that i could squeeze my little person sideways between the backs of the chairs belonging to the several card tables in order to make my way from one end of the place to the other the tables were many of them placed diagonally by which means she had been able to edge in one or two extraordinary and most of the company who were not put down to cards stood in a huddle by the fireside and the remaining few had disposed themselves in the seats of the windows the room was lighted up with the ends of waxcandles bought of the duke of  s butler and the company regaled with a small liquor made by mrs marrcourt herself in the present scarcity of lemons of the best cream otartar the company itself was as miscellaneous as a pack of cards or any hand that can be formed from different combinations of them but the most distinguished members of it and to which i observed mrs marrcourt paid particular attention were an old irish peer of a disputed title a creolian colonel a distressed baronet a city knight and his lady a french gentlewoman from the neighborhood of soho an old general officer on halfpay and a yellow admiral  such is the faithful picture of the good old ladys assembly and without pretending to more than ordinary penetration we may venture to pronounce that there are many mrs marrcourts in this great metropolis nor is it any matter of surprise for if ladies of distinction will delight to throw open their great gates and court the whole tide of nobility to flow in upon them there will ever exist these minor dames of secondhand gentry fond of aping the vices and follies of their superiors but though the imitation of bad things like the corruption of the best renders them most odious and contemptible it may not be amiss to carry our reflections still further and to consider the nature of the politest of these assemblies set off with every circumstance of elegance and splendour  these genteel meetings like miltons pandaemonium frequent and full are in the dialect of the fashionable world denominated routs the signification of which word according to dictionaries of the best authority is as follows johnson defines a rout to be a clamorous multitude a rabble a tumultuous crowd and giles jacob in his law dictionary declares the word rout to signify an assembly of persons gathered together and going to execute or indeed executing an unlawful act if we examine the thing itself as it appears in high life we shall be convinced of the propriety of the term and cannot but allow that all these routs from that of a duchess down to mrs marrcourts come within the meaning of both these descriptions for what is a rout but a tumultuous crowd a rabble that is a genteel mob or the rabble of quality drawn together as jacob says and going to execute or indeed executing an unlawful act  but the prevailing idea is undoubtedly the crowd and the lady who is mistress of the rout is happy in proportion to the numbers she has been able to assemble if the public way is interrupted for three streets together and the company can scarce get to and fro between the house and their coaches and chairs if the boxes at the play or the opera are robbed of their company because those who are left uninvited are ashamed to betray the contempt or neglect they are doomed to sustain if in the most spacious apartments in london the company are crowded together as close as at mrs marrcourts or as the poor prisoners in the blackhole at calcutta the triumph is more ample and complete i remember a duchess and a countess who for a time entertained the most mortal aversion for each other from having both appointed their routs on the same day of the week the whole town at least the polite part of it was divided into parties and ranking themselves as under a banner beneath the colors of the cards were severally called the reds and the blacks the parties being equally powerful and the routs of each being of course rendered less numerous who can say to what extremities matters might have been carried if a man of fashion who like a blank card had yet received no impression either from red or black had not fortunately compromised the affair and prevailed on the ladies to be content with taking the day alternately each holding a rout only once in a fortnight  it is remarkable that this rage for a crowd has produced a most extraordinary revolution in dress a friend of mine has composed a most elaborate treatise in the manner of montesquieu on the causes of the rise and fall of the hooppetticoat in the learned section on the subject of routs which is as curious as any chapter in tristram shandy the author has plainly demonstrated that these assemblies have produced a total revolution in architecture and dress every house is built as if it was intended to receive the whole town and every lady is dressed as if she was going into apartments where she would not have room to turn herself round the hoop which had stood the shocks of ridicule for forty years together which dilated itself wider and wider on every new attack which incumbered whole apartments spread itself all over the mall eclipsed beaux and overshadowed sideboxes shrunk in an instant like a flower shut up at sunset or a closed umbrella no hoops became the common nota been to all cards of invitation and the ladies came abroad suddenly freed of all their tumors and encumbrances like a new mother just delivered of her burden or like the fallen angels in milton as on a signal given  to smallest forms reduced their shapes immense and were at large though without number still   it may almost be asserted without a quibble that the system of life now established in the polite world seems calculated to destroy society for the sake of company a ladys journal is a mere calendar of visits and routs visits often paid by the footmen with a slip of card and a flambeau and routs where instead of a few select friends she meets with a crowd of half acquaintance and strangers routs are the modern schools of education for the female sex and as cards seem to be destined for their sole amusement and employment i would advise my good friend mr newberry the annual publisher of the ladies memorandum book to dispose his next into the popular form of a pack of cards the two and fifty cards of which the pack consists naturally adapting themselves to the use of the two and fifty weeks into which the year is distributed the several sundays might be distinguished as the first second third or fourth sundays of the duchess of as the countess of bs lady van ds or mrs es rout and the little spaces allotted for appointments might be filled with secret assignations if it be true as the chronicle of scandal relates that such assignations are sometimes made at these assemblies  i have been the more earnest to throw together my reflections on this subject at present because the female passion for routs grows every day more and more predominant and i am credibly informed that the contagion has actually spread even to our colonies and been carried by our countrywomen into other parts of the world general assemblies of no parliamentary nature i am told are frequently held in new england the clerks of our east india company and their wives have it is said been known to lose a lack of rupees at a sitting at bengal and i am confidently assured that a lady of quality on her travels has so far broke in upon the simplicity of the cantons as to have absolutely established an evening assembly for halfpenny lu in switzerland  in order therefore to prevent the further evil consequences resulting from these private public gaminghouses and at the same time not entirely to deprive persons of distinction of their favorite amusement and yet to render it of some small utility and advantage i would humbly submit to the attention of the legislature the following plan of a routact no lady of whatsoever rank should be allowed to hold in one night more than three cardtables for whist cribbage or quadrille which with a fourth for the use of the more promiscuous games such as lansquenet lu lottery etc may fairly be supposed to comprehend all the persons that can meet at once for the sake of society but for the entertainment of those who delight in larger assemblies two public routs should be instituted with authority to open their doors every night like the theaters one to be held for the use of the court end of the town at carlisle house soho square and the other for the ladies of the merchants aldermen and common council men at haberdashershall in the city the cardmoney as well as the sums subscribed for admission instead of being lavished on butlers valets and maitres dhotel should be laid apart in order to create a fund for the support of decayed gamesters whose necessities might be supplied by their successors at the gamingtable as the stage now and then gives a benefit for distressed and superannuated actors by these means a lord who has exhausted his fortune by deep play need not degrade himself by application for a pension and a merchant who has by the like conduct involved himself and family in the miseries of bankruptcy need not do the world and his creditors a further injury by going into business again  end of the genius originally published in the st jamess chronicle the gentleman originally published in the london packet

pen not as the sword of public justice or defense but using it as the instrument of ruffian violence and private rancour in political discussions indeed freedom of sentiment and speech should be almost boundless and a great and enterprising genius best able to go all lengths might perhaps with great propriety try how far the liberty of the press could legally be carried but in writings of a private nature that doctrine becomes shameful and scandalous and the practice almost diabolical he who exercises the liberty of the press with no farther idea of restraint than what the law imposes may escape a partial prosecution but will incur universal contempt for the rogue within the law as any attorney can testify is the most dangerous and despicable of all rogues in a moral as well as a civil sense every mans house should in some measure be his castle and the miscreant who wantonly disturbs the repose or breaks into the harmless secrets of a private family commits a kind of literary burglary and is almost as culpable as the minister or kings messenger who should now attempt the seizure of papers or dare to enter a mansion by a general warrant the english are a remarkably goodnatured as well as generous people but were a stranger to form a character of them from a perusal of their daily publications they would appear to require a constant evening sacrifice to their ill nature and a hecatomb of reputations for their breakfast  seeing the color of many other publications and those alas too generally popular i mean occasionally to hazard an essay in this paper of a complexion totally different and now and then to rescue at least one column in one newspaper from scandal and politics the recess of parliament when the minds of men are less heated by contention is a proper season to commence such an undertaking for my own part i am at present writing inclined to trust the interests of my country on both sides of the atlantic to the three great branches of the legislature but if i find them inadequate or unfaithful i shall be happy with other authors to embody like the constitutional militia in times of danger and to change the gentleman into the politician as steel converted the guardian into the englishman even quakers perhaps might on such an occasion suspend the pacifick tenets of their persuasion and even some of our clergy would in such circumstances exhibit a new idea of church militant change their gowns for coats of mail and like a boiled lobster turn from black to red  it is however at present my wish and my intention to suffer my patriotick powers of writing to sleep like the sword in the scabbard every gentleman chooses to wear one both for ornament and defense but when he puts it on says to himself with mercutio heaven send me no need of thee i will not like the courtfool of old times run a muck against the king and his nobles i will not draw my wit upon the minister much less as i have already professed will i wound the bosom of domestic tranquillity i send these fugitive papers smiling into the world wishing them like swedes tea to sweaten the blood and juices of my countrymen and to correct their ill humors but though intended for an antidote to black bile and acrimony it is hoped they will not appear like magnesia a cure for the heartburn indeed but in themselves a drug tasteless and insipid the rose and sweetbriar are not the less fragrant for the thorn that makes a part of them and the powers of satire and ridicule while pointed at general vices and enormities are not only innocent but salutary bungling quacks cannot attack the disease without injuring or perhaps killing the patient but the true moralist sees the drama of society performed before him like the skilful naturalist contemplating bees through a glass hive marking their operations and turning them to account without offering the busy insects the least injury the present age swarms with follies and teems with characters worthy of observation such will be frequently exhibited but as they are intended like those of the new comedy of menander to be general it is hoped that none of them will be challenged by any individual  the motto prefixed to this indroductory essay may perhaps be thought arrogant but it is only meant to imply such subjects as are fit for discussion on a plan of this liberal nature and such a character as the writer would wish to exhibit in the person of the gentleman not that he presumes to hint that he shall himself be found equal to it he means to derive his chief importance from the merits of others as to himself whether really a gentleman or the meanest plebeian a student at his ease or a scribbler in the fleet sitting by a silver standish in his own apartment or with a broken inkbottle in a garret or cellar are matters of no importance to the reader so long as the author shall sustain the part he has assumed though appearing in a public character he means to be nameless and unknown he has drawn up the curtain like other managers without admittance behind the scenes an indulgence which might gratify the curiosity of a few but tends to destroy the public entertainment in his bills the director can at present announce no more than the gentleman to which the wags if they please may subjoin being the first time of his appearing in that character i must beg leave however once for all to declare that with whatever notice they may honor me to their wit or their dullness i shall never make any reply not from the spirit of silent contempt but rather on the principle of fielding who when he was told in the green room that the audience were damning his comedy acquiesced in the badness of it and cried what have they found it out  it has heen suggested to me that it would be more consonant to the character of a gentleman to send forth my speculations like some of my predecessors uncontaminated by paragraphs and advertisements beautifully printed on a sheet and half of fine writing paper but many of my superiors several excellent essayists moral and political have written in newspapers as to that in which the gentleman has chosen to insert his productions he has distinguished it on a principle of public spirit having observed it for some time past to have been the deadest dullest most unentertaining and insipid of the many journals and chronicles which the press groans under at present a circumstance the more extraordinary as it is he is informed the property of a junto of the sprightliest wittiest politest and most learned spirits of the age capable of instructing and enlivening it with every species of composition from history down to a pun or an epigram the very printer mr william woodfall if fame say true is able like the silkworm to weave his own rich materials and after the example of the stevenss and elzevirs to be himself the editor of any productions that might issue from his press to stimulate therefore these capable but indolent geniusses to rouse them from their lethargy to set all hands to work on board the london packet is the design and ambition of the gentleman happy if like falstaff he should at any time be found to be witty himself but content if he can at least like falstaff be the cause of wit in other men  the gentleman number ii wednesday july         alterius sic altera poscit opem res and conjurat amice hor allied as sister close to brother one thing still asks the help of the other and thus allied both he or she from love or interest will agree  it is usual with those who exhibit their performances to the public to follow up their first effort with an account of the great and uncommon applause that has been bestowed on it as i have always imagined such accounts to be religiously true i cannot help considering myself as deplorably unpopular or peculiarly unfortunate i have not heard a syllable uttered in favor of the first number of the gentleman and almost all the readers i expected to interest or engage have been occupied with the sessions paper or the london gazette i have not seen a single copy of verses in praise of my style and i have even been assured by my friends that the people of this country will not at present read any article in a newspaper longer than a paragraph i have however been honored with the notice of two correspondents and as they seem inclined on certain conditions to become assistants in my present undertaking i shall introduce them to my readers by making their letters public before i proceed in my own speculations  to the author of the gentleman sir i have the honor to be a blackguard and if it had not been for a few touches in your paper that showed you to be no enemy to vulgar manners as well as no mean proficient in the vulgar tongue i should have beheld your essays with silent contempt and would not have condescended to correspond with you but is this a time sir for a writer who means to amend the morals or correct the behavior of the idle things and puppies of the present age to usher a work into the world under the title of the gentleman do not false refinements affected politeness and in a word gentility as they term it threaten to undermine our morals pervert our good sense and infect our behavior formerly it was the boast of this country that every man might in things indifferent vary from his neighbor private liberty was as essential a mark of our manners as public liberty was the characteristick of our constitution no principles of politeness no system of behavior no rules for raising a french or italian superstructure on a gothic foundation but every man built his reputation on the basis of good sense and good nature at present we begin to refine and file and polish till our manners as stern said of those of our neighbors are growing as smooth and undistinguishable as an old king williams halfpenny and fashionable principles like the legs of fashionable furniture have scarce strength enough to support the frame that belongs to them  gentility sir give me leave to repeat and insist on it is the great bane of our lives the nurse of vice dissipation and extravagance the parent of bankruptcy and source of corruption foreign manners will not thrive under our meridian there is a kind of magna charta in our good fellowship as well as in our laws that will not brook the control of an honesthearty laugh or endure to be fettered by dissertations on left legs  in opposition to the contemptible animal the newfangled being that now commonly distinguishes itself by the appellation of the gentleman i am proud to style myself a blackguard a name sir that would do you more credit both as a writer and a man than the title you have assumed humor that genuine english production is not the growth of a frippery age nor founded on polished manners it can only be cultivated by bold manly wits such as cervantes rabelais moliere swift gay arbuthnot fielding stern etc etc these and such as these are the classicks of the school of blackguard in that school i have been bred and have learnt to despise a delicacy of manners that produces effeminacy and a nicety of taste that proves the weakness of the stomach if these are models you disapprove i here take my leave of you but if english virtue english sense and english humor are meant to be recommended and encouraged by the author of the gentleman he shall now and then if he pleases hear farther from one who is proud to own himself a friend to those qualities and to subscribe himself  a blackguard   according to my correspondents definition my idea of a gentleman and his idea of a blackguard constitute pretty nearly the same character i think indeed he bears rather hard upon the fine gentleman of our age and handles him with more roughness than so tender an animal provokes yet it must be confessed that the writers rusticity becomes him and as addison says of virgil in his georgicks that he tosses about his dung with an air of gracefulness i cannot therefore dismiss his epistle without assuring him that i wish for a continuance of his correspondence as well as that of the lady who has favored me with the following letter  to the gentleman sir does your total silence concerning the female world in your first number proceed from contempt of the sex do you think with mahomet that women are void of souls to be made happy in the next world or with a late lord that they are incapable of reason and common sense in the present during the female reigns of anne and elizabeth such doctrines would have been considered as moral and political heresies no less than religious and they deserve i think as little encouragement in our times when we see a queen consort on the throne at least equally amiable and perhaps as wise in declining politics as the illustrious regents abovementioned were glorious in administering them  familiar essays sir have hitherto been peculiarly devoted to the service of the ladies steel and addison stepped forth like literary knightserrant to rescue the fair from the demons of vice and spells of ignorance endeavoring to render the toilet the altar of the muses as well as the place of sacrifice to the graces they thought the manners and principles of women not unimportant to the happiness of men and did not esteem it a disgrace to their parts or learning to write down to the understandings of female readers essays in general are indeed a kind of whiptsillabub literature not above the pitch of a mere housewifely comprehension and as becoming a part of the parlourwindow furniture as a tambour or a thread paper  i do not mean sir by what i have said to accuse you of an elevation of style and manner that throws us at a distance but rather to hint to you that a seeming neglect of the ladies is not consistent with a writer who styles himself a gentleman are you afraid that the distinguished propriety elegance and decent modesty of the females of the present age will afford you no room for animadversion or do you think them totally incorrigible for my part sir i believe them to be formed of the very same materials as their mothers were before them equally prone to err and equally capable of amendment and instruction  female virtues are certainly of consequence to the order of the moral world and foibles ought not to be suffered to spring up neglected and to overrun the mind like thorns and idle weeds yet their delicacy is not to be wounded their follies must be tenderly probed and the essayist like the surgeon should have the hand of a lady shakespeares characters of women like the portraits of women by the president of our royal academy are almost the only good ones drawn by men there is a coarseness of outline color and design in most other artists that make their ladies appear not in the simple style of caelia rosalind imogen desdemona etc but rather like men dressed in womens clothes on these considerations therefore while you sir are engaged in painting the men the females shall if you please sit to me or if you will suppose yourself alone equal to finishing the main parts of the figure you will at least allow that a female hand is most likely to be correct in the drapery  you will i doubt not be extremely curious to be informed from whom this letter proceeds and vanity may perhaps incline you to suppose that it is occasioned by some partiality to you or your writings your person sir i do not know nor at present desire to know any more than i mean to discover my own whether i shall ever unveil myself must appear hereafter in the mean time let your imagination draw as flattering a likeness of me as gentlemenquixotes picture to themselves of their several dulcineas fancy me as young handsome rich and agreeably accomplished as your complexion avarice or vanity may require and it is no matter how old ugly poor and disagreeable i may really be while i remain your assistant and humble servant  incognita   till the lady becomes acquainted with my name character and qualifications she is desired to take it for granted that i am very tall very well made exactly of the complexion she likes best and just in my prime in the mean time i most thankfully accept her kind offer and do not doubt but it will be agreeable to my fair readers the ladies have indeed betrayed some partiality for male hairdressers staymakers mantuamakers and even menmidwives yet i think they will unbosom their failings more freely to one of their own sex and any lady laboring with spleen malice envy ambition avarice or secret disorders of the mind will be glad to be laid by a woman especially as an able and experienced practitioner meaning myself will always attend ready to assist in any very nice case or an accident  the gentleman number iii wednesday july         obscurata diu populo bonus eruet atque proferet in lucem speciosa vocabula rerum quae priscis memorata catonibus

pour the full tide of eloquence along serenely pure and yet divinely strong rich with the treasures of each foreign tongue pope     learning like beaten gold in proportion to its being more extended becomes more superficial gross ignorance and profound erudition are now equally uncommon literature no longer confined to colleges and cloisters mixes itself in some measure with the commerce of the exchange the exercises of the camp and the graces of the court but the deepread scholar is a rarer character than ever the main stream of science branching into numberless rivulets grows shallow as well as clear the stores of learning are parcelled out by retail and what was sarcastically said of the reputed knowledge of our northern neighbors is nearly applicable to that of the whole island every man has a mouthfull but no man has a bellyfull  this observation on the state of learning in general is almost equally true in respect to the lesser graces of style and composition that happy mediocrity denied by gods and men to the writers of former ages has been reserved for our own period few writers are barbarous and ungrammatical or even unmusical in their language but very few are truly simple nervous or elegant some styles like handsome faces are spoilt by affectation or ruined by varnish and extrinsick ornament some are bloated with false pomp some darkened by metaphysical abstract phraseology and some enervated by dapper familiarities and the cant jargon of drawingrooms horsecourses and gamingtables  purity of style like purity of manners is not wholly practicable languages like men by whom they are framed will be imperfect yet every endeavor to trace the sources of corruption tends to stop its progress living authors as well as living manners are at once the chief objects of our censure and imitation the works of deceased writers which we have been taught by tradition to applaud are too seldom turned over while the productions of our cotemporaries present themselves to our notice oftener than their persons he who has talents to distinguish himself from the crowd has more followers than an ancient philosopher a popular writer sets the fashion of style and the very herd of critics that wish to depreciate the value of his works run after him if an author arises whose deep learning and large imagination struggling for expression equal to his conceptions tempt him to lengthen his periods and swell his phraseology if an intimate familiarity with the combinations of a dead language now and then betray him into too wide a deviation from the vernacular idiom such a writer will have the mortification to see the beauties of his style distorted by awkward imitation and his errors if in him they are errors made ridiculous by aggravation the language that in his master hand like a welltuned instrument discourses most eloquent music under their management utters nothing but discord the rattling of their periods and tumidity of their phrases like the noise of a drum or swell of a bladder are but symptoms of their wind and emptiness  ornament of diction says quintilian though the greatest of beauties is only graceful when it follows as it were of itself not when it is pursued of all ornaments a foreign structure of period as it is the most prejudicial to the genius of our language appears the most studied and unnatural an adopted word is but a partial and trifling innovation and is often happily incorporated when care is taken to naturalize the foreigner by giving a national air to the turn of the phrase every language more especially the english has its idioms which we should not register with grammarians and lexicographers among its irregularities but with poets and orators number among its beauties to extirpate idiom from our tongue would be like rooting up the old oaks that are the glory and ornament of our country or to vary the allusion to square the language of our ancient writers to the rigid rules of roman or even french syntax would extinguish the genius of our tongue and give the whole a foreign air like the labors of a tasteless improver exchanging the luxuriance of nature in our gardens for clipped yews strait walks and formal parterres  perspicuity without meanness is pronounced by aristotle to be the perfection of language or as he more nervously expresses it the virtue of style to attain which he recommends as a principal instrument the use of the most common words and phrases in a figurative signification the familiarity of the terms rendering them clear and the novelty of their application giving them an air of elegance or dignity the works of our old writers prosaick as well as poetical abound with these homespun metaphors by which the lowest words increase their consequence or at least like ciphers raise the value of their neighbors sometimes indeed these popular tropes are carried to excess or used too licentiously yet they commonly breathe a magnificent simplicity and the whole construction is purely english a circumstance like that which induced cicero to recommend the study of the ancient roman authors to his pupils in oratory urging that whoever was well read in their productions could not were he even inclined to it speak other than genuine latin  it will not i hope be imagined from what i have said that i think too lightly of the labors and genius of those learned philologists who by compiling grammars and dictionaries have endeavored to give precision and stability to our tongue their works if properly consulted are useful both to the learner and proficient but if made the objects of their study rather than occasional assistants they will certainly be pernicious the grammars of living and dead languages are too often framed on different principles in the latter all irregularities for which an authority can be pleaded are sanctified by a rule while the other brands every idiom or bold combination as a licentious barbarism no man ever learnt a language living or dead from a grammar or dictionary but by reading the best authors and partaking of the best conversation he who habituates himself to such studies and such society without proposing to himself a particular model will insensibly form a style of his own as in the mechanical part of writing every man abandoning himself to his own fancy or powers almost every man writes a different hand a certain freedom of style a manly flow of language will distinguish the authors of such a school whose periods will not be divided into formal compartments like the squares of a mosaic pavement exactly answering each other but the members of a sentence like the members of the human body will seem to be put together with ease as well as symmetry and equally framed for the purposes of elegance and strength  as to grammars and dictionaries though not administering to the foundation of our tongue they may certainly be of great use to contribute to its preservation they are a kind of scaffold erected by skilful workmen after our language has been completely built to repair the ruins of time and to keep the venerable structure from further decay the last great english dictionary will remain as long as the english tongue shall remain a monument of the learning and genius of its author and i cannot better enforce the utility of the studies recommended in this paper than by concluding it with an extract from the admirable preface to that work a preface which at once delivers the precepts and affords the example of a pure and eloquent style   i have studiously endeavored to collect examples and authorities from the writers before the restoration whose works i regard as the wells of english undefiled as the pure sources of genuine diction our language for almost a century has by the concurrence of many causes been gradually departing from its original teutonick character and deviating toward a gallick structure and phraseology from which it ought to be our endeavor to recall it by making our ancient volumes the groundwork of style admitting among the additions of later times only such as may supply real deficiencies such as are readily adopted by the genius of our tongue and incorporate easily with our native idioms   from the authors which rose in the time of elizabeth a speech might be formed adequate to all the purposes of use and elegance if the language of theology were extracted from hooker and the translation of the bible the terms of natural knowledge from bacon the phrases of policy war and navigation from raleigh the dialect of poetry and fiction from spenser and sidney and the diction of common life from shakespeare few ideas would be lost to mankind for want of english words in which they might be expressed  the gentleman number iv monday august        age vero ne semper forum subsellia rostra curiamque mediatere quid esse potest in otio aut jucundius aut magis proprium humanitatis quam sermo facetus ac nulla in re dutis hoc enim uno praestamus vel maxim feris quod colliquimur inter nos and quod exprimere dicendo sensa passumus cicero well then not to dwell on the bar the bench the pulpit or the parliament what can in our hours of relaxation be more agreeable or better suited to our nature than cheerful and elegant conversation for in this consists our chief preeminence over the brute creation that we can converse with each other and communicate our sentiments by speech to the author of the gentleman ecce iterum the blackguard again your last paper has roused me and while you are learnedly commenting on the style of writing give me leave sir to throw in a word or two on a matter of more immediate consequence to the comfort and happiness of life  the style of conversation i dont mean the rounding of sentences or saying pretty things prettily or fine things finely or backing your horses like mrs flourigig in the midst of a speech for the sake of turning the corner of a period but the downright communication of our thoughts to each other the life and soul of all social intercourse the first purpose of meeting and company and the great distinction between our species and the rest of the animal creation  speak that i may know thee said the wise man of old but according to the prescribed use of speech in polite company it is impossible for us to come at the least knowledge of each other not on account of our using speech for the purpose of dissimulation but because it is ungenteel forsooth to discover in company that you have any knowledge at all or for any one person to speak above five seconds at a time or above five words in a breath  tediousness and prosing in conversation is an abominable practice i allow but no man ever dealt half so disagreeably in that figure of rhetoric which i think swift calls the circumbendibus as the fops and flirts of the present age now deal in the abrupt snipsnap manner of abandoning a subject before three syllables have been said upon it flying from one question to another as if each had been started for the sake of quitting it immediately or as if the very ghost of good sense was to be laid in all good company conversation was intended as a kind of traffic of mental commodities but nobody now dare open their budget and lest nature should set some tongues a going the puppies of the world have from time to time contrived to put a kind of gag in our mouths by inventing certain terms calculated to turn every man to ridicule who will venture to deliver his sentiments or disclose his mind for the information or entertainment of the company if you attempt to tell a story one puppy puts his hand to his cheek and cries patch implying it seems that the tale is old and smells of joe miller and if you continue your narration a minute and half another puppy turns to a monkey next him and whispers what a bore or boar for i dont know how they spell their nonsense but take it which way you will it is intended to convey an idea of tediousness and to compare the speaker to a hog or a gimlet but sure sir such wretches are themselves the greatest enemies to good company mere dampers to the mind wet blankets to the imagination and extinguishers of good sense and good humor taciturnity is the great vice of englishmen and it would be more expedient to devise methods to prevail on them to throw off that reserve that freezes their conversation than to study these poor meagre inventions to shut up every mans light like a dark lanthorn within his own bosom a bold free spirit it is true will leap these fences but it is hard methinks that a plain modest man should be stopped in the high road of conversation and not suffered to go on without interruption  i love humor and pleasantry sir as well as the merriest man in the kingdom but give me leave to inform these fine gentlemen that it is a melancholy symptom when they cannot bear the serious pursuit of any subject for two minutes together humor itself if good for any thing is serious at the bottom but what provokes me is that these cuckows are as grave as stoics and hold it a kind of treason to laugh for the old folly is revived which almost began to grow obsolete in our ancient comedies of being gentlemanlike and melancholy conversation being a kind of short extempore composition all severe censure of what falls from us profaneness and indecency excepted is ridiculous not only sense but for the sake of sense even nonsense should be tolerated for a man who is always afraid of uttering what may be interpreted to be nonsense will not give his understanding fair play and he will often let the immediate occasion that would have given grace and force to his observations pass by he will seem like an awkward militiaman discharging his solitary blunderbuss long after the rest of the corpse or at best supposing his words to have real weight and sterling value they will come upon us untowardly like distant thunder which does not reach our ears till long after the flash has taught us to expect it  by attending and observing modern conversation one would be tempted to imagine that it was one of the first principles of politeness to drive all sentiment and science out of society every thing relative to a mans peculiar concerns in which he might suppose his friends and acquaintance to take some little interest is deemed impertinent and every thing relative to knowledge is deemed pedantick formerly the honest bottle forced some rational and spirited sallies even from the most riotous company but the milksops of our age keep themselves sober till the cards or dice relieve them from the cruel necessity of endeavoring to amuse each other by conversation in the mean time to put a curb on the fancy lest the little genius they have should grow restive and run away with them they devise these miserable mechanical pieces of ridicule as restraints on the freedom of society i am rather an old fellow perhaps somewhat peevish and i confess it often puts me quite out of patience when a man cries patch at one of my stories i am almost provoked to give him a slap on the face and when a puppy seems to measure my words with a stop watch and at the end of a few seconds cries bore i am almost ready to call him out for his rudeness and impertinence  we have lost the noble art of antiquity of writing elegant compositions in the form of dialogue no wonder for what dialogue can appear natural when supposed to proceed from the mouths of men who will discourse on no subject who preclude all pleasantries as vulgar and supersede all knowledge as pedantick as to sentiment it might find as much quarter in a modern comedy from a modern critic as from our puny establishers of the laws of conversation the heart and the head are equally unconcerned and to seem to know any thing or to feel any thing are alike breaches of politeness but surely sir all this is directly opposite to the warmth and plainness of our old national character we were wont like shakespeares claudio to speak home and to the purpose if a mans mind is full of ideas why not let them run over and water the barren understandings or refresh the fruitful wits of the company and indeed a man himself scarce knows what stuff he has in his thoughts till he has drawn them out into discourse and often forms his own opinion according to the impressions that his words seem to make on his hearers answers too are produced frequently given with more shrewdness on the spot than on further consideration and truth as well as wit is struck out by collision i dont mean to consider every company as a tinderbox and to set argument and repartee like flint and steel perpetually striking against each other yet if a spark is now and then lighted up why should the officious hand of dullness be authorized by supposed politeness to extinguish it conversation is mentioned by lord bacon as wise a man sir as the wisest of our macaronies among the chief benefits of friendship making daylight in the understanding out of darkness and confusion of thoughts and as you adorned your last paper by an extract from a learned modern give me leave to wind up the bottom of my loose thoughts on conversation with a passage transcribed from that great chancellor and philosopher  whoever has his mind fraught with many thoughts his wit and understanding do clarify and break up in the communicating and discoursing with another he tosseth his thoughts more easily he marshalleth them more orderly he sees how they look when they are turned into words finally he waxes wiser than himself and that more by an hours discourse than by a days meditation it was well said by themistocles to the king of persia that speech was like cloth of arras opened and put abroad whereby the imagery does appear in figure whereas in thought they lie but as in packs neither is the fruit of friendship of opening the understanding restrained only to such friends as are able to give a man counsel they indeed are best but even without that a man learneth of himself and brings his own thoughts to light and whetteth his wits as against a stone which itself cuts not in a word a man were better relate himself to a statue or picture than to suffer his thoughts to pass in smother conference says lord coke also is the life of study conference says lord bacon again makes a ready man and if he confer little he had need have a present wit  in short sir conversation is the great source of pleasure and information in society and whoever contributes to dam it up should be strenuously opposed by the rest of mankind but to suffer a bye word a low cant term to deprive us of the means of entertainment and intelligence is the meanest pusillanimity and sacrificing good sense at the shrine of folly and nonsense  i must beg leave therefore by an index expurgatorius to banish patch and bore from the modern vocabulary not merely on account of the barbarity of the terms but for the evil tendency of the ridiculous something or less than nothing implied by them for they are not only framed by blockheads destitute of meaning in themselves but calculated to kill the seeds of good sense and humanity in other people i am  sir yours as before a blackguard   the gentleman number v wednesday october         proximus huic longo sed proximus intervallo virg the next it is true and yet it is clear although the next it is not near  though i did not on the commencement of this undertaking engage to appear before the public at any certain stated periods yet it might not unreasonably be presumed by the occasional reader that i should at least adhere in some degree to the usual practice of an occasional writer in the small circle of those who did me the honor to peruse the foregoing numbers my long silence has i find given rise to various conjectures some have not scrupled to pronounce me really and bona fide deceased while others have contented themselves with lamenting my metaphorical departure from the literary world saying that my small kilderkin of wit was entirely exhausted others again have asserted that during the summer months i was like my betters retired into the country many concurring in this opinion have however attributed my silence to some accident attending my retirement or peregrinations some have represented me on horseback like the tailor riding to brentford and have cruelly dislocated my collarbone by a fall some have shot me with a springgun or stuck me in a mantrap like gulliver in a marrowbone some have cast me away on an inlandnavigation and some have buried me alive in a cavern of the peak  i have now the pleasure to inform my friends that i am alive and hope they will find me alive and merry the truth is i have been in the country and though i cannot like the inimitable spectator indulge myself in a series of rural lucubrations though i cannot extract entertainment from the history of an henroost or pen an agreeable dissertation upon haycocks yet before i meet the parliament in london and set up my rest in town for the winter i will give a short account of my first visit during the summer recess this publication however is not without the privity and good liking of mine host let me not be blamed therefore for a breach of the laws of hospitality  my old schoolfellow and college acquaintance sir jocelyn hearty having long importuned me to pass two or three weeks with him in the country about the beginning of august i set out for his seat and toward the conclusion of the second day found myself nearly at the end of my journey within two or three miles of the mansion house i encountered several horsemen whose seat appeared uncommonly loose and unsteady some in small parties hanging over their horses and seeming in earnest conversation with each other some galloping furiously after dropping whips and hats and wigs by the way and shouting as they past to denote their good fellowship and hail their acquaintance upon turning into the grounds which lead directly to the house my ears were saluted with a loud vocal chorus which however quickly subsided but was almost as quickly renewed and thus rose and fell by turns till i was arrived at the gate entering the hall i found it strewed with honest rusticks fast asleep in their boots and great coats a saloon on each side of the hall was filled with benches and long tables at which a jovial company still kept their places drinking toasting and singing  my friend it seems was already retired an old servant however took me under his protection and provided me with every necessary accommodation till the next morning about noon i was introduced to sir jocelyn whom i found in his dressing room with a bowl before him containing a composition of milk nutmeg and brandy which he called a doctor this doctor is it seems always called in on the morrow of these joyous festivities and though not regular may boast as numerous a set of patients and a practice as extensive as any of the faculty after a hearty shake by the hand and a few other civilities the baronet informed me that he and his friends of yesterday had been getting drunk according to act of parliament having formerly been a student of the law i expressed some surprise at not being able to recollect so particular a chapter in the statute book it is one of the best of them all for all that said sir jocelyn and yet it is but a new law neither and i had the honor to assist at the passing it the grenville bill my friend since that bill past into a law we dare not give a gill of wine or a tiff of punch before the election but it is fit we should entertain our friends handsomely some time after it is over that the freeholders may see we do not forget them and remember us hereafter accordingly i could not help smiling at so ingenious an exposition of the statute telling my friend that the soundness of his law put me in mind of foigards logic if you receive it beforehand it is a bribe but if you take it afterward is is only a gratification  a few days after sir jocelyn told me if it was a matter of indifference to me which way i might ride that morning he should be very glad of my company to a village at about eight miles distance but i must quit you at the towns end says he for i am engaged to dinner and on particular business we have a meeting of the justices the chief business of this meeting it seems was to sign licenses for the public houses for the year ensuing this business was fortunately dispatched before dinner fortunately i say because their worships showed themselves so sincerely well inclined to promote the interest of those whose callings they met to authorize that it would not have been prudent to postpone an operation for which their very zeal might disqualify them in short after a joyous day sir jocelyn rode home rather quicker than he went and we saw no more of him till the next morning  in about a week more however he was again called forth to a turnpike meeting sir jocelyn ever ready to accommodate his friends and serve the public duly attended but the road under consideration proved so execrable and so many difficulties occurred concerning the proposals for repairing it that the committee sat till midnight and did not rise till they had debated the matter like the ancient germans both drunk and sober  the races and the assizes being each a kind of assembly of the whole county it was impossible for the baronet and his family to be absent from either on two different days of the races were entered two horses belonging to sir jocelyn both started but their fortune was as various as their colors the first day his baldfaced gray horse north won the odds against the field carried off the kings plate and was victorious but on the second day his brown horse orator took rust ran out of the course and was distanced sir jocelyn and his friends after the example of the ancients celebrated one of these events and lamented the other exactly in the same manner the flowing bowls were crowned again and again in honor of the winner and the cup of affliction ran over in sorrow for the loser  at the assizes sir jocelyn was foreman of the grand jury so many bills were presented that the several members of the inquest exhausted by their uncommon fatigue required a more than ordinary recruit it is no wonder therefore that having duly dispatched in sober sadness the business of the nation the honest country gentlemen relaxed their gravity and converting their solemn assembly to a merry meeting protracted their sitting after supper till daylight  an old boon companion of my acquaintance used to say that getting tipsy was one of the pleasantest things in the world but that nothing was so irksome and painful than its necessary consequence getting sober again this was exactly the case with sir jocelyn the text of every evening was mirth and jollity but the comment of the morrowmorning was sorrow and sickness the hunting season commenced some little time before i departed every hare or fox that had been killed in the morning was revived at night and again run down in full cry the exercise of the chase was less laborious than the festivity of the evening politics took their turn also america was floated with lakes of claret and the blockade of boston caused many an headache on one of these occasions seeing my worthy friend in much pain i could not refrain from a short and affectionate expostulation regretting that an excellent understanding should be drowned in liquor and the best of men rendered a martyr to his own hospitality and benevolence ah my dear friend said sir jocelyn with his hand pressed upon his temples you town gentlemen imagine that we lead very quiet idle lives in the country but take my word for it that it requires a very good estate and a very good constitution to support as one ought to do the character of a country gentleman  the gentleman number vi monday december        respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo doctum imitatorem et veras hinc ducere voces hor on natures pattern too i will bid him look and copy manners from her living book colmans art of poetry to the gentleman sir since you have announced your arrival in town i hope you intend to demonstrate by some future papers that you are a frequenter of the theater i love the playhouse and am one of those plain folks that dine early enough to attend the rising of the curtain i do not sit down to table at six prolong the last course till eight or nine and then perhaps crack my head with cracking a bottle or rattling a dicebox till eight or nine the next morning i hope therefore since with the bulk of my countrymen i take an interest in these entertainments that you will like your predecessoressayists gratify us with some sound criticisms on the drama sound criticisms i say no flimsy panegyric or gross abuse praising or reviling one writer or performer for the purpose of raising or debasing another but tracing and enforcing the real principles of the drama and if examples for the sake of illustration must now and then be given give them from the classick dead for praise or censure of the living is commonly nauseous commonly suspicious the dead too no offense to the present generation are our more intimate acquaintance  i do not mean however to depreciate the talents of the living no sir you will find that the main scope of this letter is to encourage cotemporary merit and to repress the petulance and expose the futility of commonplace criticism writers who endeavor to effect their purpose by methods merely mechanical are justly denied the palm of genius ought critics then to comment by line and rule and to decide by a receipt if criticism be the handmaid of the muse she might surely catch something of her air and spirit rather than rip up the cast clothes of her mistress at once to steal the pattern and find fault with the fashion in a word her labors should be directed to promote the arts rather than to dishearten the professors and though it must naturally fall out that more can see and read than those who write and paint etc yet since they who hazard their observations in public in some measure become artists themselves they should take care to found those observations on the basis of candor taste and good sense at present the press swarms with critics a louse say the naturalists is a very lousy animal and there is not a lousy author in town especially a dramatick author that has not fifty lousy critics on his back these bloodsuckers have no doubt their use and may serve to correct the too sanguine imagination of an author but i beg leave to mention a few instances wherein i think they contribute to weaken and to impoverish genius  the first canon of modern criticism and indeed it has been a favorite topic ever since the flood is the degeneracy of the present age this is the grand era of dullness genius they cry is extinct shakespeare jonson and fletcher wycherly congreve and vanbrugh are no more  true and the present writers such as they are will hereafter at least have that claim to applause they will be no more  but a good play say the critics is so scarce so very scarce a commodity  granted when was it otherwise allowing for a moment that every old piece in dodsleys collection is excellent how few are such pieces to those which were then written and exhibited whose wit and spirit has not been sufficient to keep them sweet and alive for the delight and entertainment of the present generation from the days of aeschylus to yesterday few writers have been equal to the hard task of a good tragedy to write a comedy is a serious matter and even an excellent farcemonger says diderot is no ordinary character i have looked upon the stage for a long long series of time and without flattery to the present race of dramatists i will venture to pronounce that the last five and twenty years or thereabouts have produced more plays likely to descend to posterity than the five and twenty immediately preceding i do not mean to pay my court to any particular author i have thrown the compliment among them and let each of them take as much of it as he may think falls to his share  to point out antique merit to the moderns as an object of emulation is wise and laudable but to set it up like the gallows to terrify and gibbet poor culprits that venture on the high road of letters is impolitick and ungenerous comparisons are commonly invidious yet there are a kind of comparisons still more odious than those between the ancients and moderns  i mean those drawn between moderns and moderns wits as well as beauties are naturally fond of pulling caps and mangling the reputations of each other but shall the sober critic who ought to keep down their vanity and quell their arrogance shall he as it were ex cathedra give a sanction to their squabbles or throw additional weight into that scale which success and selfconceit have perhaps already made too heavy let every successful writer triumph in his turn yet do not chain his fellowauthors to the wheels of his chariot but rather let it be the office of a critic like the slave of the ancients to bid him remember that he is mortal  but the most offensive weapon of modern criticism is some reigning word with which every literary rifleman arms himself and does dreadful execution the two leading monosyllables of the house of commons are not more powerful than such a word be it what it may while it remains formidable by being in fashion i am old enough to remember when the word low was this scarecrow genteel comedy and the politest literature were in universal request and every writer who attempted to be comic dreaded the imputation of buffoonery if a piece had strong humor  oh sir it is damned low  was its sentence of condemnation at length however the word low has been restored to favor and the term sentiment in its turn has fallen into disgrace to anatomise a character and see what breeds about the heart had formerly its merit but now this dissection of the human mind has lost its advocates and admirers sentimental stuff is the phrase and he who dares to approve a scene where the course of the story apparently leads the author to exhibit passion rather than humor is condemned for an oldfashioned dunce and a coxcomb gross drolleries or dull moralities  moralities let me call them are equally reprehensible but humor is not to be censured merely because it is low nor sentiment to be banished when it seems to exhibit the workings of the heart with the ancient critics the manners and sentiments held an equal rank in the drama each alike excellent while they were each alike characteristick  after such a free censure of the modern coinage of cant terms in the critical vocabulary if i might be allowed to give currency to a word i would endeavor to renew one that is as old as the creation  nature  the sterling bullion of nature  let the critics cease to enquire whether the humor be low or the piece sentimental let them examine whether it be natural but let the admirer and imitator of nature also be on his guard not to fall into insipidity or to indulge the minute touches of a dutch pencil let your outline be bold though simple and fill it as richly and color it as highly as you please always taking care to avoid extravaganza and to hold as it were the mirror up to nature this is no curb upon the imagination caliban is as natural as hamlet  composition and criticism are so nearly allied that in making strictures upon one i have been betrayed almost unawares into speaking of the other narrowness in each mannerists in writing and mannerists in criticism are equally my aversion the wretched fellow that could paint nothing but a rose was not in my opinion more contemptible than the cuckoo who can repeat nothing but low or sentimental the wide field of nature gives scope for that variety which ever distinguishes an era of genius never was there a period wherein excellent authors flourished but their several manners were as different as their faces nay a good author possesses a versatility of talent not only keeping him above the servile imitation of others but enabling him in great measure to vary from himself yet there is another vice of critics which i forgot to mention before i mean their perpetually recurring to every writers first production and settling it as the standard of his genius as if they dreaded his cultivating more than one spot of parnassus to compare a man with himself disadvantageously too is of all comparisons the most mortifying but mortification is no more the main business of the critic than torture should be the study of the surgeon though some pain will of necessity follow both their operations  to conclude sir while i recommend the drama to your notice i mean to warn you from falling into the vulgar errors of ordinary commentators and i hope you will take warning but if you go on gingling the bells of panegyric or wading through the mire of abuse in the beaten track of modern criticism i wish that your remarks may perish as speedily as the lie of the day with which they appear and that your essays may be consigned to oblivion with the newspapers in which they are printed  in hopes of better things from your candor and discernment i remain your old friend and old correspondent  the blackguard   terraefilius published daily during the encaenia at oxford in honor of the peace mdcclxiii the following letter though written by another hand and without the privity of terraefilius is yet prefixed to his papers now republished as an introduction or short preface conveying a just idea of the design of the author and the nature of the undertaking  to the printer of the st jamess chronicle sir as the terraefilius is to be revived at the encaenia now held at oxford the following explanation of that character may be agreeable to some of your readers  terraefilius is a student who writes a satyr upon the members of the university during the festival and taxes them with any faux pas or irregularities they may have committed a sort of a licensed pasquin for the time he takes his title from the old roman phrase terraefilius which among them signified an obscure or unknown person it neither being proper nor advisable that the author of the censures usually thrown out under this character should be publicly known it is confidently reported the celebrated mr c c  ll is gone down to assist therein  as the word encaenia also may probably puzzle the unlettered part of your readers it will not be amiss to inform them that it signifies an anniversary feast held by the primitive christians in commemoration of the day on which their churches were founded and since used to denote any annual festival the money out of which the expenses of the present encaenia at oxford are to be defrayed was originally left if i mistake not to new college by their generous benefactor lord crew and was formerly laid out in what is called a gaudy from the latin word gaudeo to rejoice that is to say spent in eating and drinking but for these thirteen years past the college with a disinterestedness which does them the highest honor have bestowed the legacy on the university to be by them laid out in defraying the expenses of an annual musical entertainment or such other celebrity as shall be likely to render the university famous and increase the number of its patrons by drawing a concourse of gentry and nobility there who are always complimented on these occasions with academical honors suitable to their rank the festivities of this year

satyrist the terror of old and young male and female graduates and undergraduates gownsmen and townsmen matriculated and unmatriculated send greeting i am come ladies and gentlemen according to ancient custom to be one of the principal actors in the celebrities of the present term you have heard without doubt of the noble exploits of my predecessors those bold assertors of the freedom of speech and the liberty of the press though the degeneracy of the times and the numberless innovations in the ancient customs and usages of the university will not permit me after the manner of my ancestors to enter the theater and pour forth the torrent of my family eloquence from the rostrum yet i am resolved not to be put to silence my wisdom shall cry aloud in the streets though no man regards it i will erect my temporary stage like the itinerant practitioners in physic in the highway i will make a speech without doors if i am forbid to mount the regular pulpit i do not doubt of having as numerous followers as other fieldpreachers i am determined at all events to maintain the honor and assert the privileges of my family and make no doubt of being able to prove myself a chip of the old block  the method i have taken of announcing my intentions by advertisements in the london papers and oxford journal has i find created the utmost consternation among all ranks and degrees of people in this famous town and university the mayor and corporation i am informed were first seized with the pannick fit and held a council extraordinary on this occasion when it was taken into consideration whether they should put me into the stocks send me to the house of correction or bind me over to appear at the next quarter sessions at length however it was held to be an universitybusiness and to fall more properly under the cognizance of the house of convocation from the body corporate therefore my cause was removed by a new kind of certiorari to the body academical the right honorable the chancellor i am told is alarmed and thinks of issuing a formal prohibition the learned and reverend the vice chancellor i hear has declared that he will not grant his imprimatur to my works and the wise heads in golgotha have laid their sculls together about me and my paper that formidable lawyer and learned gentleman the venerian professor it is confidently asserted is consulting the archives to prepare a solemn lecture on the two tremendous statutes de contumeliis compescendis and de famosis libellis the public orator they say is drawing up an harangue in the style and spirit of quousque tandem and the poetry professor is writing a poem against me it is further added that the name of terraefilius himself as soon as it is certainly known will be registered in the black book and he himself like most of his forefathers will be publicly expelled  that his poor printer will be trained after a beadle as big as pope beaver into the vicechancellors court and in spite of the statute de privilegiis urbis et universitatis simul non fruendis have the honor of an academical mittimus to the castle or bocardo  some few however who fancy that they see deeper than the surface and that they have more penetration than their neighbors affect to know me and my intentions better the dreadful sound of the name i have assumed which has alarmed the vulgar as that of rawheadandbloodybones serves as a bugbear for children these confident gentlemen affect to consider as a mere scarecrow set up to fright the few shallow daws and chattering pies of the university while my words however big and sonorous are as innocent as the noise of a cherryclapper they affect to laugh at those who have conceived horrible ideas of me and cry out when they hear that terraefilius is coming that there is a lion in the way terraefilius they pretend is not that tremendous animal he was wont to be lion as he is he has filed his teeth and pared his claws and though he may venture to lift up his voice and make the wide forest tremble at his roar yet like shakespeares lion he will roar as gently as any nightingale  be this as it may whether i shall prove myself a literary hornet a downright academical wasp or merely an innocent humblebee with a small sting by way of defense or melius non tangere in my tail whether my style will be more agreeable to the genius of our modern encaenia or the old saturnalia whether i shall pour forth from my small cruet of wit and humor the oil of panegyric or the vinegar of invective and satire in whatever manner i may write or speak still gentlemen i must insist on it that i have a natural an uncontrovertible right to appear at these solemnities a right established by the ancient forms of the university and recognized by the statutes the celebrities appendant and appurtenant to the actterm every man must acknowledge would be imperfect without the admission of such a character as that i have undertaken to sustain a character as necessary to enliven the gravity of solemn convocations formal processions long harangues dull disputations and oratorios most musical most melancholy as the introduction of the fool among the personages of the old comedy or that merry gentleman master punch among the wooden kings and queens at a puppetshew it is the peculiar nature also of seasons of festivity to strike out sallies of wit and indulge strokes of satire which give no more annoyance to the general merriment than illuminations and fireworks on a night of rejoicing though perhaps some queer old gentleman may be alarmed at the crackers bouncing about his ears the serpents hissing at his tail or a squib whizzing in his periwig  in an age less productive of innovations than the present i should indeed be surprised that when the celebration of the peace has cccasioned a kind of public act no person properly qualified should be called upon by the heads of the university to officiate in the capacity of terraefilius in the theater or at least if so essential a personage as terraefilius should be by our academical licensers and chamberlains silenced and forbid to appear on the scene i am still more surprised that the character of public orator also should not be wiped out of the dramatis personae his rattling eloquence and my sprightliness or if you please to call it so impertinence should accompany one another as naturally as thunder and lightning to have all praise and no satire all sweet and no sour is to make your punch without lemon the province of public orator we know by experience is wholly panegyric that is the case of the present company always excepted to say every thing of a man but the truth whereas the very nature and spirit of my office demands that although the truth should not be told at all times yet at this particular season i may tell the truth the whole truth and sometimes perhaps a little more than the truth and though truth in general is well known to be at the bottom of the well yet on these occasions it may be pumped up be the springs ever so foul and muddy till it runs clear and dealt out among you by pails and buckets full  the reverend dr brown a worthy member and illustrious ornament of a sister university in a dissertation lately published wherein he has drawn all the rudiments of politeness from savages and shown us that the tree of knowledge originally took root in the soil of ignorance the learned doctor i say gentlemen has proved almost to a logical if not a mathematical demonstration that satire and comedy as well as ode and tragedy owe their birth to the solemnization of that elegant indian celebrity the savage songfeast where every man had a license to make free with another and to throw out jests and gibes upon his neighbor since therefore the public orator adheres to his imitation of the great prototypes of sublime panegyric shall not terraefilius be permitted to follow up the originals of familiar sarcasm shall we ladies and gentlemen be less liberal and openhearted in our mirth than the cherokees and the catabaws shall we be exceeded in politeness by the six nations and shall the savages on the ohio and missisippi indulge themselves in more trulyclassical festivities or elegant railleries than the polite scholars on the banks of the isis  if we descend to later times or examine the custom of more polished ages we shall find that at all seasons of festivity and rejoicing peculiar freedoms are allowed nay that even some mixture of terror is often introduced in order as may be supposed to give a higher relish to the other portions of the celebrity the spanish bullfeasts and old english tilts and tournaments are of this nature or to confine my illustrations entirely within the limits of our own times and nation and to show we love a little horseradish with our roastbeef what do you think gentlemen and ladies of the champion at a coronation is not a doughty knight armed capapee prancing in upon a milk white palfrey by found of trumpet and beat of drum and throwing his gauntlet in defiance a most tremendous apparition he makes his entrance too during the peaceful ceremonial of dinnertime yet i never heard that he frightened away the stomach of the most delicate lord or lady or infused terror into any of the worshipful aldermen  do not let terraefilius disturb

will not now transcribe a translation of my motto from francis or creech or after the newfangled fashion of modern wits give a new one of my own adapted to modern manners the mottoes to the connoisseur then not long collected and published in volumes were the first given in that style and manner but i rather choose to enforce and illustrate the alarming words of the roman satirist by the following still more tremendous quotation from shakespeare   tremble thou wretch that have within thee undivulged crimes unwhipt of justice hide thee thou bloody hand thou perjure and thou simular of virtue that art incestuous caitiff shake to pieces that under covert and convenient seeming have practiced on mans life close pentup guilts rive your concealing continents and ask this dreadful

danglers in square caps and hanging sleeves who boast the triumphs of a lettered heart not put the pitapatation of their dear little bosoms into a flutter let the rosy doctors and my good masters in

virgil who is he what is his name a stranger guest comes he in serious earnest or in jest  ladies and gentlemen of all the literary commodities which are at present brought to market there is not one which produces half so large a demand or such a quick sale as scandal formerly the sweet flowers of poetry like myrtle or orange trees in pots were the chief ornaments of a booksellers window and sold as well as roses and hyacinths at covent garden but now every bud and blossom of helicon every fruit and flower of poetry every shrub of parnassus is an unprofitable weed unless it be as bitter as wormwood or coloquintida heavy treatises moral discourses and dull dissertations were once as greatly in request as beef at leaden hall and religion and philosophy were as fixed staple commodities as corn at bearkey law in white calfskin while there were any students in the profession sold at as high rates in the purlieus of the temple or lincolns inn as the calf itself in smithfield and till the poring over musty parchments was exploded in the inns of court the sheepskin was almost as valuable as the sheep it was easy also for the manufacturers of systems and paradoxes to drive a kind of contraband trade in deism infidelity and such other hardware and little dablers in ink often made successful cruises in smuggling profaneness and bawdry in a word every common pedlar in a magazine was thought to have some curious trinket in his pack and the lowest hawker was sure to make a dinner on a bloody murder or the kings speech  these times wherein the great mart of letters was in such a flourishing situation were indeed glorious but now to the unspeakable detriment of trading authors of almost every denomination literary property is reduced to a very narrow compass and the richest copyholders not only groan under the load of heavy fines and new impositions but see their most valuable possessions perishing under their hands or in spite of every fence of law and equity invaded by bold trespassers from scotland for many parcels and whole bales of goods they have now no vent no performance can promise itself a great run that is not highly seasoned with abuse and the nearer a writer approaches to unquestionable libel and the most open scandalum magnatum the more his work will be read if a smart piece of satire is thought to have occasioned a duel though it is doubtful whether the pistols of the combatants ever were more than upon halfcock the paper will run off like wildfire an information in the kings bench or a visit from a kings messenger will carry off a dozen impressions and if the author stands in the pillory or is committed to newgate or sent to the tower the fortune of the bookseller is made for ever  it is plain therefore ladies and gentlemen from these and many other considerations which i have duly weighed and deliberated that scandal is the most profitable commodity which a writer can deal in being that to which readers give the most encouragement scandalmongers like fishmongers may put what price they please on their goods and be sure to have them all bought off their hands provided they will take care to supply their customers fresh and fresh this therefore is to give notice that i terraefilius at the universityscandaloffice in oxford have determined to open a shop in the high street during the encaenia and though all will be accounted fish that comes to my net yet to avoid creating a glut which might make my stock too cheap i shall like the rest of my honest fraternity throw away the small fry and offer you nothing but the very prime of the market and i can assure you ladies and gentlemen that i have several odd fish and such as were never exhibited to sale before which are just brought to town by land carriage  i have already received in consequence of my late request by public advertisement several very curious and entertaining anecdotes concerning some of the most eminent personages attending the present celebrity aliens and visiters as well as inhabitants and members of colleges with many of which the names of the parties printed at full length i propose to oblige my readers reserving the rest to enrich the two volumes of my college atalantis subscriptions to which pour in apace abundantly more than sufficient to defray the expense of any prosecutions which my papers may incur or to carry on such actions as i may think necessary to maintain in vindication of the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the press  but while i am thus employed in collecting materials for secret history and pushing as far as possible my researches into the characters of others you i find ladies and gentlemen are equally assiduous in your enquiries after me it is a well known remark of addison that readers never entertain a true relish for a performance till they know something of the author as whether he is a fair man or a black man a short man or a tall man a nobleman or a gentleman or a tradesman or a highwayman a divine a lawyer or a physician high or low rich or poor sorry am i to be obliged to call in question the observation of so fine a writer but i must beg leave to insist on it that till the book is by some means or other  by its whimsicalness its scurrility or no matter what  become the object of general notice nobody cares a farthing about the writer then indeed when the alarm is given when merit has made its way or when fashion or caprice have given the nod of approbation then the hue and cry goes abroad after the author  who is he which is he where is he what says he  this is and i will be judged by mr shandy  this is as the laureat terms it the honeymoon of wit  now lords ask him to dinner ladies take him to ranelagh and managers give him the freedom of the theater his name is in every newspaper and his face in every printshop if the real author is not known a substitute as in the case of militiamen is appointed to serve in his stead which the world runs after with as much eagerness as turnus pursues the airy image of aeneas or rather as the booksellers pursue the phantom of an author in the dunciad  i had once some thoughts in order to gratify the reigning passion for caricature of having my head cut in wood and placed at the front of these papers at another time i had half formed a resolution of having my face painted by haggarty and hung up as a sign at the door of my printer but finding that masked balls are coming into fashion i at last determined to mix among the crowd in disguise with the liberty of other masqueraders of attacking every person in company in a seigned voice with the witty interrogation of do you know me  curiosity however is not to be repreft and there are many that will flatter themselves they see through the disguise they know your walk your voice your air or some little peculiarity in your manner or deportment i have had the honor of being mistaken for several celebrated persons already and every man is convinced that i am one of his old acquaintance some take me for that merry fellow the facetious author of the companion to the guide and the guide to the companion that lively spark who showed early dawnings of a poetical genius and soon proved himself a fine chopping boy that would do honor to his alma matter when he sung the triumphs of isis who not only brings up the rear of epicaedia and gratulationes with uncommon spirit but can also descend from the sublimer exercises of his muse to celebrate the maker of muttonpies or compose odes on grizzlewigs who though now a grave tutor cannot surely nay should not wholly forget his days of pupilage and though now  the days are come when calm he smokes in commonroom and dines with breast untroubled under the picture of the pious founder progress of discontent  by the rev mr t wharton  yet he must remember the days when his ale first became a rival to phillipss cider the days when he frequented christchurch and spent his evening at captain jollys  some there are who suppose me to be no other than that grave antiquarian that soul of ail souls who obliged the world some years ago with a dissertation on the mallard who has since appeared in the shape of a decypherer and wrote an explanation of the oxford almanac and about the same time like an expert gamester played my cards most notably at a certain game of all fours  others take me for that rattle the student and others for that dapperwit the genius and some for both these together who have come down expressly from london like the chairmen with their sedans or like a pair of oars on the thames in whitsonholydays have agreed to ply together during the present celebrity on the isis should it be the first of these wags it is pretended that the company may expect a sign post exhibition or that the solemn oratorios under the direction of dr hayes the professor of music will be turned into ridicule by a grand burlesque ode and a masked band from ranelagh and in case it should be the other little wit it is supposed that besides threatening the university with a terraefilius he means once more to convert the tenniscourt into a playhouse and in defiance of the statute de ludis prohibitis to bring down a company of comedians funambulos et histriones to present us with new jealous wives and new polly honeycombes of his own composition  some few who indulge this last way of thinking are half inclined to suppose that terrae filius is the haymarket momus who formerly gave tea and took off his tutor and the rest of the fellows at worcestercollege in which honorable society he is acknowledged to be a founders kin of which circumstance perhaps he may one day or other claim the benefit notwithstanding the objections raised in dr blackstones learned treatise on collateral consanguinity  others again the ministerial and antiministerial characters in the university whose ideas of wit and humor are almost entirely absorbed in port and politics will have it that i am one or other of the supposed authors of the northbriton since it is generally reported that the reverend gentleman having snapped the last cord of poor hogarths heart strings will come down in his laced hat like general churchill or tiddydoll and being a member of the university of cambridge it is taken for granted that the convocation will take this public opportunity of admitting him ad eundem at the same time too the newspapers having already informed us that the member of parliament for aylesbury will be here in his way to stowe the squire is hourly expected with a grand retinue of compositors pressmen devils and his own extempore traveling press from great george street westminster  such it seems and so various are the sentiments of different little cabals in this town and university concerning the real person of terraefilius whether he be either or neither or one or all of the characters abovementioned time alone must discover he is determined like the actors among the ancients to play out his little comedy in a mask and all the notification which he thinks proper to give of himself in his present bills is that at the particular desire of several persons of quality the part of terraefilius is attempted by a gentleman for his own diversion being the first time of his appearing in that character  postscript terraefilius willing as much as in him lies to promote a general obedience to the programma issued from the court of delegates ordering that during the time of this solemnity all persons comport themselves with such sobriety and modesty as may tend to the reputation and honor of the university begs leave to recommend the following faithful extract from the statute of quales tutores etc to the very serious consideration of the grave and learned tutors in this university  tutoris etiam muneri incumbit quoad ea quae ipsius oculis quotodie sese ingerere necesse est qualia sunt vestes ocreae capillitium etc pupillos suos intra modum a statutis praescriptum continere quem si excesserint pupilli tutor pro prima secunda et tertia vice qua deliquisse pupillus deprehensus fuerit sex solidis and octo denariis mulctabitur quarta vero vice

also to the office of tutor in regard to those things which must necessarily pass daily under his very nose as clothes boots hair periwig etc to keep his students dressed in the fashion prescribed by the statutes which if the pupils exceed the tutor for the first second and third time in which the pupil shall be found guilty shall be sconced six shillings and eightpence but the fourth time the vice chancellor shall put him out of the office of tutor terraefilius number iii thursday july        spectatum veniunt veniunt spectentur ut  ovid what is it by coming here they mean they come to see and to be seen  the reigning passion of this nation for some few years past seems to have been the love of shows and spectacles and festivals and solemnities during the war the people betrayed several symptoms of this rage after fine sights and many thousands followed the camp as young ensigns often take to the army for the sake of its splendour and gaiety one week all the vehicles in england and from the coach and six or landau with two postilions down to the one horse chaise and sober sulky were whirling passengers along the road from all quarters toward portsmouth to see the fleet assembled at spithead and the next the same people were transported with the same rapidity by the same passion for a sight and a crowd to behold the evolutions and maneuvers of the regiments of militia embodied and encamped at winchester at the coronation the tide of company from every county in the kingdom flowed like rivers discharging themselves into the sea into the metropolis last summer one would have imagined that all the famous witches of lancashire had been at work to draw the whole city of london from its foundations which seemed like birnam wood going to dunsinane to be all moving together to preston guild this summer now that oxford is become the scene wherein the grand show is exhibited and the doors of the sheldonian theater are thrown open for almost a whole week it is no wonder that london once more empties itself into this magnificent reservoir and that all ranks and degrees of people are assembled to see the doctors in scarlet and to attend the lectures of terraefilius  there is not a man on earth ladies and gentlemen who is a truer lover of mirth and jollity than myself and i take a most particular delight in the present encaenia it gives me an unspeakable pleasure to see the new dunstablebonnets mixed with square caps and a gown and petticoat by the side of a gown and cassock i could stand whole hours to see the white fustian ridinghabits and blue sattinwaistcoats make their entry at eastgate and am transported to see the boot and the basket of all the stagecoaches filled with rosin and catgut and fiddles and hautboys and clarionets and frenchhorns and bassviols while the inside and outside of every machine is crowded with the performers english and italian vocal and instrumental festivals and solemnities have i grant their uses and advantages and far be it from me to attempt to erase any of the redletter days from the oxford almanac it must however at the same time be confessed that scenes of grandeur and seasons of celebrity which serve merely for relaxation to the studious and fill the intelligent mind with great ideas often prove only new occasions of idleness to the holydaymaking tradesmen and open nothing but the mouth of the ignorant who stand agape gazing with a foolish face of pleasure and astonishment i am not one who lament as a disappointment our not having fireworks on occasion of the present peace and think that the  0000 people assembled last week in hydepark had sufficient consolation in the review i am glad indeed to see our chancellor presiding in person for the first time at a public solemnity among us yet do i not wish for the installation of another to produce more spectacles though as magnificent as what we saw at the installation of lord westmorland and for the above reasons as well as for some others which i do not think it prudent or advisable to mention at present i hope it will be long very long before there is another coronation  going along the high street last tuesday morning i was observing not without a smile one of those modern tottering crazy vehicles halfpostchaise halfchariot neither one nor the other and yet something of both driving toward the angel innyard but turning my eyes from the carriage to the persons it contained whom should i see but my good friend mr folio the bookseller near st pauls and his wife mrs folio who at that very instant happening to dart the rays of her bright eyes in right angles upon me she pulled my friend folio by the sleeve who seemed half asleep by her side folio no sooner saw me than he ran his head and neck a yard and a half out of the chariot window and bawled out lustily mr  but hold i must not tell my name i followed the chariot into the innyard and had the honor of handing out mrs folio  the first ceremonies occasioned by this our unexpected interview being over and being quietly seated in the parlour mr folio informed me that having a new edition of a jestbook printing at a private press in oxford he took this opportunity of visiting the university and giving mrs folio an agreeable airing after which he enquired very cordially after mr fletcher of the turle mr daniel prince and the rest of his brother booksellers in oxford i find too continued he you have a terraefilius  a new paper i suppose  pray who is the author does it make a noise does it sell how many do they print would you be so kind now my dear sir taking me by the hand and smiling as to assist me in making proper extracts and furnish me with a few occasional paragraphs to send up to the ledger and lloyds evening post to these various interrogations i made no other reply than enquiring after the younger part of the family  i hope miss folio is well maam  very well sir i thank you said mrs folio we had some thoughts of bringing her down with us but my spouse had such a quantity of things to put into the chariot that we could not easily crowd three on us into it so i have left polly in our lodgings at islington spa and there you know she cannot be unked for want of company  and if she pleases she may go to the wells every night  and how does young mr folio do  what bonus says mr folio bonus is entered in one of the colleges  he has left st pauls school and is a brother gownsman of yours at which words he rung the bell and on the appearance of the waiter dispatched him to  college for young master folio desiring his company with some particular friends at the angel  till the return of the messenger mr folio after having dispatched another waiter to the barbers with his wig amused himself with unpacking some parcels and valizes which it seems were what had filled up miss folios place in the chariot the first he unfolded he informed me were some sheets of a new work of his own writing which he proposed to publish early in the ensuing winter he pressed me very hard to read some particular passages which i evaded pleading want of time and leisure to give it due attention in the present hurry and dissipation of the place  come come says he i know you gentlemen that write dont approve of us in the trade pretending to publish books of our own  but we have some good hands among us i can tell you  oh i know that  know it ay but you none of you care to own it for any thing courtly and airy for a dramatick satire or a modern tragedy we have dodsley in pall mall  mr pope allowed him to be a good poet  for divinity and morality we have pain that lives in the row  for criticism or any thing in the belles lettres way there is r griffiths  why he writes half the monthly review  and then for the whole circle of sciences there is our old friend mr newbery at the north door of st pauls  and the author of a late pamphlet called the lives of the present writers assures us for a fact that he has wrote two favorite farces  how much farther his zeal for the honor of the trade would have carried him is uncertain if his vehemence had not been broke in upon by the return of the messenger and the arrival of young folio the mother was charmed beyond expression with his appearance in the academical habit and vowed he was grown half a head or else that dress made him look so much taller well i protest it becomes him vastly dont it turning to me you must know sir his father intends making on him a clergyman  ay ay the gown by all means said folio  but come bonus you must show your mother and me the university  mr  i hope will favor us with his company to make the tower of the colleges and return afterward to eat a bit of mutton with us at dinner i accepted the invitation and mr folio having waited in his gold laced hat with a handkerchief of mrs folios about his ears till the return of his wig properly bushed out and powdered and having in the interim equipped himself with a full suit of pompadour with gold buttons which he had brought down carefully packed between pasteboards we sallied out of the angel into the high street to see the university  we were no sooner got into the street than we were carried by a kind of instinct into mr parkers not only to give mr folio an opportunity of shaking his old friend by the hand but also in order to furnish himself with one of mr princes pocket companions without which he declared it was impossible to go round the university there sir continued he applying himself to me there is another instance of a genius in a bookseller the pocket companion is all mr princes own  not only his own property but his own writing one of your gownsmen indeed has since wrote a new guide  but it will not do  shaking his head  it will not do  much inferior to my friend daniels  we then crossed the way to queens college where bonus as folio called him informed us that the east side of the square had been lately rebuilt and that there had been some squabbles among the fellows folio said the chapel was fine very fine and quoted two lines out of miltons spenseroso for so he termed it about a dim religious light as to mrs folio she declared that nothing in the college pleased her so much as the figure over the door of her majesty in a cage  but that she said was very pretty and she liked it vastly  we then proceeded to all souls and the radcliff library at the first of which places bonus informed us that the common room there was remarkable for the best port in oxford some of the fellows says he have tossed off four bottles of it a day for several years together without doing them any manner of harm folio observed that neither the college library nor the radcliff were as yet half sufficiently stocked and it would be a rare job to have the furnishing them with books mrs folio said that the radcliff was a good deal like st pauls only not half so large or so handsome a queer sort of building maam said young bonus  a mere pepperbox  and there  pointing to the turrets of all souls there are the sugarcasters  this produced an universal laugh which concluded with an exclamation of folios  well said bonus egad i dont think that would be amiss in the new edition of the jokes  we then entered the schools quadrangle where mr folio took upon himself to inform his wife that all the rudiments of learning were taught in that spot here says he my dear pointing there are lectures read every morning  here the students attend the professor of divinity  and here they attend the history professor  and here the poetry professor  and here the professor of physic  and here the professor of civil law  and so on  all learned men that have large salaries on purpose to lecture their pupils in the sciences  ay says mrs folio it is no wonder that they have all so much larning  it is impossible to recount half their observations on the picturegallery the bodleian library the arundel marbles the pomfret collection the clarendon printing house the theater and the museum i can only recollect that mr folio met with an acquaintance among the compositors at the printing house with whom he entered into conversation about the method of printing baskervilles bible without wetting the sheets before they were put to press  and that he supposed a good deal of money might be made of the mss in the bodley  that he compared the museum to don salteros coffeehouse and that mrs folio at going out asked the person who showed the room if there was no waxwork  in the rest of our circuit i remember nothing remarkable except that mrs folio was extremely delighted with the basin and mercury in the center of the great quadrangle at christchurch and told her husband she wished they had just such a one in the middle of their garden at islington  we then returned to the angel and as soon as dinner was ended and the cloth taken away well bonus says folio and what have thou learnt here tell us some of thy studies  come give your mother and me a little touch of the mathematics  bonus being hard pressed was obliged to comply and drawing a kind of figure with his finger in the wine that was spilt on the table uttered very gravely some incoherent jargon about a and b being equal to c and d and parallel lines and equilateral triangles folio and his wife observed him with infinite attention and the most visible delight and as soon as he had done this says folio  this my dear addressing himself to his wife is what we call demonstration sir says bonus i did not think you had so good a notion of the mathematics  child says mrs folio your father has a general knowledge of every thing  not long after i took my leave and could not help reflecting that to people like folio and his wife sights and shows afford but small entertainment and no instruction and that it would be almost sufficient for the gratification of such minds if grand solemnities were to come round like the year of jubilee at rome or the blowing of the aloe not above once in a hundred years  terraefilius number vi friday july        nunc adeo si ob eam rem vobis mea vita invisa est aeschine quia anon justa injusta prorsus omnia omnino

do what you will  but if in those affairs where youth has made you blind eager and thoughtless you will suffer me to counsel and correct  and in due season indulge you  i am at your service colmans terence ladies and gentlemen it is necessary that terraefilius like the senior proctor and other great officers of this university should make an harangue at the time of laying down his office but it gives me infinite concern that on this occasion instead of glorying in so favorable an opportunity to display my merits i am obliged to make it my chief endeavor to wipe off a most infamous aspersion that has been thrown on my character no less than the charge of being a counterfeit and an impostor it is hard for a man on his deathbed to be put upon the proof of the reality of his existence and though i am alive and merry of which i hope you are all fully convinced yet i cannot brook the thought that terraefilius should be accounted a kind of bastard production or as the lawyers term it nullius filius and that it should be in the power of envy or malice to make a blot in my escutcheon i do not doubt however of being able to blazon my title and to prove that i am neither an usurper nor a pretender  it is true indeed that most of my ancestors were the most noted manufacturers of scandal and great wholesale dealers in libel and scandalum magnatum and that in this glorious occupation they nobly sustained all the pains and inconveniences of martyrdom and persecution i must confess that my father was expelled the university for villifying the grave and reverend heads of houses and that my grandfather was expelled the house of commons for libelling the honorable members and reviling the constitution i cannot deny that most part of my family have at diverse times had the honor of being pumped beat and tossed in a blanket that many of them have lain whole months in newgate and stood in the pillory at the royal exchange temple bar and charing cross and that of some i might even justly boast that they were hanged for high treason i must own too that for my own part i nave not trod in the steps of my predecessors and though i am not conscious of any shameful degeneracy yet i have never been on the brink of expulsion for defamation i have not so much as been taken up i never had my house entered at midnight by kings messengers neither i nor my printer can complain of the illegal seizure of our papers or bring actions against the secretaries of state for false imprisonment i never had the pleasure of having my nose slit i have as yet both my ears and have not according to what i have hitherto been able to discover any prospect of dying at tyburn or kenningtoncommon  for these reasons ladies and gentlemen as well as for the manner in which i have conducted myself in my office during the present solemnity i find that some evilminded persons have been induced to consider me and my writings as spurious they say that i have disappointed their expectations they complain that i have offered no affront to the chancellor or any other person of qualaty nor turned the senior part of the university into objects of ridicule for the entertainment of freshmen and undergraduates they confess that at first they were induced to conceive better hopes of me but that it may now be said of me as it is of the month of march that i came in like a lion and go out like a lamb  these and several other circumstances which i cannot pretend to palliate or refute i can however very easily account for a reverend gentleman of exeter college eminent in all parts of europe for his knowledge in hebrew in a late contested election being accused by the opposite party of timeserving very shrewdly answered in vindication of himself and his associates that they did not make the times but the times made them the university borrows its complexion from its patrons and the moon her light from the sun and at a time when there is a general revolution of principles or to invert a little the arrangement of the phrase when revolutionprinciples are general among us is it any wonder that the honest terraefilius should be as changeable as his brethren  i can remember the time and indeed it is but a very little while ago when a place was esteemed at oxford as a badge of corruption and a green coat the livery of servitude i can remember too that a certain great patriot informed the house of commons that oxford was paved with disaffection and jacobitism but now the old true blue is faced according to the courtfashion with green and the red and white roses were not more closely twined together by the union of the houses of york and lancaster than the old and new interest in this county by the coalition and compromise at the late election of lord charles spenser and sir james dashwood we have lived to see the staunch doctor blackstone on the point of being sent to ireland as a judge and honored with a patent of precedence and a silk gown we have lived to see sir francis dashwood created lord le despenser and appointed chancellor of the exchequer and master of the wardrobe sir john phillips it is well known is a privy counselor and our right honorable chancellor is captain of the band of pensioners tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis the tories are all at court and oxonians are made bishops the cocoatree is running a race with arthurs toward the golden goal of st jamess and it is said that at the next meeting of the parliament a bill will be brought in for cleaning lighting and newpaving the streets of oxford by the right honorable mr pit  i may be believed also when i declare upon the word and honor of an author that it is not for want of information or materials that i have not made my paper a chronique scandaleuse a journal of defamation i have received letters sufficient to form a volume anecdotes without number and satires sonnets epigrams and acrosticks by wholesale there is not a toast in the city or environs of oxford of whom i have not had a particular account and there has not been a phaeton and four driven out of oxford this summer or a single excursion to wallingford that has not been faithfully registered in my black book one correspondent has sent me a piece which he calls the secret history of ditchley and another has transmitted an exact detail of all the ceremonies on opening the newlyrepaired church at westwycomb last sunday together with the copy of a carol on the occasion which he tells me was written by paul whitehead and sung over milk punch in the golden ball in short so willing are all to open the sluices of scandal that there is not a corner of the country from which i have not been favored with some curious articles of intelligence with an earnest desire of their being communicated to the public by the channel of my paper so that had i been disposed to sit in judgment upon them care has been taken to provide me a handsome calendar of delinquents  a great number of correspondents have very freely and abundantly communicated their observations on the transactions of the present encaenia some have sent me criticisms on the verses and orations delivered in the theater and others have commented on the voice gesture and deportment of the speakers greatly lamenting that mr sheridan as heretofore was not employed to instruct our young nobility and gentry in the art of elocution one writer affects to be greatly disgusted at the vehemence and frequency of the plaudits of the upper gallery bestowed indiscriminately on the chancellor or a singer dr king or the first fiddle another is much offended that the pieces on this occasion are composed in no other languages than latin or english at such a time as well as in their printed gratulations the members of the university might be expected to show the extent of their learning and we might not only with the most modest expectation have promised ourselves several greek odes after the manner of pindar and occasional pieces of hebrew psalmody but have flattered ourselves with the certain hopes of seeing the elegant figure of mr swinton delivering an oration in etruscan or phoenician  in this place as i am settling the account with my correspondents it is also proper to acknowledge the receipt of several remarks on the present state of the university and hints for its improvement a person who signs himself londinensis laments that the arts of politeness as well as the polite arts are not taught at oxford and proposes that messieurs heart and dukes or at least one of them should be invited down to instruct our grown gentlemen thinking that he might be of as much service to the university and make as brilliant a figure in that art as dr hayes in music on which consideration it might be expedient to appoint him dancing professor another person a facetious clergyman of uncommon parts who dates his letter from lincoln college wishes to see the intended scheme of a ridinghouse to which the profits of the last collection of the clarendon papers were supposed to be appropriated carried into immediate execution he foresees great advantage accruing to the churchmilitant from our doctors in divinty being taught to ride the great horse and does not doubt but that from their acknowledged skill in horsemanship the rector of his own house lincoln college and the president of corpus christi will instantly be appointed joint masters of the ridinghouse and have the sole direction of the manege  i have also received several rough draughts and curious portraits of academical characters with the names for fear of mistake at the bottom of the picture a young buck of christ church has sent me a cutting satire on a severe disciplinarian whose name and additions i do not think proper to mention and a fellow of trinity complains of being forced with several more to lay out an hundred pounds in taking a doctors degree and inveighs most bitterly against tufthunters and a person whom he calls doctor driver  these and several other articles of intelligence extraordinary i have had virtue enough to suppress and think i deserve the public thanks both of the town and university together with some more solid and substantial marks of their favor for my extraordinary moderation the affairs of the corporation are i fear too much perplexed to make me any handsome gratuity but i hope in consideration of my clemency toward them and my tenderness to their wives and daughters at least to have the compliment of my freedom in a gold box with a right of common on portmeadow as to the university i expect on the next public occasion to be presented to an honorary degree and that in the mean time the bursars of the several colleges will have directions to make up a purse for terraefilius  public writers it is well known have often been bought off silenced with a bribe or quieted with a pension when the fears of fine pillory and imprisonment have had no influence over their resolutions and all the terrors of the law have been let loose upon them in vain our own times too will afford examples of writers who after having been disappointed of the expected rewards from the hands of power and munificence have turned from the pleasant path of panegyric and gone upon the highway of satire for my own part being naturally of a benevolent disposition i had rather it should be made worth my while to pursue the smooth turnpikeroad in which i have set out at present being the first of my family who has hot been expelled i am resolved to take my leave in good humor and shall conclude my present course of lectures with the words in which the late worthy bishop of cloyne who had every virtue under heaven and who spent the last part of his life amongst us used often to describe this university  oxford is a fair city situated in a pleasant country adorned with beautiful gardens and magnificent palaces and a place where religion and learning are kept in countenance postscript the worshipful sir john fielding knight and justice of peace for the liberty of westminster having at sundry times not only given occasional hints and cautions from the police but also published useful extracts and clauses from the penal statutes terraefilius in imitation of so great an example thinks proper to subjoin to this paper the following extract from the statutes of the university at the same time exhorting the junior part thereof to a serious perusal of the statute book that they may know the rules which at their matriculation they undertake to obey
