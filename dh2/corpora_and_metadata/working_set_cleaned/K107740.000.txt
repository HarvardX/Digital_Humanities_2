the wanderer a poem in five cantos  by richard savage son of the late earl rivers  nulla mali nova mi facies inopinave surgit virg london printed for j walthoe over against the royal exchange in cornhill      price two shillings  to the right honorable john lord viscount tyrconnel baron charleville and lord brownlowe knight of the bath my lord part of this poem had the honor of your lordships perusal when in manuscript and it was no small pride to me when it met with approbation from so distinguishing a judge should the rest find the like indulgence i shall have no occasion whatever its success may be in the world to repent the labor it has cost me  but my intention is not to pursue a discourse on my own performance no my lord it is to embrace this opportunity of throwing out sentiments that relate to your lordships goodness the generosity of which give me leave to say i have greatly experienced  i offer it not as a new remark that dependence on the great in former times generally terminated in disappointment nay even their bounty if it could be called such was in its very nature ungenerous it was perhaps withheld through an indolent or wilful neglect till those who lingered in the want of it grew almost past the sense of comfort at length it came too often in a manner that half cancelled the obligation and perchance must have been acquired too by some previous act of guilt in the receiver the consequence of which was remorse and infamy  but that i live my lord is a proof that dependence on your lordship and the present ministry is an assurance of success i am persuaded distress in many other instances affects your soul with a compassion that always shows itself in a manner most humane and active that to forgive injuries and confer benefits is your delight and that to deserve your friendship is to deserve the countenance of the best of men to be admitted into the honor of your lordships conversation permit me to speak but justice is to be elegantly introduced into the most instructive as well as entertaining parts of literature it is to be furnished with the finest observations upon human nature and to receive from the most unassuming sweet and winning candor the worthiest and most polite maxims  such as are always enforced by the actions of your own life i could also take notice of your many publickspirited services to your country in parliament and your constant attachment to liberty and the royal illustrious house of our most gracious sovereign but my lord believe me your own deeds are the noblest and fittest orators to speak your praise and will elevate it far beyond the power of a much abler writer than i am  i will therefore turn my view from your lordships virtues to the kind influence of them which has been so lately shed upon me and then if my future morals and writings shall gain any approbation from men of parts and probity i must acknowledge all to be the product of your lordships goodness to me i must in fine say with horace quod spiro and placeo si placeo tuum est   i am with the highest gratitude and veneration  my lord your lordships most dutiful and devoted servant r savage  the wanderer a vision in five cantos canto i fain would my verse tyrconnel boast thy name brownlow at once my subject and my fame oh could that spirit which thy bosom warms whose strength surprises and whose goodness charms that various worth  could that inspire my lays envy should smile and censure learn to praise yet though unequal to a soul like thine a generous soul approaching to divine when blessed beneath such patronage i write great my attempt though hazardous my flight over ample nature i extend my views nature to rural scenes invites the muse she flies all public care all venal strife to try the still compared with active life to prove by these the sons of men may owe the fruits of bliss to bursting clouds of woe that even calamity by thought refined inspirits and adorns the thinking mind come contemplation whose unbounded gaze swift in a glance the course of things surveys who in thyself the various view can find of sea land air and heaven and human kind what tides of passion in the bosom roll what thoughts debase and what exalt the soul whose pencil paints obsequious to thy will all thou surveyst with a creative skill oh leave awhile thy loved sequestered shade awhile in wintry wilds vouchsafe thy aid then waft me to some olive bowry green where clothed in white thou show a mind serene where kind content from noise and court retires and smiling sits while muses tune their lyres where zephyrs gently breathe while sleep profound to their soft fanning nods with poppies crowned sleep on a treasure of bright dreams reclines by thee bestowed whence fancy colored shines and flutters round his brow a hovering flight varying her plumes in visionary light the solar fires now faint and watery burn just where with ice aquarius frets his urn if thawed fullissue from its mouth severe raw clouds that sadden all thinverted year when frost and fire with martial powers engaged frost northward fled the war unequal waged beneath the pole his legions urged their flight and gained a cave profound and wide as night over chearless scenes by desolation owned high on an alp of ice he sits enthroned one claycold hand his crystal beard sustains and sceptered one over wind and tempest reigns over stony magazines of hail that storm the blossomed fruit and flowery spring deform his languid eyes like frozen lakes appear dimgleaming all the light that wanders here his robe snowwrought and hoard with age his breath a nitrous damp that strikes pertific death far hence lies everfreezd the northern main that checks and renders navigation vain that shut against the suns dissolving ray scatters the trembling tides of vanquished day and stretching eastward half the world secures defies discovry and like time endures now frost sent boreal blasts to scourge the air to bind the streams and leave the landscape bare yet when farwest his violence declines though here the brook or lake his power confines to rocky pools to catracts are unknown his chains  to rivers rapid like the rhone the falling moon cast cold a quivering light just silvered over the snow and sunk  pale night retired the dawn in lightgrey mists arose shrill chants the cock  the hungry heifer lows slow blush yon breaking clouds  the suns uprolld thexpansive gray turns azure chased with gold whiteglittring ice changed like the topaz gleams reflecting saffron luster from his beams o contemplation teach me to explore from britain far remote some distant shore from sleep a dream distinct and lively claim clear let the vision strike the morals aim it comes i feel it over my soul serene still morn begins and frost retains the scene hark  the loud horns enlivening notes begun from rock to vale sweetwandring echoes run still floats the sound shrillwinding from afar wild beasts astonished dread the sylvan war spears to the sun in files embattled play march on charge briskly and enjoy the fray swans ducks and geese and the winged winter brood chatter discordant on yon echoing flood at babel thus when heaven the tongue confounds sudden a thousand different jargon sounds like jangling bells harshmingling grate the ear all stare all talk all mean but none cohere mark wiley fowlers meditate their doom and smoky fate speeds thundering through the gloom stopped short they cease in airy rings to fly whirl over and over and fluttering fall and die still fancy wafts me on deceived i stand estranged adventrous on a foreign land wide and more wide extends the scene unknown where shall i turn a wanderer and alone from hilly wilds and depths where snows remain my winding steps up a steep mountain strain emersd atop i mark the hills subside and towers aspire but with inferior pride on this bleak height tall firs with icework crowned bend while their flaky winter shades the ground hoarse and direct a blustering north wind blows on boughs thickrustling crack the crispid snows tangles of frost half fright the wilderd eye by heat often blackened like a lowering sky hence down the side two turbid rivlets pour and devious two in one huge catract roar while pleased the watery progress i pursue yon rocks in rough assemblage rush in view in form an amphitheatre they rise and a dark gulf in their broad center lies there the dimmed sight with dizzy weakness fails and horror over the firmest brain prevails thither these mountainstreams their passage take headlong foam down and form a dreadful lake the lake highswelling so redundant grows from the heaped store derived a river flows which deepning travels through a distant wood and thence emerging meets a sisterflood mingled they flash on a wideopening plain and pass yon city to the farseen main so blend two souls by heaven for union made and strengthening forward lend a mutual aid and prove in every transient turn their aim through finite life to infinite the same nor ends the landscape  ocean to my sight points a blue arm where sailing ships delight in prospect lessened  now new rocks reared high stretch a cross ridge and bar the curious eye there lies obscured the ripening diamonds ray and thence redbranching corals rent away in conic form there gelid crystal grows through such the palacelamp gay luster throws luster which through dim night as various plays as play from yonder snows the changeful rays for nobler use the crystals worth may rise if tubes perspective hem the spotless prize through these the beams of the farlengthend eye measure known stars and new remoter spy hence commerce many a shortened voyage steers shortened to months the hazard once of years hence halleys soul etherial flight essays instructive there from orb to orb she strays sees round new countless suns new systems roll sees god in all and magnifies the whole yon rocky side enriched the summer scene and peasants search with herbs of healthful green now naked pale and comfortless it lies like youth extended cold in deaths disguise there while without the sounding tempest swells incavd secure thexulting eagle dwells and there when nature owns prolific spring spreads over her young a fondling mothers wing swains on the coast the farfamd fish descry that gives the fleecy robe the tyrian dye while shells a scattered ornament bestow the tinctured rivals of the showry bow yon limeless sands loosedriving with the wind in future cauldrons useful texture find till on the furnace thrown the glowing mass brightens and brightning hardens into glass when winter halcyons flickring on the wave tune their complaints yon sea forgets to rave though lashed by storms which naval pride oerturn the foaming deep in sparkles seems to burn loud winds turn zephyrs to enlarge their notes and each safe nest on a calm surface floats now veers the wind full east and keen and sore its cutting influence aches in every pore how weak thy fabric man  a puff thus blown staggers thy strength and echoes to thy groan a tooths minutest nerve let anguish seize swift kindred fibers catch so frail our ease pinched pierced and torn enflamed and unassuagd they smart and swell and throb and shoot enraged from nerve to nerve fierce flies thexulting pain  and are we of this mighty fabric vain now my blood chills scarce through my veins it glides sure on each blast a shivering ague rides warned let me this bleak eminence forsake and to the vale a different winding take half i descend my spirits fast decay a terrass now relieves my weary way close with this stage a precipice combines whence still the spacious country far declines the herds seem insects in the distant glades and men diminished as at noon their shades thick on this top oergrown for walks are seen gray leafless wood and winter greens between the redning berry deeptingd holly shows and matted misleto the white bestows though lost the banquet of autumnal fruits though on broad oaks no vernal umbrage shoots these boughs the silenced shivering songsters seek these foodful berries fill the hungry beak beneath appears a place all outward bare inward the dreary mansion of despair the water of the mountainroad halfstrayd breaks over it wild and falls a brown cascade has nature this rough naked piece designed to hold inhabitant of mortal kind she has approached appears a deep descent which opens in a rock a large extent and hark  its hollow entrance reached i hear a trampling sound of footsteps hastening near a deathlike chillness thwarts my panting breast soft the wished object stands at length confessed of youth his form  but why with anguish bent why pined with sallow marks of discontent yet patience laboring to beguile his care seems to raise hope and smiles away despair compassion in his eye surveys my grief and in his voice invites me to relief preventive of thy call behold my haste he says nor let warm thanks thy spirits waste all fear forget  each portal i possess duty wideopens to receive distress obliged i follow by his guidance led the vaulted roof reechoing to our tread and now in squared divisions i survey chambers sequestered from the glare of day yet needful lights are taught to intervene through rifts each forming a perspective scene in front a parlour meets my entering view opposed a room to sweet refection due here my chilled veins are warmed by chippy fires through the bored rock above the smoke expires neat over a homely board a napkins spread crowned with a heapy canister of bread a maple cup is next dispatched to bring the comfort of the salutary spring nor mourn we absent blessings of the vine here laughs a frugal bowl of rosy wine and savry cates upon clear embers cast lie hissing till snatched off a rich repast soon leap my spirits with enlivened power and in gay converse glides the feastful hour the hermit thus thou wonderst at thy fare on me yon city kind bestows her care meat for keen famine and the generous juice that warms chilled life her charities produce accept without reward unasked twas mine here what thy health requires as free be thine hence learn that god who in the time of need in frozen deserts can the raven feed wellsought will delegate some pitying breast his second means to succor man distressed he paused deep thought upon his aspect gloomd then he with smile humane his voice resumed i am just informed and laugh me not to scorn by one unseen by thee you are englishborn of england i  to me the british state rises in dear memorial ever great here stand we conscious  diffidence suspend free flow our words  did never thy muse extend to grots where contemplation smiles serene where angels visit and where joys convene to groves where more than mortal voices rise catch the rapt soul and waft it to the skies this cave  yon walks  but ever i more unfold what artful scenes thy eyes shall here behold think subjects of my toil nor wondering gaze what cannot industry completely raise be the whole earth in one great landscape found by industry is all with beauty crowned he he alone explores the mine for gain hues the hard rock or harrows up the plain he forms the sword to smite he sheaths the steel draws health from herbs and shows the balm to heal or with loomd wool the native robe supplies or bids young plants in future forests rise or fells the monarch oak which borne away shall with new grace the distant ocean sway hence golden commerce views her wealth increase the blissful child of liberty and peace he scoops the stubborn alps and still employed fills with soft fertile mold the steril void slopd up white rocks small yellow harvests grow and green on terrassd stages vineyards blow by him fall mountains to a level space an isthmus sinks and sunderd seas embrace he founds a city on the naked shore and desolation starves the tract no more from the wild waves he won the belgic land where wide they foamed her towns and trafficks stand he cleared manured enlarged the furtive ground and firms the conquest with his fenceful mound even mid the watery world his venice rose each fabric there as pleasures seat he shows there marts sports councils are for action sought landscapes for health and solitude for thought what wonder then i by his potent aid a mansion in a barren mountain made part thou have viewed  if further we explore let industry deserve applause the more no frowning care yon blessed apartment sees there sleep retires and finds a couch of ease kind dreams that fly remorse and pampered wealth there shed the smiles of innocence and health mark  here descends a grot delightful seat which warms even winter tempers summers heat see  gurgling from a top a spring distills in mournful measures wind the dripping rills soft cooes of distant doves received around in soothing mixture swell the watery sound and hence the streamlets seek the terrass shade within without alike to all conveyed pass on  new scenes by my creative power invite reflections sweet and solemn hour we entered where in wellrangd order stood the instructive volumes of the wise and good these friends said he though i desert mankind good angels never would permit behind each genius youth conceals or time displays i know each work some seraph here conveys retirement thus presents my searchful thought what heaven inspired and what the muse has taught what young satiric and sublime has writ whose life is virtue and whose muse is wit rapt i foresee thy author of a poem called the excursion mallets early aim shine in full worth and shoot at length to fame sweet fancys bloom in fentons lay appears and the ripe judgment of instructive years in hill is all that generous souls revere to virtue and the muse for ever dear and thomson in this praise thy merit see the tongue that praises merit praises thee these scorn said i the versewright of their age vain of a labored languid useless page to whose dim faculty the meaning song is glaring or obscure when clear and strong who in cant phrases gives a work disgrace his wit an odness of his tone and face let the weak malice nursed to an essay in some low libel a mean heart display those who once praised now undeceived despise it lives contemned a day then harmless dies or should some nobler bard their worth unpraise deserting morals that adorn his lays alas too often each science shows the same the great grow jealous of a greater name ye bards the frailty mourn yet brave the shock has not a stillingfleet opposed a lock oh still proceed with sacred rapture fired unenvied had ye lived if unadmird let envy he replied allireful rise envy pursues alone the brave and wise maro and socrates inspire her pain and pope the monarch of the tuneful train to whom be natures and britannias praise all their bright honors rush into his lays and all that glorious warmth his lays reveal which only poets kings and patriots feel though gay as mirth as curious thought sedate as elegance polite as power elate profound as reason and as justice clear soft as compassion yet as truth severe as bounty copious as persuasion sweet like nature various and like art complete so fine her morals so sublime her views his life is almost equaled by his muse o pope  since envy is decreed by fate since she pursues alone the wise and great in one small emblematic landscape see how vast a distance twixt thy foe and thee truth from an eminence surveys our scene a hill where all is clear and all serene rude earthbred storms over meaner valleys blow and wandering mists roll blackning far below dark and debased like them is envys aim and clear and eminent like truth thy fame thus i from what dire cause can envy spring or why embosom we a vipers sting it is envy stings our darling passion pride alas the man of mighty soul replied why choose we misries most derive their birth from one bad source we dread superior worth preferred it seems a satire on our own then heedless to excel we meanly moan then we abstract our views and envy show whence springs the misery pride is doomed to know thus folly pain creates by wisdoms power we shun the weight of many a restless hour  lo i meet wrong perhaps the wrong i feel tends by the scheme of things to public weal i of the whole am part  the joy men see must circulate and so revolve to me why should i then of private loss complain of loss that proves perchance a brothers gain the wind that binds one bark within the bay may waft a richer freight its wished for way if rains redundant flood the abject ground mountains are but supplied when vales are drowned if with soft moisture swelled the vale looks gay the verdure of the mountain fades away shall clouds but at my welfares call descend shall gravity for me her laws suspend for me shall suns their noontide course forbear or motion not subsist to influence air let the means vary be they frost or flame thy end o nature still remains the same be this the motive of a wise mans care to shun deserving ills and learn to bear the end of the first canto the wanderer a vision canto ii while thus a mind humane and wise he shows alleloquent of truth his language flows youth though depressed through all his form appears through all his sentiments the depth of years thus he  yet farther industry behold which conscious waits new wonders to unfold enter my chapel next  lo here begin the hallowed rites that check the growth of sin when first we met how soon you seemed to know my bosom laboring with the throbs of woe such racking throbs  soft when i rouse those cares on my chilled mind pale recollection glares when moping frenzy strove my thoughts to sway here prudent labors chased her power away full and roughrising from yon sculptured wall bold prophets nations to repentance call meek martyrs smile in flames gored champions groan and muselike cherubs tune their harps in stone next shadowed light a rounding force bestows swells into life and speaking action grows here pleasing melancholy subjects find to calm amuse exalt the pensive mind this figure tender grief like mine implies and semblant thoughts that earthly pomp despise such penitential magdalene reveals looseveild in negligence of charms she kneels though dress nearstord its vanity supplies the vanity of dress unheeded lies the sinful world in sorrowing eye she keeps as over jerusalem messiah weeps one hand her bosom smites in one appears the lifted lawn that drinks her falling tears since evil outweighs good and sways mankind true fortitude assumes the patient mind such proved messiahs though to suffering born to penury repulse reproach and scorn here by the pencil mark his flight designed the wearied virgin by a stream reclined who feeds the child her looks a charm express a modest charm that dignifies distress boughs over their heads with blushing fruits depend which angels to her busied consort bend hence by the smiling infant seems discerned trifles concerning him all heaven concerned here the transfigurd son from earth retires see the white form in a bright cloud aspires full on his follwers bursts a flood of rays prostrate they fall beneath the oerwhelming blaze like noontide summersuns the rays appear unsuffrable magnificent and near what scene of agony the garden brings the cup of gall the suppliant king of kings the crown of thorns the cross that felt him die these languid in the sketch unfinished lie there from the dead centurions see him rise see but struck down with horrible surprise as the first glory seemed a sun at noon this casts the silver splendour of the moon here peopled day thascending god surveys the glory varies as the myriads gaze now softened like a sun at distance seen when through a cloud brightglancing yet serene now fastencreasing to the crowd amazed like some vast meteor high in either raised my labor yon highvaulted altar stains with dies that emulate etherial plains the unequal glass which in that opening glows mid circling rays a pictured savior shows bright it collects the beams which trembling all back from the god a showry radiance fall lightning the scene beneath a scene divine where saints clouds seraphs intermingled shine here waterfalls that play melodious round like a sweet organ swell a lofty sound the solemn notes bid earthly passions fly lull all my cares and lift my soul on high this monumental marble  this i rear to one  oh ever mourned  oh ever dear he stopped  pathetic sighs the pause supply and the prompt tear starts quivering on his eye i looked  two columns near the wall were seen an imagd beauty stretched at length between near the wept fair her harp cecilia strung leaning from high a listening angel hung friendship whose figure at the feet remains a phoenix with irradiate crest sustains this graced one palm while one extends timpart two foreign hands that clasp a burning heart a pendent veil two hovering seraphs raise which opening heaven upon the roof displays and two benevolent lessdistant hold a vase collective of perfumes uprolld these from the heart by friendship held arise odorous as incense gathering in the skies in the fond pelican is love expressed who opens to her young her tender breast two mated turtles hovering hang in air one by a faulcon struck  in wild despair the hermit cries  so death alas destroys the tender consort of my cares and joys again soft tears upon his eyelid hung again checked sounds died fluttering on his tongue too well his pining inmost thought i know too well even silence tells the storyd woe to his my sighs to his my tears reply i stray over all the tomb a watery eye next on the wall her scenes of life i gazed the form backleaning by a globe halfraisd cherubs a proffered crown of glory show eyed wistful by the admiring fair below in action eloquent disposed her hands one shows her breast in rapture one expands this the fond hermit seized  over all his soul the soft wild wailing amorous rassion stole in steadfast gaze his eyes her aspect keep then turn away awhile dejected weep then he reverts em but reverts in vain dimmed with the swelling grief that streams again where now is my philosophy he cries my joy hope reason my olympia dies why did i ever that prime of blessings know was it ye cruel fates tim bitter woe why would your bolts not level first my head why must i live to weep olympia dead  sir i had once a wife fair bloomed her youth her form was beauty and her soul was truth oh she was dear  how dear what words can say she dies  my heaven at once is snatched away ah what avails that by a fathers care i rose a wealthy and illustrious heir that early in my youth i learned to prove the instructive pleasing academic grove that in the senate eloquence was mine that valor gave me in the field to shine that love showered blessings too  far more than all highrapt ambition ever could happy call ah  what are thief which even the wise adore lost is my pride  olympia is no more had i ye persecuting powers been born the worlds cold pity or at best its scorn of wealth of rank of kindred warmth bereft to want to shame to ruthless censure left patience or pride to this relief supplies but a lost wife  there there distraction lies now three sad years i yield me all to grief and fly the hated comfort of relief though rich great young i leave a pompous seat my brothers now to seek some dark retreat mid cloistered solitary tombs i stray despair and horror lead the chearless way my sorrow grows to such a wild excess life injured life must wish the passion less olympia  my olympias lost i cry olympias lost the hollow vaults reply louder i make my lamentable moan the swelling echoes learn like me to groan the ghosts to scream as through lone isles they sweep the shrines to shudder and the saints to weep now grief and rage by gathering sighs suppressed swell my full heart and heave my laboring breast with struggling starts each vital string they strain and strike the tottering fabric of my brain over my sunk spirits frowns a vapry scene woes dark retreat the madding maze of spleen a deep damp gloom oerspreads the murky cell here pining thoughts and secret terrors dwell here learn the great unreal wants to feign unpleasing truths here mortify the vain here learning blinded first and then beguiled looks dark as ignorance as frenzy wild here first credulity on reason won and here false zeal mysterious rants begun here love impearls each moment with a tear and superstition owes to spleen her fear fantastic lightnings through the dreary way in swift short signals flash the bursting day above beneath across around they fly a dire deception strikes the mental eye by the blue fires pale phantoms grin severe shrillfancied echoes wound the affrighted ear airbanishd spirits flag in fogs profound and allobscene shed baneful damps around now whispers trembling in some feeble wind sigh out prophetic fears and freeze the mind loud laughs the hag  she mocks complaint away unroofs the den and lets in more than day swarms of wild fancies winged in various flight seek emblematic shades and mystic light some drive with rapid steeds the shining car these nod from thrones those thunder in the war till tired they turn from the delusive show start from wild joy and fix in stupid woe here the lone hour a blank of life displays till now bad thoughts a fiend more active raise a fiend in evil moments ever nigh death in her hand and frenzy in her eye her eye all red and sunk  a robe she wore with lifes calamities embroidered over a mirror in one hand collective shows varied and multiplied that group of woes this endless foe to generous toil and pain lolls on a couch for ease but lolls in vain she muses over her woeembroiderd vest and selfabhorrence heightens in her breast to shun her care the force of sleep she tries still wakes her mind though slumbers doze her eyes she dreams starts rises stalks from place to place with restless thoughtful interrupted pace now eyes the sun and curses every ray now the green ground where color fades away dim specter dance again her eye she rears then from the bloodshot ball wipes purpled tears then presses hard her brow with mischief fraught her brow half bursts with agony of thought from me she cries pale wretch thy comfort claim born of despair and suicide my name why should thy life a moments pain endure here every object proffers grief a cure she points where leaves of hemlock blackning shoot fear not pluck eat said she the sovereign root then death reversed shall bear his ebon lance soft over thy sight shall swim the shadowy trance or leap yon rock possess a watery grave and leave wild sorrow to the wind and wave or mark  this poniard thus from misery frees she wounds her breast  the guilty steel i seize straight where she struck a smoking spring of gore wells from the wound and floats the crimsoned floor she faints she fades  calm thoughts the deed revolve and now unstartling fix the dire resolve death drops his terrors and with charming wiles winning and kind like my olympia smiles he points the passage to the seats divine where poets heroes sainted lovers shine i come olympia  my reared arm extends half to my breast the threatening point descends straight thunder rocks the land new lightnings play nor tempt the vengeance of an angry god nor tempt the vengeance of an angry god nor tempt the vengeance of an angry god flyst thou from providence for vain relief such illsought ease shall draw avenging grief honor the more obstructed stronger shines and zeal by persecutions rage refines by woe the soul to daring action swells by woe in plaintless patience it excels from patience prudent clear experience springs and traces knowledge through the course of things thence hope is formed thence fortitude success renown  whatever men covet and caress the vanished fiend thus sent a hollow voice would thou be happy straight be death thy choice how mean are those who passively complain while active souls more free their fetters strain though knowledge thine hope fortitude success renown  whatever men covet and caress on earth success must in its turn give way and even perfection introduce decay never the world of spirits thus  their rest untouched entire  once happy ever blessed earnest the heavenly voice responsive cries oh listen not to subtilty unwise thy guardian saint who mourns thy hapless fate heaven grants to prop thy virtue ere too late know if thou will thy dearlovd wife deplore olympia waits thee on a foreign shore there in a cell thy last remains be spent away deceive despair and find content i heard obeyed nor more of fate complained long seas i measured and this mountain gained soon to a yawning rift chance turned my way a den it proved where a huge serpent lay flameeyd he lay  he rages now for food meets my first glance and meditates my blood his bulk in many a gathered orb uprolld rears spire on spire his scales bedropt with gold shine burnished in the sun such height they gain they dart green luster on the distant main now writhed in dreadful slope he stoops his crest furious to fix on my unshielded breast just as he springs my sabre smites the foe headless he falls beneath the unerring blow wrath yet remains though strength his fabric leaves and the meant hiss the gasping mouth deceives the lengthening trunk slowloosens every fold lingers in life then stretches stiff and cold just as the invetrate son of mischief ends comes a white dove and near the spot descends i hail this omen all bad passions cease like the slain snake and all within is peace next to religion this plain roof i raise in duteous rites my hallowed tapers blaze i bid due incense on my altar smoke then at this tomb my promised love invoke she hears  she comes  my heart what raptures warm all my olympia sparkles in the form no pale wan livid mark of death she bears each roseate look a quickening transport wears a robe of light highwrought her shape invests unzond the swelling beauty of her breasts her auburn hair each flowing ring resumes in her fair hand loves branch of myrtle blooms silent awhile each wellknown charm i trace then thus while nearer she avoids the embrace thou dear deceit  must i a shade pursue dazzled i gaze  thou swimst before my view dipped in etherial dews her bough divine sprinkles my eyes which strengthened bear the shine still thus i urge for still the shadowy bliss shuns the warm grasp nor yields the tender kiss oh fly not  fade not listen to loves call she lives  no more i am man  i am spirit all then let me snatch thee  press thee  take me whole oh close  yet closer  closer to my soul twice round her waist my eager arms entwined and twice deceived my frenzy clasped the wind then thus i raved  behold thy husband kneel and judge o judge what agonies i feel oh be no longer if unkind thus fair take horrors shape and fright me to despair rather than thus unpitying see my moan far rather frown and fix me here in stone but mock not thus  alas the charmer said smiling and in her smile soft radiance played alas no more eluded strength employ to clasp a shade  what more is mortal joy mans bliss is like his knowledge but surmisd one ignorance the other pain disguised thou were had all thy wish been still possessed supreamly cursed from being greatly blessed for oh so fair so dear was i to thee thou had forgot thy god to worship me this he foresaw and snatched me to the tomb above i flourish in unfading bloom think me not lost for thee i heaven implore thy guardian angel though a wife no more i when abstracted from this world you seem hint the pure thought and frame the heavenly dream close at thy side when morning streaks the air in musicks voice i wake thy mind to prayer by me thy hymns like purest incense rise fragrant with grace and pleasing to the skies and when that form shall from its clay refine that only bar betwixt my soul and thine when thy loved spirit mounts to realms of light then shall olympia aid thy earliest flight mingled well flame in raptures that aspire beyond all youth all sense and all desire she ended still such sweetness dwells behind the enchanting voice still warbles in my mind but lo the unbodied vision fleets away   stay my olympia  i conjure thee stay yet stay  for thee my memory learns to smart sure every vein contains a bleeding heart sooner shall splendour leave the blaze of day than love so pure so vast as mine decay from the same heavenly source its luster came and glows immortal with congenial flame ah  let me not with fires neglected burn sweet mistress of my soul return return alas  she is fled  i traverse now the place where my enamored thoughts her footsteps trace now over the tomb i bend my drooping head there tears the eloquence of sorrow shed sighs choke my words unable to express the pangs the throbs of speechless tenderness not with more ardent more transparent flame call dying saints on their creators name than i on here is  but through yon yielding door glides a new phantom over the illumined floor the roof swiftkindles from the beaming ground and floods of living luster flame around in all the majesty of light arrayed awful it shines  it is catos honored shade as i the heavenly visitant pursue sublimer glory opens to my view he speaks  but oh what words shall dare repeat his thoughts  they leave me fired with patriot heat more than poetic raptures now i feel and own that godlike passion public zeal but from my frailty it receives a stain i grow unlike my great inspirer vain and burn once more the busy world to know and would in scenes of action foremost glow where proud ambition points her dazzling rays where coronets and crowns attractive blaze when my olympia leaves the realms above and lures me back to solitary love she tells me truth prefers an humble state that genuine greatness shuns the being great that mean are those who falsetermd honor prize whose fabrics from their countrys ruins rise who look the traitor like the patriot fair who to enjoy the vineyard wrong the heir i hear  through all my veins new transports roll i gaze  warm love comes rushing on my soul ravished i gaze  again her charms decay again my manhood to my grief gives way cato returns  zeal takes her course to reign but zeal is in ambition lost again i am now the slave of fondness  now of pride  by turns they conquer and by turns subside these balanced each by each the golden mean betwixt em found gives happiness serene this i will enjoy  he ended  i replied o hermit thou art worth severely tried but had not innate grief produced thy woes men barbarous men had preyed on thy repose when seeking joy we seldom sorrow miss and often misery points the path to bliss the soil most worthy of the thrifty swain is wounded thus ever trusted with the grain the struggling grain must work obscure its way ever the first green springs upward to the day upsprung such weedlike coarseness it betrays flocks on the abandoned blade permissive graze then shoots the wealth from imperfection clear and thus a grateful harvest crowns the year the end of the second canto the wanderer a vision canto iii thus free our social time from morning flows till rising shades attempt the day to close thus my new friend behold the lights decay back to yon city let me point thy way southwest behind yon hill the sloping sun to oceans verge his fluent course has run his parting eyes a watery radiance shed glance through the vale and tip the mountains

breathing music moves the circling dance here the bold youth in deeds adventrous glow skimming in rapid sleds the crackling snow not when tidides won the funeral race shot his light car along in swifter pace here the glazed way with iron feet they dare and glide wellpoisd like mercuries in air there crowds with stable tread and levelled eye lift and dismiss the quoits that whirling fly with

melody pursues while the softmurmring amorous wooddove cooes and when in spring these melting mixtures flow the cuckoo sends her unison of woe but as smooth seas are surrowd by a storm as troubles all

hermit if here with pity we reflect how must we grieve when learning meets neglect when godlike souls endure a mean restraint when generous will is curbed by tyrant want he truly feels what to distress belongs who to his private adds a peoples wrongs merits a mark at which disgrace is thrown and every injured virtue is his own such their own pangs with patience here endure yet there weep wounds they are denied to cure thus rich in poverty thus humbly great and though depressed superior to their fate minions in power and misers mid their store are mean in greatness and in plenty poor

beauties heightened by the sun in colored lanes along the furrows run there the next produce of a genial shower the bean freshblossoms in a speckled flower whose morning dews when to the sun resigned

their down as flocks their fleeces leave here worms for man their glossy entrails weave hence to adorn the fair in texture gay sprigs fruits and flowers on figured vestments play but industry prepares them often to please the guilty pride of vain luxuriant ease now frequent dusty gales offensive blow and over my sight a transient blindness throw windward we shift near down thetherial steep the lamp of day hangs hovering over the deep dun shades in rocky shapes up either rolled project long shaggy points deeptingd with gold others take faint thunripend cherrys die and paint amusing landscapes on the eye there blueveild yellow through a sky serene in swelling mixture forms a floating green streaked through white clouds a mild vermilion shines and the breeze freshens as the heat declines yon crooked sunny roads change rising views from brown to sandyred and chalky hues one mingled scene another quick succeeds men chariots teams yoked steers and prancing steeds which climb descend and as loud whips resound stretch sweat and smoke along unequal ground on winding thames reflecting radiant beams when boats ships barges mark the roughend streams this way and that they different points pursue so mix the motions and so shifts the view while thus we throw around our gladdend eyes the gifts of heaven in gay profusion rise trees rich with gums and fruits with jewels rocks plains with flowers herbs and plants and beeves and flocks mountains with mines with oak and cedar woods quarries with marble and with fish the floods in darkning spots mid fields of various dies tilth newmanurd or naked fallow lies near uplands fertile pride enclosed display the green grass yellowing into scentful hay and thickset hedges sense the fulleard corn and berries blacken on the virid thorn mark in yon heath opposed the cultured scene wild thyme pale box and firs of darker green the native strawberry redripening grows by nettles guarded as by thorns the rose there nightingales in unprund copses build in shaggy furzes lies the hare concealed twixt ferns and thistles unsown flowers amuse and form a lucid chase of various hues many halfgrey with dust confused they lie scent the rich year and lead the wandering eye contemplative we tread the flowery plain the muse preceding with her heavenly train when lo the mendicant so late behind strange view now journeying in our front we find and yet a view more strange our heed demands touched by the muses wand transformed he stands over skin latewrinkled instant beauty spreads the latedimmd eye a vivid luster sheds hairs once so thin now graceful locks decline and rags now changed in regal vestments shine the hermit thus in him the bard behold once seen by midnights lamp in winters cold the bard whose want so multiplied his woes he sunk a mortal and a seraph rose see  where those stately yewtrees darkling grow and waving over yon graves brown horrors throw scornful he points  there over his sacred dust arise the sculptured tomb and labored bust vain pomp bestowed by ostentatious pride who to a life of want relief denied but thus the bard are these the gifts of state gifts unreceivd  these ye ungenrous great how was i treated when in life forlorn my claim your pity but my lot your scorn why were my studious hours opposed by need in me did poverty from guilt proceed did i contemporary authors wrong and deem their worth but as they prized my song did i sooth vice or venal strokes betray in the lowpurposd loud polemic fray did ever my verse immodest warmth contain or once licentious heavenly truths profane never  and yet when envy sunk my name who called my shadowed merit into fame when undeserved a prisons grate i saw what hand redeemed me from the wrested law who clothed me naked or when hungry fed why crushed the living why extolled the dead but foreign languages adopt my lays and distant nations shame you into praise why should unrelishd wit these honors cause custom not knowledge dictates your applause or think you thus a selfrenown to raise and mingle your vainglories with my bays be yours the mouldering tomb be mine the lay immortal  thus he scoffs the pomp away though words like these unlettered pride impeach to the meek heart he turns with milder speech though now a seraph often he deigns to wear the face of human friendship often of care to walk disguised an object of relief a learned good man long exercised in grief forlorn a friendless orphan often to roam craving some kind some hospitable home or like ulysses a low lazar stand beseeching pitys eye and bountys hand or like ulysses royal aid request wandering from court to court a king distressed thus varying shapes the seeming son of woe eyes the cold heart and hearts that generous glow then to the muse relates each lordly name who deals impartial infamy and fame often as when man in mortal state depressed his lays taught virtue which his life confessed he now forms visionary scenes below inspiring patience in the heart of

revenge inspired the third o mammon was thy meaner slave thou idol seldom of the great and brave florio whose life was one continued feast his wealth diminished and his debts increased vain pomp and equipage his low desires who never to intellectual bliss aspires he to repair by vice what vice has broke durst with bold treasons judgments rod provoke his strength of mind by luxry halfdissolvd ill brooks the woe where deep he stands involved he weeps stamps wild and to and fro now flies now wrings his hands and sends unmanly cries arraigns his judge affirms unjust he bleeds and now recants and now for mercy pleads now blames associates raves with inward strife upbraids himself then thinks alone on life he rolls redswelling tearful eyes around sore smites his breast and sinks upon the ground he wails he quite desponds convulsive lies shrinks from the fancied ax and thinks he dies revives with hope enquires stops short with fear entreats even flattery nor the worst will hear the worst alas his doom  what friend replies each speaks with shaking head and downcast eyes one silence breaks then pauses drops a tear nor hope affords nor quite confirms his fear but what kind friendship part reserves unknown comes thundering in his keepers surly tone enough  struck through and through in ghastly stare he stands transfixt the statue of despair nor ought of life nor ought of death he knows till thought returns and brings return of woes now pours a storm of grief in gushing streams that past  collected in himself he seems and with forced smile retires  his latent thought dark horrid as the prisons dismal vault if with himself at variance everwild with angry heaven how stands he reconciled no penitential orisons arise nay he obtests the justice of the skies not for his guilt for sentenced life he moans his chains roughclanking to discordant groans to bars harshgrating heavycreaking doors hoarseechoing walls and hollowringing floors to thoughts more dissonant far far less kind one anarchy one chaos of the mind at length fatigued with grief on earth he lies but soon as sleep weighs down the unwilling eyes glad liberty appears no damps annoy treason succeeds and all transforms to joy proud palaces their glittering stores display gain he pursues and rapine leads the way what gold what gems  he strains to seize the prize quick from his touch dissolved a cloud it flies conscious he cries  and must i wake to weep ah yet return return delusive sleep sleep comes but liberty no more  unkind the dungeonglooms hang heavy on his mind shrill winds are heard and howling demons call wideflying portals seem unhinged to fall then close with sudden claps a dreadful din he starts wakes storms and all is hell within his genius flies  reflects he now on prayer alas bad spirits turn those thoughts to air what shall he next what straight relinquish breath to bar a public just though shameful death rash horrid thought yet now afraid to live murderous he strikes  may heaven the deed forgive why had he thus false spirit to rebel and why not fortitude to suffer well were his success how terrible the blow and its recoil on him eternal woe heaven this affliction then for mercy meant that a good end might close a life misspent where no kind lips the hallowed dirge resound far from the compass of yon sacred ground full in the center of three meeting ways staked through he lies  warned let the wicked gaze near yonder fane where misery sleeps in peace whose spire fastlessens as these shades increase left to the north whence often brewed tempests roll tempests dire emblems cosmo of thy soul there mark that cosmo much for guile renowned his grave by unbid plants of poison crowned when out of power through him the public good so strong his factious tribe suspended stood in power vindictive actions were his aim and patriots perished by the ungenerous flame if the best cause he in the senate chose even right in him from some wrong motive rose the bad he loathed and would the weak despise yet courted for dark ends and shunned the wise when ill his purpose eloquent his strain his malice had a look and voice humane his smile the signal of some vile intent a private poniard or empoisond scent proud yet to popular applause a slave no friend he honored and no foe forgave his boons unfrequent or unjust to need the hire of guilt of infamy the meed but if they chanced on learned worth to fall bounty in him was ostentation all no true benevolence his thought sublimes his noblest actions are illustrious crimes fine parts which virtue might have ranked with fame enhance his guilt and magnify his shame when parts and probity in man combine in wisdoms eye how charming must he shine let him less happy truth at least impart and what he wants in genius bear in heart cosmo as death draws nigh no more conceals that storm of passions which his nature feels he feels much fear more anger and most pride but pride and anger make all fear subside dauntless he meets at length untimely fate a desperate spirit rather fierce than great darkling he glides along the dreary coast a sullen wandering selftormenting ghost where veiny marble dignifies the ground with emblem fair in sculpture rising round just where a crossing lengthening isle we find full east whence god returns to judge mankind oncelovd horatio sleeps a mind elate lamented shade ambition was thy fate even angels wondering often his worth surveyed behold a man like one of us they said straight heard the furies and with envy glard and to precipitate his fall prepared first avarice came in vain selflove she pressed the poor he pitied still and still redressed learning was his and knowledge to commend of arts a patron and of want a friend next came revenge but her essay how vain nor hate nor envy in his heart remain no previous malice could his mind engage malice the mother of vindictive rage no  from his life his foes might learn to live he held it still a triumph to forgive at length ambition urged his countrys weal assuming the fair look of public zeal still in his breast so generous glowed the flame the vice when there a virtue half became his pitying eye saw millions in distress he deemed it godlike to have power to bless thus when unguarded treason stained him over and virtue and content were then no more but when to death by rigrous justice doomed his genuine spirit saintlike state resumed often from soft penitence distilled a tear often hope in heavenly mercy lightened fear often would a drop from struggling nature fall and then a smile of patience brighten all he seeks in heaven a friend nor seeks in vain his guardian angel swift descends again and resolution thus bespeaks a mind not scorning life yet all to death resigned  ye chains fit only to restrain the will of common desperate veterans in ill though rankling on my limbs ye lie declare did ever my rising soul your pressure wear no  free as liberty and quick as light to worlds remote she takes unbounded flight ye dungeonglooms that dim corporeal eyes could ye once blot her prospect of the skies no  from her clearer sight ye fled away like error pierced by truths resistless ray ye walls that witness my repentant moan ye echoes that to midnight sorrows groan do i in wrath to you of fate complain or once betray fears most inglorious pain no  hail twice hail then ignominious death behold how willing glides my parting breath far greater better far  ay sar indeed like me have suffered and like me will bleed apostles patriarchs prophets martyrs all like me once fell nor murmured at their fall shall i whose days at best no ill designed whose virtue shone not though i loved mankind shall i now guilty wretch shall i repine ah no to justice let me life resign quick as a friend would i embrace my foe he taught me patience who first taught me woe but friends are foes they render woe severe for me they wail from me extort the tear not those yetabsent missive griefs control these periods weep those rave and these condole at entrance shrieks a friend with pale surprise another panting prostrate speechless lies one gripes my hand one sobs upon my breast ah who can bear  it shocks it murders rest and is it yours alas my friends to feel and is it mine to comfort mine to heal is mine the patience yours the bosomstrife ah would rash love lure back my thoughts to life adieu dear dangerous mourners swift depart ah fly me fly  i tear ye from my heart ye saints whom fears of death could never control in my last hour compose support my soul see my blood wash repented sin away receive receive me to eternal day with words like these the destined hero dies while angels waft his soul to happier skies distinction now gives way yet on we talk full darkness deepning over the formless walk night treads not with light step the dewy gale nor brightdistends her starembroiderd veil her leaden feet inclement damps distill clouds shut her face black winds her vesture fill an earthborn meteor lights the sable skies eastward it shoots and sunk forgotten dies so pride that rose from dust to guilty power glares out in vain so dust shall pride devour fishers who yonder brink by torches gain with teethful tridents strike the scaly train like snakes in eagles claws in vain they strive when heaved aloft and quivering yetalive while here methought our time in converse passed the moon clouds muffld and the night wore fast at prowling wolves was heard the mastiffs bay and the warned masters arms forbad the prey thus treason steals the patriot thus descries forthsprings the monarch and the mischief flies pale glowworms glimmerd through the depth of night scattering like hope through fear a doubtful light lone philomela tuned the silent grove with pensive pleasure listened wakeful love halfdreaming fancy formed an angels tongue and pain forgot to groan so sweet she sung the nightcrone with the melody alarmed now paused now listened and awhile was charmed but like the man whose frequentstubborn will resists what kind seraphic sounds instill her heart the loveinspiring voice repelled her breast with agitating mischief swelled which closed her ear and tempted to destroy the tuneful life that charms with virtuous joy now fast we measure back the trackless way no friendly stars directive beams display but lo  a thousand lights shoot instant rays yon kindling rock reflects the startling blaze i stand astonished  thus the hermit cries fear not but listen with enlarged surprise still must these hours our mutual converse claim and cease to echo still olympias name grots rivlets groves olympias name forget olympia now no sighing winds repeat can i be mortal and those hours no more those amorous hours that plaintive echos bore am i the same ah no  behold a mind unruffld firm exalted and refined late months that made the vernal season gay saw my health languish off in pale decay no racking pain yet gave disease a date no sad presageful thought preluded fate yet numbered were my days  my destined end near and more near  nay every fear suspend i passed a weary lingering sleepless night then rose to walk in mornings earliest light but few my steps  a faint and chearless few refreshment from my flagging spirits flew when lo retired beneath a cypress shade my limbs upon a flowery bank i laid soon by softcreeping murmuring winds composed a slumber pressed my languid eyes  they closed but closed not long  methought olympia spoke thrice loud she called and thrice the slumber broke i waked forthgliding from a neighboring wood full in my view the shadwy charmer stood rapturous i started up to clasp the shade but staggered fell and found my vitals fade a mantling chilness over my bosom spread as if that instant numbered with the dead her voice now sent a far imperfect sound when in a swimming trance my pangs were drowned still farther off she called  with soft surprise i turned  but void of strength and aid to rise short shorter shorter yet my breath i drew then up my struggling soul unburthend flew thus from a state where sin and grief abide heaven summoned me to mercy  thus i died he said the astonishment with which i start like bolted ice runs shivering through my heart art thou not mortal then i cried but lo his raiment lightens and his features glow in shady ringlets falls a length of hair embloomd his aspect shines enlarged his air mild from his eyes enlivening glories beam mild on his brow sits majesty supreme bright plumes of every die that round him flow vest robe and wings in varied luster show he looks and forward steps with mien divine a grace celestial gives him all to shine he speaks  nature is ravished at the sound the forests move and streams stand listening round thus he as incorruption i assumed as instant in immortal youth i bloomed renewed and changed i felt my vital springs with different lights discerned the form of things to earth my passions fell like mists away and reason opened in eternal day swifter than thought from world to world i flew celestial knowledge shone in every view my food was truth  what transport could i miss my prospect all infinitude of bliss olympia met me first and smiling gay onward to mercy led the shining way as far transcendant to her wonted air as her dear wonted self to many a fair in voice and form beauty more beauteous shows and harmony still more harmonious grows she points out souls who taught me friendships charms they gaze they glow they spring into my arms wellpleased high ancestors my view command patrons and patriots all a glorious band horatio too by wellborne fate refined shone out whiterobd with saints a spotless mind what once below ambition made him miss humility here gained a life of bliss though late let sinners then from sin depart heaven never yet despised the contrite heart last shone with sweet exalted luster graced the seraphbard in highest order placed scers lovers legislators prelates kings all raptured listen as he raptured sings sweetness and strength his look and lays employ greet smiles with smiles and every joy with joy charmful he rose his evercharmful tongue joy to our second hymeneals sung still as we passed the bright celestial throng hailed us in social love and heavenly song of that no more my deathless friendship see i come an angel to the muse and thee these lights that vibrate and promiscuous shine are emanations all of forms divine and here the muse though melted from thy gaze stands among spirits mingling rays with rays if thou would peace attain my words attend the last fond words of thy departed friend true joys a seraph that to heaven aspires unhurt it triumphs mid celestial quires but should no cares a mortal state molest life were a state of ignorance at best know then if ills oblige thee to retire those ills solemnity of thought inspire did not the soul abroad for objects roam whence could she learn to call ideas home justly to know thy self peruse mankind to know thy god paint nature on thy mind without such science of the worldly scene what is retirement empty pride or spleen but with it wisdom there shall cares refine rendered by contemplation halfdivine trust not the frantic or mysterious guide nor stoop a captive to the schoolmans pride on natures wonders fix alone thy zeal they dim not reason when they truth reveal so shall religion in thy heart endure from all traditionary falsehood pure so life make death familiar to thy eye so shall thou live as thou may learn to die and though thou viewst thy worst oppressor thrive from transient woe immortal bliss derive farewell  nay stop the parting tear  i go but leave the muse thy comforter below he said instant his pinions upward soar he lessening as they rise till seen no more while contemplation weighed the mystic view the lights all vanished and the vision flew finis erratum page     line    for the etherial read the broad etherial
