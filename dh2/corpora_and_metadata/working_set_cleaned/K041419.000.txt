plain and familiar insructions on ruptures designed for the use of the female sex in which are given distinct notions of these maladies and the most proper means of curing them together with accurate rules and directions on the use and application of trusses  by mademoiselle guiton surgeon of paris  london sold at the authors at no ii in martletcourt bowstreet covent garden by h whitridge at the royal exchange r spavan in ivylane wowen at temple bar gwoodfall at charing cross h chapelle in grosvenorstreet and at the court of requests    0  price one shilling  preface as ruptures are disorders on which very preposterously a character of disgrace has been fastened so almost all those of our sex who labor under them imagine these infirmities to be a stain to their honor they fix upon them a kind of ignominy which is the reason that instead of having recourse to the remedies proper for them they would by a misplaced shame dissemble them to others and even conceal from themselves the knowledge of the danger they are in  we shall find this delicacy to be quite out of place if we consider that these disorders are the most common of all those afflicting human bodies that they are the growth of every country the fate of every age and of every condition in life and that they happen through causes much more simple and innocent than most of those producing the other distempers  it is through the conviction of this truth that persons of distinguished rank who have deigned to own their mistake on this head have prevailed upon me to publish the following instructions their purpose was that all persons afflicted as they were might learn to lay aside their prejudices and set about to procure for themselves the means of aid these disorders call for  the circumstances of my life put me in a capacity of acquitting myself of this duty with all the precision necessary to a work of this nature born in the bosom of surgery and brought up under the instructions of mr arnaud author of the treatise on these distempers published not long since i have been enabled though the only one of my sex to merit the honor of being admitted into the number of the surgeons of paris for the treatment of ruptures in women some persons jealous of my talents do indeed dispute me this privilege and attempt to misguide the public on my score but the patent or letters of my reception subjoined to this preface must defeat all such surmises in justifying my title to that honor  to come up fully to my engagements i propose in these instructions to put persons of my sex on their guard against the untoward symptoms attending ruptures these disorders which are so many concealed enemies because unknown will no sooner be discovered than be destroyed each patient will be in condition upon reading this dissertation with a small degree of attention to become acquainted with these maladies and their cure no longer shall any one be able to allege her want of knowledge for excuse nor any longer be restrained by reasons of decency or modesty on a conviction of our understanding in these kinds of disorders  all the views of the persons for whom i write are here fully answered in the order i observe for their instruction i set out with the notion of ruptures in general then i enter upon a particular detail of each of these disorders i describe the parts where they are formed in proportion as i come to speak to the differences of these distempers i explain their causes their symptoms and signs so that with a glance of the eye the female reader may become acquainted with each particular case finally i come to speak to the means of effecting a radical cure upon them and among all the means bandages or trusses being the most common and most necessary i enlarge as much as possible on the manner of making and adjusting them to the body of the patient i lay down the necessary rules for taking the proper measures of the body in order to execute them well and i point at the inconveniences which some have opposed to the use of these machines and every one not being in case of having the necessary relief against the strangulation of the gut each female patient will here find the most efficacious remedies and easy of execution that can possibly be employed against that symptom and by their means may remove it themselves  i have avoided as much as possible the use of the terms of art which are always uncouth to persons not of the profession and substituted in their stead those of a more familiar and common use  the extract of the patent mentioned above francis de la peyronnie esquire counselor first surgeon to the king head of the surgery of the kingdom etc to all to whom these presents shall come greeting etc taking into our consideration the consent of the first physician to the king we have ordered the matriculation of demoiselle mary guiton and that she shall appear in our chamber of jurisdiction of st come at paris to pass examination where having appeared being conducted and presented by mr george arnaud master in surgery at paris we have interrogated and examined her and caused her to be interrogated and examined on all the branches of the herniary surgery and on the construction composition and application of the trusses proper for the ruptures of women in presence of the dean of the faculty of physic of paris the receiver in office and the dean of the company of surgeons of paris of all the masters which constitute the council of the said company of the two masters of each of the four classes and of the two experts by the

general the design of the workthe intention which i have of giving instructions to persons of my own sex afflicted with ruptures necessarily obliges me to engage in some detail upon the character of these disorders their differences their causes their signs and their symptoms in order to arrive at the knowledge of the means proper to guard against or cure them  what a rupture is ruptures are tumors or swellings formed by the issuing forth of certain parts contained in the belly  they are so called because there is produced a kind or division or separation of some of the parts of the belly which serve to contain the caul the guts the liver the spleen the stomach etc these parts which separate of divide are called the muscles and these have five natural apertures or openings which serve to give exit or issue from the belly to certain necessary parts of these openings i shall speak in the following chapter  division of ruptures ruptures are divided into true and false  true the true ruptures are those formed by the coming forth of those parts contained in the lower belly  false the false ruptures are tumors or swellings formed by the collection of the blood the lympha or other humors in the parts where the true ruptures happen  distinction of ruptures ruptures are distinguished according to the parts of which they consist and the places they possess  differences they differ among themselves on the score of the parts of which they consist in that some are formed by the guts others by the caul and others again by the guts and the caul together  uncommon ruptures there are also some ruptures formed by the stomach the bladder which happens rarely others by the ovaries and the womb passing through the openings in the bending of the groin but these sorts of ruptures happen still more rarely and so without insisting on a particular detail of them which would throw confusion into the discourse i shall only mention those produced by the gut and the caul to which i shall add those of the womb and the falling of the fundament  differences of true ruptures the true ruptures differ among themselves from the places they possess in that some happen in the navel and these are therefore called umbilical hernias or ruptures of the navel others in the groin and these are called inguinal others in the bending of the thighs and called crural others again are formed in different parts of the surface of the belly and called ventral or ruptures of the belly  there are besides other ruptures which happen in other parts and which for that reason differ from these others as some happen in the loins others in the vagina others again which are formed at the holes at the bottom of the haunchbones but i shall wave speaking of all these different sorts of ruptures as they happen but very rarely to engage our attention here these extraordinary cases claiming only the attention of the people of the art or profession  chap ii of the general causes of ruptures what a cause is physicians call causes of diseases every affection against nature which produces or which concurs to produce diseases the causes of ruptures are divided into remoter or primitive and into proximate or determining  remote causes the remote causes are those which arise from the temperament or constitution which the patients bring with them into the world or from the disposition they acquire by their manner of living it is not to be doubted but that children ordinarily enough inherit the good or bad qualities of the soul and body of their parents so that there is nothing more certain than that robust parents predate strong and vigorous children and the delicate children of the like delicacy of constitution with themselves the gouty gouty and die phthisical phthisical etc and those who have ruptures commonly enough children with the like indispositions with themselves consequently the most remote causes of ruptures may be traced up to the disposition which is communicated to the child at the moment of its conception  primitive causes whence they most commonly proceed it is much more common to find the primitive or remote causes of these diseases in the manner of living all the parts which are contained in the belly and all those which form it are naturally softened and relaxed by the too moist air which is respired by the marshy places which are inhabited by the too relaxing aliments that are used as the too thin milk of a nurse of a bad constitution by the oil the butter the too great quantity of water smallbeer and other the like drinks  determining causes every thing that is capable of determining the parts already relaxed to come forth is considered as immediate causes of these disorders loud crying leaping straining constipation pregnancy and childbearing force the parts contained in the belly to stretch and come out at those places where they happen to find the least degree of resistance  natural openings in the belly there are five natural openings but which are neither apparent nor even surmised to be there by persons unacquainted with anatomy because like all the other parts they are covered by the skin and fat of these five openings the navel is the first two others are situated in the groin and called rings two others in the bendings of the thighs and called arcades or archs these openings in their natural state are exactly filled by other parts which are destined to come forth of the belly in the hole of the navel are the remains of the navelstring which during the time the child is in the body of the mother serves to convey nourishment to it through the rings pass two sorts of strings which serve to support the womb and are called the round ligaments of the womb below each of the arcades pass the vessels which carry the blood for nourishing the inferior extremity  preternatural openings besides the natural openings through which the parts contained in the belly may come out there are besides others very often formed in all the anterior surface of the belly because the parts which are under the skin and the fat called muscles and which serve to form the belly are susceptible of separations and divisions which let out the caul and the guts besides the muscles there is another part which immediately covers all those contained in the belly this part is called the peritoneum this peritoneum does not divide but is capable of being extended and lengthened considerably though of a very delicate texture its thickness resembling nearly that of a hogs bladder it always forms a part of the rupture and serves as a covering to the guts when out of the belly in the same manner as in it it is called the herniary sac when out of the belly an appellation very significant since it serves as a sac to contain the rupture  immediate or determining causes in order to find the immediate causes of hernias or ruptures and at the same time guard against them it suffices to attend to the general idea which we have just now formed from the natural openings in the belly and from those which may be produced therein in an extraordinary manner by the separation of the muscles when the first or primitive causes have brought the parts contained in the belly to a state of relaxation by the great quantity of moisture communicated to the blood by the natural constitution by the method of living or by the air respired how inconsiderable soever the efforts or strainings happen to be the guts will be disposed to make their way out of the belly by the parts where they find the least resistance now as they find less at the natural openings or in the parts disposed to separate they will not fail to come out of the belly at these places and form one or several ruptures according to the greater or less degree of resistance they meet with in any of those parts  chap iii of the signs of true hernias what a sign is the signs in diseases are sensible marks which discover and distinguish them from each other some of them discover the present state the character and the species of the disease and they are called diagnostic others again enable us to judge of the issue of a disease and these are called prognostic  diagnostic signs of ruptures the diagnostic signs common to all true hernias or ruptures differ according to the progress of the disease when the rupture is just about forming the patient feels a small pain like that of an excoriation or ruffling of the skin and that within the belly when the rupture increases the patient perceives on applying the hand a small swelling which disappears upon pressing with the finger when entirely formed collical pains are from time to time felt in the part of the rupture and which extend to the parts about the navel the diagnostic signs common to all the species of true hernias do besides discover what parts they consist of whether of the gut or caul or of both together those consisting of the gut are known by a small rumbling noise caused by the wind and the fluid matters contained in the gut which rumbling is heard especially upon handling the rupture in order to procure its return  those formed of the caul discover themselves upon the touch by a doughy resistance like what we feel when we come to handle a piece of tripe in those formed of the gut and caul together these signs are mixed that is to say they are found combined  prognostic signs of ruptures in regard to prognostic signs it may be said in general that ruptures are very troublesome disorders when they are neglected and come to be atttended with symptoms those formed of the gut are more dangerous than those formed of the caul those happening in the navel and belly more difficult to cure than those called inguinal and those happening in the bending of the thigh are of all the most difficult of cure  the hernias of the womb are in general more troublesome than dangerous  those of the fundament called the falling of the fundament are the least dangerous but the most difficult to cure  in fine all of them are so much the more difficult to cure as they are of an older standing consequently less so in children  chap iv of the symptoms of ruptures what a symptom is every thing that supervenes or happens upon a disease and renders it more grievous is called a symptom as for instance a flux of blood coming upon a looseness a dalirium upon a fever and the like  strangulation of all the symptoms of ruptures that of the strangulation is the most formidable and dangerous and against which patients should be most on their guard either in preventing it or seeking out the means of cure and using them instantly upon this symptom never so little neglected it is impossible for the expertest surgeon to remedy it the death of the late queen is too sensible an instance of this truth not to be capable of striking every patient for who could procure better means of assistance than she upon this melancholy occasion  what strangulation is by strangulation we understand a degree of straitening which happens through the strong compression of the parts though which the gut passes and which no longer suffer it to return into the belly in this case then the gut is strangled and this strangulation cannot happen without two other symptoms extremely easy to be understood the first is an inflammation and gangrene the second an impediment to the passage of the feces into the gut from whence it necessarily follows that the feces must return by the mouth by throwing them up if the return of the gut into the belly be not procured for the feces to take their ordinary course by the fundament  though someimes it happens that it is not above five or six hours before the feces return by the mouth yet this is not so commonly the case the vomiting comes on for the most part on the  d or  th day sometimes not till after     and  0 days but the patients are afflicted with such symptoms as by preceding the vomiting anounce and characterize the strangulation of the gut so distinctly that every one who will but attend can never mistake the case  here follows the detail of the symptoms  first the rupture grows bigger than ordinary  secondly causes much pain  thirdly baffles all attempts to reduce it  fourthly the pain extends as far as round the navel if the rupture be in the bending of the thigh if in the navel the pain beginning there extends to the groin  fifthly the pains called gripes hold only for some minutes but recur from time to time and the disorder they cause is daily increasing  sixthly upon these gripings comes wind which is plentifully discharged at the mouth the patient cannot discharge it by the fundament notwithstanding all the inclination she seems to have to do it by that part  seventhly the patient is troubled with loathings or an inclination to vomit which terminate in a plentiful salivation thick and glutinous  eighthly at last the patient throws up the aliments then come the feces whole taste and smell are extremely nauseous  during the series and increase of the symptoms the rupture swells the belly turns hard and very big a fever comes on and heightens more and more  but on the close of the distemper the vomitings slacken the patient is afflicted with hiccups the belly subsides and becomes insensible the rupture turns soft and livid the sight fails the pulse turns intermitting and languishing at length is totally lost and the patient dies for want of having foreseen the means of guarding against a death she might have avoided  adhesions ruptures are besides subject to another symptom called adhesion it is an union which is made between the parts coming out of the belly and those without it as the fat and skin etc the parts which are attached externally can no longer return into the belly  but how should we avoid a danger unknown how guard against these symptoms if we are uninstructed about them possibly it is only by reading and to render it the more useful i propose to describe each species of rupture in particular after which i shall communicate the means to guard against and remedy them  chap v of the ruptures of the navel explanation of the part the navel as i have already hinted is a hole destined to give passage into the belly of the infant during its stay in the body of the mother to what we call the navelstring it consists of three sorts of vessels namely a vein two arteries and a canal called urachus this string is a continuation of the vessels which form the afterbirth which afterbirth is attached to the bottom of the womb by means of the vein which is a part of this string the blood is conveyed from the mother to the child for its nourishment and growth and the blood returned back to the mother by the intervention of the two arteries  the urachus is a canal coming from the bladder of the child for relieving it of the urine by conveying it into the blood of the mother when the child comes to the world this string is tied up with a thread and cut to prevent the flux of the blood of the child so that the hole of the navel is filled by the navelstring yet imperfectly enough as it afterward comes to shrivel and dry  character of the disease when we happen at any time to strain much the gut or the caul easily comes out at the hole of the navel because there a less degree of resistance is found than any where else  differences and causes the ruptures of the navel are not only formed at the hole itself of the navel but some more commonly happen at the circumference of this hole because these parts are very weak and easily dilate by any violent efforts or gentler efforts often reiterated women are very subject to this species of rupture the reason is that in pregnancy the belly is extremely extended the hole of the navel enlarged more than in the natural state or that its circumference yields and gives way more easily than all the other parts because as was said the circumference of the navel is weaker than the navel itself  diagnostic signs the swelling and elevation of this part is the characteristical mark of the rupture especially if this swelling disappears when abed or when pressed with the fingers  prognostic signs in general this species of ruptures is very difficult to cure the small ones and recent are more dangerous than those of a longer standing but these of a longer standing are of more difficult cure these diseases are very dangerous in children but more easily cured than in persons of an advanced age  symptoms the symptoms of the ruptures of the navel are the same in general with those in all the other species of hernias one peculiar to and common in them is a species of slight colic less painful than troublesome which the patients are incessantly afflicted with when up and which increases after eating  cure the art of surgery supplies three different means of cure for this species of rupture the first is what is called the palliative the second the radical and the third is the means of remedying the symptoms  the palliative cure is that by means of which we only attempt to prevent the symptoms by keeping the parts in the belly by bandages or trusses which exactly close up the hole at which the parts come out and hinder their coming out when once returned into the belly this method of cure suits the hernias accompanied with inconveniences which oppose their radical cure as those of too old a standing those of too considerable a bulk and those happening to women who are subject to have children  the radical cure is that by which ruptures are cured by the remedies proper in these diseases of which i shall speak in chap xiv as in chap ix of the means of removing the symptoms  chap vi of the rupture of the groin explanation of the part the author of nature has so disposed the belly that there are two holes which answer to the parts called the groin these holes are destined to give passage from the belly on each side in women to a species of round string called from its figure the round ligament of the womb it serves to keep that part in its place the holes through which these ligaments pass are from their figure which is nearly round called rings in the natural state these holes are filled by the parts which pass through them but upon violent strainings they enlarge gradually and at last give passage to the gut or caul or to both together out of the belly and suffer them to form the ruptures of the groin they are called inguinal hernias or ruptures  differences the hernias of the groin are different and have different appellations according to the place they occupy some remain in the bending of the groin these they call incomplete others descend to the great lip of the natural parts and these are called complete  causes the particular cause of inguinal hernias proceeds from the rings being situated in the lowest part of the belly which are continually relaxed by a certain quantity of water found at the bottom of the belly if then the determining causes come to act these part being naturally open and situated in the lowest part of the belly the guts or the caul insinuate easily into them  the determining causes are loud crying leaping the strainings made to cough at stool in childbed etc  the neglect of remedying the incomplete rupture of the groin is the most immediate cause of the complete rupture for if its progress be not stopped by bandages it is natural to think that it must daily increase more and more and arrive at that pitch that all the guts shall come down to the great lip nothing is more common than such sorts of ruptures they are sometimes observed of the bigness of ones head and hanging down to the thighs  symptoms the parts which ought to continue in the belly which is their natural place cannot be thus disarrangd without this consequence a considerable disorder in the state of the health for the guts cannot come down so low and the stomach at the same time not be pulled down and displaced as the guts are a continuation of the stomach it then but imperfectly performs the digestion of the aliments the patients are afflicted with windy colicks the twitchings to which the guts the stomach and other parts contained in the belly are subject cause almost continual weaknesses which are improperly ascribed to the cravings of hunger  it rarely happens that these large hernias are subject to strangulation but should that happen it is ever with the most imminent danger  the incomplete hernias are rarely subject to the symptoms above described yet more than the others subject to strangulation because the rings not having lost their spring as in the complete hernias are more in case to make an impression upon the parts and hinder their return which constitutes the strangulation it is besides true that it is easier to guard against their strangulation because easier to keep them in with bandages or trusses  diagnostic signs the incomplete hernia of the groin is distinguished by its facility of coming our and returning again when not adherent and by the signs of the complete hernia  the complete hernia is also distinguished by its facility of returning again when not adherent if adherent that is if attached to the exterior parts and formed of the gut we feel in it a certain degree of flexibility like that which is felt on compressing a bladder not quite full of water if the hernia be formed of the caul on the touch we perceive a softness like that we feel in handling a piece of tripe if the hernia consists of both these parts the signs are then mixed we feel in handling the tumor that flexibility and at the same time that softness just now mentioned  prognostic signs we may affirm of the hernias or ruptures of the groin that the incomplete are more dangerous than the complete and also of more easy cure for in the complete the disarrangement of the parts is more considerable but the hole of the ring being larger they are less subject to strangulation  cure the hernias of the groin are susceptible of three different methods of cure of which i shall speak hereafter viz the palliative the radical and of that which consists in removing their symptoms  chap vii of the crural hernia explanation of the part in the bending of the thigh just in the middle under the skin and the fat there is an opening to one side of the ring this opening which is called the crural arcade has in effect nearly the figure of a small arcade or arch it serves to give passage out of the belly to the vessels which carry the blood for the nourishment of the thigh the leg and the foot and to those which reconvey it from these parts these vessels are called crural and the rupture made by this hole is also called crural  this species of rupture happens more commonly to women who have had children than to others  differences the crural hernias differ only in bulk or size the biggest exceed not a hens egg but ordinarily they are much less  causes the increase of the volume or bulk of the womb in proportion as the woman advances in her pregnancy is the particular cause of that species of hernia the guts being then obliged to bear in greater quantity on the sides of the belly and as in this case the muscles are stretched much and their openings called arcades are more patent the guts or the caul escape more easily at these openings in the great strainings of women with child in the act of coughing at stool or in labor  symptoms they are very subject to adhesions on account of the continual rubbings or collisions they undergo in the motion of the thigh the bandages being illmade contribute thereto much they are also subject to strangulation  diagnostic signs the diagnostic signs of this species of hernia are the same with those of the incomplete hernia of the groin the situation bespeaks its species with respect to the place it occupies  prognostic signs the crural hernia is very dangerous from the difficulty there is of reducing it into the belly in case of a strangulation the operation is much more dangerous the radical cure of it is very difficult to compass nay it is not an easy matter to keep it in with bandages unless they are made with much care and judgment so that one may affirm in general that this species of rupture is very dangerous  chap viii of the ventral hernia what the belly is the belly consists of soft parts which are the skin the fat and the muscles by muscles we understand those parts of animals which are known by the name of flesh which consists of red fibers or strings which easily separate when the meat or flesh is boiled these strings are joined to each other by other smaller strings of another species and which are so fine and delicate that the sight scarce discerns them it is easy to conceive that these fleshy strings may divide and separate from each other by the strainings we may happen to exert and that the opening which this division forms may give passage out of the belly to the guts and caul with as much ease as the natural holes of which we have already spoken these sorts of ruptures which may be thus formed in all the extent of the belly are called ventral hernias  differences the different places of the belly where these ruptures happen characterize their difference for some of them may happen about the navel others below others again on the sides of the belly in fine they may happen in all the parts of its surface and they ever are ruptures of the belly otherwise called ventral hernias all of them may be produced by the gut or caul or by both together  causes the great extensions the muscles are exposed to in pregnancy and in the dropsy are the proximate and most common causes of these species of ruptures yet violent strainings may give occasion to them  symptoms of all the species of ruptures there is none that fatigues and spends the patients more because in these cases there is an extreme relaxation in all the parts of the belly the continual twitchings the patients are exposed to incapacitate them almost to walk they are ever complaining of weaknesses and sinkings especially after meals which allow them no other posture but that of sitting or lying down these ruptures also are subject to strangulation and adhesions  diagnostic signs the ventral hernias are known by their softness their elasticity and the facility with which they come out of the belly and are again returned especially at their beginning  prognostic signs these species of hernias are incurable they are not so subject to strangulation as the other ruptures but should it happen upon them it is highly difficult to remedy these sorts of ruptures are then very dangerous  cure the palliative cure is the only one that suits here such is the application of bandages but no bandage are of more difficult execution than those for such ruptures and i may without presumption affirm that no one besides myself has hitherto found out the commodious and sure means of keeping in these ruptures so as to prevent their coming out in what situation or position soever the patients are put  chap ix of the means of remedying the strangulation what strangulation is the strangulation as was said in chap iv is so considerable a straitning of the gut formed by the constriction of the parts through which it comes out of the belly that its return is not possible in this case we see that it must be exposed to all the symptoms of which i have given a detail in the same chapter and of what importance it is to remedy it speedily  three means to be used the strangulation is remedied by three means the first consists in the situation in which the patient should remain the second in the use of proper remedies the third in replacing the gut  first means in the strangulation of any species of hernia whatever we must procure to the parts which are too much extended a suitable relaxation to lessen the straitning of the gut the patient then should be laid upon her back the buttocks and breast be raised by means of pillows by this situation the exterior parts of the belly are less extended and the ruptured guts are made to have a greater tendency to return  second means the patient being in this situation the suitable remedies must be forthwith used and those proper to promote the reduction of the parts each country each practitioner has his peculiar remedies but as some of them are approved by all the people of the profession and everywhere to be met with it is on such i shall insist to the end that the instructed patients may use them directly and till they can have recourse to the aid of their surgeon the coldest and the hardest water as that of a pump thrown immediately upon the rupture is the most efficacious remedy and which ought to be used the first if one is so happy as to apply it in the first moments of the disease if the patient be laid on a bed and we apprehensive of wetting it it will be sufficient to dip rags in this water and applying them on the affected part shift them every minute to this water may be added half the quantity of vinegar it is to be observed that this remedy which is the most sovereign of all those we are going to prescribe would prove highly dangerous if not used at least at the very first because after that it disposes the guts to a gangrene but being properly applied it promotes the return of the gut with as much ease as the most dextrous hand and the most accustomed to this operation  if these remedies have not been applied for want of being able to seize on the critical moment the patient must be blooded directly and that till she faints away and the surgeon to improve the moment of the swooning during which all the parts are in a state of relaxation to procure the return of the rupture  but it may happen that this means has not succeeded either through the disposition of the patient or the little experience of the surgeon in that case we must apply on the rupture the remedies capable of relaxing the strangling parts nothing is more fitted to produce this effect than the crum of bread boiled in water or milk we may add to it oil this poultice is wrapped up in a small bag of fine cloth but we here still more usefully employ warm milk put into a hogs bladder and applied on the ailing part or an omelet made with oil that of nuts is the best these applications should be shifted every three hours and during the use of them the patient to be let the same quantity of blood every three hours also taking at each time   or   ounces  whilst we thus labor to procure the relaxation of the parts which strangle the gut we must endeavor to void the matters which may be evacuated from the guts by means of small glisters of river water in which has been boiled wheatbran and into which is put a teaspoonful of sugar or common salt by thus voiding the guts we also procure a relaxation to the exterior parts by bathing and moistening them  if these remedies prove ineffectual for two days we ought not to hesitate a moment to procure the aid of some able surgeon who is to act in consequence of the violence of the symptoms for then they heighten more and more while we wait for his assistance we must apply a poultice made of crum of bread boiled in red wine  in all cases wherein we use crum of bread it must be crumbled very fine and smooth  regimen during the course of the disease the patients must have no nourishment because they throw up all they take and what is given them is quite lost upon them besides the feeding them excites the vomiting which comes on but too often  a few spoonfuls of broth are sufficient at times and a few spoonfuls of the simplest and lightest drink  third means the replacing the parts which is called reduction is an operation of the hand which consists in procuring the return into the belly of the gut or caul which were come out  it is very difficult to give rules on the manner of performing this operation besides it only concerns the people of the art to be instructed therein and so i forbear speaking of it such as are curious of knowing the general rules which may be given on it may consult mr arnauds book chap xiii sect ii part   it is enough for the patients to know that they ought not to quit their bed after the reduction of the parts before they are guarded with a proper bandage to stop up the hole through which the guts or caul were come out and prevent this accident from happening again as life depends on such sort of machines and that the patients are incapable of judging of their defects i am in the following chapter to give the exactest rules possible to judge of their good or ill construction and thereby enable the patients themselves to determine about the advantages and disadvantages which may result from bandages or trusses well or ill made  chap x of the trusses proper for the different species of ruptures what a truss is trusses are solid bands made in form of a circle applied round the body to oppose the issuing forth of the ruptures  the matter of trusses the matter of which trusses are made is a composition of iron and steel forged together so as to acquire a solid consistence elastic and incapable of warping this last matter should only make a third a half or two thirds of the truss the rest to be of leather the whole lined with cloth proper to guard against the hardness of the ironwork  the parts of the truss it is necessary to know the parts of the truss before we learn to make the proper application of it or determine its position three principal parts are to be observed in the ironwork of the truss the plate the circle and the tail the plate is the anterior extremity destined to fasten a cushion which ought to stop up the hole of the belly on the outside of this plate is a hook for fastening the girdle of leather the circle is the part extending from the plate as far as to the tail the tail is the posterior extremity of the ironwork to which is fastened the girdle of leather the plate or the cshion is also called the point of compression the tail the point of support  the conditions of the truss the ironwork should be adjusted in such a manner as to apply or fit exactly quite round the body as otherwise it would be apt to bear false or warp gall the patient and never close up the hole exactly the rupture be apt to fall out the plate of the truss be galling and give occasion to the adhesion an untoward symptom of which we have spoke in chap iv  truss of steel the truss of steel is the only one which may be applied round the body without being subject to any variation or warping its turn or rounding being well molded to the shape of the body for which it is made renders it firm invariable and incapable of shifting place in what situation soever the patients put themselves  springtruss some workmen have imagined they gave a great degree of perfection to the truss by adding to the cushion a spring to make it bear downwards without considering that if the compression be greater in the lower part it is less in the upper where the rupture takes a new course and ever and anon comes out  jointtrusses others have devised a jointtruss the use of which is pernicious for the truss which should remain firm upon the body in the different motions of the patients cannot possibly do so its joints suffering it to open and close according to the motions of the patients  elastic trusses many more advantages were imagined to be found in certain trusses to which they have given the name of elastic trusses of a new invention this elastic virtue which constitutes their merit is very advantageous when this sort of truss is executed by an intelligent hand who knows how to give the degree of turn or rounding proportioned to the shape of the body on which it is to be applied a thing extremely difficult for otherwise it ever bears false galls the patients and neither restrains the rupture  truss without steel the truss without steel has all the most dangerous inconveniences possible and we cannot too much caution patients against a machine which may easily mislead from the notion of restraint and pain at first excited in the mind by the idea of steel which enters into the composition of other trusses but if we consider that the cushion of the truss without steel has no fixed point to render it immovable we shall come easily to understand that it cannot effect an exact compression on the hole of the rupture but when the patient is abed and that in that case most patients being able to do without a truss this sort becomes useless and proves dagerous in all other situations as it prevents not the exit of the rupture  therefore i conclude from what i have just said on the subject of trusses that those agreeing the best are the steeltrusses methodically made that is made according to the nature and species of the malady and turned or rounded to the shape and structure of the bodies of the persons on which they are to be applied but as it suffices not that patients have trusses properly constructed for them but further necessary they know how to use them to advantage i shall in the following chapter recite the inconveniences which may happen upon the use of these machines  chap xi of the inconveniences which may happen during the use of trusses three general inconveniences may make patients but little attentive to their ailments lose all the benefit they should otherwise derive from the use of trusses executed according to the rules of art some arise on the part of the disease itself others of the patients others again of the trusses  inconveniences chargeable to the score of the disease ruptures of the caul are very difficult to keep in the belly because that part being a fatty membrane is very slippery how little soever we neglect the retaining them in the belly they are ever increasing patients should in that case then submit to wear their trusses night and day and tighter than in a rupture of the gut  sometimes the rupture is found to consist of the gut and caul together and it may happen that in this case the gut enters into and the caul remains out of the belly without being able to return on account of some adhesions which restrain it the patients ought not therefore to go without the truss as it is necessary to prevent the coming forth of the gut art then directs to make a truss that shall close the hole so as to hinder the gut from coming out yet not overcompress the caul for fear of causing some alteration therein  inconveniences to be laid to the account of the patients the two extremes of being too thin or too fat are inconveniences on the part of the patients which oppose the stability of the truss and make the use of it always difficult unless the surgeon and the patient each on their part give all the attention necessary  in an extreme leanness the bones being bare and uncovered but for the skin and these bones themselves forming eminencies and pits the surgeon the most versed in making of trusses must miscarry if he employ not all the attention necessary to give them the shape proportioned to that of the bones but the patients on their part ought to apply all their care to keep them in place as we shall see in chap xiii  in an extreme of corpulency the too great quantity of fat gives the hips a difformity so contrary to the natural state that the turn of the truss should also be very different from what is assigned it in a moderate corpulency and it is very difficult for the truss to be capable of producing the effect expected from it if the patient herself favor not the intentions and be not careful to tighten it from time to time  the inconveniences to be met with on the part of the patients in ruptures of the navel equally arise from the difformity of the belly which is more or less prominent more or less thin tight or soft according to the greater or less degree of relaxation undergone by the skin the fat and the muscles in the state of pregnancy and of consequence the trusses for these sorts of ruptures should be as differently constructed as the shapes of bellies differ for if the belly terminate in a point toward the navel the point of compression easily varies if the navel be found lower than the hips the point of support or bearing is very difficult to find if the belly be more raised above the navel than below t the truss tends to fall down below the rupture all these differences call for different degrees of attention in the make of the trusses none of which in this case are capable of remaining in place unless that sort of my invention of which i shall speak at the close of this chapter  the more the truss is apt to vary or shift the greater degree of constancy the patient should put on to give it the time to fix or settle and the surgeon on his part endeavor to mould and fit it to the body of the patient by degrees in persons extremely thin we must not at first tighten it to the highest pitch the use of it would then prove discouraging and insupportable the parts that serve for seat to it must insensibly be made accustomed to its impressions in persons extremely fat the same precautions must be used because the fat can subside but by little and little under the truss and so it must be tightened but in proportion as it sinks in the thickness of the fat without which it would become too wide these degrees of attention should then be divided between the patient and the surgeon till the truss has acquired a firm and invariable situation the patients ought not to put off their truss night and day till they are become accustomed to it when the ruptures have a great facility of coming out as those consisting of the caul have every motion must be avoided capable of determining the parts to come out as violent striding raising the arms too high and strong sneezing finally if the belly be bound the patient is obliged to strain much at stool and then it is proper to procure an open belly by means of glysters or making her swallow half an ounce of lenitive electuary if notwithstanding this she be obliged to strain in the least at stool let her rest her hand on the upper part of the plate of her truss to prevent its ascending and this she is to do every time she sneezes or coughs or blows her nose because in these great motions the cushion of the truss is always determined or apt to ascend and then the hole it should stop is found a little uncovered by all this attention the parts will be gradually accustomed to remain in the belly and acquire the habitude of not coming out and the patients being abed in that case they may pull off their truss at night  inconveniences on the part of the truss we have just said that trusses can only gradually mould themselves to the bodies of the patients they are therefore of themselves subject to some variation which must necessarily be remedied to procure them the utmost degree of perfection this perfection consists as i have already said in the just turn or rounding and exactly proportioned to the parts on which the truss is to be applied for if it bears false i mean if it bears on one part more than on another of the circumference of the belly it cannot fail to gall and the point of compression be vicious and irregular beside this defect makes it subject to break in the part where is the void or hollow this defect is not always perceivable at the very first time it is applied on because the ornamenting which is new and striking conceals its hollows but after being wore for some days the ornamenting flattens the fat which is under the girdle subsides the leather which forms the rest of the circle lengthens and the truss no longer compresses in any part of the circumference of the hips unless in the part which bears false this inconvenience which is considerable is easily amended when we come to be well acquainted with the manner of ordering these machines but a defect common to all the trusses made for the ruptures of the groin and those of the bendings of the thighs and for which no one before myself was ever able to find a remedy is that they bear less on the opening which they ought to stop when one happens to sit very low because then the belly sinks this defect stands corrected in the trusses of my manner to so considerable a degree of perfection that the patients are always surprised at not finding that inconvenience after having used the common trusses and therefore it was found necessary to order the patients to sit always high but that is not possible to be done every where unless one was always to have her seat carried about with her a thing highly inconvenient in a thousand instances this defect is besides to be met with on many other occasions as in persons very thin when abed the cushion of the common truss never bears on the hole in fat persons in those of a reasonable good plight of body in like manner as in the thin the same thing is also to be found when they sneeze blow their nose cough or are at stool and all the means proposed to remedy this inconvenience are as embarrassing as useless and in no manner come up to the simplicity of my truss in which there is found none of these inconveniences here is the proper place to mention a discovery which my application to be of service to persons of my own sex put me upon in reflecting on the lot of many women whose delicacy of constitution incapacitates them to go their full time with child  the most common cause of miscarriages is the same with that of ruptures it arises from the relaxation of all the parts of the belly both internal and external and takes rise in the too great quantity of serosities which water the ligaments which ought to keep in place each of the parts contained in the belly now the ligaments of the womb are so often relaxed by the serosities abounding in the blood that that part remaining unsupported on account of the weakness of its ligaments it is impossible the child should come to its full time because it determines by its weight the womb to remain in the lowest parts of the belly and not finding there sufficient room to grow dies through the constraint it undergoes  the means i have found to remedy these troublesome disorders are as simple as the following reasoning which i use to prove its efficacy the ligaments of the womb and the muscles of the lower belly being too much relaxed the growth of the child is prevented because the womb tends too much toward the lowest part of the belly where it is straitened for room the muscles of the belly not being strong enough to support it forwards if by the means of a truss sufficient to balance the relaxation of these parts that defect may be supplied it is not to be doubted but that women subject to miscarriages will happily go their full time the experience of upwards a hundred women to whom i have given this relief proves it having often miscarried before the use of my truss  it is made of a flexible matter without any ironwork at all but strong enough to resist the weight of the belly it stretches in proportion to the growth of the child nothing is more easy to apply and to wear it puts pregnant women the most subject to miscarriages in a condition to walk and go by any carriages and it becomes so commodious to them by giving a degree of firmness to the whole body that many women use it out of the time of their pregnancy but it proves besides highly useful to women whose belly being very heavy and pendulous hinders them to walk and to persons to whom it is not possible to apply the common trusses of the navel  chap xii a method for taking the measures of the trusses necessary for persons afflicted with ruptures persons who would incline to procure trusses for themselves not always living near great towns where they are commonly made have need of instruction to enable them to send their exact measure i imagine it to be useful for such to put them on the easy method of taking exactly the dimensions of their own bodies and to insist more particularly on some circumstances they ought to observe in relation to the different species of ruptures  first the patient should give a particular detail in an instructive memorial of her constitution and age whether she be maid or married woman the date of her rupture and whether the place she lives in be moist and marshy or dry  secondly she should as much as may be recollect the cause which has determined or occasioned her rupture whether a blow a fall a fit of coughing a sudden effort or straining or childbearing  thirdly she must determine nearly the size of the rupture and on what side it lies  fourthly she must set down precisely its place if in the groin or bending of the thigh  fifthly whether or no it reenters and whether in reentring it returns more difficultly in a standing than lying posture  sixthly when the rupture is in the bending of the groin it is necessary to distinguish whether it descends as low as the side of the natural parts  seventhly if it is in the bending of the thigh it is necessary to specify whether it be round or long  eighthly if there are two ruptures it is necessary to hint which is the biggest  ninthly it must be remarked whether the person be fat or thin or only in a tolerable good plight of body  tenthly it must be hinted whether the patient has one hip bigger than the other which is a very common case or if there be any other deformity it is necessary not to fail describing it and setting down its place with ink upon the measure  to this memorial the patient may add the measure of her body taken with a slip of paper of a proper length whether the rupture be single or double in the groin or bending of the thigh it is sufficient to lay the middle of the slip of paper immediately over the part where the clift of the breech ends and to join the two ends of the paper above the place where the top of the natural parts reunite  if the rupture be in the navel in the same manner will be taken the size of the belly by laying the middle of the slip of paper on the part of the back which answers to those of the sides which are between the ribs and the bones of the hips and by joining the two ends of the paper over against the part where the middle of the paper has been laid behind the back if the rupture be precisely at the meeting of the two ends of the slip of paper that must needs be specified in the memorial if not it is necessary to mark exactly at what distance from this meeting of the two ends of the slip the rapture lies whether a quarter of an inch half an inch or one or two inches above or below  care also may be taken to specify in the memorial  mo the part of the navel the rupture occupies either the middle or its circumference either lies above or below it or to one side  do if it is of an old or recent standing  tio its size  to its shape  to if it reenters or not  to if the navel be higher or lower than the bone of the hips  mo if the belly be hard or very soft it is moreover necessary to know whether the patient has had children and how many  all those particulars are very necessary to be mentioned in order to execute with care the trusses proper in each of these circumstances and render them as commodious as useful when the patients oh their part shall use the necessary care in their just application on this head i am to prescribe some rules in the following chapter  chap xiii on the manner of putting on the trusses necessary precautions to be observed previous to the laying or adjusting them the truss would become absolutely unserviceable if improperly adjusted it is therefore of importance to the patients to have rules to follow for their just application these rules are the same for persons of what age soever even for children at the breast  the use of the truss is to stop the hole at which the rupture comes out in order to prevent its coming out we must for that purpose begin with reducing it back into the belly  the ruptures unaccompanied with symptoms reenter with facility enough of themselves when the patients are abed of consequence the morning at the hour of waking is the time to apply the truss to do it with ease of what nature soever or in what part soever the rupture be we pass the girdle below the back and approach with one hand the cushion of the truss over against the part of the rupture with the other we examine whether any thing remains out of the belly afterward laying hold with this last hand on the girdle of the truss we pull it to ourselves toward the cushion whilst with the other we fix the cushion directly upon the part where the rupture appeared before reduction we at the same time fasten the girdle to the hook which is on the outside of the cushion  to procure the proper position to the truss the lower border of the girdle should be behind the back immediately above the clift of the breech when we are sure it has gained its due position we must then tighten it sufficiently for this purpose we lay hold on the girdle with one hand at the part where it joins to the ironwork of the truss and we pull it successively by slipping the hand as far as to its extremity while with the other hand we hold the cushion steady on the part where it should be placed if it were not supported it would shift to one side of the thigh and no longer be found on the hole of the rupture it is not necessary that the truss be too slack and neither must it be too right you will observe to tighten it from time to time fat people should particularly mind this because the longer they use the truss the fat sinks under the girdle which of consequence becomes too slack which is the reason that the overslackening of the girdle is charged on its lengthening and it also happens that the girdle of the truss is found hid by the pads which the fat forms both above and below when the fat has been entirely flattened under the girdle by its reiterated compressions  almost all the patients have the custom of placing the cushion of their truss too low especially such whose ruptures fall down pretty low without considering that the business is only to stop the hole to prevent the parts from coming out for when the cushion is placed so low the hole remaining unstopped the rupture comes out above the cushion of the truss  when the patients are thin the truss fails not to ascend especially when they are abed in this case we must use a small strap which is fixed to the truss we pass it under the thigh and fasten it to the ironhook which serves to fix the girdle but we must observe that it ought to be put under the leather of the girdle as otherwise it would be always apt to loosen  when there is a necessity of wearing the truss of nights we must take care to adjust or put it in order before we get out of bed of a morning and as the motions we give ourselves lower or raise it behind we must not fail replacing it in its due position as otherwise the cushion would not bear exactly upon the hole  with respect to children who are not cleanly we must be careful of shifting their trusses every day to prevent the ordure from heating or fretting them  in plump fat children the girdle should behind be a good fingers breadth above the clift of the breech in the thin it should immediately touch the clift or even be a little lower  we must be ever cautious in shifting their truss that the rupture does not fall out again for this purpose we must have ready at hand that which is to replace the other and lay the finger on the hole till the second truss is adjusted  chap xiv of the radical cure of ruptures by radical cure we mean such as removes a disease to its very root the radical cure of ruptures is therefore that by means of which we may cure these disorders without apprehension of any return is this possible it is what may be easily proved  but as i should be obliged to transcribe word for word what mr arnaud has at large to so good purpose writ on this subject such as would satisfy themselves of this truth may consult the book of that author chap xiv sect ii part i  all i can say to prevail on the patients not to suffer themselves to be discouraged as commonly those are who are afflicted with these disorders is that there are none for which there is a greater variety of remedies known the only question is to know how to appropriate them to the constitutions of the patients their age their sex the climates they inhabit and to know how to distinguish the species of ruptures which are curable from those which are incurable it is with these infirmities as with all the others such a one cannot be cured by a remedy which ten or a score others have found the good effects of because the circumstances differ this is the reason why the remedies of the good women do sometimes much good and very often a great deal of harm  chap xv of the ruptures of the womb otherwise called the inversion of the womb relaxation of the womb falling of the womb the relaxation and inversion of the vagina what the womb is the womb is the principal organ of generation it is situated between the bladder and straight gut the womb is of the shape of a pocketflask it is divided into two parts the one called the neck the other the body of the womb its neck is terminated by an opening caled the orifice it answers to the bottom of the vagina its body is the largest part it is seated in the lower belly beyond the vagina so that we can only reach to the neck of the womb when we introduce the finger into the part  the womb is hollow within and kept in its place by four ligaments two called the broad and two the round  it is these ligaments we are principally to regard in order to form a just idea of the ruptures of the womb these ligaments are capable of an extraordinary degree of extension otherwise the womb could not place itself in the belly by stretching in the time of pregnancy but would continue in its natural place and be there straightened and confined  the broad ligaments cover all the exterior bottom of the womb they are there firmly attached they rise on each side and stretch by enlarging to proceed to fasten on the parts which cover the hip bones internally it is a sort of very strong membrane  the round ligaments are so called from their round figure like a cord they are as big as the quill of a raven of a nature resembling that of the broad ligaments for they are properly only a division of them they come out of the belly at the holes which are in the groin by which the ruptures of the groin happen they proceed to fasten themselves to the bone of the thigh the womb is kept in place by these four ligaments  the vagina is a canal consisting of a very thick membrane capable of dilating and contracting this canal serves for an emunctory or drain to the flowings from the womb  inversion of the womb the womb being the principal organ of generation it sometimes happens that in child bearing the inside of this comes out at its opening or orifice in the manner as turning a purse inside out this disorder has besides other causes but these very rare the being overfat is one in particular this distemper is so distinctly handled in mr arnauds book chap xxiv sect ii p   that i thither refer such as would be further informed about it i could only copy this author and that would be to disgust him  relaxation of the womb though the term relaxation of the womb be improper i shall however make use of it because all authors do so for it is not the womb that relaxes it is its ligaments which lengthening suffer the womb to quit its natural place and thus to fall down more or less into the vagina  when the ligaments are only relaxed to a certain pitch this is what is properly called the relaxation of the womb because it is come down lower than the place it naturally occupies but comes not out of the vagina  falling op the womb when the womb comes out at the vagina then that species of rupture is called the falling of the womb this disorder may be more or less considerable according as it comes out more or less there are some in whom for want of minding it it hangs down as low as the middle of the thighs and then it grows in bigness to a pitch as sometimes to become as big as the head of a child  relaxation of the vagina the vagina relaxes too and that either in part or in whole if in part only the disorder is called the relaxation of the vagina if in whole the inversion of the vagina then it forms an eminence which comes out of the natural parts  causes the general and particular causes of these disorders are the same with those contributing to form the other ruptures of consequence young women are subject to them it is true they are not so much exposed to them as the married but there are some in whom the womb falls and the vagina relaxes to the highest pitch  married women are more subject to them because in pregnancy the ligaments of the womb are extremely lengthened by the weight of the child it contains also those who are not tender enough of themselves after delivery by keeping at rest and not stirring are more subject to these infirmities than others  symptoms the symptoms of these disorders differ according to the case when there is only a relaxation of die womb the patients feel some pain toward the loins and at the top of the thighs they walk with less facility and are never better than when sitting or abed  when the womb comes out a little at the vagina besides what i have just said the patient has a desire to make water often or a difficulty in making it  when the womb is in whole come out it is exposed to the rubbing of the thighs and to receive the impressions of the urine which runs upon it in making water which causes it to smart occasions painful excoriations and considerable ulcers  these symptoms are followed by those which attack the womb itself it is inflated and hardened and then it is very difficult to effect its return  the symptoms which accompany the relaxation of the vagina and its inversion are not so considerable unless when it carries along with it the womb for then the patients feel the same pains in the loins and thighs as in the falling of the womb but in the simple relaxation of the vagina there is no pain  diagnostic signs these disorders are known by the symptoms i have just mentioned excepting the simple relaxation of the vagina which can only be known by a sort of swelling or inflation felt at its entrance  prognostic signs in these four disorders the relaxation and inversion of the vagina are the most difficult to cure though without any danger to life the relaxation or falling of the womb just beginning is easily enough cured when the distemper is not of an old standing it even happens sometimes that after a new pregnancy if the patient be tender of herself in her lyingin and keep her bed close she is cured withour the aid of any remedies  but the grand symptoms to which the womb is subject when it comes out entirely are sufficient to manifest the danger and the difficulty there is to cure the patients  cure the relaxations and failing of the womb the relaxations and inversions of the vagina are susceptible as the other species of ruptures of a twofold cure the radical and the palliative  i shall not engage in the detail of the first that would carry me too far and i could hot abridge it without omitting things too necessary it may be seen in chap xxv and xxvi sect ii p i of mr arnauds work  the palliative cure which is the most used consists in keeping in place the relaxed or displaced parts by the means of pessaries  pessaries are instruments which serve to keep the womb and the vagina in place and to hinder their departing too much from their natural state the common use of these machines which are made in different forms and shapes according to the notions of him who applies them or the nature of the malady has inconveniences so considerable that the advantage derived from them is worse than the disease itself besides that we are obliged to introduce them into the part with violence and keep them there without scarce ever removing them these pessaries are always made either of matters subject to corruption as cork and wood or incorruptible as gold of ivory which hurt the womb or the vagina this causes a flow of matter extremely fetid with which the patients themselves are always offended and often those who approach them  these reasons have put mr arnaud on contriving a sort of pessaries with all the advantages we can desire and without any of the inconveniences of the others it is the only pessary i would advise patients to use and whose description is very clearly given in that authors book chap xxvii sect ii p i  chap xvi of the relaxation of the fundament what the fundament is the fundament is the extremity of the guts which terminate in a round opening with a power to open and close its use is to allow the discharge of the excrements and wind out of the belly  the extremity of the gut which ends at the fundament is sometimes relaxed and comes out by turning itself just like the finger of a glove when we pull the glove by turning it  this malady happens very commonly to children women are also subject to it sometimes  causes the cause of this relaxation consists for the most part in the too great quantity of serosities which water this part the palsy of the muscles of the fundament contributes sometimes too  but strainings determine this distemper as crying in children constipation in persons in years and the effort exerted in childbearing  symptoms it is rare that this malady is accompanied with untoward symptoms being so incommodious people never put off the looking out for the proper aid but were the procuring the return of the gut neglected an inflammation would be formed in it and a gangrene might seize upon it which would expose the patients to a very great risk  diagnostic signs this distemper is known by the eminence or lengthening formed by the gut of the fundament  prognostic signs according to what we have just seen of the symptoms of this distemper it is easy to judge that it is dangerous when neglected  cure we remedy this distemper by procuring the return of the gut and retaining it when returned or by employing the remedies proper to fortify and strengthen it all these means are recited in chap xxviii of mr arnauds book  chap xvii of false hernias it now remains to speak of false hernias these distempers are so rare in the sex that i might well pass them over in silence yet as i have seen some instances and that they were taken for ruptures i think it not from the purpose to give a general notion of them  what a false hernia is we understand by false hernias tumors that happen in the parts where the true ruptures are formed they are called false because they impose upon us by giving room to think them true ruptures unless we carefully consider them  differences there are two species of them some consist of water these are called hydroceles others of flesh or thick hard and viscid humors these are called extraneous bodies  the hydroceles sometimes show themselves in the bendings of the thighs in the groin and in the lips of the natural parts there may be formed of them two in the navel  the extraneous bodies are formed at the entrance of the vagina and in its cavity sometimes also they are attached to the neck of the womb  diagnostic signs the false hernias are known by the impossibility there is of procuring their return to the difference of true ruptures which return easily to the belly or at least have returned before they have got adhesions or are become of enormous bulk but hydroceles how small and recent soever they be never return  it is the same as to extraneous bodies these return not but they are distinguished from hydroceles as they are quite apart and separate from the parts to which they are attached hydroceles on the contrary unite with the parts where they grow  prognostic signs we may say that these distempers are attended with no uneasiness they are rather incommodious than dangerous  cure hydroceles are cured by tapping or discussing them by resolvents they are besides cured by compressions by the means of some proper bandages or trusses  as to extraneous bodies these are destroyed by ligature or incision  finis
