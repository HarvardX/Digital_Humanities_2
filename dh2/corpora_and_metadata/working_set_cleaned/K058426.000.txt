the lovers treat or unnatural hatred being a true narrative as delivered to the author by one of the family who was principally concerned in the following account  written by mrs charke author of dumont and miss charlotte evelyn  her lower weeds were patched with different colored rags as black red white yellow and seemed to speak variety of wretchedness chamont in the orphan london printed and sold at baileys printingoffice at the ship and crown in leadenhallstreet where tradesmens bills are printed neat and reasonable  the lovers treat or unnatural hatred etc in this last century there has been no vice more generally rooted in the minds of men than a discordency in families and which flows from the very springs from which we should naturally expect to find the most agreeable harmony but interest whose power is invincible too frequently creates us enemies where we are most nearly and consanguinity which ought most especially to endear to each other is now become a standing maxim to forget those tender principles which nature claims and the world must necessarily approve  this unfortunate depravity of sense laid want of fraternal affection was the unhappy cause of many sufferings and severest hardships which a very worthy youth for many years endured and from whom i had a particular account of a long series of misery occasioned by his elder brother and since i have his permission will give a succinct account both of him and his family  this young gentleman was the second and last son of mr anthony elstone born of a very reputable family in gloucestershire and whose father was a wealthy grazier worth a considerable deal of money but having a very large family to whom he paid an equal regard he portiond out his sons and daughters alike often declaring that one child was as dear to him as another and that what he was worth was the happy effects of his own industry so he was determined to dispose it in such a manner that no envy should arise among his children from his partiality having ten of them he left to each when died one thousand pounds a piece and as a farther proof of his paternal affection his wife dying when the youngest of his offspring was but two years of age he resolved never to make a second choice in respect to the memory of a very worthy woman and a fond regard to the infant blood she left behind her he looked on every child as a particular blessing sent from heaven and as such resolved never to put it in the power of a motherinlaw to contradict his pious purposes in acting like a tender father or enumerating his issue and consequently obliging himself to divest those he had part of their natural rights to provide for a foreign stock  many years before he died he had the happinness of seeing even the youngest of his children disposed of in different callings and set up for themselves amongst which mr anthony elslone his youngest was well established in merchandise in the city of london and behaving extremely well in his clerkship he married a niece of his masters who was a dependant on her uncle who gave her to mr elstone with a fortune of two thousand pounds and would have done more but that he had a family of his own to provide for by this young gentlewoman he had several little ones all of whom died in their infancy except the last three viz anthony the eldest george the second son and jane their last and only daughter who were twins  anthony and george were as opposite in their dispositions as fire and water the elder being the first that lived up to a twelvemonth the fond parents by an over acted indulgence ruined his principles which in infancy might have been cultivated to have rendered him the reverse of which be proved by that time he was six years of age he was absolute master of the family and was passed off as life and spirit in one so young very soon made him hateful and contemptible to all about him except his father and mother in about four years after his birth their second son and only daughter made their appearance in the world to the unspeakable transport of their parents and the admiration of all who beheld them being without exception two of the finest children that even were born at one birth young as anthony was he conceived an aversion for his little brother and sister and grew jealous at the sight of them this rancourous disposition grew up with him and strengthened with his years the other two whose tender dispositions and affability of soul inclined them to love each other also excited them to sue for anthony affection but all in vain he openly declared his aversion through every action of his life and several times even at play attempting to maim or destroy them this wicked disposition was once the occasion of his fathers stripping him starknaked and disciplined him with a horsewhip till he had almost left him for dead it happened mr elsione luckily went into the room when he was within an inch of rushing a sharp penknife into his brothers throat which naturally enraged the father and urged him to excuse the forementioned justice on him  notwithsanding mr elstones reason convienced him of the justice of the punishment he had inflicted yet when his anger subsided fondness then prevailed and reduced the piteous father to an immoderate flood of anguish and repeneant tears for having proceeded with such vigiour to his darling worthless son master george tenderly pleaded for his brother and would have prevented the dreadful stripes he underwent but even that wrought no effect upon the mind of this young barbarian for he remembered the smart of the whip to a long and cruel detriment to his brothers interest and reputation  mr elstone had been often heard to declare his intention of providing for his family by the worthy example of his father this caught the ears of his son anthony who from twelve years of age to maturity industriously employed his thoughts to engross the whole of what his father should die possessed of to which end he made it his constant business to influence his father against his brother george whose continual obedience and regard made it a very difficult task for example even in infancy he was unexceptionably endearing to his parents through a continued course of goodnature at the same time giving promising hopes of an extraordinary undertaking when ripened into years in his school days he made his studies his peculiar care and by that time he arrived to the age of sixteen was master of several languages and as he was designed to follow his fathers business closely applied himself to the perfect knowledge of merchants accounts of which he is justly esteemed to be at this time the compleatest master in great britain  his brother anthony was as entirely regardless of every advantage of this nature mis making chief and pleasure his only study and having from the hour of his birth gained such an ascendency over the hearts of both his parents they found it an impacticable scheme ever to get the better of that power their mistaken fondness had invested him with mr elstone was too plainly convinced of the rancourous disposition of anthony to  inoffensive brother therefore tenderly admonished his son george to be contented with being put apprentice to some other merchant to prevent any feuds or animosities between em though he originally designed to have bound him to himself the good youth received his fathers advice with that dutiful respect that became him though sorry to be obliged to leave his father and greatly affected with the unnatural and cruel motive of their separation in a short time mr george was put clerk to one mr hume an eminent hamburgh merchant and seldom visited home above twice or thrice a year though mr elstone often went to see him this removal any reasonable person would have thought might have made his brother perfectly easy but so far from it the constant praises he heard of his brothers good behavior and assiduity in his business greatly corroded his mind as he knew that this universal good character must entirely frustrate all his wicked intents of depriving him of his birth right and that any falsehoods he could allege against him must consequently prove ineffectual but in order to give birth to his cruel purposes he suddenly put on a mask of friendship and feigned a hearty repentance for his unnatural behavior to his brother earnestly requesting his father to become his advocate to poor george and endeavor at his reconciliation with him mr elstone and his wife were pleasingly amazed at this wonderful and happy charge in their sons temper and without delay sent for the other home to close this unlucky breach and six a wished for friendship between the brothers mr elstene urged his son anthony to write but the artful villain pretended he should be at a loss to express himself in a manner suitable to his offense and begged his father for that reason to do it for him to which he joyfully agreed as follows dear george it is with amazing and unspeakable transport i inform you that your brother anthony is at last grown sensible of his error and feels so strong compunction for his ill grounded aversion to you he can no longer forbear suing for a reconciliation and as he confessed himself unequal to the task of moving for it as he ought has entreated me to be his mediator i dont in this case use the commands of a parent but the tender admonition of a friend which i hope will be sufficiently prevalent on your goodnature to come on the receipt of this to fix a lasting union between you which will be an infallible joy to your mother and sister as also to dear georges  most tenderly affectionate father anthony elstone     mr georges good sense and sweetness of temper was easily moved to obey his fathers pleasing summons and went directly with the servant who brought the letter to him on his approaching to embrace his deceitful brother he showed the real signs of love real pity and forgiveness while the the other artfully strained from his eyes the crocodiles pretending sorrow which influenced the generous youth to pay a sincere and grateful retribution flowing from the result of an honest heart and joy uneignd  when his brother attempted to make confession of his error he would not permit him to proceed in but with the politest tenderness desired him to regard but as a dream what had passed and make at once to all the transport of belonging and being beloved by a truly affectionate friend and brother  mr and mrs elstone with their agreeable daughter bore an equal part in this pleasing distress for such they thought it to be in regard to mr anthony who affected every symptom without feeling the smallest degree of it however it passed current upon the worthy part of the family who were esolved on this seeming happiness to celebate it with a festival and as the discord between these brothers was universally known among their friends and acquaintance many of them were invited to a public rejoicing each congratulating the whole family on so laudable and reasonable a reconciliation  it is necessary to inform the reader that mr george and miss jenny who came together into the world went hand in hand in every point of brother and sisterly affection and on such terms as ought to stand for an example to all such relations though singly born but alas those principles are lost in this present age and is almost deemed a crime in some families to he related to them  the tender regard this young gentleman and his sister from infancy preserved for each other though entirely innocent and infallible was the first motive through the villainy of anthony to their long and unprecedented sufferings  the day appointed for their public rejoicing being come among their numerous friends were mr georges master and his only son who had for very near a twelvemonth paid his addresses to miss jenny by consent of both parties who thought proper to defer their marriage till her admirer had served his clerkship which he did to his father by which time he would arrive to the age of two and twenty and the young lady to about nineteen as they were happy in the knowledge of being designed for each other entirely correspondent to their wishes they passed their time with agreeable cheerfulness and a pleasing reflection of being one day till death to be rendered inseparabe they were so near their destined happiness that it wanted but three months to confirm it which was part of the discourse at their feast and gave birth to a very barbarous plot both on them and poor mr george which mr anthony put in force  mr elstone being resolved to express the fullness of his joy on this occasion concluded his entertainment with a ball and because miss jenny would not seem particular chose her brother george for a partner instead of young mr hume her intended husband it is true he entreated her to dance with him but she modestly declined it for the formentioned reason as people are apt to take notice of every look and action of a young couple so near marriage  accordingly mr george and his sister both of whom danced most excessively genteel opened the ball with a minuet and louvre and continued partners for the night the whole company were in a flow of spi its and good humor except the villainous hypocrite on whose account these goodnatured people were all assembled next day this monster of inhumanity and falsehood goes to pay a visit at mr humes under a pretense of strengthening that affection he had the night before waved for his injured brother he staid some time expatiating on georges kind forgiving nature and condemning his own mistaken folly in being blind to so much merit and obstinately depriving himself for so many years of his fraternal love and friendship during his stay at mr humes mr george elslone was obliged to go out for an hour upon business of very great consequence but made his brother promise to stay and pass the evening with them to which he readily agreed while mr george was gone young mr humes fondness naturally turned his discourse upon dear miss jenny expressing the tenderest regard for her and the happiness he promised to himself when he should become her husband ah said anthony with a kind of a sneer in his countenance it is all a lottery some blanks some prizes women are dangerous things to encounter and the very best of them according to the old phrase will not upon trial have much goodness to spare adding that for his part if he owed any man a spleen he would advise him to marry but if he were his friend he would sonner offer him a knife or a pistol than propose a match for him and so you would say too if you knew as much of the sex said be as i do perhaps said mr hume you have met with some disappointment but that should not urge you to an open war with the rest of womenkind but be it as it may i am fully persuaded that your sister is entirely exempt from any of the follies or imperfections which are i own too incidental to females and till i find her wrong it is my duty and my interest to believe her in the right why says anthony did i say she was not no says the other but you were speaking in reference to women in general and though i am naturally inclined to be partial to them all i cannot help on every occasion to express the tenderest sentiments of my soul for her whom honor and love equally have fixed in my heart a most implicit regard for well well replied anthony these are all very fine lights and i know you think this opinion will last as long as you live yet i will hold youfifty guineas that i alter it in less than a quarter of an hour and says mr huine i will hold you a hundred to fifty you dont done says the other done again says mr hume neither you or the world combined together will ever be able to alter my present thoughts in regard to your sister you will stand to the wager says anthony i will says young hume and now exert your utmost skill to win it but i pronounce you the loser before you begin upon which this wicked wretch takes out of his pocket a forged letter directed to miss jenny elstone which he pretended she had carelessly left in her escrutore which stood open upon her being hastily called down to her mamma that he accidentally coming in and seeing it to be a mans hand to which he was a stranger he had a curiosity to discover the contents which he read to young hume as follows my souls idol how unhappy am i in being disappointed of the pleasure of seeing you this evening at the usual place the sweet remembrance of our last interview doubly excites my impatient love to entreat you if possible to slip out but for a few moments and as the family are busied in rejoicing you will not be so easily missed for the short time i beg you will spare to fix the next happy meeting of  your truly tender and affectionate lover j  b  ps your brother george who was my friendly advocate and since the faithful confident of our loves assured me i should see you if but for a moment remember my love i only live while you are present       now sir said he what think you why really mr elstone that this letter is a villainous contrivance to blast both your brother and sisters reputation rather than that they are the least concerned in it there is no single action of either of their lives that proclaims them capable of so monstrous a crime and so far from being accessory to miss jennys destruction i am certain mr george would lose his life to preserve or vindicate her honor and as that base scroll so infamously calls it in question i think myself bound by all the ties of love and friendship to find out the wicked author of it and use him at his villainy deserves nor will i rest till i have put my resolution in force and as you are her brother i think you ought to join in so honorable a design even at the hazard of your life  why that is my intent says anthony who was left dead with the fears of being detected in this villainy what i said of the sex just now was only to see how far you was inclined to think well of them abstracted from my sister in whom i know your soul is wrapped and my reason for showing you the letter was as my brothers character suffers in the contents and we having but within a few hours healed up an unhappy breach which had been from infancy subsisting i thought proper to take the advice of a friend in the clearing up this point lest by undertaking it myself i might be deemed fond of retracting the solemn professions of our newborn friendship and pleased to think my brother guilty of a crime which i am certain his honest nature would most abhor therefore mr hume as i have opened myself so freely to you let me prevail on you not to take the least notice of it till we meet again i will find an opportunity to replace the letter in jennys escrutere and if i dont doubt but she will take notice then we may publicly endeavor to find out by whom and what means it was there placed it must be by some of the servants who may be reasonably judged as an accomplice with the invidious wretch whom i suppose has a wicked design upon her person and hopes to bring the matter to bear by blasting her reputation with a forged process of an amor with her i know out eldest clerk once made an overture of marriage but jenny being engaged to you he was soon repulsed perhaps his disoppointment for i know he was extremely in love with her may have urged him to this wicked design at least will endeavor to find it out agreed said mr hume and or a day or two i give you my word and honor to be quite silent in the affair nor drop the least hint of it even to my friend george these last words gave anthony new spirits as they afforded him more leisure to perpetrate his cruelty and with less hazard of being found out  mr george returning home the three young gentlemen concluded the evening together anthony still continuing to repeat the tenderest sense of obligations to his brother and expressing the highest satisfaction at their being reconciled it growing late mr anthony took leave and went away full fraught with all the mischief hell itself could inspire with to perpetrate the wicked means to destroy the happiness and peace of two families  next morning he went out very early to pay a visit to one mrs grimes an elderly woman of decayed circumstances and low cunning whose son was mr anthonys emanuenfis who writing several sorts of exceeding good hands he found him put for his purpose being possessed of a heart like his mothers capable of any evil by which he could get a shilling this mrs grimes kept a little house near goodmansfields in which she entertained several disorderly women of the lowest class among which number mr anthony had a favorite lady which served his turn as well as the finest or most elegant creature nature could produce having no other sense of love superior to that of a brute deeming the only happiness arising from that generous passion consisted in the immediate gratification which animals  are capable of conceiving  mr anthony opened his whole design to the old woman which was to use the most effectual means he could to get his poor brother and sister totally disinherited which if mrs grimes by being assistant could bring to bear he promised her a reward of five hundred pounds and as earnest of his intention gave her twenty guineas to encourage her and her son to put in practice every method that could forward his barbarous undertaking the money was a sure bait for both and she promised most faithfully to transact whatever he should employ her in accordingly he told her all that had passed the night before between him and mr hume in regard to the forged letter and made her thoroughly acquainted with the plan on which she was to proceed which when she had heard entirely out the old jade burst into a fit of laughing at a conceit which came into her wicked head more immediately to confirm what he had insinuated to young mr hume pray tell me said she what hour and at what place this young gentleman is to be found oh replied anthony you may always be sure to see him going to or returning from the exchange at the usual hours but you dont know him but i do sir says the son and his father too pefectly well that is enough says the mother you shall go and point him out to me and i warrant i do your business at that time they parted appointing to meet in the evening to know the success of their negotiation about the hour of twelve oclock away goes madam and her son and waited mr hume s coming to the change at his return from thence she follows him in a very poor garb suited to her purpose and implored his charity which he refusing she still persisting in her importunity till be growing tired hastily bid her begone upan which with an air of resentment she told him he need not be so short for twas in her power to do him more service by a secret knowledge she had than his trifling alms could possibly be of to her  and as a proof she bid him not bespeak his wedding clothes for she was well assured if he did they would be out of fashion for many years before he would want them this declaration startled the young gentleman and claimed his attention as he knew his marriage was near at hand he thought she must either know his person or have a supernatural understanding upon which he asked if she had any knowledge of him she answered no nor could she charge her memory with ever having seen him before but no matter for that at first sight of you i was rendered capable by the linaments of your face of teaching you to avoid a fatal snare you will suddenly fall into if you dont listen to what i can tell you said the old beldam mr hume s curiosity began to be raised so he ordered ber to go to a particular public house giving her sixpence and wait till he came not caring to be seen in the streets with such an object of misery as she at that time appeared to be  he was not long after when to the great surprise of the man of the house he called for a pint of wine and a private room ordering this old trapes to follow him up stairs upon which she directly told him in a kind of ambiguous phrase all that was contained in the letter mr anthony had read to him the night before and though he gave no credit to it at that time he then began to be staggered in his opinion and in short grew very uneasy after she had thoroughly workd up his imagination to an absolute credulity of every thing she uttered she told him though she was a stranger to his names she would be bound to tell him the first letters of each and that if she thought it worth while to study about it in a very few hours by her art though he were himself to lock her up upon condition she had her books with her she would tell him his names entire well says he to convince me of a likelihood of it tell me directly the first letters of my christian and surname j said she is the first of the christian and h the first of your surname mr hume was perfectly astonished and began to consider whether it was or was not possible for her to be mistress of so much art or whether she might not have had some private intelligence of whom he was and did this to get money from him but that he might be sure to trap her if he could he bid her if her art extended so far to tell him any one circumstance that would happen to him before he slept that i will sir and to convince you that i dont tell your fortune for the lucre of gain as many impostors do without knowing any thing of the matter you shall not give me a farthing more than the six pence i had of you in the street but i will tell you one thing that shall happen before you go to bed and i will meet you here tomorrow and if i tell you truth will leave it toyour own houour to reward me as you think fit to which he agreed and appointed to meet her next day at the same time and place and now let us hear what is to happen in particular to night pray sir say she let me see your hand which after she palmd and peerd over for about five minutes she looked very steadfastly at him and told him there was a young gentleman that he frequently conversed with and that to her thinking lived in the same house and for whom be had hitherto a very great friendship but something would happen that very night to break it off not that they would come to any high word but a foundation would be laid for a coldness that would grow into a mutual contempt of each other very speedily and that it would not be long before they came to reparation look ye sir said she i am the seventh daughter of the seventh son a common cant the real professors of fortune telling make use on and i have studied very deeply to acquire the knowledge i have in fate and ugh i am poor i know more than many who carry that heds very high but misfortunes which were not in my power to avert have reduced me to ask charity but now sir i will take my leave and wait you according to appointment away the pretended artist went to an alehouse where her son was to stay for her laughing in herself to think how dexterously she had imposed n the young gentlemans credulity and pling herself with the hopes of a handsome reward from him next day poor mr hume went home to dinner very disconsolate but was ashamed to tell the cause of his uneasiness for fear of being laughed at but when be inwardly ed like nt she had told him such tale  it bore great circumstance of truth he was half distracted and waited with impatience to see his friend anthony again that he might from him receive his care to unlade his breast from the load of grief it then sustained but as he had given his honor to be silent till they met again he concealed the cause though it was too obvious from his countenance that his mind was disturbed as well it might when laboring with the conflictious passions of love despair and rage  mr anthony whose wicked heart never rested till he had accomplished his barbarous design prompted him to fly with eager haste to his inferral instruments where he found the old caeature stripping out of her ragged attire and so pleased at the thoughts of her adventure she had scarce power to recite it for laughing however when he heard it he greatly approved the scheme and ordered her to make a swinging bowl of punch to drink to the success of her next expedition to the royal exchange  according to her instructions anthony posted away to young hume to forward the intent of making the breach between him and mr george that she might gain the greater credit and be thereby more amply enabled to carry on the plot and bring it speedily to perfection among the rest of her contrivances she advised mr anthony to engage his sister to a country dancing which was to be at a noted private house of distinction for the ladies of pleasure of the first order and contrive a means for young hume to know of her being there which would naturally confirm his growing jealousy and corroborate all that could be invented to raise it a tristing hint was sufficient and the evening for the ball was to be the old ladys undertaking at one lucass where every thing was prepared in a very elegant manner and the ladies being all let into the secret they and their sparks were admonished too with the utmost decorum and good breeding but of that we shall treat hereafter mr anthonys present business was to go and work upon poor mr hume whom he found sitting alone in the compting house reading in a very melancholy posture why how now says anthony why so pensive arnt you well indifferent replied mr hume i am a little chagrind in respect to the letter you read to me last night i have considered on it very deeply since and confess notwithstanding my seeming lncredulity to you that i am greatly alarmed but to act upon bare supposition strongly puzzles me as i am fond of your sister and too tenacious of her honor without some positive proof of her misconduct to accuse or condemn her but pray tell me mr elstone have you gained any farther knowledge concerning the affair partly says the other but whether it may serve as loop or hinge to hang a doubt on i cannot absolutely say poor impatient mr hume hastily demanded what it was expressing in his countenance all the agony of horror and distraction  nay nay says anthony put yourself out of temper so unreasonably till you hear what it is perhaps i may be mistaken in my conjecture and you may be working yourself into a disorder there is no grounds for but in short i happened to over hear an appointment between her and one of her particular intimates to go to a ball and the place appointed unless my ears deceived me is one of the most infamous houses in town do you know one lucas a famous retailer of beauty in or about white chapel know her answered young hume aye too well she is one of the most notorious bawds in christendom sure miss jenny is not engaged to go thither if so i shall no longer doubt the truth of  letter but however that is easily found out and you and i will go there and confront her in her wickedness with all my heart said anthony but first let me find out whether it is so or no and if it is so i will give you my word to go with you for i am certain there can be no good intent in a meeting of that kind at such a place that i am well assured on said young hume for i have experienced it for to tell you the truth before i fell in love with your sister i had a ridiculous affair of gallantry there which cost me a monstrous sum of money and had it not been for my attachmen to miss jenny might have continued still but the strict regard i paid to her brought me into a resolution rever more  associate with the terrible crew that reside in that house ittle dreaming ever to hear so angelic a creature as jenny appears should scandalously resolve to herd with such a set of devils but sure it is impossible added he yet be it as it may i am resolved to know the truth he then began to question whether george was of the party to which the other answered he was not certain nor was it very material to anthony to bring him into that scrape as he had two or three different pleas for georges ruin without making him a party in their affair to be short they concluded to come at the bottom of miss jennys designs and anthony shook hands with hume promising him to assist him in the discovery with many professions of the most solemn friendship mr george coming into the room they changed their discourse and anthony seemed highly delighted that the scene was changed between them and george on his part answered his falsehood with the tenderest marks of real love  as mr hume was not in a very extraordinary humor for campany anthony took leave and went to consult with his evil counselors what was farther to be do e to effect his cruel purposes upon which the old woman bid him if he could find out who was his sisters most particular intimate amongst the females oh i can tell you that directly there is one miss edwards in thames street who is jennys greatest favorite among all her acquaintance upon the least summons jenny will come into any scheme of pleasure so well serd her a note and i believe i have some of miss edwardss writing in my pocket which your son shall counterfeit and carry it directly to our house he is not known and may pass upon our family for one of mr edwardss servants  accordingly he gives a copy of verses of miss edwardss writing to young grimes who directly wrote the following epistle to miss elstone in a beautiful italian hand as follows my dear miss elstone on thursday evening i am engaged to a ceuntry dancing among a set of very agreeable people who though not your acquaintance are my very good friends and from the account they have heard of you from me are very desirous of your company and to be ranked among the number of your friends i will not take any denial so expect me to call on you about five in the afternoon and i will conduct you thiher in the mean time endeavor to persuade your brother george and mr hume lest we should want partners it is the young ladys birth day where we are to go and as it is to oblige her you will confer a double favor by accompanying  my dear miss jenny s friend elizabeth edwards ps i will not ask your brother anthony he is so cross i know he will refuse us       young grimes was dispatched with this letter to miss elstone who sent back her service to miss edwards and that she would be ready to wait on her if she would call at the hour appointed the thursday following and begged her pardon for not writing for her mamma had company and she was obliged to make tea directly  away comes grimes with his message which pleased mr anthony highly but when he said that there was company the old woman forgetting the answer through fear cries out to her son suppose the very gentleman should be there why then says anthony directly my sister would not have sent such an answer besides you simpleton said he i knew twas impossible for miss edwards is at her fathers country house at enfield and dont come to town this fortnight this was the reason why i pitched upon her to make the appointment that is well enough says the old woman then we are safe but what is to be done when miss is to call upon your sister why says anthony dick here shall carry a note to excuse her coming and entreat jenny to take coach directly and meet her at the ladys house where they are to pass the evening in the mean time do you be punctual to the hour in which you are to meet young hume so at present farewell i will not go up to poll this evening because i have no time to lose therefore dont own i have been here away he marched home and was immediately accosted by his sister who told him of her invitation from miss edwards and though she expected to be refused she was resolved to try if the brute would have complaisance enough to squire her to the bali which he peremptorily refused as she expected upon which his mother chide him telling him she wondered he would not endeavor to polish himself a little and throw off that roughness of behavior which he never had the least example of either from his father or brother he answered that dancing was no entertainment to him and that george would be glad of the opportunity so refered her to him  all that evening young hume and george elstone were at home alone but mr hume seemed very cold and distant in his discourse which greatly surprised poor mr george who often kindly enquired into the reason of his short manner of speaking to him desiring to know wherein he had offended him to which the other sullenly replied time would show he could not but own he was offended in the highest degree and did not doubt but mr george was sensible enough of the occasion in this manner they conversed for some hours till they parted with a downright querrel as well mr george might to meet with such unexpected ill treatment from his friend without a cause or knowing what was the motive of so sudden and unkind a change in the temper of one who till that time had ever treated bim with the utmost marks of friendly tenderness it is not to be supposed that either these persons enjoyed much rest that night next morning when they met mr hume be retained the sullen mood he went to bed with mr george being conscious of not having deserved this unaccountable alieration in his friend took as little notice of him but each went to their business without exchanging a syllable at change time mr hume went out and from thence to his appointment with his expected fortunetellor who was punctual to a minute he found her at the door of the alehouse in the same tattered trim she appeared in the day before but as he thought the landlord might wonder to see him twice together in such company he beckoned her to him before he got to the house and directed to another in the next street when they were got together well sir says she have i told you truth or no indeed says he you have and though i am not pleased at it yet i am bound in honor to reward you and directly gave her a crown which he supposed would be a valuable present for one in her seeming wretched circumstance but madam expected gold not considering that many a fortune tellers would have thought him an excellent chap now says he if you can tell me any thing farther that is material i will double that sum tomorrow ah sir said she i can tell you any thing you want to know but i wish you would double the sum now for i want to buy a few clothes to my back for you see i am very bare and to convince you that i am skilled in my art i have only this to say to you whatever you do listen to one particular man who is your friend on which she described anthony s person to a hair and gave him the first letters of his names to his very great astonishment and afterward describing george she bid him carefully avoid such a one assuring him that under the mask of friendship he was a bitter enemy she also bid him beware of a fair young woman and farther added that where he loved most he had the least occasion now sir i have said as much to you as i think will be serviceable to you and will take my leave upon which he gave her another crown and they parted mr hume first enjoining her to meet him again in two or three days but she took care not to keep her word for fear through any accident she might be found out  the day being come when the ball was to be miss elstone was very elegantly dressed waiting at home for miss edwards but inhead of the young lady young grimes brings a second letter to request miss jenny would take coach and come directly with their man to wait on her there and begged her excuse for not waiting on her herself for the young lady whose birth day it was had sent their coach for her which had three more in it but that she was there ready to introduce her this passed current with poor miss and away she went with dick behind the coach to attend her when she came to the appointed place she was received by the pretended young lady with the highest elegance and respectful breeding miss elstone was under a good dea of confusion when she found her friend not there but the lady who received her begged her not to be uneasy for miss edwards had been there and left her compliments to her that she was only gone to persuade another young lady to come whom nobody but miss edwards could prevail on to oblige them with their company tea was immediately ordered after which a glass of wine round but still no miss edwards appeared and miss elstone being among a set of strangers she began to grow very uneasy at last up came half a dozen beaus who were immediately addressing miss elstone who was an undoubted beauty which was considerably heightened by an unaffected modesty  at last the music came and with much difficulty miss elstone was prevailed on to lead down one dance which when ended she positively insined upon going home but as every body there present had their cues from mr anthony who paid the expense of the whole nights entertainment she was not suffered to stir she was not only excessively uneasy but began to suspect by her friend not appearing there was some design laid against her yet miss edwardss hand being so well counterfeited she thought herself wrong to suppose that so worthy a young lady would keep bad company and began to be a little more composed but the evening being pretty far spent she again insisted upon going home but the company one and all insisted upon her staying supper to which she sat down but never eat a morsel and upon attempting to slip out after the cloth was taken away while they were pretending to settle a dance she found the dining room door double locked upon which she shrieked out crying oh heavens i am undone she then began to reflect on herself for not asking mr hume and her brother george to be of the party and found too late there was some wicked fraud in the affair the old lady of the house seeing her burst into tears asked her the reason assuring her she was among friends and that she was surprised she should discover such dreadful signs of uneasiness if madam answered miss jenny i am among friends what is the reason notwithstanding my frequent solicitation to go home i have not only been detained against my will but must have this door locked upon me why child says the old lady you will not think of going home till morning there is a bed for you it is my daughters birth day and we are resolved to make a night on it at these words miss jenny fell into a soon and one fit was succeeded so fast by the other that they were obliged to undress and put her to bed where when she came a little to herself and found how she was disposed she fell into strong convulsions which lasted for a considerable time the old jade who kept the house began to repent having any concern in the affair and privately sent word to mr anthony the danger his sister was in and that they might be rumed upon his account he directly sent word not to own to any living mortal that she was there and that he would be with them early in the morning and get her removed  about ten the next day he went and ill as she was being lightheaded in a violent fever she was conveyed to mother grimess house and put to bed there in a garret this secured mrs lucas and was the dreadful means of poor miss jennys being never after permitted to see her distracted parents as they did not know the place where she was as they thought to meet miss edwards twas impossible for her to send but when it grew near twelve oclock her father took coach to mr edwardss house but the family were in bed but he persisting in knocking at the door a servant looking out of window he asked for his daughter and miss edwards they told him their young lady was down at endfield and was not expected home for a fortnight and that miss elstone had not been at their house for several days past mr elstone returned home full of distracted thoughts about his child and through excessive tenderness to his wife who was just before gone to bed he concealed his grief that night but in the morning it burst it is passage through his heart and mrs elstone was soon made the melancholy partner of his sorrow mr anthony was called on to assist in endeavoring to find her out and with a pretended grief set out on that occasion but in fact was carefully employed in removing his hapless sister to that shocking seat of infamy beforementioned the whole family were dispersed to different parts of the town but to no purpose mr george was sent for who was doubly assiduous in the pursuit of her and that she might be more likely to be found he advertised her and by his fathers order offered a thousand pounds reward to any person who should produce her living or dead young mr hume was quite convinced that she was false and credited every thing her brother anthony had insinuated against her but when the whole mischief was perfected by her wicked brother and his accomplices it had a different effect on her lover than either he or anthony imagined for despair and grief reduced him to a raging madness which immediately seized him and he was obliged forthwith to be confined in a private noted mad house at chelsea after two or three days ineffectual search her viliainous brother with a mixture of pretended grief and anger produces the forged letter he had shown to poor young hume and gave it his father to read which when he had done he vowed severest vengeance on his son george and as her absence corroborated with the contents no arguments could convince him to the contrary of what was inserted in the letter mr elstone flew with the utmost rage to mr humes and showed him the letter which when poor george came to be acquainted with his distress was not to be painted or conceived his father and master were equally enraged the one for the positive loss of his daughter and the other for the dreadful apprehension of the loss of his son  mr george used all the arguments he was master of to convince him how highly they all were injured by that letter but to no purpose mr hume gave up his indentures and the father forbid him from that instant ever to see him more nor did he leave the place till he saw his son absolutely turned out of doors the poor melancholy youth went to a friends house where he was very frequent in his visits and was greatly esteemed as he truly deserved when he told the story of his being deserted both by his father and master for a fault he was not guilty of nor ever could though reduced to the lowest ebb of fortune his friend greatly pitied his distress and promised him all the assistance in his power toward his relief first he advised him to insist on his masters turning him over to another or permit him to serve out his time with him but that mr george declined till he had first endeavored to clear up his reputation with his father which both he and his friend took infinite pains to do but to no purpose so far from it that mr jennison who was the person who espoused mr georges cause offering to be at any expense toward finding out the author of the letter which had caused the separation of the father and son he was desired never more to darken the doors for any person that would plead in georges behalf would only be regarded in an equal light mr jennison finding his advocation out of tune resolved never to trouble the old gentleman again but in every other point to serve the unhappy youth to the extent of his power  mrs elstone despairing of ever seeing her daughter more sickened and languished out a few weeks till death terminated the most sincere and real sorrow that maternal fondness ever felt  mr anthony took particular care to behave with all the duty and affection to his father that hypocrisy was capable of acting and as an addition to his deceit upon the fathers declaration of cutting off the brother with a shilling and making him his sole heir he begged him to forego so severe a resolution as it must necessarily make him very unhappy to know he was possessed of an affluence while they perhaps were wandering through the world in search of bread  this seeming tenderness made the fond believing father still more a friend to his worthless wicked son and in short he settled the whole of what he was worth upon him and his heirs for ever which when he came to possess would have made him master of about twenty thousand pounds as mr elstone was very industrious and successful in his business he acquired in fewer years than any merchant had ever been known to do before him  young mr humes madness daily increased and continued for the space of fifteen months at the end of which time he expired raving to the neverceasing sorrow of his discensolate father this young gentlemans sad catastrophe was the lucky means of preventing the discovery of anthonys villainy for had he retained his senses but an hour after he heard of miss jennys departure from her fathers house he would undoubtedly have cleared up every point as circumstances would have so strongly concurred to have proved the innocence of the abused party and the unparalled wickedness of him who was the base contriver of this shocking scene of ruin  poor miss jenny continued so very ill for near three weeks that her life was hourly despaired of which news pleased anthony extremely well but mrs grimes who always consulted her own interest was resolved seeing her a beautiful creature to spare neither cost or pains to restore her and as her brother refused to advance a single shilling upon that score the old woman took misss clothes and jewels in which she was brought to her house and sold them to the best advantages which amounted to a considerable value out of which she laid out about five pounds to cloth the poor unfortnate girl in a plain manner as soon as she was able to sit up and when she was tolerably recovered resolved to make her market of her and that she might be secure of her prey she kept her locked up never suffering any mortal to go nigh her but herself and son stil providing every thing necessary for her and to poor misss imagination behaving with the motherly tenderness of a disinterested old woman  this poor girl on the recovery of her senses demanded by what means she was brought thither upon which the old woman mumps up a tale of seeing her in the hands of wicked people and though a stranger she rescued her from them and poor as she was had her brought home to her house to prevent ill usage she must unavoidably have met with where she was for do you know madam said she the house you was brought from was no less than a common brothel and if the wicked jade who keeps it had not been frighted out of her senses seeing you to be a person of condition you had not escaped so luckily but she knew i was too well acquainted with her tricks and have it in my power to hang her if i had a mind therefore was glad to let you go at any rate i am sure my poor old heart bled to see your danger and glad i am to find you are likely to do well again then forcing a dissembled tear or two she desired miss to acquaint her with her name and family all which the infamous wretch knew before but the poor unhappy victim directly told her who she was and entreated her to take a letter from her to her fathers house and go herself with it as she was best able to give an account of the melancholy cause of her absence in short letter after letter was wrote for several days but all committed to the flames by mrs grimes who pretended that her father would send no answer and in fine that she was forbid ever to bring any more for he positively resolved never to see or hear of her again she told her her mother was dead on the account the loss of whom as she was looked on to be the occasion of her death greatly added to her fathers anger which by all she could learn was irrevocably fixed against her the poor thing also wrote several letters to her brother george which met the same fate of those intended for her father such a multiplicity of sorrows might reasonably be thought sufficient to break an adamantine heart but it pleased heaven to preserve this unhappy maid and furnish her with strength to bear the severest griefs her fate could possibly inflict when the old woman brought her new plain clothes to put on she pretended they were her daughters which she lent her to save her own for which this poor innocent was very thankful and thought herself highly obliged but on her being able to walk about and entreating to walk down stairs she was terribly startled at mrs grimes refusing to let her out of the room and still insisting to lock her in alleging that it was dangerous for her to go out lest she should be way laid and intrapd by those wicked people she had redeemed her from besides said she you want for nothing and my son and i will be with you as frequently as possible and till you have gathered strength you are much better in your own apartment than by catching cold run the hazard of a relapse poor miss jenny was in the lions paws and obliged to comply but began to have a secret dread at richards approach who had for his three or four last visits pretended to be mighty fond of her and as she was too often in his power she feared the cnsequences of it which one evening had liked to have proved very fatal had it not been for a sudden accident which prevented it mrs grimes was gone out for the whole day and left a strict charge with her son dick to take all imaginable care of poor jenny which he promised very saithfully to do paying her several visits and behaved very decently at last he proposed if she pleased to play a game at cards with her to pass away a few melancholy hours which she with great reluctance at last consented to it growing pretty late in the evening according to his order the maid brought up a roasted fowl for supper and a bowl of punch dick still behaving with the utmost complaisance his mother not being come home he entreated the favor to  with her after supper which he did till all the family were gone to bed except the maid who sat up for her mistress when he was quite assured that all was safe master richard began to be very amorous and thereby troublesome to the poor soul who sat trembling by him with terrible apprehensions of his using the horrid power he had to do her the greatest injury in the world at last he began to take such freedoms as too plainly convinced her of his cruel design on which she shrieked out and he being only possessed of a brutal passion struck her menacing severest vengeance on her if she dared to speak above her breath telling her plainly he would not stirout of the room till he had gained his ends the poor soul struggled with him till she had no longer strength to resist him and throwing her on the bed and intended sacrifice to his brutality before he could accomplish his wicked purpose a dreadful outery of fire was heard in the street and though a terrible circumstance proved the happy means of miss jennys deliverance the very next door was a very great oilshop which was unhappily set on fire through the carelessness of a servant who was very sleepy going to bed leaving the candle in an old matted chair and in less than two hours most of the houses were consumed on that side of the street dick was alarmed at the outery and ran down directly and poor jenny after him as well as she could though more terrified at the thoughts of the danger she was in resolved within herself to take that opportunity of escaping from her prison late as it was was determined to sit all night in the street rather than run the chance of being ruined by that infamous fellow in her weak condition the reader may suppose with the addition of her fright she must be terribly reduced  richard in his confusion never missed or thought of her till next morning and could not very well tell whether she came out of the room when he did or perished in the flames for his mothers house was reduced to ashes before she came home when to her great surprise she found she had not a place to shelter herself nor bed to lie on as the neighborhood in every street about are naturally asarmed at such dreadful disasters poor jenny was luckily met by a goodnatured man who was going to the fire and perceiving by her looks she was just come from it he advised her to go in and set down in the watchhouse but she told him she had no money and she supposed they would not let her set there for nothing upon which he conducted her and giving the watchmen a shilling with positive orders to take care of her that night  in the morning she wandered to mr humes in hopes of seeing her brother george bat how great was her amazement when she heard of his being turned away in the manner he was and when she was informed ofher lovers death she was like a distracted creature farther she was told her father had cut both her and mr george off with a shilling and made anthony his sole heir and that all was owing to her running away and george being thought accessory to it this information she received from an old servant of mr humes who was left in care of his house till it was let his master since his sons death having lest off business and retired into the country  miss jenny assured the good man of her and her brothers innocence alleging that she found they had been both betrayed but by whom she could not tell she then requested him to go to her father with a letter but he assured her it would be a sruitless attempt for he was so enraged he would not suffer here is or mr georges name to be mentioned in his hearing what to do in this exquisite distress she could not tell however one gleam of comfort appeared through all this cloud of sorrow for she got information where to find mr george at mr jennisons the goodnatured man sent for a coach to conduct her thither and believing her to be quite innocent and positively an injured person slipped a guinea into her hand and wishing her better fortune begged her not to be seen there again as it might endanger his losing his place if it should be known when she arrived at mr jennisons the joy of seeing her brother greatly alleviated her misery as the unexpected interview did his they wept and kindly condoled each others fate but from what cause it sprung they neither of them could imagine the cause said mr jennison is plain enough your brother anthony is at the bottom on it as sure as light and he has gained his point and take my word for it one day or other when it may be too late his villainy may be discovered however you may depend on this friend george while i am master of a shilling neither you or miss jenny shall want though said he sighing heaven only knows how long that may be for things are not with me now as formerly as indeed it soon after proved for the poor gentleman was in about six weeks time obliged to step aside and all he was worth in the world was not sufficient to answer the large demands upon him which was chiefly occasioned through considerable losses in trade  this unlucky stroke of fortune drove poor george and his sister into the wide world but they never separated shifting for three years as well as they could for daily bread miss jenny earned what she could by her needle at best poor subsistence and her brother whose credit was broke amongst the merchants undertook to teach those accounts and kept a little school but with much difficulty between them both could raise even a homely livelihood  mrs grimes upon her misfortune went to mr anthony elstone to claim his promise of the five hundred pound which be would have declined as not being in immediate possession of the fortune but she insisted on a bond which he gave her out of fear of a discovery as to his sister she was concluded to have perished by the fire as they had never heard any thing of her since  as providence has in itself several wonderful and surprising turns i must now give a very remarkable instance of its care of poor george and his sister jane georges reputation having been so cruelly blasted in the city he chose to reside at a different end of the town for which reason he took a couple of rooms in one of the little streets near red lion square and in an evening in the summer time would frequently take a walk with his sister up as far as pancras and at the end of one of redlion fields he had for many weeks observed a venerable clean old man who did not ask charity but bowed with a submissive supplicating look that claimed a human regard from every passer by among the rest poor george and jenny as often as they could would throw in their mites and with so tender and compassionate an air it seemed rather an obligation to themselves than to the person on whom they bestowed their kind benevolence the poor old man had taken particular notice of this couple whom he took for man and wife but observed something in their aspect and deportment that declared them what they really were two well bred distressed people and resolved within himself the next time he saw them to be better acquainted with them soon after they took their evening walk and the old man spying them at a distance made toward them and met them half way the field my good master said he i beg pardon for stopping you but i have been often obliged to your friendly charity and am now come to thank you for it in a particular manner and if you will condescend to give a poor man your company for few moments i will conduct you to a house where we can more freely converse than in this place dont be offended sir nor you my good mistress for what i have to say is worth your attenuca and if you should not approve of a proposal i have to make you i can but ask your pardon and trouble you no farther they answered him in a very good natured and obliging manner and consented to walk back to powis wells where they called for a private room and the old man to their great surprise ordered a cloth to be laid and the table was spread in an instant with a cold fowl and a place of ham and a bottle of wine he threw aside his crutches and begged of em not to be surprised if he took the liberty to alter his countenance which he did by taking of a long gray beard and his worsted cap and placing in its  a very neat bob wig he had in his pocket this tranformation discovered him to be a very handsome man very little more than forty years of age and when he pulled off his washleather gloves to sit at table made another discovery of the finest and whitest hand they had ever beheld he helped mr george and his sister in a very polite manner and before he eat drank a glass of wine to a lasting fendship between them which they very readily pledged  we have regaled said he if you are not in haste i will tell you the reason why i have asked this favor of you and hope it will prove as agreeable to you as i have some reason to believe it will be to me they soon finished their collation and when the things were taken away he ordered the landlord not to let any body come to them till they rang which in a very respectful manner he said they should not on which he began asking mr george first of all whether they were man and wife and upon hearing they were only brother and sister they perceived an unusual joy sparkle in his eyes and begged the favor of miss jenny to favor him with the privilege of saluting her which she did and now madam said he give me leave to inform you that though i live by charity i am better able to bestow it than three parts of those from whom i receive it but i hope as i design to do good with what i have got i shall not be blamed for the means by which i have acquired an immense fortune and the first step toward it i humbly offer that and an honest heart to make you honorably happy for the remaining part of life  i own madam said he this is a sudden attack upon your modesty but as it flows from the result of a tender passion i have for some weeks past sustained for you i hope you will excuse this quick manner of requesting the only blessing i wish to enjoy on eath miss jenny blushed and was at a loss for words to express her thanks and avoid the appearance of being either forward in complying or impertinently rejecting if what he said was true must be a very advantageous offer but to prevent her confusion her brother answered for her entreating the gentleman which he perceived he was not to insalt on a positive answer till they were a little better acquainted for sir said he we are two unfortunate twins who have sustained very great injuries which have made us the outcast of our families and cut us of from a very good inheritance which i believe would have amounted to near seven thousand pounds a piece now sir our misfortunes have taught us rather to increase that store of friendship we imbibed from infancy therefore through every change of life i am resolved to be a faithful guardian to my sisters honor and protect her even at lifes expense from any danger she may be liable to not that i suspect any ill from you sir and hope you will not be offended at my cautious care for so dear and near a relation no sir replied the other i rather applaud than condemn you for it but as earnest of my truth i beg sir you will do me the favor to accept of this trifle for your present use putting into his hand a silk purse with fifty guineas in it tomorrow i desire to see you and this fair lady at my house by dinner please to enquire for mr cornish at the two red lamps in deanstreet soho where you will find every thing i hope agreeable to you and your sisters expectations i will not detain you longer but beg you to consider well on what i have offered and know me hereafter as a friend and i hope a brother they took leave and the gentleman resumed his venerable appearance and discharging the reckoning he went to his stand till evening and went home well pleased at his afternoons adventure mr george had a great deal of reason to conceive a high opinion of his new acquaintance and advised his sister to resolve upon the match which she promised to do in case every thing answered to what he had told them  next day he went to deanstreet and upon the coach stopping at the door was opened by a footman in a laced livery before the coachman could get off his box and mr cornish dressed like a man of fashion ready to hand the lady in whom he conducted into a very handsome dining room splendidly furnished and at one end a noble sideboard of plate fit for a nobleman now madam said he permit me to bid you welcome to your house for that and all that it contains is yours if you please to except of it she bowed and blushed and mr cornish continued paying his addresses in the politest manner possible dinner was served at which there was fifteen dishes five at a course with the best the season of the year afforded when that ceremony was over mr cornish brought mr elstone a pocket book out of which he counted out bank notes to the amount of upwards of forty thousand pounds which he and his father before him had amassed by begging yet this is not all that i am worth for i have several houses and have often received charity from my tenants in their coaches who at the same time did not know they were relieving their landlord i have but one servant belonging to me that knows any thing of my course of life and he is an old fellow that lived with my father before my remembrance he always attends me to our house of rendezvous and is principal secretary of our begging state in short they passed the afternoon with a recital of both their fortunes and mr cornish heard of the cruelty of george and jennys fate he shed a kind commiserating tear for both but most especially for miss jenny whom he loved and was pleased to find she had an equal share of sense and beauty after they had told their separate tales mr cornish requested em to pass the evening and as mr elstone was perfectly convinced of his being in all points capable of making his sister happy on mr cornishs moving his suit again twas concluded in a few days to fix their widding which was at queenssquare chapel near ormondstreet and as mr cornish was king of the begging crew there was a grand festival held the next day at their house of rendezvous where he resigned his throne to another allowing a yearly pension to support the dignity of their society which was kept in more exact order and strict decorum than some constitutions which might fare much better if they were governed by their example  the wedding was kept at home with great splendour where was present a young lady of ten thousand pound fortune who changed hearts at first sight with mr elstone but he not having it in his power to address the young lady for want of an equivalent stipend he heartily sighed for her till his brotherinlaw perceiving him grow melancholy enquiring into the cause soon made up the match to the unspeakable satisfaction of both parties  as providence had been careful in rewarding these injured innocents so was it no less concerned in punishing the guilty as will appear by the powerful end of mr anthony who was in a visit to mr hume attacked on the road by a party of highwaymen whom he endeavored to rest but they resolvidg on their booty shot at him which not proving effectual they drew their hangers and stabbed him in different parts of his body and left him weltering in his blood upon the road where he soon expired the highwaymen made off and the deceased was soon owned by some passengers coming along the road the news was directly carried to town to his father who grieved much for him till in a few days upon searching in his closet he found several papers under his own hand which fully discovered the villainy he had been guilty of to his injured brother and sister mr elstone greatly condemned his hasty credulity to the ruin of as he feared of his unhappy son and daughter nor did he know whether they were living or dead his old friend mr hume upon hearing the news of anthonys death came to town to pay him a visit of condolence but when he saw the memorials of his villainy to his brother and sister he rather congratulated him on the happy ridance of so infamous a burden and disgrace to his family but now said mr hume your business is to make a strict enquiry after your abused children and by a tender reconciliation endeavor to make them the best amends you can for all their sufferings the only ready means is to advertise in case they are living that if they will return to you they will find all that can be wished for to make them happy and as i hope to be a witness of so pleasing an interview i will stay in town the whole week to join my blessing with yours to poor jenny who was once my intended soninlaw the remembce of which drew tears from the good old gentlemans eyes in respect to the tender love he bore his son and farther said he i have a pardon to ask of poor george for so rashly forcing upon him his indentures and thereby ruining his credit among the merchants an advertisement was sent over night which mr george reading at breakfast next morning he went with his sister directly  overjoyed to throw themselves once again a their fathers feet mr hume bore an equal share of tenderness at the sight of these worthy persons and declared an honorable intention of making them both his heirs which entitled em to five and twenty thousand pounds each through the hurry and surprising joy of meeting neither of the old gentlemen had time to observe the splendid appearance they made but at last mr hume looking through the dining room sash saw a very handsome gilt coach at the door and asking whose it was mine said mrs cornish sir on which she related the story of her fortune from the time of her being decoyed from her father to her marriage as did mr george the same and next day great preparations were made for the reception of their spouses who to make amends for past affections mutaully agreed to retire all together at an ancient seat mr cornish had purchased a few years before where they pass the remains of life in an uninterrupted state of for egard and general tranquillity  finis
