obscure arose and graced his humble name iv yet not the early wreath of fame with haughtiness was twined nor pride nor fickleness could claim the empire of his mind v the lowly hut beneath whose roof he sighed a sad adieu received him time and distanceproof to love and mary true vi this hamletfair by fortune scorned seemed natures favorite child with hand profuse by her adorned  the flowret of the wild vii her neat but homely garment pressed the pure the feeling heart often sought in vain behind the vest of decorated art viii if sharing all thy cares she said has paled my beautys rose ah know for thee the heart that bled with all its passion glows ix blessed moment to my wish that gives the long long absent youth he lives  thendeard cabeysa lives and love confirms the truth x when thy brave comrades fell around what powrs benignant care secured thee from the fatal wound and mary from despair xi often in the troubling dream of night i saw the rushing spear nor did the morns awakning

delay say mary shall tomorrows sun illume our nuptial day xiv with look declined she blushed consent  reserve that takes alarm and love and joy their influence lent to raise meek beautys charm xv the guests to hail the wedded pair beneath their roof repaired with them the little feast to share their scanty purse prepared xvi though no delicious wines were poured mirth took his destined place the handmaid neatness spread the board and sage content said grace xvii scarce through one hasty week had love his grateful blessings shed when bliss as flies the frighted dove their humble mansion fled

said should thou depart shall i and sorrow do xx say valiant youth when you are away who will raise my drooping head how shall i chase the fears that say thy loved cabeysas dead xxi with thine my fate i now involve intent thy course to steer no words shall shake my firm resolve not even that trickling tear xxii framed for each scene of soft delight he said thy gentle form as shrinks the lily at the blight will droop beneath the storm xxiii blessed in thy presence every pain she added brings its charm and love though falls the beating rain will keep this bosom warm xxiv her zeal the supplement of strength upheld her many a day but natures powers subdued at length on sickness couch she lay xxv three painful days unseen she lay of him she held so dear ah does he thus my love repay she said  and dropped a tear xxvi cabeysa at a leagues remove dwells on the tentspread hill ah wherefore did he vow true love and not that vow fulfill xxvii yet not deficiency of truth forbad to yield relief stern power withheld the tender youth and duty to his chief xxviii who wiselycounseld drew a line to check the hand of stealth that ravaged wide the encircling vine the humble peasants wealth xxix to pass the line it was ordained whoever should presume should a deserter be arraigned and meet the cowards doom xxx this law by equity approved and to the peasant dear soon to the brave cabeysa proved destructively severe xxxi now marys image haunts his soul in woes dark tints arrayed while to his breast compassion stole and all her claims displayed xxxii for me her native home he said for me each weeping friend for me a fathers arms she fled  and shall not love attend xxxiii say for a chosen lovers sake what more could woman do and now that health and peace forsake shall i forsake her too xxxiv now stretched upon the naked ground oppressed with pain and fear she casts a languid eye around nor sees cabeysa near xxxv now now she weeps at my delay and shall neglect be mine submit ye fears to pitys sway he spoke  and crossed the line xxxvi soon at his sight the fair resumed each captivating grace on her pale cheek the rose rebloomd and smiles illumd her face xxxvii yet to that cheek returned in vain bright healths vermilion dye for bitter tears that cheek shall stain and dim her brilliant eye xxxviii the youth returning through the gloom at midnights secret hour was seized  and to dishonours tomb doomed by the martial power xxxix to meet his fate at wake of day loves victim he was led no weakness did his cheek betray while to the chief he said xl if in the battle death i have dared in all its horror dressed think not this scene by thee prepared sheds terror on my breast xli yet at marias hapless fate my fortitude impairs unmannd i sink beneath the weight of her oppressive cares xlii ah when her grieftorn heart shall bleed some little solace grant oh guard her in the hour of need from the rude hand of want xliii now kneeling on the fatal spot he twined the darkning band the twelve who drew thunwelcome lot reluctant took their stand xliv and now the murmuring throng grew dumb twas silence all  save where at intervals the mournful drum struck horror on the ear xlv now with their deathfraught tubes upreard the destined twelve were seen  and now the explosion dire was heard that closed cabeysas scene xlvi another scene remained behind for mary to supply  she comes mark how her tortured mind speaks through thexpressive eye xlvii forbear  will ye in blood she said your cruel hands imbrue on me on me your vengeance shed to me alone it is due xlviii relent  and to these arms again the valiant youth restore i rave  already on the plain he welters in his gore xlix advancing now she pierced the crowd and reached the fatal place where listing from the corse the shroud no semblance could she trace l is this  oh blasting view she cried the youth who loved too well his love for me the law defied and for that love he fell li when will the grave this form receive the grave to which he is fled there only there i will cease to grieve she spoke  and joined the dead finis
