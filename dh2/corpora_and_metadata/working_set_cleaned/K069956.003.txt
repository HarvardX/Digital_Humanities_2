family secrets literary and domestic  by mr pratt  in five volumes  vol iii  the ways of heaven are dark and intricate puzzled in mazes and perplexed with errors addison london printed for t n longman paternosterrow        to the reverend mr potter prebendary of norwich notwithstanding the real and acknowledged corruptions of the times and the alarming spirit of depravity which has more or less pervaded all orders or men in despite also of the piteous whine in which hypocrisy affects to bewail and the cant of those censors who with more suspicious vehemence rave at the state of universal degeneracy  a writer whose aim it is to illumine written language  which is but the dead letter  by models of existing rectitude from the living volume can be at no loss to find such models even at this day in every class of society indeed any difficulty of this kind argues the declaimer to be himself destitute of respectable connexions and to have kept very bad company  in taking a survey of the sacred profession to give the energy of an example to a rule which is intended to exhibit a man venerable by his years of the holy order and of exemplary conduct save in the frailty that confessedly shades his character a numerous and honorable train will offer itself to the mind of every virtuous reader and the difficulty will consist only in the variety prescribed for selection but it will unquestionably be admitted by the lovers of private virtue and the admirers of public talents and by the sacred body of which he has been for near half a century a respectable member that a more pious man a more affectionate friend a more tender parent or a more zealous minister of the protestant faith  unblemished by the infirmities which attach to the character of sir armine fitzorton

armines purpose he loitered behind complained that the relics of the gout still enfeebled him and alas my beloved my favorite and most favored son said he i literally stand in need of a support a dear and tender child is the best crutch on which a parent can lean it is one which providence bestowed in the days of his youth to sustain and to comfort his age  here sir armine took hold of henrys arm  they were both silent for some paces whata reliance is this resumed sir armine leaning on henry it is a pillar that sustains the soul as well as the body at this blessed moment i feel myself as firmly protected as if the vigor of my own springtime of life were returned the plant i reared repays my care it is become the most goodly tree of my little garden  he paused a moment to press on henrys arm yet more forcibly and though continued he i am now grown weaker than the shrub that the next rude blast may level with the dust this filial support shall prove a better dependence than the branches of the proudest oak yea were they formed into crutches lined with the down of the cygnets bosom nay in the conflict of my last hour which you know my henry cannot be remote this prop  lifting up his sons wreathed arm to his lips  shall attemper the storm of death and give me on the verge of the world a foretaste of what awaits an honored parent and an expiring christian in heaven  a perfect reliance on the heavenly father  henrys present emotions excited by this discourse annihilated the past and in remembering he was a son he even forgot he was a lover returning his fathers embraces with tearful rapture he conjured him in a voice that the union of love and duty only can inspire  he conjured him to lean the whole weight of that body and of that soul sir armine had mentioned entirely upon him  the strength of my affection is equal to it all said he  i believe hope and feel it henry returned sir armine and the trial that is preparing will but confirm the assertion  he paused and wept  the life or death of his father is in the hands of his son henry you must prepare early tomorrow to begin a journey in company with mr clare his daughter and myself a journey my son at the end of which if youth beauty and innocence if fame fortune and love unbounded if that religion of which i hope soon to see you  with all humility be it spoken  a worthy minister if all these in blessed union can render a human being happy you will be the happiest of mankind  henry upon whom was now forced a remembrance of himself was about to reply when sir armine seeing something of resistance and agitation in his air pressed more eagerly his hand and said  name not to me your bosom prepossessions inasmuch as you conquer them for the sake of what you owe to duty and religion that is to me and to god you will be meritorious the matter lies in a narrow compass continued sir armine raising his voice awfully and dropping henrys hand  you selfishly unite yourself to the daughter of your fathers enemy enemy to his person family and faith whatever gloss he may i fear for no virtuous reason now put upon it or to the daughter of your fathers friend in all things that can give a title to that sacred character and in one word instead of my dying thanks my expiring reproaches will attend you as your determination prospers or opposes this great object of my bane or blessing it is superfluous for me to say more and i will expect your answer in your conduct not your words with me when my opinion is formed they are only waste of time you know  without waiting for reply of any kind sir armine hastened unsupported to the castle dreading more the pain of a speech that might thwart his favorite purpose than the pangs of his gout or perhaps he lost the sense of the latter in the greater apprehension of the former  they were indeed within a few paces of the castle as henry was ascending in disordered silence the steps at which olivia and lady fitzorton presented themselves to view the former had tript down the long flight of stairs to give her arm to sir armine and as she was conducting the old gentleman in this manner henry took notice of a circumstance which added not a little to his confusion he perceived that olivia had quitted her mourning and was for the first time since the death of a relation of the family in colors lady fitzorton perceiving he observed this whispered to him to follow the example since the white hours said she blessed be god are at last returned well might he have replied in the language of hamlet  it is not alone this inky cloak good mother nor customary suits of solemn black that can denote me truly the embarrassment however of any reply was taken off by the appearance of the good old mr clare who coming up to henry with an air and aspect of ineffable benignity exclaimed but it was plain to be seen he had been weeping at length henry i am about to entrust you with a treasure which were i not assured you know how to prize even according to its value i would not for all the wealth of all the worlds that pay homage to their god below or above put you in possession of but at present i must borrow her a few minutes even from you having occasion for her services  olivia and her father left the room henrys heart seemed ready to burst with variety of agonies suppressed and uttering a terrifying groan he flung himself first into a chair and then at sir armines feet passionately embracing his knees with one hand and lady fitzortons arm with the other  his parents raised him from his prostrate posture and each taking hold of him  son said sir armine nothing truly great or noble was ever done without exertion the sublime duties demand and deserve it you are trusted with all my motives you are in the confidence of my situation a confidence denied to the rest of my children  for i have neither told john nor james of my misfortune nor of the generosity that removed it to you i would owe the reestablishment of your family after the appeals which have been made to your conscience on the points of filial duty and religion it were needless to add more reasons for your ready obedience but i am this day permitted to inform you that sir rowland firtzorton allied equally to our family and to that of the clares has left the adsell estate which yields seven thousand pounds a year to olivia on condition only of her marrying one of our name and blood and the fortune goes out of both families to public uses specified in his whimsical will in case she fulfils not the obligation by way of generous surprise to your heart which she has all along believed wanted no inducement in its love it has been olivias prayer to her father that this circumstance should be reserved to the hour at which the day of marriage might be fixed and though my friend and i have faithfully kept promise it has been with much difficulty she has adhered to her own resolves on the idea of its being cruel to withhold from you any good  generous even to cruelty sighed henry  amongst other singularities of the testator he has stipulated resumed sir armine to have the marriage ceremony  for shame my son be more firm at what do you tremble to have i say the marriage ceremony performed at the altar of the chapel where he himself was united to his lady and that the wedding should be kept holy in the room which was his own bridal apartment giving as a reason for this a superstitious but yet tender prophecy that the young couple would be the happier from celebrating their nuptials in the place which confirmed his own felicity with the loveliest and best of women  surely my beloved child said lady fitzorton gently pressing his hand to her bosom these accumulated motives might reconcile a heart like yours to forego a partiality which whatever may be the merit of the object neither duty to your parents your friends nor yourself permits you to cherish i might have added duty to your god for though you have of late neglected all offices all studies you cannot but feel that a sacred profession should again be cultivated  sir armine perceiving henry still agitated and divided what part to take his embraces testifying the desire he had to obey and his tears manifesting his passion for caroline henry said sir armine no good man can be miserable with olivia clare and no good man under like circumstances could be happy with caroline stuart  henry still shuddered at the name and he seemed to think that if it was intended he should profit by good counsel this was not a time to couple olivia with caroline in any admonition  sir armine pointed to lady fitzorton and said behold an illustrious example for you to follow this beloved woman was the object of my affectionate esteem not of my youthful enthusiasm a great and commanding duty first united me i did not romantically love but i did mor i revered i honored on that honor that reverence i made her my wife since which more than half a century has gone smiling by and in all that time she has been as my own soul henry prove yourself worthy of us make us proud  or farther outstripping us in the glorious career of filial piety  humble thy father and thy mother which the lord thy god has given thee  he led lady fitzorton out of the apartment saying to her  madam the honor and happiness of your family is safe tomorrow will our filial preserver prepare his hand and his heart  tomorrow sir good heaven questioned and ejaculated henry and once more he fell at his fathers feet but sir armine disengaging from his embrace hurried away firmly saying to lady fitzorton  there is but a moment on this side my destruction and your favorite sons disgrace madam if you would prevent both assist me in making our escape then turning to henry he exclaimed  tomorrow at fix oclock of the morning i shall find my son prepared  chap ii pale as the ghost that by the gleaming moon withdraws the curtains of the murderers bed so pale and cold at heart he looked around such was precisely the situation of henry he sat for some time motionless then attempted to examine his condition there is scarce an emotion of which the human heart is capable but took its turn to tyrannize at one time his distempered sancy painted the ruin and even the poverty of his parents brought about by the indulgence of his fatal passion he thought he saw them stretched on their dying beds with their last breath accusing him as the cause of their destruction his filial heart shrunk as from the crime of parricide he resolved in that afflicting moment to sacrifice his love to his duty but in the next instant his imagination suggesting his vows to caroline and the miseries he should entail on himself and perhaps on the innocent olivia made that offense more foul to his foul than the most determined disobedience this cried he smiting his breast would be worse than selfmurder  worse than that impiety against which the omnipotent has set his seal alas caroline though fortune were to remain my cruel persecutor for years to come should not this hand be reserved even to the end of life for thee and were it never permitted to be united to thine could my devoted heart my violated conscience offer it to another without treason to honor to tenderness and to truth and least of all can i present it to thy brothers adored olivia does filial duty require me to violate the sacred laws of love and friendship shame on such virtue it is unnatural i renounce it  in the midst of these struggles he retired to his chamber whither he was accompanied by true george who seeing his master agitated and thinking rest would be the most likely means of restoring him began as usual to assist him he entreated his honor would please to go to bed observing that a little sleep would do him good  sleep exclaimed henry throwing himself on the bed o that it were my everlasting one  the poorfellow shook at hearing this ejaculation accompanied as it was with the most extravagant voice and gesture as if his own last hour had been at hand  george cried henry thou art thou have been proved faithful and of that fidelity i must now make another trial the countenance of the honest domestic brightened in an instant and without losing any time in professions or offers of service except by giving assent at almost every word his master uttered he stood eagerly waiting for the word of command  my dear parents continued henry are going to make me the most infamous and miserable of human kind my brothers my whole family and even the clares are in the plot against my peace i have no dependence no hope but from thee  georges whole frame quivered with impatience  tomorrow i am by their joint contrivance to be ruined tomorrow they have determined i shall break my most sacred promises my most solemn oaths tomorrow therefore my heart also will be broken if i am not preserved from the impending stroke tonight  george traversed the room at a stride and ejaculated tomorrow tonight tonight tomorrow  a case of pistols hung over the chimneypiece in henrys chamber and george as if by an involuntary impulse hastily took them down and held one in each trembling hand intimating though he spoke not a word that he was now doubly armed and only wanted the orders of his superior to shoot any body and every body through the head that should stand in the way of effecting his masters escape from this terrifying catalogue of ills  o heavens cried henry at the unexpected sight of the pistols an often suggested and desperate idea seemed to resume its dominion  gracious heaven i thank thee good fellow for the hint  the hint sir questioned the trembling george  what hint alas exclaimed henry how many easy ways are there of escaping the tyranny of friends or foes by the help of one of these friendly instruments continued he catching suddenly at one of the pistols i might in one moment avoid perhaps a long life of misery  but what will become of you after cried george and can this be a crime resumed henry a terrible one your honor interposed george the lord gives and the lord only can take away  or continued henry not attending if a crime can it be so atrocious so immitigable so beyond gods forgiveness or mans salvation as that which prostitutes for gold the sanctity of the most solemn vows made in the presence of that god and falsify the most awful engagements if both are evils both iniquities is not that the least which to prevent the ruin of many destroys but one  while henry was entering into the latter part of this selfdebate too often discussed in the same way george who still trembled from head to foot substituted action for words by wrenching the pistol from his hand and disappearing amidst a profusion of bows henry had scarce time to reflect on what had been done before george came again bowing into the apartment without any deadly weapon and making a number of silent apologies for the liberty he had taken at length perceiving a frown gathering on his masters brow  i hope your honor will not be offended at my obeying your honors commands  disobeying them you mean answered henry  no replied george you told me you should be ruined tomorrow if not preserved tonight providence sent me to your honors assistance for i dont see how a man is to ruin himself if another man takes out of his hand all ruinating weapons at least he must thereby get time to think better of it so you may now go into a comfortable bed and tomorrow may come as soon as god pleases to give it us blessed be the name of the lord  the fervid devotion and humility with which george uttered this bowing his head and folding his hands each time he spoke that name which claims the reverence of all creation disarmed the rising resentment of henry who extended his hand in testimony of forgiveness and seeming to acquiesce in what had been said went to his chamber and desired to be left to his repose george who was now eased of his terrible apprehensions departed but the poor fellow returning on tiptoe and gently opening the door about an hour after to see that all was well having perhaps still some fears found henry had risen from his bed and by the glimmering light of the lamp had been writing a letter he was folding it up as george came in this is the trial i spoke of george said henry as he wafered the letter it is to lieutenant stuart and requires an immediate reply he is at the abbey dennison will take it to his apartment and as the old man you know sleeps apart from the family it may be managed without alarm  the latter part of these directions were lost in air for george was at the bottom of the stairs and making his rapid way but with inaudible steps to the streetdoor before they were uttered setting off at full speed with the words  immediate reply  henry now betook himself again to his bed but it might be truly said caroline had murdered sleep or rather she in combination with many more conspired to banish that lenient power from shedding balms on his pillow the morrow began to dawn and he anticipated all the horrors of a marriage into which even tender parents plunged him and while they knew his heart to be utterly averse and on which therefore a train of mischiess threatened to attend their beloved their favorite son and his posterity even to the last syllable of recorded time the motives of the parents were undoubtedly manifold and mighty but the single objection of the child declared and unshaken by all those motives each of which he felt and acknowledged should at least have reserved to him the right of withholding his hand from an object of his indifference if it could not be given to that of his choice yet how many in all otherrespects excellent parents are there who refuse the darlings of their hearts this comparatively happy alternative should any of this description peruse these annals let the natural consequences of similar error prevent them from carrying their designs into effect  chap iii while the intended victim of the fitzortons was anticipating the sacrifice of all his happiness how differently passed away the hours in the apartments of olivia  virtuous love in like circumstances has ten thousand times been felt by virtuous women but has never perhaps been described even by themselves without an injury to that feeling and indeed the combined sensations of love firmly believed to be fondly reciprocated of innocent passion and of virgin modesty seem too bold for the contracted powers of language  the language of love itself the truly amiable young creature whom the reader long ere this we trust both loves and pities by turns experienced the sweet reverse of all those bitter emotions which were afflicting the mind of her beloved henry  as the clock struck five she rose it was in verity an april morn both of life and nature olivia smiled and wept and the element showered and shone at the same moment the summons of preparation was consigned to jenny atwood whom gratitude and her own disappointed but alas not hardened heart kept wakeful on entering the apartment she found olivia almost dressed they greeted each other kindly but on olivias face had settled one of the tears and another in its crystal source stood ready yet her cheeks glowed and her eye looked the more bright from the luster of that precious drop but it trembled like early dew upon the rosebud glistening in a sunbeam  meantime the unfortunate henry was still tossing on the bed sometimes traversing the room and sometimes in a profound reverie debating but unable to determine what course he should take at one time he resolved to yield himself up the victim of filial piety and prepare for the ceremony at another he rejected this idea with disdain and resolved to abscond attended only by true george he even formed the outline of a plan to carry off caroline by force and gain over charles to the conspiracy that olivia might make her escape at the same time by which stratagem his disordered fancy represented the happiness of both himself and friend each possessing the object of his affection but this thought was presently abandoned as the height of impracticability and of madness in the midst of these conflicts he heard with horror the striking of that very clock whose sound vibrated the tenderest joys to the bosom of olivia it announced the sixth hour terrible was it to his ear as if it had been the knell of a friends death to olivia it was the music of the sphere resolving and reresolving but still unresolved he rose abruptly packed and unpacked filled and emptied a trunk several times and after having at length determined to hazard temporal and eternal misery rather than prostitute his heart by yielding a reluctant alienated betrothed hand be the consequence what it might  here he pressed carolines miniature with almost a convulsed emotion to his bosom  he sat down with the composure which a man always feels when after deep agitation his fluctuating opinions become fixed but this calm lasted only while his imagination again took wing which was in the succeeding moment  at this crisis the faithful george returned from the abbey almost breathless with haste and informed henry that the lieutenant had left the abbey within an hour after his honor that he set off without any servant and left word for his sister that he should not return till late in the next day  left the abbey exclaimed henry so sudden did you see dennison o yes your honor and i know not what is the matter but i  i fear from the young squires setting off in the nightime all alone some harsh words have passed between the old gentleman and his honor for sir guise is gone too before henry could reply to this extraordinary intelligence a messenger on horseback desired to speak to true george who setting off at full speed presently returned at full speed also and delivered a packet to his master saying  i understand it is from the lieutenant sir the horse that brought it is all in a foam  to henry fitzorton esquire  seeing o my beloved friend we are both hovering on the extremest verge of destruction i have been some hours on my horse to prevent a marriage which if not prevented will be the precipice that must whelm us both into instant ruin henry beware let nothing urge you to an action which will heap havoc and horror on both and on all that belong to us the secret of your love of my sister must one day or another reach the ear and pierce the heart of olivia i have reflected and find it is neither duty honor love friendship nor religion to make your friend yourself the woman you love and even the woman you wed irreparably miserable it is the false doctrine of your fathers prejudice not of his good mind and fine understanding  not even of his nature or his faith and it will be virtue in you to save both him and yourself you have no alternative but flight  instant flight something may happen in your absence favorable to all our loves at any rate the prevention of your marriage with olivia will be an almighty blessing since it must avert an omnipotent curse  the curse of loathing her you must swear to love i have by the assistance of a friend devised a way to make your flight look like a matter of necessity but the detail would take up the precious moments thinking me therefore as your guardian friend attend to my instructions proceed in your preparations  be ready at your fathers call  seem to enter into the spirit of his views  begin the dreadful destined journey with alacrity and at the edge of adsell forest which you must necessarily pass in your way to the hall expect to meet a deliverer  so great was henrys perturbation on reading this that though he ordered true george to prepare every thing without knowing he spoke and dressed with all possible dispatch and though he determined to follow his friends advice he was by no means in a state of mind to conjecture or indeed to connect thought on what could be intended by the promise of deliverance the very idea however of escaping a marriage with olivia and of the bare possibility of reserving his hand for caroline gave him such alacrity in preparation that he was the first of the groupe to salute the intended bride whom he met arrayed in those bridal vestments which lady fitzortons assiduity and taste had prepared at the sight of her now almost husband she was covered from her forehead to her bosom with the true rosy red of native modesty and might literally be said to blush and breathe ten thousand graces lady fitzorton and both the fathers had bestirred themselves and were bustling to get the carriages to the door henry animated by the hope which his friend charles had inspired had assumed all at once so vivid an appearance not only from that hope but from the flush of hurrying employments and emotions that sir armine thought his parting words had taken effect lady fitzorton wept and mr clare forgot his age and danced for joy for olivias felicity there are no words and if it was still dressed like aprils suns in showers it was thence only the more bright and delicious  chap viii as the carriages were driving up mr partington to the surprise of the whole party rode up on the full gallop why heydey you abominable goodfornothing rascals said he addressing them all and so you thought to have stolen not only a march but a match upon me without knowing whether i forbid the banns or give consent did you but i was not added he in the same pleasant vein to be outgeneralled by a parcel of shallow vagabonds like you my trusty scouts apprised me of your operations and brought me a full account of the enemys motions long before the official letters of father fitzorton arrived at headquarters but to show that i do not mean to punish you for disobeying orders i will be so far from intercepting you in your expedition that i propose to be your leader and now give you the word of command to proceed on your march like a pack of sad poltroons as you are to the right about make ready march fire away  at full trot  you sorry forefooted caitiffs rejoined he turning round the horses heads with one hand and performing part of the military exercise with the other  the huge crabstick with which he always rode or walked serving him for a musket  the company accustomed to his mode of address took all in good part and were made happy at the unexpected rencontre henry performed the honor of assisting the ladies to their carriages with an agility which was still mistaken by some present for the impatience of a lovers tenderness and having made his bow to lady fitzorton and olivia he ordered the postillion to drive on observing that he and mr partington would lead the way  now that is as it should be so off we go infantry and cavalry to besiege your grandfathers old sir rowlands castle  hey my boy exclaimed the bustling partington who appeared to be as well instructed and as much interested in the conduct motives and dispatch of the journey as if he only had the ordering of the arrangements had fixed the day and was going himself to be married to olivia  the party in motion consisted of sir armine and his lady olivia and mr clare in the family coach followed by jenny atwood and true george in the post chariot at olivias particular request partington and henry on horseback a suit of domestics following in this order they set forward on one of the loveliest mornings of the loveliest part of the year and all appeared in spirits suitable to the occasion  they purposed dividing the journey into two equal parts stopping to rest the first night at adsell where they had previously bespoke accommodations at an excellent inn on the western road and to reach the priory early enough on the second day to finish the great object of their tour  nothing worthy to be recorded in this history took place till almost after the whole of the first days travel they arrived at the skirts of the forest bordering on the village of adsell when just as they were descending a deep valley enriched by a stream that took its way through the woods partington exclaimed jocosely  now if we have any of us our deserts we shall be plundered by some of the robbers that infest this part of the forest to prevent which added he as the night draws on and that palefaced hussy the moon holds a dark lanthorn to the honest gentlemen of the bullet aiding and abetting rather than discovering them let us push on till we get clear of this plaguey wilderness which is absolutely an encouragement to the amiable associates of the halter rather in sport than in apprehension henry humoured his whimsical fellowtraveller and they had not proceeded above a couple of hundred paces farther ere partington checking his own horse and pulling the rein of henrys cried out woho  stop you abominable goodfornothing vagabond we are just at the spot where you are to be robbed stripped murdered and ravished  let me see  aye this is the very place prepare yourself your time is come  he had scarce uttered this when four stout men on foot preceded by one on horseback with vizors on their faces rushed from behind a cluster of thick elms that forming an angle came justing into the road they surrounded henry crying out  yield you are amongst friends  the horseman now came up to henry and taking off his vizor exclaimed behold one of your deliverers  charles stuart exclaimed henry  yes said partington my plot is now mature you are to be delivered  delivered i find from a forced marriage  i will allow no scoundrel to force another but we must wait the arrival of the coach because it is necessary the old gentleman should see you carried off you may as well seem to resist a little though and i will appear to help you  but we must both cleverly suffer ourselves to be overcome  and while i am making my escape with proper difficulty you shall be carried to a place of safety  namely to my own house where i desire you will remain a close prisoner partington conducted the whole of this attack with too much rapidity to admit of more than silent surprise  but at this moment a violent shriek arrested the general attention heydey cried partington seeing the coach surrounded by armed men and even some of the company dragged out here are more rogues than we bargained for stuart hereupon setting spurs to his horse and ordering the men to follow bludgeons in hand henry and the first body of assailants with charles at their head were hastening to inquire into the designs of the second which were soon discovered to be of a far more hostile nature for notwithstanding the dispatch of partington and his cohort the villains had burst open the door of the carriage and while the women were trembling and beseeching mercy two of the banditti were belabouring sir armine and mr clare with bludgeons which would soon have put an end to their existence had not partington henry and the masked men one with the fury of an old and the rest of two young lions assisted in their rescue but this was not effected before sir armine who received a blow in his temple after he was otherwise much hurt had fallen on the ground while henry and partington were endeavoring to raise him up the rest were employed in pursuing and securing the ruffians true george had fastened upon the collar of one and the neck of another was nailed to the earth by his feet the villain that was observed to strike sir armine after he was on the ground was the prize of the victorious charles who considering him as devoid even of the common compassion of an highwayman in treating a venerable and helpless man with so much barbarity returned every blow he had inflicted on sir armine with tenfold interest nor were partington and true georges myrmidons less liberal in their rewards of the rest of the banditti which consisted of two persons besides those in georges custody  by this time the tender and assiduous henry who totally forgot all idea of his own escape in the apprehension and terror he felt for others had so far composed the ladies that he was at liberty to assist in lifting mr clare and sir armine who were both wounded into the carriage meantime the victors pursued their triumphant blows over the vanquished but villainy though done in the center will speak and great discoveries are brought about by slender means little fitz who in the general ransack of the company had left the coach and was too active a spectator to remount ran to the person whom jonathan armstrong was putting an end to and expressed more signs of sympathy than a stranger and a ruffian had a right to claim  fitz however either from indignation or some other motive leaped on the personage above described and the moon coming from under her cloud what could equal the surprise and consternation of the whole company when in prosecuting their chastisement one of georges captives turned out to be the infamous david otley sir armines favorite servant who had been trusted with ordering the accommodations at adsell and who was supposed to be still in waiting there to receive the family the other mr valentine miles and to complete the climax of astonishment the personage under the severe discipline of jonathan about whose sat or destruction little fitz appeared to be so interested proved to be sir guise stuart  while valentine miles had been the victim of henry and charles alternately these extraordinary discoveries were made so near to the coach that every body within capable of sight or speech exclaimed how sir guise stuart david otley valentine miles  sir armine alone wanted power to know the prime offender being utterly stunned by the backhanded stroke he received from that implacable wretch  chap ix the rage grief and shame of the ingenuous charles at this detection is not to be described it was insupportable to him  and giving way to a resentment which shook his frame almost to dissolution and annihilated all sense of affinity he addressed the trembling sir guise with an oath by which he swore that he would see justice executed upon him and be himself his principal evidence even though the public disgrace of an ignominious death should be the consequence o thou  polluter of a family which never knew a stain till in an evil hour its honor was committed to thy charge for what sin committed or yet to be perpetrated am i condemned to think the life which thou have dishonored was bestowed by thee  as for you wretch said he turning to miles and thou his meanest instrument if my correction toward thee knows any bounds it is only in the hope that the residue of your punishment will be more sure and exemplary in the hands of my country than in those of an individual i require mr partington that you and your friends assist in conducting these offenders to the next town where they shall remain close prisoners till i can properly dispose them and do not think abandoned assassins the names of son or father from which my soul alive as it would be to every deserving tie turns with horror shall screen ye from the insulted laws of your country or your god partington who deemed this no time for discourse proceeded to immediate action he therefore arranged his men and placed his prisoners in the midst of them in the manner of deserters taken up and moving to a court martial he then took the lead and desired charles to guard and bring up the rear  in this manner was the longfostered revenge of sir guise and his mercenaries defeated by the very persons whom his amiable but unhappy son had convened to rescue his friend from a forced marriage  the escort of prisoners arrived at adsell which was about two miles from the place of attack sooner than the coach but the indefatigable george and his colleagues which were no other than jerome and his cousin jonathan for henry had never left the side of the coach had rode at full speed and had brought a rural surgeon to the inngate where he waited the coming of the carriage the innyard and street adjoining were soon crowded with spectators for besides that george had given the alarm village curiosity who had the eyes of argus opened all her visual powers to see the wonderful phenomenon of a gang of ruffians who always afford an holiday to the vulgar as well when they are taken to prison as when they are sent out of the world  more than an hour elapsed in arranging the two different parties in separate apartments which were with difficulty procured for david otley had attended only to the accommodations at the forest and neglected those he was to have prepared at the inn which having much company who purposed staying all night the hostess was driven to her best management to provide beds even for mr clare her landlord and his friends as to sir guise stuart and his fellow assassins mr partington and charles disposed of them with very little apparatus in convenient outhouses adjoining where they were put without ceremony under lock and key and the trusty george set over as guard relieved occasionally by jonathan or jerome  with equal politeness and humanity however the party that occupied the best apartments hearing that a gentleman and his family were brought in wounded by assassins whom they had taken offered to resign their claims as firstcomers and to mount or descend into whatever sleepingrooms the landlady could provide for them by this civility sir armine was accommodated with a comfortable suite of rooms where he might be surrounded by olivia lady fitzorton henry jenny atwood and his attendants  he was no sooner put into a warm bed than the surgeon who contrary to what books usually represent gentlemen of the faculty resident in the country to be was a skilful and sensible man desired to be left alone with the patient whom he immediately blooded and finding the bruises less violent than he at first suspected gently fomented the parts affected with a suitable embrocation then administering an anodyne assured the company they would show their affection in the most essential manner by leaving the patient to repose after which said the surgeon i do not doubt but we shall find him materially refreshed  and promising to call again before bedtime and to attend early in the morning he bowed and took his leave  somewhat comforted by this favorable report the shattered party had leisure and spirits to inquire about each other mr clare felt himself much recovered having escaped with only two or three blows and those on no vital part olivia and lady fitzorton who had suffered only in sympathy for the sufferings of others and from the natural terrors of so sudden an attack seemed to revive in proportion as mr clare and sir armine were pronounced to be out of danger henry could not be prevailed on to quit sir armines bedside at which begging his mother to sleep in another apartment with olivia he kept watch the whole night on the return of the good surgeon finding the favorable symptoms continue the rest of the party felt themselves sufficiently at their ease to take some slight refreshment and after each had paid a tiptoed visit to the chamber of sir armine whom the vigilant henry signified rather by gestures than by speech to be in a dose they withdrew to their apartments in order to follow so good an example  it should not be omitted to the honor of his race that little fitz whose various good actions entitle him to be now considered as a personage of some consequence in this history kept watch over sir armine at the feet of henry and except that on the entrance of olivia whose passing caresses he acknowledged he remained there till the morning  chap x having thus disposed of the several characters at the inn in the best manner that the circumstances admitted it seems a fit opportunity to settle a running account not only with historic consistency in regard to the causes which gave rise to all this mischief but to acquit ourselves of the claim which is so infinitely due to john fitzorton we left that singular young man sitting down to the pleasing and painful task of finishing his drawing of olivia clare he had just taken his pencil from retouching the wellimitated features over which he heaved many a sigh when lieutenant stuart was announced john rose and ran to the door with expanded arms to receive him but willing to pass over the subject of his promotion which he knew might lead to what would disconcert the amicable convention settled betwixt him and henry on that matter he exclaimed i am apprised my good charles of all that gives me the sincere satisfaction of seeing you and having you amongst us but as i see a great deal of your enthusiastic friend henry is mounting into your face i must cut short all unnecessary effusions at a word i think you do honor to any mans election and i wish you the farther promotion you merit with all my heart are you come to remain with us now altogether  no replied charles i have some affairs to adjust at home before i can have the honor of associating but thought it a first duty to make my bow to my new captain and colonel en passant then you are just in time to take letters for me to the castle and may i trouble you to convey a small parcel to our olivia  our olivia cried charles reddening ah captain fitzorton you know not how far nor through what perils i would go had i a thousand lives at stake to render the most trifling service to that dear angelic girl indeed said john employing all the powers of his scrutinizing eyes upon charless face as if at the first idea of a new discovery  indeed  there are moments it is well known which defeat the circumspection of years this was one of them at the time charles intended nothing less than the unfolding of his heart to john neither was there any thing in the occasion itself that should draw forth his confession so we can only suppose this was to be the period according to the predestinarians in love ordained by the god of that passion or the goddess of fortune for john fitzorton to become acquainted with another of olivias military admirers the steady gaze with which john pursued his object deepened the tacit declaration in the cheek of charles and either by reflection or by some other course john felt an uncommon glow in his own countenance on the repetition of the ejaculatory word indeed charles found out that he had betrayed himself and became yet more embarrassed john was discomposed and each continued to confuse the other till both sought relief by turning their eyes another way john who of all men was the most sensible of shame and who the most labored with selfreproach soon left the room and gave charles opportunity for one of those painful soliloquies which usually burst from a man after he has discovered the secret he would conceal  and have i said he after cautiously guarding the cruel secret in my own tormented breast and after we had agreed so to shut up the fatal secret till happier times  perhaps for ever  have i divulged it to the man who of all the fitzorton family would be the least likely to forgive my passion even to john who noblenatured as he is will consider my unfortunate attachment to olivia  for am i not a son of the offending sir guise  as the height of madness and presumption  nay more i must appear to him as the rival of his brother my dearest friend  nor can i clear myself from this idea by explaining the situation of henry not knowing how far affairs at the castle may at the present moment make this eligible doubtless john is gone away displeased or possibly my fears may interpret falsely  he may have been startled at the warmth of the expression  and yet perhaps  perhaps no precise discovery has been made in the midst of these ruminations john reentered and cordially taking charles by the hand inquired when he would wish to set out for the abbey as soon said charles as i have paid my respects to my new colonel and obtained his permission of absence which i must confess is a little unreasonable to begin with by no means said john generously i engage to procure you both immediately come my friend dispatch you know is the soul of business  john took hold of charless arm and walked away with him so readily that the latter really believed his last reflection went to the truth namely that his expression had not extended to the discovery of his affection for olivia the colonel being found at headquarters john fitzorton presented charles stuart in the following manner  this sir is the youth for whom colonel forbes has a friendship of which the basis is not favor but merit i need not say more in his behalf to make colonel warren consider him as an acquisition to the regiment but i must add from my own knowledge of his virtues and personal bravery that if i should be found as worthy to occupy the post of the lamented lascelles as i will pledge myself this young man will approve himself of the station my promotion leaves open and which one of my family has presented to him under your auspices sir you will have reason to be doubly satisfied and what has rarely happened to me in any occurrence of life i shall be satisfied with myself  colonel warren received his new lieutenant as such an introduction gave claim to but continued john the youth is desirous to owe to his new colonel an indulgence on advance even before he has done any duty he has a lovely sister whose situation requires a brothers immediate councils and consolation other family affairs likewise summon his attention and though the diffidence which connects with high and genuine pretensions induces him to shrink from the solicitation i have taken upon me on the surety of your character sir to come forward on the occasion  young gentleman said the colonel turning to charles the sooner necessary business is done the better we expect stirring work in the military line in another month or two  my advices of the day are pretty strong  this then is the time you can best be spared from the services my regiment may expect from a man who comes into it thus doubly armed with the recommendation of captain fitzorton and colonel forbes adieu therefore  you will return as speedily as circumstances admit  proper acknowledgments being given and received john conducted the lieutenant to the different officers of the regiment and after dining at the mess by way of giving to the initiatory visit all its advantages in favor of the lieutenant he left to the choice of that gentleman either to defer his intended journey to the morning or to set out immediately i rather think my dear sir said charles that  that  that it will be expected i am now on the road  and as  as  as you know the colonel intimated i might be wanted in my place in a short time it will perhaps be better to  to  to  pray what do you think yourself john perceiving the lieutenant was getting into a fresh dilemma rang the bell before the hesitation in the lieutenants speech grew worse and on the servants appearing said you will make ready and bring round to the door this gentlemans horse then turning to charles he added smiling let me be your commanding officer at present in giving marching orders immediately after which he adverted to more general subjects in order to take off the too keen sense of that particular one on which he saw charles was irritable a soldier of the regiment who attended john soon came to say the gentlemans horse was at the door on which charles after more impediments than the simple question seemed to demand had it not been preceded by a succession of little stumbling blocks ventured to ask if the letters for fitzorton castle and the parcel for  for  for olivia clare were ready  no observed john i find on reflection i must have a little more time to make them up and a few days more or less can make no material difference  charles rose to take his leave john advanced toward him and opened the door with one hand while he cordially offered the other to charles lieutenant said he you deserve honor for your own good qualities and generous compassion for the bad ones but i will not wound you  you are moreover the chosen friend of our henry fitzorton  for all these reasons and for numberless others i sincerely wish your happiness i suspect also you are somewhat too sensible of the charming powers of our olivia alas do not shrink from the observation if it is unfounded happier is it for yourself if it goes to the fact ah my friend it is no way unnatural that you should love what is most lovely i you or any other man might have been carried beyond our powers  but have a care  you have not a heart to endure the thought of breaking in upon the plan of two of the most venerable men that ever gave luster to the character of parent nor could you bear to enchain an alienated woman even if she should be brought to sacrifice herself to your arms alas it is with reason we make a petition against being led into temptation a part of our daily prayer that changeful cheek and averted eye seem to say you are going into the midst of it my dear brotherofficer the strongest of the sons of men can often be saved only by determined retreat oh beware you had better be the most miserable of the wretched alone and unobserved than call in another who cannot love you to share your fate hasten then your journey but should you at the end of it find your sorrow greater than your joy return to your appointment here and assuring yourself that the only remedy for the disappointments of life is employment let even your calamity have the liberal effect of occupying you in some active virtue so shall you in a manner remember others till you forget yourself  give my love to the family and farewell  it was not unlucky for charles that john precluded reply by leading him to his horse which having mounted he rode away attempting many silent acknowledgments and looking as many promises  all of which he remembered with a predetermination to fulfill them till he saw olivia clare or rather till he saw her likeness in that very picture which john was finishing on his arrival and of which it was first intended to make him the bearer but after the suspicious effusions which escaped the lieutenant john thought this would be making himself accessory in the temptation he would wish him to avoid and though john was too generous to throw any impediments that might savor of the jealous lover in this young mans way he would not do any thing that might promote his unfortunate passion when charles had departed john fitzorton sat as was usual with him in any new difficulty in silent thought his hands folded over his face  illfated charles said he when he could articulate it is hard upon us both we have been attracted by uncommon beauty and uncommon virtue yet there is no quarrelling with the creator for having made such a creature nor with our beloved henry for being possessed of happier powers to make her his own i am very wretched but methinks i love him the more at least i think the more exaltedly of his virtues for the very charm that has wrought my despair for i am convinced that olivia is not a woman to prefer one man to another on caprice or the eyes absurd vanity of calling a handsome man her own no charles our henry depend on it has endowments of mind as well as person which we do not possess that have given him this distinction over us both  john turned the point many ways without coming to any thing satisfactory and at the end of his soliloquies he took the miniature from his pocket where he had placed it on the entrance of charles and after gazing on it with more true admiration than pigmalion bestowed on the adored masterpiece of his art he confessed he was yielding to great weakness even though unseen of the world and then pressing the miniature to his lips retired with it to his bedchamber his waking thoughts were pointed against human frailty and a very energetic philippic followed on the weakness of man and the strength of woman during which he found the resemblance of olivia had somehow found its way to his pillow but after he had risen he exclaimed i see plainly little of voluntary virtue is to be expected from incorrigible mortals all is to be done by main force  the scourge the wheel the prison and the gibbet are all necessary instruments of terror a damoclesian sword must always hang over the human head i have no superior merit to charles except that i am playing the fool by myself and i fear he is gone to expose himself before company  at the close of these reflections john paid his parting adorations to the picture for by an opportunity which happened in the course of the following day he sent it to the fair olivia to prevent farther mischief to himself and in discharge of his promise the use which that enchanting girl made of it was such as the reader has seen and such as the truly generous john had foreseen also  the next occurrence that happened to john was one of the most trying of his whole life in the information which reached him by means of his father who wrote to him in this manner   my ever worthy john i have no time now to comment on the affair of our dear henrys heart whether it has had its wanderings or not young men were always truants you know from their boyish days even john had his airy visions and played with shadows these all yield to substances in due time neither can i now stop to examine the precise fact alleged in the anonymous letter whether a forgery or not your conduct my john is alike liberal and i thank you  our henry is at the present moment all i wish him  he cannot himself be otherwise than happy with olivia and the strongest reasons that can urge to any union combine to make it proper she should become his wife the point the place the time the circumstances are all adjusted  can you not meet us at adsell hall can it not have the air and effect of an unexpected measure your good little girl has more than once hinted at the sanction of her guardian giant as she sometimes calls you my hands would tremble said she even as he gave it to henry but surely the union would have more strength were approving john to pronounce that it was good tell him so  and tell him too that the promises i shall make to his brother at the sacred altar cannot be more holy than those i long since made him to be all my life long his good olivia i have repeated her own words john and leave you to act upon them henry has confidentially informed me he has been writing to you a kind of journal history of affairs here from the time of your departure to the present date but since our last discourse in which all the better parts of his nature were called out he has determined not to send it  nay i saw him consign it to the flames if you can quit quarters you will not fail to give us the meeting now and ever god bless you my excellent son is the wish of your  true and tender father armine fitzorton p s your beautiful drawing of our olivia has been received with joy it does honor to the artist  it does almost justice to nature olivia declares it far surpasses the latter but while she makes that declaration nature as if piqued asserts her superiority and throws such fresh blooms into the countenance of this surely the fairest of her works that john would himself own she is the best painter     the reader perceives this epistle arrived when henry wholly subdued by the paternal blessing on his head had promised to become obedient to his fathers wishes and sir armine took advantage of that moment to hurry off an account and invitation to his eldest son  having already said it was the most trying circumstance that his son john had yet encountered in life a description of particulars is thereby precluded we shall only observe that after having again fixed himself in one of his ruminating postures the profound reflections of an hour were concluded by the following reply to the invitation  sir armine and my friend must not expect john at adsell or at the altar i should not be an auspicious assistant at the ceremony but neither the parents nor the children nor even the lovers themselves can more earnestly pray now and ever that peace and honor and uninterrupted joy may be the issue of their nuptials than sir  your honored and dutiful son john fitzorton   this answer was addressed to sir armine at adsell hall and there met him on his arrival after the disastrous events at the forest but it was earnestly requested by sir armine nay and even made a condition by the apothecary that mr john fitzorton should not be made acquainted with those events nor any thing that had allusion to them till sir armine judged proper even were death to be the issue for i foresee said the reverend sufferer that worse than death would be the consequence of johns hearing of this fresh outrage of sir guise stuart sir armine bound his whole family by an oath of honor to profound silence and all readily joined in it well perhaps was it for the aggressor they did so for dreadful must have been the result of the intelligence  the afflicted john indeed wanted not any fresh cause of grief he attempted to engage with earnestness in his official duties  he even sought its social reliefs  he mixed with his brotherofficers  he employed himself in the ardours of a field day and passed his evenings at the mess but when the day appointed for the nuptials of henry and olivia approached his mighty heart and powerful nature were sorely shaken  he invoked blessings on them both  protested that natures most insupportable curse was upon him  received and was denied the solace of tears alternately  kept the shutters of his chamber closed that he might indulge in the sad luxury of his forlorn condition the whole day undisturbed  never quitted the bed on which he had thrown himself till toward midnight and supposing by that time olivia had become the bride of his tenderly beloved brother he kneeled down by his bedside and with a fervor that from the sincerity of his agitated soul applied once more the expressive words that had been so long in family recollection on different occasions  bless o bless ye together  he then adverted to the lieutenant exclaiming ah dear partner in despair if thou have been an eyewitness to the events of the past day thou art even more to be commiserated than john fitzorton whose only comfort is derived from his determined absence  after two days silent suffering in this manner he nursed his mind into sufficient composure to attend to the common duties of his life and situation the heaviness of the storm was past  a calm succeeded  and as he did not receive any accounts from adsell or the castle for a considerable time he attributed their silence to their festivity and rather dreaded than hoped the arrivals of the post  the intermediate history of our admirable john thus brought down to the events at adsell we go back to the family party assembled there with more ease and satisfaction  chap vii the reader has been already apprised that sir guise stuart meditated an effectual revenge and was prepared to expect some violent but cautious measures and he now sees that this affray was intended to satiate his evil designs but there are various particulars which as they cannot be known but by our explication shall now be developed perhaps there are some impatient spirits who have already condemned us for not satisfying them sooner not considering that diverse are the events of life which whatever pain and inconvenience they give cannot be explained till after we have suffered from them and that we often feel the blow before we discover the hand from whence it comes  to untie therefore the several knotty points in order as they lie before us we must first use the privilege of a victor by stripping the vanquished of whatever we deem valuable in the pillage of the ingenious david otleys pocket we find the following letter from his prime seducer mr valentine miles  to david otley friend david your intelligence has been communicated to sir guise and mrs tempest and is most welcome to all of us we are of opinion the former plan which we had in preparation should be renounced as tedious in its process and uncertain in its issue the wedding journey promises a more immediate as well as a more secure way of paying off old scores for you are not to be told that all parties who join in the plot have been grossly injured but as there is not i see a moment to be lost this is only to desire you will take the abbey in your way to adsell in order to receive our final instructions  your faithful v miles   from this ingenious epistle the reader learns that otley was wholly in the interest of miles to whom he communicated the first news of the intended nuptials time place etc and being a confidential domestic he was employed to make a very early report at the abbey of what was in contemplation at the castle in the next place we find hereby that mrs tempest entered into the mysteries of this confederacy urged indeed simply by the spirit of a disappointed womans vengeance for as to the insults which either sir guise or miles had received she would probably have sat with the most philosophical patience to have seen either or both of them mount the scaffold but the affronts they had received served very well to cover the revenge she resolved to take on her own account in truth her designs were more deeply vindictive than the baronets they went to the blood not only of the offending henry but of his whole family and her hate like her love was a conflagration that consumed almost her own life and made it extremely difficult for her to support the necessary ripening of her own purposes her joy therefore was excessive on the news of this promising journey and her impetuous fancy outstripping that of her compeers suggested the whole business of the assassination and had furnished all appliances and means to boot before either of her colleagues fertile as each was in mischievous expedients had seen any advantage to be derived from otleys communication by these means the work of a few hours made so good or rather so bad progress that all things were arranged before sunrise and never perhaps sallied forth a troop of murderers more determined than the heroine mrs tempest her generals sir guise stuart and miles and her aid de camp the renegade david otley and three other chosen men who had been picked from the mass of their dependents and bought up to the most hazardous enterprise the chief delay arose on the part of the baronet who though he heartily desired to promote the work of vengeance apprehended it might prove a service of much danger notwithstanding all the precautions he meant to take and he would have been contented to stay at home and hear from his agents a history of the attack and its success without taking an active part in it but mrs tempest so excited him by her daring arguments and biting reproofs that he less dreaded to join in the attack of the common enemy than encounter her virulent upbraidings singly and though the superaddition of miless terrifying conversation was not wanting it wound up his fears to a pitch that prepared him for the destruction of all the travelers thus partly from shame and partly from cowardice but more than all the assurances he received of there being little or no hazard he suffered himself to join the banditti and assist in person  his conduct and caution afterward in the action are already unfolded  the gang were ready to set out from mrs tempests lodge where the plot was laid as mr otley arrived saying he had been delayed by sir armine but that there was not a single moment to lose as the fitzorton party would be in their carriages and on their horses at six it is now he observed on the stroke of four and if we make proper use of our time shall have the advantage of two hours which will be all we can desire said miles but let us not set out in a body that will look suspicious after a few more arrangements they began their march by the contrary road to that which the fitzortons were to take for otley having been consulted on this subject by his old master with whom his advice in all such matters was looked on as oracular told his own party how they might avoid a premature rencontre as said he i found no difficulty in persuading sir armine that the way i wished him to go was that he ought to take in snort he settled the geography of the route and marked the spot at which the attack should be made  chap viii while these transactions were in preparation at the abbey a conspiracy of a very different kind was laid by the illstarrd charles stuart who immediately on the receipt of the letters that intimated the wedding day and the intended particulars of its celebration fell into a state so near distraction that a thousand plans to prevent the nuptials were formed approved and renounced almost in the same instant several of these indeed were scarcely possible to enter into the brain of any but a man agitated by the extremes of love and of despair rather however than suffer the hated ceremony betwixt olivia and henry to take place he determined thinking perhaps with othello such murders would be heavenly that the death of friend and mistress should be crowned by his own but to avoid this tragic catastrophe he resolved on a project which to him appeared capable of producing the end desired the idea of partingtons resolute spirit his love of doing what men not daring to act for themselves would be afraid to think on his indefatigable perseverance in whatever he engaged and amidst all his singularities his uncorrupted integrity  all these forming one grand idea rushed upon his fancy so strongly that without precisely knowing what good might result from it and feeling that the bad was nearly at the worst he assumed a composure which lulled even the penetrating caroline who now but illdisguised her own sorrows the lieutenant gave out that he would make a visit to a brother officer at some miles distance and try if change of scene and of company could not restore him to that tranquillity which he had lost the house at which mr partington was then resident stood at the distance of a very long days journey from the abbey yet literally traveling on the spur of the occasion charles reached it just as partington was sitting down to dinner the company at table consisted of the whole family of the atwoods at least all that part of it which had been taken under partingtons protection  jenny being as the reader well knows happily situated with the fitzortons  at the sight of a stranger they all rose upon which partington calling them a set of vile scoundrelly goodfornothing vagabonds insisted upon each resitting in the seat and pulled the lieutenant down into a chair at the same time ordering him to partake of the family fare and feel himself as much at home as if he were the son of a friend but said partington i know how to make distinctions between an infamous rascal like charles stuart and his allglorious father sir guise while partington made this observation in his own extraordinary manner he was heaping charless plate with what he conceived to be the rarity of the table  at the name of stuart the blood in a tide of the most violent crimson covered the countenance of young atwood and at the words father sir guise the youth could hardly conceal or contain an indignation which rose from his full heart till a repetition of the baronets name quivered on his lips and died upon his tongue  you must be friends cried partington noticing the young mans emotion the lieutenant here is as great a vagabond as yourself he has like me the highest respect for his exalted sire but i shall think you youngsters less good for nothing than i could wish if you do not like me know how to make distinctions so saying he put the hand of charles into that of young atwood who would have shrunk back from the slightest contact with the son of the man who had dishonored his family  but partington exclaimed i tell you stripling this is as good for nothing a scoundrel as any i know and therefore you must be friends  charles however made a show of eating without relishing a morsel and immediately on the cloth being removed partington perceiving his distress forcibly led or rather carried him into another apartment where charles eagerly catching partington by the hand exclaimed the nuptials of olivia clare and henry fitzorton are to take place within twentyfour hours he loves her not it will be a sacrifice i adore her our destiny will be determined the effect will be dreadful sir armine is not to be persuaded o mr partington is there no stratagem  no miracle to save us all accumulated will be the horrors that must ensue if this forced alliance takes place o pardon the folly the madness of this incoherence  this journey  the last effort of a desperate man  farewell something terrible is at hand  for at the hazard of ten thousand lives olivia clare shall not give her hand to henry fitzorton  and when is this forced alliance as you call it threatened questioned partington tomorrow begins the accursed journey and on the following day my doom is to be sealed farewell  hold you headstrong vagabond said partington detaining him let us return to the company  not another word  he then hurried back the passive charles into the dining room and with yet greater vehemence than he had precipitated him out of it and ere he had well opened the door he ejaculated avaunt ye lazy goodfornothing devils here is a world of work to be performed  young man said he addressing himself to atwood junior your benefactors favorite child young fitzorton and your sisters patroness demand your assistance yet more you vagabond your enemys son but my friend is to be rescued from despair  even the son of sir guise stuart  atwood gave his hand to charles aye said partington you are the caitiff i thought ye so take home these old vagabonds your father and mother who would be useless lumber in this expedition to their farm and if none of us return alive for dire are our designs take care of yourselves as well as you can for you charles mount your horse  no  first write a few lines to henry ordering him to be of good cheer  to smile  to  in short i will give you final instructions what is to be said to the vagabond as soon as i have adjusted a little preliminary with that old scoundrel my steward  the business with le maitre the steward was to furnish a stout staff and suitable disguise for each person intended to act a part in partingtons drama  disguises weapons offensive and defensve you old vagabond were all the orders le maitre received obedient to which in something less than half an hour le maitre had got together such habiliments and accoutrements as would have equipped a pillaging party in the days of robin hood young atwood soon returned from the farm attended by two husbandmen who he said were to be trusted the means of conveyance were ready a servant was dispatched with the letter to henry and on the road were unfolded the particulars of the enterprise the whole groupe more especially young atwood who was of an affectionate disposition entered into it with ardour and alacrity olivia said partington is an abominable scoundrel and must be saved even from the man she loves because he does not love her it seems  but the rascal cannot help that yet take notice charles i will prevent forced matches but i will not be a matchmaker so you and the wench must settle it as well as you can afterward  though i will own to you i should engage with some good will in any project that might favor the escape of a vile ugly young scoundrel like your sister from such a nobleminded brave generous gentleman as your father so that when we have by the plot now rolling in my head prevented olivia from running into the arms of henry i shall be ready provided the girl be willing to aid and abet henry to run into the arms of caroline and as for olivia get you but the consent of that little villain and you shall have mine and after that a fig for the opposition of fathers and mothers  the handsome rascal will be the dearer after she has put you to a good deal of trouble for my part i know of but one natural or reasonable impediment to a mans marrying the lass he fancies and that is her fancying another or not fancying him so now for our expedition  to release a lovesick knight from a damsel who is sallying forth to have him whether he will or not  in this sort of discourse did partington and his companions shorten their way to adsell forest what followed their arrival at the appointed place has been circumstantially related from the first and second attack even to the catastrophe  now should the reader in a retrospect of his own life be unable to trace any wild project of love or revenge if in a survey of his antipathies and of his affections he should discover no ideas conceived nor schemes executed as little sensate as those which instigated sir guise to vengeance mrs tempest to jealousy miles to study at once his interest and revenge and the traitor david otley to prefer a golden bribe to the duty he owed his trusting master we congratulate him on his exemption from the darker shades in the human character on the other hand should he in the aforesaid examination of himself happen upon none of those generous excesses in his own feelings which correspond to the feelings of partington nor any which urge him to love olivia and to bestow his pity on henry and charles if moreover he finds no congenial touch that sends the sorrows of caroline stuart thrilling through his blood nor any glow of approbation at the defeat of villainy as it was discovered and punished at the edge of adsell forest we commiserate him for that he is incapable of passing any manner of judgment on the fair the beautiful and the good of human nature  chapter ix the night was past at the inn with more composure than the fatigues of the day and disasters of the evening gave reason to expect even the slumbers of sir armine were unbroken till toward the break of day when seeing the still wakeful henry at his bedside he affectionately said to him i feel in less particular pain and am so generally refreshed that i trust i shall be able about midday to proceed in our journey meantime my beloved child you require rest yourself which i entreat you to take while i make trial to sleep again bless you for ever  at this moment little fitz suddenly started from his light slumbers leaped upon the bed in dumb but expressive eloquence of fond caresses  made with those timid advances and modest tremblings creeping betwixt hope and fear  which seemed to purport  i am the dog of an enemy and my humble gratulations may not only be unwelcome but suspected this was assuredly sir armines idea if not the dogs for no sooner did that venerable man perceive the poor little fellow than with an encouraging benignity he cried while he patted the smooth head and stroked the silken ears  i have no quarrel with thee simpleton and i thank thine honest love for these testimonies of thy good wishes little fitz listened to the kind voice and fondled in turn the caressing hand then gently retired to henrys lap where he had past the night yet such was the entire love that henry bore his father and so wholly was he engrossed by the injuries that good man had received that he never adverted once to the dogs belonging to his beloved caroline till his fathers notice of the animal and the visible progress he made toward recovery had eased his heart of terrors for a life dearer than his own he now received the dog with a tenderness which indicated feelings that attached themselves to the minutest thing living or dead with which the object of the master passion has or can by the magic power of fancy and the heart be made to connect  sir armine dropped again to sleep and continued to doze till the surgeon came to examine the wounds lady fitzorton olivia mr clare jenny atwood her brother and true george  the latter had unbidden kept watch on the outside his old masters chamber door  were all ready to overwhelm the surgeon with questions on sir armines recovery how great then was their wonder their ecstacy to hear this intelligent disciple of aesculapius exclaim to the whole assembled party  the patient methinks cannot do better than get his breakfast in bed about an hour after which if the sun continues his fair promises it will be his own fault or yours ladies and gentlemen not natures if he is not again in his carriage so as to eat his dinner at the place of your destination  the general rapture into which the whole family were thrown by these tidings produced the very delays that each individual desired to avoid lady fitzorton and olivia neither of whom had closed their eyes through the night could have embraced the surgeon the venerable clare shook his hand heartily and henry emptying his purse into the surgeons notrefusing palm leaped about with all the demonstrations of an extravagant transport which wholly obliviated the idea that with the recovery he so hailed would end his every hope and revive his absolute despair jennys tender heart dropped tears on her brothers bosom and hasted to prepare breakfast but honest george had always like dennison the art of being extremely happy and useful at the same time and with the lightnings speed he had flown into the kitchen immediately on the utterance of the surgeons hint that his old master would be in a situation to travel if not the fault of himself or some one of the family he resolved at any rate the fault if any should not lie with him though he would have been extremely ready to take the blame of it from any other  while these matters were transacting above in the house partington and his corpse were not idle below in the stable where the degraded sir guise and his associates were still under the guard of young atwood about midnight partington betook himself to a truss of clean straw as nothing could prevail on him to repair to any other bed he had sworn not to quit sight of so honorable a personage as sir guise stuart till he had the supreme felicity of seeing him fully committed he made this observation with a profound bow and indeed through the whole night treated the baronet with an external respect which he would have refused to any but one for whom he felt the most sovereign indignation  be sure you young goodfornothing scoundrel said he to the worthy atwood that you do not suffer your eyes to close should mine be caught napping for i have not the smallest doubt but that noble generous magnanimous gentleman in the straw  three respectful bows  would try to escape by which i should lose the heartfelt satisfaction i promise myself in seeing him dungeoned if not hanged  two more bows  at the end of this sarcastic speech partington crossed his arms and nestling in the straw soon enjoyed the repose he courted and which did not refuse to visit him in his lowly bed atwood grasped his crabstick and in manly silence waved it over the head of the prisoners not condescending to speak during the whole night  chapter x by this time it had gone forth that the said prisoners were not actually highwaymen but wanton assassins who had maliciously plotted against the lives of mr clare sir armine fitzorton and their families to gratify their private revenge  this hint was no sooner spread abroad than the inhabitants of adsell were up in arms for the whole of that parish was in the manorship of olivia and almost every house in the village and most of the land that smiled around it was by virtue of her grandfathers will the property of that young lady an estate of sir guise or rather of mrs tempest lay within the distance of a few miles in the same county so that both parties were well known at adsell in consequence of which the yard adjoining to the barn wherein sir guise and co were deposited was crowded by people of both sexes who would have made it unnecessary for young atwood to stand sentinel any longer as they would certainly have knocked the baronet and his illustrious companions on the head had not partington dispersed the populace before he betook himself to rest and pacified them by an assurance that they should have timely notice of the execution of the honorable gentleman who he made no doubt would suffer to their hearts content in a very little time  in this hope they departed to their several houses and it was about the third hour of the morning when all was quiet in the inn and its environs but just as young atwood had traversed the outside of the barn the court adjoining and returned to his station within  it was at this tempting moment the very witching time of the night that a whispering succeeded by a soft fearful tread of persons was heard moving toward the barn a small lanthern which one of them held discovered a man and a woman the latter led by the former and each by turns in earnest conversation  young atwood did not doubt but some kind of treachery was on foot as the first words that reached his ear were touching the liberation of sir guise he retired therefore a few paces that he might gain more information the persons advanced and observing the barn door half open they entered cautiously and after walking on tiptoe a few steps one of them said all is still the guard and the guarded are equally overcome by sleep  i have thus far performed my promise  you desired only to see the vile author of your ruin and to warn him that he may leave off his wicked courses before it be too late i have consented to this because it is what a christian should do but as for this sir guise he ought to wish for the sake of his own soul that he should have time to repent and then be hanged out of the way for the good of mankind so as this is the last time i hope the wicked man can be seen on this side the gallows take fast hold of my hand and follow me for by the rustling of the straw we must be near the prisoners saying this the person who spoke stepped forward holding up the lanthern by whose light the object he and his companion were in search of presented itself to view lying in an abject posture his hands and legs bound and his associates in the same situation  young atwood receded as the nightwalkers advanced desirous to see the real motive and end of their enterprise one of the adventurers now held the lanthern to the face of sir guise the miserable paleness of which and every other sign of guilt and fear caused the person who had not yet spoken to exclaim in a piteous tone  alas unhappy man did i ever think your conduct would bring you to this and that the woman you have most injured should live to see it  then turning to her companion she exclaimed wicked as he is i cannot bear to see him in this sad posture tied like a criminal and thrown as it were into a dungeon if added the speaker falling on her knees to her companion  oh if there is any compassion in your heart if it has a spark of the love you profess to feel for me suffer me and assist me to loose these cruel cords i ask no more  loose the cords returned the other  no were i never to see you more although you are dear to my soul and i now tell you so all at once as my heart to my body i would neither assist nor suffer you to give that monster liberty of hand or foot had i thought mrs jenny could have desired such a thing not all the world  no not my love for you which i feel will be all the world to george should have made me show you the place what would your good brother say to this if poor dear jerome had his eye on us now only think how angry he would be  at the names jenny and george young atwood rushed forward and cried out in a terrible voice even before he was seen o wicked wicked girl would you set at liberty the wretch who has undone you who had well nigh brought your poor father and mother with sorrow to the grave and who has almost murdered your best friend and benefactor  for whose sake and for his other numberless sins he is destined to meet his deserts at last  yes vile sinner added he turning to sir guise you will be hanged you and all your accomplices but alas what are your lives or the lives of ten thousand thousand such villains to the fingerache of such a noble gentleman as sir armine fitzorton or the innocence of this poor wicked unhappy girl whom you have ruined and who is still sinful enough to wish you were free as for you george continued he i am not angry with i know your love for my sister and am sorry for you i know you would have died sooner than consent to let him escape and you only came here with the girl out of pure good will because she pretended she wanted to rebuke her seducer rebuke him why you could not say an angry word to him you know you could not jenny surely the girls are distracted mad george they love the scoundrels who undo them better than the men who would sooner lose their lives than do them a wrong  the poor jane overwhelmed with her agitations at being thus in the presence of her brother lover and betrayer could scarcely stand under the support of the two former  would to god i were dead said she but you wrong me brother i did not mean to make mr george guilty of ingratitude to his master by releasing sir guise i  i  i  only wished him not to be  be  bound in that manner  here her tears choked her utterance and she wept aloud  her sorrows awakened partington who no sooner heard the story from the honest lips of george than he called jenny a goodfornothing little vagabond shaking her most kindly by the hand all the time and desired george and jerome to lead her back to the house commanding them to say nothing of her adventure to any of the fitzortons and insisting the pretty young scoundrel should no more be scolded  scolded your honor replied george i would not let her own brother nor even your honor scold her if i could help it without knocking out both your brains only i thought  the thought of knocking out our brains is good and might in that case be justifiable perhaps cries partington but thinking is loss of time you rascal  here both of you give her a kiss and do as i ordered while i relieve guard over this allworthy gentleman  a profound bow to sir guise  and his two veteran associates  a bow to each till his head almost touched the straw  jenny went away somewhat pacified but could not help casting more than one look behind for though perhaps even partington did not more thoroughly despise the actions of the baronet nor more execrate his principles than did this virtuouslydisposed young woman  she felt for him involuntary emotions of pity and tenderness  the good partington saw this midnight enterprise as in truth he did most other things in the proper light and his knowledge of the human heart joined the pity he felt in his own to determine it was a matter to be hushed up on the return therefore of the young men he took each of them by the hand and desired them to be of good cheer since they had every reason to believe that when that amiable gentleman  a profound reverence to sir guise  had hung his hour the grand enemy to the girls peace of mind would be removed and he did not doubt but he should see jenny as goodfornothing a sister to jerome and as infamous a wife to george as any happy little varlet could desire to be  this inverted mode of compliment being well understood the youths were made again comfortable and the whole affair ended by jeromes taking george by the hand saying if so be things went that way there was not a man in the world he would so soon wish to call his brother provided the affair with that vile monster could be put up with  but for his part he would not marry a duchess no not the queens majesty herself if he knew she had been miss to another man though it were a king on his throne  jerome jerome you talk like a hector and a fool said partington  he talks said george ant please your honor like a young fellow who has never been in love true love forgives every thing that happens before wedlock and most things that happen after and as to jenny i think her the modestest girl in the whole world and i love her the best though i never told her so till today and when sir guise is dead i think all will be well between jenny and me though i had rather he should live fifty years and keep me out of jennys heart for ever than that any harm should betide my dear good old master or any of my honored young ones or any of the family not forgetting mr and miss clare  george said partington affecting to cough you are one of the most unsupportable young rascals i ever knew  give me your hand but take this for your comfort whether sir armine lives or dies atwoods sister shall be your wife and this rightworthy old youth  another bow  shall swing with both his excellent friends because it would be a sin to part them  here he rolled the baronet and his associates about and heaped the straw over them as if they were so many pigs  chapter xi the provisions which the youth ordered to be brought into the barn were now resorted to and the exulting trio sat down to the repast spread upon a winnowing machine turned the wrong side with as high spirits and as hearty an appetite as they ever enjoyed particularly as one of the waiters entered with a billet to partington containing the following words  to basil partington esquire my poor father is in a sound repose  request my unhappy friend charles to come to the bed which is prepared for him and do you dear sir take quiet possession of yours i cannot quit my post but hope to relate good tidings in the morning  yours affectionately henry fitzorton   partington having read this note and folded it up he handed it about first penciling on the back of it these words  read but let not the worthy sir guise suspect it brings any good news  he gave it to george who opened it and scarcely able to conceal his joy put it in the hands of jerome  miserable intelligence said partington with great gravity  no hopes you see  the surgeon no doubt gives it up as a lost case  heigho  let us raise our spirits with a glass of that wine fill george come here is to sir guises speedy mounting and to the sudden execution of valentine miles esquire the chaste mrs tempest  for we shall noose her too  and that most true and trusty of all valets  an inclination of the whole body as he mentioned each  david otley gentleman  it would be a compliment gentlemen to offer you any refreshment indeed seeing you have so short time to live it would be throwing good things away upon almost dead carcases and i hate to be extravagant  so wishing with all our souls that the hangman may do justice to all three of you we have the honor to drink your good health in all christian charity  the bitter sarcasm of tone gesture and action which characterised the scorn of partington cannot be conveyed in language  the bottle was emptied and the repast finished in the like spirit of biting ridicule which often extorted an oath from the daring valentine and drove the abashed sir guise looking more swinish than before under covert of his straw  one of the waiters now brought a letter into the barn saying it came by a special messenger who was then waiting a reply in the kitchen it contained what follows  to basil partington esquire forgive my having deceived you instead of retiring to my bed the pretense with which i left you i fled from the most horrid of all human sights  the presence of a father who has made his son curse the hour of his own birth and wish for death to cover his shame but how shall i escape myself and alas my poor sister how shall i shelter thee from the disgrace which is thus brought upon thee if henry can endure my hated name tell him i shall feel horrors not to be borne till i know the state of his injured parent i have other griefs settling in my soul but may not give them vent as for him  the atrocious the unnatural  i yield him to conscience and justice  and yet alas he is my father  might he not escape  forgive and pity  the distracted charles stuart n b i will remain here till i have your answer then fly to quarters     in the progress of perusing this letter the colors of compassion and indignation alternately mounted and sometimes mixed in partingtons cheek these were succeeded by tears that gushed from his eyes and that almost to the drowning of his voice insufferable young villain said he this is not to be endured  then darting a look of rage and contempt  which no features could more forcibly express than partingtons sharpened by that ironical asperity which was edged at every word and intonation with the most cutting energies  here cried partington listen to the sentiments of that scoundrel of a son who has run away from his amiable sire in his last distress and left him in confinement in his way to an ignominious death  he then read the letter aloud sinking only the last sentence mentioning sir guises being suffered to escape thundering in the ear of sir guise every expression that manifested the deep sense which charles had of his fathers villainy and at the end seeing him unmoved or if moved only from the impulses of fear behold said partington how the good baronets tender heart bleeds at the wounds which his ungracious boy has inflicted what sensibility what affliction what exquisite feeling honest conscientious gentleman he will hardly survive so unfilial an attack it will go with him to the gallows  the reverences which partington made during this address were repeated at every sentence till at last they arrived at almost persian prostration then desiring the baronet and his two friends would be kind enough to rise from the straw and hold themselves in readiness to be tried condemned and executed he left them in the charge of young atwood ordering true george to follow him into the house  chapter xii the good partington to the infinite joy of his honest heart found the fitzorton family still rejoicing at the unexpectedly rapid recovery of sir armine olivia had just prepared for him the third cup of tea and was going to place it on a waiter to be conveyed by a servant when this singular man snatched it from her hand declaring she was an infamous little villain to suppose any other person should carry it the old rascal but himself when he was within reach of him  that trouble is unnecessary said lady fitzorton sir armine feels himself quite stout enough to finish his breakfast below and that you olivia may be out of pain as completely as ourselves your good father gently turned me out of his apartment just now saying he would be my substitute hark i hear them coming the door was opened and discovered the truly reverend and honorable sir armine walking into the room with a not infirm step and rather affectionately embracing than leaning upon his friendly supporters henry and mr clare there said the old gentleman dismissing his attendants by spreading his arms to their extent armines himself again then taking every one by the hand he acknowledged their tender care assuring them of his freedom from pain except a kind of confusion in his head from the severe blow he had there been saluted with probably by the hand of sir guise stuart  no doubt exclaimed partington your obligations to that very worthy gentleman are so great that i hope you will have no objection to attend him and his brace of myrmidons to the justice who i find resides three miles on our road to adsell hall scarcely a furlong out of your way  though i trust you have enough of christian spirit in that old abominable body to travel to a court of equity as far as the alps in order to do your country the service of committing so very deserving and amiable a personage to the halter indeed as you are also in the commission i do not see why you should not pass sentence on the gentleman yourself  but perhaps you may think it right to pay your brother justice the compliment of hanging an honest man found in his district i expect at any rate that you will be well enough to see him swing for although you have given the death designed for you the slip there is i think malice prepense enough in the attack to hang the assassin and to tell you the truth if i did not think so i should scarcely forgive you for recovering  and if you are of a different opinion i must really beg the favor of you to die off as fast as you can that justice may be satisfied  i suppose added he you know that the worthy trio are under my custody and refreshing themselves at this moment in an unroofed barn with some unpeppered unsalted and unbuttered water gruel ready to march at the word of command  all the time partington was speaking poor jane atwood then happening to be in the room and behind olivias chair was obliged to hold it fast to support herself from falling henry from contrary causes but productive of the same effects was in a scarce better condition they were all however soon relieved by sir armine who taking a paper from his pocket at the sight of which olivias cheeks took the hue of the deepest crimson thus addressed his friends  i will read a paper of proposals to you my friends and must own it has wholly decided me as to what should be done with the prisoners i need not inform you that it was drawn up by that blushing little girl of ours and as i believe placed by lady fitzorton upon my pillow  why what wickedness has the little rascal been at now quoth partington  you shall hear replied sir armine and then putting the paper into lady fitzortons hand desired her to read it for the good of the company which while olivia sat between the palpitating henry and mr clare she did as follows   to sir armine fitzorton bart my dearly valued friend and almost father but that the news the heartfelt news of your being recovered  but that the assurances of my soulelected henry promise us the sight of you in a few hours i should neither have the will nor the power to write to you on the proposed subject of this paper which is in behalf of your bitterest enemy not for his own sake you will readily believe but as his public disgrace must inevitably be connected with the public character and private feelings of far more worthy persons  there is a little villain for you said partington drawing the back of his hand across his eyes  lady fitzorton went on   had any thing fatal happened from the merciless being for whom i now plead heaven only knows how any of those persons would have borne the blow surely it would have broken all our hearts  dear angelic girl cried old clare pressing her to his bosom  were any thing to break thine the strings of mine would crack i am sure  lady fitzorton proceeded   but as it has pleased the great restorer in pity and in love to give you to us certain i am that the only resentment your allnoble nature is capable of feeling against the cruel author of your sufferings will be confined to himself alone and no way extend to the innocent because they happen to be his offspring  sweet olivia said lady fitzorton taking one of her hands  she is my child my own dear daughter cried mr clare proudly think of that eagerly snatching the other hand  thanks be to god that gave her to me  she is my daughter  go on with the letter said sir armine coughing to conceal his emotions  on this principle i dare to sue even for sir guise stuart  since the shame and sorrow of his children  the excellent caroline and her amiable brother  would be doubly heaped upon them were you to carry even your just vengeance against this misguided man i tremble for the effect of a public prosecution on their minds  good and gracious heaven ejaculated henry is it possible  ah permit me dearest sir armine to place myself in their situation while i plead their cause i feel that the reflected infamy of him who gave me being would kill me  my child thy father shall never dishonor thee said mr clare the proudest chords of his heart finely touched  never never  the gentle henry too dearest and best of men would lament the fate of his drooping friend he would join my sympathizing woes for the blushes and tears of the sweet caroline  i cannot support it  he must be more than human that can cried henry  as i am neither more or less than human i will hear no more of the vile husseys nonsense unless the letter is read on without stoppings said partington blowing his nose violently  even our poor jane would be afflicted and sir armine himself whose heart is the throne of all that is humane and honorable would endure a pang it never ought to feel were even this hardened creature to pass his days in a prison after the ignominy of a public trial  jane atwoods whole frame quivered at the idea and had not her hand still clung to olivias chair she must have fallen  zounds and the devil you determined murderess have you almost done cried partington  hem hem  read the last passage cried sir armine  thank heaven we are coming to the last passage  in the names therefore of his unhappy son the denizen of your henrys bosom of his duteous daughter in whose honor and felicity i feel a sisters interest in that of beloved lady fitzorton and of my own adored father whose compassionate heart i am sure goes with my petition i implore that sir guise with all his crimes on his head may be suffered to depart if it be possible without his foul deeds or at least his foul disgrace reaching the ears of his innocent and outraged daughter let henry and his friend owe this  through your abundant clemency  o my second father to the intercession of  your duteous and ever grateful olivia clare   when lady fitzorton was preparing to read olivia would have quitted the room and starting up had got to the door but partington caught hold of her and exclaimed stop you insufferable scoundrel stop  i knew you had done something to be ashamed of but there is no escaping i am an excellent hand to catch a thief and to keep him too  witness sir guise and co  for some time henry had manifested emotions almost beyond his nature to endure generosity goodness compassion and every other quality that exalts humanity in those happy moments when every principle is alive and every passion moving to virtuous impulse reflected from the conduct of olivia struck on his heart well fitted to receive such distinguished guests at length dropping on his knees o teach me he exclaimed teach me how i can deserve such excellence  olivia who had not till that moment raised her head which alternately reposed on her fathers and henrys arm as the proper supports of her blooming merit now ventured to look up summoned by a voice to her indeed sweet as the shepherds pipe upon the mountains and tenderly returning the embrace of her enthusiast she declared that although the whole company had out of all bounds overrated common sentiments of christian charity she felt herself rejoiced not to have offended and if there was any merit it was all borrowed from constant association with those whose conduct was at once her emulation and her example  then i suppose the worthy baronet is not to be hanged this time said partington  no said sir armine i think i see myself so well and so satisfied that i shall take olivias advice  why for that matter rejoined partington i must own i too have a letter to be read which seems to strengthen an idea of that sort and as i plainly perceive my vote to break the honest mans neck will pass for nothing where a pack of abominable goodfornothing scoundrels are resolved to save him  here henry do you give us the contents of this  presenting him with that letter from charles which was before offered to the reader  it was with great labor that henry after many stops lets and hindrances from the overflowings of his own heart and that of the company finished this epistle all the passions of his nature had been up in arms for a considerable time in this last letter there were some hard lines which pierced him and him only of the party to the quick  the forlorn situation of caroline wondering perhaps at the absence of her father the tender goodness of olivia the benevolent disposition of sir armine and the dire heartrending condition of his friend charles formed in his bosom such a mass of contrary and conflicting passions and principles desires and duties hopes and fears that henry fitzortons situation at this crisis was perhaps as truly to be commiserated as at any period not of his individual but of the human history  do you henry said sir armine for i know you will do it in the best manner answer your friends letter  partington will only interlard it with vagabonds and scoundrels  no  it will be better dear boy in your hands  you will assure your friend of my continued esteem for him and that while you are telling him so his father will be set at liberty  jane atwood here quitted the room very hastily  and add my henry cried sir armine that it shall be by no fault of mine or my family or my friends if the cruel and unprovoked assault is ever divulged to  to  to  his  to miss    sir armine hesitated seeing some paper which had lain on the table tremble in henrys hand to pronounce the name of caroline or stuart he therefore only added in an under tone heard only by henry  you know who i mean henry  and while harry is thus employed you my dear sir armine observed lady fitzorton you may go with me if you please  they did so and while they were absent partington being now left alone with henry exclaimed what you vagabond is to be done now our plan you see has been overturned and there is no time for another you cannot be carried off again this forced match i fear after all must take place yet who but such a fellow as you would require force to possess such a darling little villain as olivia what do you intend  would i were dead and buried ejaculated henry or would i had never seen  indulge me dear mr partington by leaving me alone a little i will endeavor to do what i ought  what is right order the carriages as desired  some delay will of course happen after this accident  at least one day and if i gain another day i shall have time to think and to decide  partington who amidst all his singularities was never troublesome and who indeed knew not how to advise henry whom he sincerely loved left the room saying only with visible signs of anxiety  all i know of a certainty is that you are one of the most atrocious young scoundrels i ever saw and therefore i wish with all my soul i could see you happy without seeing others who are as great vagabonds as yourself miserable  chapter xiii the letter which henry after he had recovered himself wrote to charles contained all the generous sentiments his father dictated with every grace they could receive from eloquent expression but they were mingled with others that betrayed a disordered and almost distracted mind but which would become intelligible to charles in addition to his fathers kind commands he told his friend that nothing but rocks and precipices were before him that all the powers of gratitude duty love friendship honor pity hope and despair were at once warring in his breast that whichever way he moved some of these were his constant attendants in opposition to each other with regard to his power of reconciling them with his peace and agreed only in one determined point  a general confederacy against his happiness for that even hope herself which in any other mans situation would bring healing on her wings seemed to make her visits of a moment to him only to show his state was so forlorn so destitute there was no resting place whereon she could set her foot and that she was compelled to leave him to despair  ah my dear dear friend and partner in grief observed the unhappy henry the firebrands of hate and animosity which our affectionate care joined to the goodness of sir armines heart had almost extinguished are by this baneful rencontre and its effects kindled afresh and must consume you and your beloved olivia henry and his adored caroline in ashes  he then implored the advice and assistance of charles without the slightest expectation that either could be availing he ran on to some length in a state of incoherence that entangled the design and obscured the sense with which he began and in fine discovered that his enthusiasm threatened to hurl reason from her throne he then recurred to that last dire refuge of the desperate and argued the point of life and death by his own hand with a casuistry so subtle that he had almost persuaded himself suicide was the only virtue left him to perform  this way only said he can olivia escape a man whose heart is for ever alienated  for ever possessed by another this way alone can my friend avoid the misery of seeing the woman he adores in the arms of another  this way too shall he be dissolved from his everlasting oath and die faithful to the vows of his heart  after a long indulgence of this phrenzy he took the path which led to the contrary extreme where duty to his father and admiration of the tender virtues as well as tender pity for the affection of olivia convinced him though his days were to exceed those of the longest liver upon earth he ought still to wish their prolongation that he might reward so much benevolence beauty and goodness he concluded the epistle by confessing his whole soul was in the state of this globe of earth when all its materials were discordant atoms and not having suffered his passions or his imagination intemperate as they were to extinguish for more than a moment those heavenly sparks which his principles had lighted up and which his education had fostered in his soul he ended with a prayer that the power who called into order a world and perhaps myriads of worlds from anarchy would deign to bring his deeplydistracted mind from its present chaos  the unfortunate writer of this farrago having addressed sealed and dispatched it felt an impulse he could not but indulge to join the party now assembled in the barn he there found sir armine and lady fitzorton olivia and mr clare who had been interrupted in their way thereto by a little adventure of jane atwoods  the reader may recollect the latter of these persons left the room suddenly the occasion of which was this  finding through the benevolence of olivia and sir armine that her still too kindlyremembered sir guise would receive no farther hardships and conjecturing she should incur no censure by a little anticipation of the intended clemency the poor girl obeying the softness of her heart which told her that nature insisted on her dues of daily bread as well in her guilty as innocent subjects had ventured to gain one of the waiters over to her wishes of administering something to eat and drink more nutritious than the bread and water which that vigilant disciplinarian mr partington had permitted to be set before them since their captivity having seen her brother therefore safe at his own breakfast and true george whose heart on this side a breach of duty could deny her nothing fixed as his substitute she had passed the first sentinel namely the aforesaid george and had got with her basket of provisions to the barn door and was just giving orders to the waiter to take it to the prisoners when sir armine and the rest caught her in the fact  it is not easy to conjecture the ingenuous distress and embarrassment of jane atwood she entered upon her defense in so very lame a manner that her offense would have been extremely aggravated had she not found a better advocate in olivia who with honest energy declared she should have done the same or worse had she reflected on the circumstances of the poor wretches for i do not think said she i could know the wickedest creature upon the earth no not my fathers murderer  though the very thought of him would nearly murder me too  no i am positive i could not let even him die of famine while i had charge of his life and power to administer to those bitter wants which would make him incapable even of repentance in his last moments  take that basket george said sir armine and carry it to the party who are in need of its contents  or no  stop continued he i have a thought may answer the purpose better  here jane do you carry this into the house and in a room apart from that which we occupy order a proper repast to be prepared for the persons you intended to relieve and see good girl that it be done immediately  jane bursting into tears could answer to this kindness only by them and several bows which george made for her saying their honors saw the young woman was not well george then took hold of her arm and conducted her into the house  it was at this moment that henry arrived sir armine undertook the explanation so much to olivias honor that henry incessantly warmed by instances of her excellent disposition felt it was if not the conquering the resistless moment and with violence protested he was sure she must be an angel no replied olivia putting her face close to that of henry alas no angel but a mere mortal who considers that the poor wretch bad as he is gave birth to charles and caroline of whose inestimable value we are both conscious  thus perpetually did olivia promote the cause of others and counteract her dearest interests at the displays of her character and conduct henry often glowed with such admiration and gratitude that he could have been proud to have flown with her to the altar but then her conversation so frequently brought back the image and virtues of caroline to his mind that she was in a manner accessory to his looking on that altar as the place where should he yield his hand to olivia he must at the same time sacrifice his love his fame his friend his honor and his virtue  chapter xiv sir armine with his family now entered the place where the proud crestfallen sir guise and his infamous accomplices were degraded and advancing within a few paces stopped short  for a moment we too must pause good reader to converse in a friendly manner with one another peradventure thou have formed great expectations of this meeting of the two baronets thou may suppose that the injured sir armine after much triumph over the captive sir guise will dismiss him with all the pride of a conqueror if thou art of a sanguine complexion thou will prepare for the grand sublime of some great action accompanied by all its verbal pageantries and if of a phlegmatic turn thou will be dissatisfied if any thing be said or done beyond the barren limit of thy own cold nature either way if thou art deeply read in fastidious learning thou will be disappointed in this transaction which consisted  after a moments delay to beg lady fitzorton and olivia would apprehend nothing  in the offended party going up to the grand offender and with his own hand unbinding his legs and arms beckoning to george and his son henry to do the same for miles and david otley  the contrast exhibited in the two baronets at this instant was such as a delineator of the human character has seldom an opportunity to observe the awful and superior majesty of an insulted and innocent man giving liberty to a base clandestine enemy who though nearly dead to the excesses of conscious infamy seemed almost to wish that the cords thus loosened were drawn tight even to strangulation round his neck  sir armine pointed to the door and signified by sufficient tokens that the path to the abbey or wherever else he might desire to take his way would not be obstructed but sir armine uttered not a word till he gained the courtyard that led from the barn to the house and then in a voice that penetrated the heart of every hearer he said  attribute thou implacable thy undeserved enlargement to thy children and mine whose virtues are a balance  and surely higher praise cannot be given them  for vices such as thine  disdaining to cast a look on the subordinate engines of baseness sir armine with his associates went into the house but he had scarcely passed his foot over the threshold before jane atwood and true george came running into the passage by another door to say that an armed multitude were marching on from the neighboring villages to revenge the injuries committed against their respected patron sir armine by their detested tyrant sir guise  he must be protected said sir armine george flew to his protection swift as the word young atwood who was at hand did the same his sister repeated sir armines orders till adsell woods reechoed  sir guise must be protected henry fitzorton forsook for a moment the side of olivia to attempt the rescue of the father of caroline but the mob who now poured into the innyard covering the fields adjacent were at first too clamorous to be opposed  they had heard the story of the assassination with all the extravagant additions of a traveling tale and here as at the abbey and castle sir guise being an object of general hatred and sir armine of as general love even the entreaties explanations promises and threats of the latter could not prevent the enraged multitude from hooting pelting hissing hustling buffeting and beating the former out of the innyard and in despite of henry partington young atwood george and jane who followed the rabble from one end of the parish to the other their unmitigated fury was pursued by the assailants even to that part of adsell forest where the postillion told them the attack was made at that memorable place had not the shrieks and at length the swoons of jane atwood like a guardian genius broke the raging passions by exciting the general pity and humanity of the mob to restore a beautiful young woman whom some of them supposed was the baronets daughter sir guise otley and miles would have breathed their last on the identical spot where they had begun the assassination  thus implored they suffered at length the miscreant and his minions to escape and the mob turned all their attention to the young woman who  after recovering and being assured by the generous george in a tender whisper that sir guise had got off alive  was carried by the people safe back to the inn here they met sir armine mr clare and the ladies coming in consternation to know what had been the result of the affray olivia seeing henry for whom she had felt terrors not to be described fell into a state scarce less pitiable than that of jane but at length the adventure of the running fight was explained the company took some more refreshment and the good surgeon telling sir armine the sooner he left the scene of agitation and got to his own quiet home the better partington ordered the horses and carriages to be brought out and sir armine his friends and familty left the eventful inn  but they had not yet arrived at the land of peace for the same multitude which had dismissed sir guise with so many marks of disapprobation would not part with sir armine without greetings of as violent applause they hung on the wheels of his coach took off the horses and drew him along in triumph they ran after him for some miles crying out god bless sir armine and at last stopped the carriages and horses insisting that partington henry and all the retinue should join them in three cheers to the honor of sir armine after which they gave a universal huzza and suffered the vehicles and horsemen to proceed  chapter xv the rest of the journey was performed without any farther interruptions except that toward the end of it sir armine complained of uneasy sensations in his stomach which he said he was apprehensive were the forebodings of his old constitutional enemy the gout  at length however the antique towers and gothic avenues of adsell hall appeared in view and the evening sun was playing its beams on the romantic scenery around at the prospects of which different sentiments were produced in the minds of some of the company  in the fine eyes and complexion of olivia were written all those tender perturbations hopes and fears which till now the late occurrences had banished from her gentle bosom but she said nothing it was at the altar of that old chapel my child observed mr clare that your grandfather was made the happiest of mankind  o may the heirs to his fortune the fair domain that is now opening upon us succeed to that richer possession his unspeakable felicity for i know by my own heart  widower as it is and wholly bereaved as it would be but for thee olivia the old gentleman tenderly drew his daughter toward him i know there is no earthly treasure so invaluable as a chaste and virtuous companion  such as alas i have lost mr clare brought his daughters hand from his bosom to his lips and impressed it with a kiss that was moistened with a tear while olivia gently lifted her other hand to the old mans cheek and wreathing her arm by degrees round his neck repaid the precious drops which he had shed with tenfold interest  meantime sir armine forgot every former pain in the supremely happy reflection of still possessing the excellent lady fitzorton whom having viewed for some moments with conscious pride he exclaimed with an energy that spoke the soul  the years of that lovely girl almost thrice numbered pointing to olivia have thou been the blessing of my life  the coachman was ordered to stop at the top of the hill from whence adsell hall park and chapel were discovered and where these little pictures of family happiness were drawn henry and partington had rode on one side of the road keeping even with the coach and the postchariot in which were george and jane to whom her brother was now added drew up on the other more in apprehension of sir armines returning sickness than in expectance of those sweetly tearful sensations which welcome the pains if pains they may be called of a tender heart the whole group therefore characteristically felt the scene henry who had witnessed it from the time of mr clares paternal prayer to sir armines last reflection and to whom the sight of the chapel brought back every agonising anticipation counterfeited but ill the smile he gave to mr clare when that good man wished him all the bliss that both their houses had experienced in marriage henry bowed acknowledgment but observing the evening dews were falling advised his father to avoid them by suffering him to order the coachman and postillion to drive briskly to the hall by this maneuver he escaped the severity of any farther trial of his feelings true george wept and laughed by turns young atwood bore him company but jane was so overwhelmed with the conflicts which preceded that when the carriages were again in motion she felt relieved some minutes before partington whose sensibility had been variously excited turned his horse from the coach again into the road swearing that sir guise and his worthy pair of friends were archangels to sir armine and his family who he plainly saw  here he rubbed his eyes which were not dry  had a desire to blind him first and then to break his heart for which amongst a multitude of other obliging favors he considered the whole body men and women as a set of dd goodfornothing assassinating caitiffs and scoundrels  at length they arrived at the place of destination the sun had just made a golden set the villagers were assembled on the green which neighboured the hall to pay their first salutations and the rural bells joined merrily in chorus to the notes of universal welcome it was indeed considered by the inhabitants of the surrounding parishes as a jubilee which had been expected by the peasantry and husbandmen for many years their lovely patroness was now come amongst them not only to take possession of her ample inheritance but to share it as they had often heard with a youth generous as herself and from whose liberal regulations they expected to derive all the benefits of honest industry and of easy servitude for it had been given out that if the young squire and his lady liked adsellhall they were to fit it up for their general residence a point of the utmost importance to the sons and daughters of poverty that nothing on their parts therefore might be wanting whatever could demonstrate respect gratitude and zeal were now to be seen and heard  a village poet whose meter was looked upon by the rustics as the sublimest effort of human genius presented a gratulatory ode in the last stanza of which he promised an epithalamium when the young couple should attend the altar of hymen a rural musician whose untutored melody was at least a match for the uncouth rhyme of the aforesaid bard composed a cantata which was to be rehearsed the evening of the arrival but to be played to a full band immediately after the ceremony  the barber having promised his flute the huntsman of a neighboring squire his horn and the clerk of an attorney from the next market town his fiddle the composer himself literally executing harmony on the bassoon six of the village maids were selected by sage matrons to twine chaplets of jessamine and roses cudgelplaying singlestick and cricket were also in preparation and a variety of other honorary tokens of duty good will and homage were designed to celebrate the nuptials of henry fitzorton and the blooming lady of the manor  these innocent testimonies of rustic satisfaction were highly acceptable to all but henry who having now had leisure for retrospect looked upon every preparation as a garland to decorate a grand sacrifice of which he was to be the principal victim and yet matters had now gone to such length he saw no way to escape his obligations to olivia whose virtues were ever under his eyes multiplied every hour his obstacles to the hand of caroline were increased tenfold within the last two days even though before they did not seem to admit of augmentation all that could be expected was a little delay that his father might recover his late fatigue before he entered on a fresh course of tumultuary happiness and even this sir armine determined should postpone the festivity only twentyfour hours  there was a rough honesty in the good partington who albeit unused to the soft parts of speech had as much nicety in feeling as bluntness in expression he was often on the point of at once extricating henry by unfolding his situation to mr clare or even to olivia herself for he entered into the spirit of henrys objections and though he did not see the least possibility of his friend being united to the woman he loved  the daughter of the villain or as partington himself called him the worthy gentleman who would have murdered sir armine  he could look for nothing but grief and disappointment in marrying one whom he did not love even though it was the charming olivia but the business of interference was difficult and delicate and after long deliberation he once more took henry aside to say my dear scoundrel i can do you no good and i do not choose to run the hazard of doing you any harm so tomorrow morning i shall take myself back into my own country attended by young atwood whose family are now in suspense about him all i have to observe is that if you have no better means than a second elopement and wish for an asylum i can lock you up in my cellar in descending to which there is a wellstored pantry and there you may remain you unhappy villain till you have drunk and eat me out for i must confess as love is not on your side of the question you would do better to live with toads in the vapor of a dungeon as that incomparable old scoundrel will shakespeare expresses it than with the fairest and finest girl in the world in a palace for in that case to my firm thoughts olivia is no better than an oysterwench  with this sentiment he left henry forlorn and undecided and would have made ready for his journey but for one of those unforeseen interventions which in this world of changes baffles the limited foresight of man and sometimes at a moments warning sometimes without it levels emperors and empires and every labored edifice of their power fancy and ambition in that common dust of nature out of which they and all that they create or inherit were formed proving at once the strength and weakness of mortality  chapter xvi on the evening of the day preceding the intended nuptials sir armine felt himself unexpectedly faint accompanied by a slight return of his pains in different parts of the body but particularly in that where he had received the ruffians last dastardly blow he withdrew to his chamber before the usual hour convinced himself and convincing others that a few hours rest which he felt he should enjoy would make him rise more alert in the morning than either the intended bride or bridegroom resisting all offers to have anybody sit up with him and it having been settled before he was taken ill that on this the last night of olivias single state lady fitzorton was to be the partner of her bed he went up stairs peremptorily refusing company or assistance and as lady fitzorton saw he was not in a temper of mind to be controlled she vexed him not with importunity  but growing worse in the night he resorted to as he thought a bottle of laudanum in whose powers he had always too much faith and although in much agony he was unwilling to disturb any of the family thinking the disorder would pass away in the profoundness of that sleep which the supposed laudanum his favorite panacea would procure he went so hastily to the closet where the day before he had locked up all his medicines that the lamp went out and in this state of darkness and uncertainty as he was in search of something to hold the laudanum he unfortunately laid his hand on a cup in which had been mixed up and incautiously left by the house steward a preparation of arsenic and other poisonous drugs to destroy some rats which had infested several parts of the dilapidated mansion anxious to remove the malady which he felt every minute increasing he resorted again to the medicinechest and poured a double proportion of his favorite anodyne upon the dregs which having drunk he returned to his bed  the deadly quality of the poison was for some time overborne by the balmy power of the anodyne and poor sir armine enjoyed a temporary repose out of which alas he was roused at the dawn of the day by sensations of misery that raged through his whole frame the family were alarmed they found sir armine in speechless agony at a transient interval of which he with difficulty exclaimed  the laudanum the laudanum some dire mistake  a shriek from the wife of the house steward who had taken up the cup out of which sir armine had drank the fatal potion now augmented the consternation by wildly crying out  o why did not my husband remove this cruel cruel cup his honor ladies has swallowed poison  this cup alas this cup  incapable of finishing the sentence she fell on the floor  poisoned sir armine poisoned ejaculated every one present the god of heaven and earth forbid  on the arrival of the very surgeon who attended sir armine at adsell and whom true george almost with the rapidity of wings had fetched from thence medicines were administered which after a violent operation of some hours gave gleams of hope that sir armine might be restored so far as human means could recover him on the fourth day by judicious treatment he could bear to sit up and saw by turns every one of his family in his chamber henry was still his constant attendant and rarely left the bedside his beloved hand  for in sickness as in health he was his darling  administered the cordials and they seemed to acquire new energies from such ministration the gentle olivia too was often at the door even when it was impossible to gain entrance the solicitous inquiries of the villagers after their venerable and reverend pastor and patron were incessant in the end the poison seemed wholly expelled by the antidotes but had left his general health so much invaded his frame even to its stamina so shaken his stomach was so torn by his old malignant enemy and perhaps even yet some internal pains from those bruises which a more inveterate foe had inflicted that the effects of all these evils brought on a complication of ills for which perhaps in the most vigorous bloom of mans life there could have been no established cure but which must inevitably even in the firmest constitution and such sir armine had been blessed with have terminated in a manner the most fatal  the dreaded stroke which was to separate this venerable man therefore from his family came on with solemn steps and slow but alas they were not less certain than if the dire power of the poison had continued to rage he was in a manner dying daily under their eyes but happily his pangs were less and less acute thus he regained comparative ease of body and tranquillity of mind and though assured of deaths approaches for some weeks before the fatal arrow sped he displayed to all around a rare example of paternal tenderness patience and every christian virtue  when sir armine felt his hour at hand which he expected more than a week before it arrived he expressed wishes to her whose delight had ever been to obey them that he might breathe his last at fitzorton castle thither therefore he was removed by slow degrees and seemed much the better both for the air and exercise of the journey  what a seducer is the heart it again deceived all the fitzortons and clares with a false but soothing hope that sir armine might yet be spared to them and when these fond expectations were imparted to their object he received them with a smile which showed his reluctance to damp an innocent delusion which he saw gave them pleasure  the disorder nevertheless in silent depredation went on and in the evening of the fatal night in which its victim departed he desired such of the family as were then in his room to leave him all of you said sir armine holding henry by the hand but this young man with whom i wish to confer and when i ring the bell let it i pray be considered as a summons for your return to me  they obeyed  o thou the nearest to my heart said he to henry in this its last hour of motion  for the hand of death is outstretched i see it hovering over my pillow  thou for whom it throbs with tenderness unutterable  i charge thee with my expiring breath and by my parting souls eternal hope as soon after my decease as the decent forms of the world allow not to delay fulfilling the purpose for which the journey that will produce my dissolution was undertaken for were all other motives annihilated  and i have pardoned all men  even as i hope to be pardoned  all motives i say but those which are due to the best of the aged and of the young  to my earliest friend and to his child those are all sufficient my own immediate death is not more inevitable than would be theirs on your refusal perhaps my dear henry this point of union has been pressed on my part with too fond a solicitude  beyond a parents authority it is my only pang in death you must place it amongst the faults of my long life but it is alas now too late to avail yourself of this error guard then with the most religious care from the father and the child whose fate is in your hand the remotest thought of it ever having been necessary for me to urge this subject and conceal yet more religiously the secret attachment you have unadvisedly once entertained for any other woman more particularly for the daughter of the man who  but i will not insult you by farther mention of that implacable whose conduct you must deprecate think that my latest blessing even if not withheld cannot be deserved  if   o i will be the victim of a thousand sacrifices die a thousand deaths exclaimed henry in an agony to deserve and to receive that blessing  receive it most certainly thou shall said sir armine even if it be not deserved it will be my duty to give but it rests with my son to bestow or to refuse what will impart to that duty all its sweetness my son decide thy fathers life hangs by a thread which the next breath may sever  henry was so utterly absorbed as scarce to hear his fathers thrice repeated command to ring the bell when however he obeyed the family reappeared  amongst these we have to number john fitzorton who had been at length informed of sir armines extremity the cause of which however was to be imputed to the accident of the poison every one but especially sir armine trembled at the consequences should the part that sir guise had taken be made known from the vow of silence therefore which sir armine imposed the family was only in part released john had rode almost at full speed two days and nights to take his everlasting leave of a parent whom he loved with a strength and ardour not inferior to that which was borne him by henry or james and this ardour inspired him with a speed that even outstripped the rapidities of the former  but his fathers exhausted appearance the depredation that had been made in his majestic form the sinking voice the faded eye the trembling hand and the various wrecks of a deathbed sickness struck the heart of john with a dismay far beyond the powers of speech but though silence enchained his tongue the friend the son the man spoke in every feature flowed when he could weep in every tear and agonised in every groan  thou art in good time my inestimable john said his father to receive my warmest blessing my warmest gratitude thou art in time also to witness the happiness with which a christian can leave this world pleased and proud at the thought of bequeathing to it in his own family some of its noblest ornaments and examples  john fitzorton uttered not a sentence yet seemed almost suffocated from the powers of speech refused  the relief even of a single tear was long denied him after his first survey of his fathers situation he had hurried round to the left side of the bed fell on his knees put his fathers hand into his bosom there held it and looked steadily at sir armines countenance  the object of his care here spread forth his arms as if to illustrate his eulogy by encircling his family mr clare and olivia in the intermediate space betwixt his life and death as henry was leaning over his pillow a whispered question and reply passed between sir armine and his youngest son  is my blessing to be deserved  o in all things now left within my power  all i require is in your power said sir armine  henry seemed eager to say something in reply but his father prevented by invoking upon his obedient son the last benediction of a dying parent he then clasped henry in his arms beckoning to olivia to receive him from an expiring father as her future guardian and husband then taking up a bible which he had been frequently reading and which at all times in sickness and in health was laid behind his pillow he pressed it with fervor to his lips emphatically repeating  the everlasting benediction of a father be upon ye both he then delivered the book to henry saying after an earnest gaze whose meaning could not be mistaken do thou likewise  henry the victim of a thousand emotions kissed the sacred volume with an ardour as if he hoped from its holy power the inspiration of fortitude greater than his own and in a voice suited to such expected succor exclaimed on the holy bond of these aweful leaves do i swear to ratify the commands of a dying parent  enough said sir armine i die in peace  sir armine survived this speech only a few hours but the reader will permit us to conduct him hastily from the sacred apartment and quit for a while the melancholy castle of fitzorton  chapter xvii we were constrained to leave the unhappy caroline in various distress occasioned by the receipt of olivias letter which as the reader remembers threw the whole party whom it concerned  and it involved the destiny of several persons  into perplexities out of which there appeared no friendly clue  to this on the part of caroline succeeded the secret departure of her brother and father with an air of mystery which foreboded fresh calamities in this solitary state while she was wandering in the thorny labyrinths of conjecture one of her maids came into her chamber and officiously related the news which had been brought by a tenant who had passed through adsell and was come to settle his yearly accounts at the abbey  this man had told dennison in the heedless girls hearing the history of the affray as he had picked it up in the kitchen of the inn where truth was so far from being the historian that every fact was distorted and by the time the good farmer had traveled with it to the abbey for he made a stop at every public house in his way it had grown to such a frightful size that even at adsell had it been carried back again in the state it was delivered to caroline or at least as related to her by the maidservant it would scarce have been known to be the story of sir guises assassination and of sir armines consequent malady  the farmer recorded that his worshipful reverend honor of fitzorton was at the point of death that all the company men and women even to the coachman on his box were beaten almost to mummies and that instead of marriage there was god willing in all likelihood to be a burial ceremony of them all  that his honorables dishonest landlord sir guise his unhonorable madam who it is thought is lurking hard by and his hangeron miles as pure a limb of the devil as you should wish to see and another illlooked fellow all jumped out of a wood at once snapped their blunderbusses drew their broadswords and went desperateously to work and being taken by one squire bartington or partington were thrust into an old barn till sir armine was dead then to go before justice who it was thought would order them all for gaol then to the gallows to this intelligence the farmer added that the young captain stuart brave as a lions whelp ran for it lest he should be hanged too as one of the accomplishes though he had no hand in it but like father like son they say you know yet he took sir armines part against his own father whom he thrashed heartily good that but thought i he should have got another thrasher i had some notion master dennison of asking to see the wicked old gentleman after he had got into lobs pound so save myself the trouble of this journey by paying my rent to himself said the farmer for though he is an old rogue under favor it is no reason i should be one too but on second thoughts i remembered to have read in a book that a prisoners bond is no bond a nullification as they say so thought i what signifies his honors receipt to i now seeing his body is the lawyers and his handwriting by the same token a nullification another reason was that i did not like to be seen in company with his honor after he was a sassinator for thought i  i am you know mr dennison a pretty bit of a thinker  yes thought i to i i may be had up as a witness or summut or other and law work often takes a man from business and moreover i had my thoughts about me after another fashion i did not like to give so much money into the hands of a man who was in a hanging condition seeing as mayhap his family had a better right to it than mr john catch and moreover there is no knowing thought i to what straits a great gentleman like sir guise may be driven to before he takes to the highway and who knows thought i  a keen one ant i  but if i pay this rent of mine to master dennison who i know to be an honest man but miss or the captain may be the better for it  an honest one too you see  so thought i i will even seem to take no notice but after baiting my beast and lunching a bit myself i will jog on and let em know how matters are here at adsell for thought i mayhap poor miss at home knows nothing of what rogues tricks her father has been doing in those um parts there so mr dennison here i am here is my money and here is the long and short of the story  had not dennison been too much occupied by the circumstances to attend whether there had been any auditors in the room but himself he would doubtless have attempted to set the seal of secrecy on the lips of the loquacious maid but she happened to have just returned from sweeping dennisons little parlour when the farmer came and as the door was left on the jar the girl stood with open eyes and ears suspended on her brush devouring every syllable and the moment the talebearer had ended she ran without waiting to hear dennisons comments to make a report of even more than the whole first to her young lady and then to every one of her fellow servants  notwithstanding the terror and astonishment which these tidings produced in the mind of caroline she saw that much was magnified by the fears of the maid and allowed for the natural progress of a malicious tale yet enough of the probable remained after all reasonable deductions to excite apprehensions that something dreadful had happened and that almost every person most near and dear to her was concerned she would have gone down to the farmer and questioned him herself but that another of the maid servants at that time came to the apartment with dennisons dutiful desire as he expressed himself to hold some discourse with her the object of this interview was to conceal with much care every thing that had been already divulged and at the same time to frame some excuse for his dennisons journey to adsell where the good steward said he had reason to suppose his presence might be serviceable on a little matter of business farmer spedman has been here miss said the good old man under great emotion which he labored to hide and i find by him all matters respecting his honors estates which lie in that county are not to his honors liking and  and  and  as  perhaps  his honor and young master and the rest he had reasons to suppose were detained there  or  or thereabouts  and perhaps did not choose to let your ladyship know because it might vex your ladyship i  i  i think  it may be right for me to set off and see what can be done  so i desired the farmer to go before and  and    dennison said caroline i see your distress but i have heard as much of the sad story brought by farmer spedman as yourself and am so far from disapproving your journey to adsell  for there i understand the unfortunates are assembled  that i am determined to be your companion and desire the chariot may be got ready directly from the next town we can go post i do not my good dennison suspect and heaven forbid i should half the dreadful events which the ignorant farmer has talked upon but something depend upon it is wrong and we are both called upon by our duty to set out this instant then turning to the maid servant and saying betty i shall want your assistance was hastening out of the room dennison who apprehended more than caroline or at least than she thought fit to express tried many ways to gain permission for his undertaking the journey alone observing that if any thing worse than he hoped had happened    the more unfortunate my fathers or brothers situation the more shall i  wanted cried caroline and at  i am resolved to go  so without  time or words i must entreat  with a more peremptory voice and  than usual that the carriage may be  door immediately as she was  second time her brother the lieutenant made his appearance the happiness of seeing one of the persons dearest to her soul return alive gave cheerful presage of the rest and she was opening her arms to receive him when that afflicted youth after violently stamping on the ground to express contrary emotions too strong for utterance staggered to a chair and burst into a flood of tears presently seeing only the confidential dennison with his sister the maid servant being gone out of the room my dear caroline said charles prepare to leave this pesthouse immediately  it is the seat of contagion disgrace and shame it has covered us with blushes  fly with your unhappy brother this moment  i was going to quit it replied the trembling caroline but wherefore do i see you thus agitated where is my father alas i have heard in part and i see in your terrorstriking looks your trembling lips and shaking frame the dreadful news  yes let us fly this instant to his rescue  his rescue cried charles the rescue of an assassin a common cutthroat a murderer would thou fly to rescue him no it is to escape his presence  to avoid him for ever ah my unhappy beloved sister let us hide our disgraceful heads in some unthoughtof corner for that i am come and but for the love of thee no earthly power should have brought me to the accursed spot which returns on my memory the author of our injuries  dennison saw this was no time to reason down the rage and almost phrenzy of charles or to enter into a detail of questions falling therefore on his knees while the big drops of sympathy flowed down his cheeks he implored to be partner of his young masters and ladys fortunes whithersoever they led while he was yet kneeling the good father arthur entered like a patriarch bearing a commission from the god of gods  rather implore my brother good old man cried caroline in the supplicatory posture you are now in not to defert him to whom whatever are his frailties or even his vices he owes his existence and least of all to leave him in misery and wretchedness and shame if such are to be his fate no my dearest dearest brother you will not forsake your father at such a desolate moment if he is most guilty he is most pitiable if he is in a prison his soul and body equally call upon us by the voice of nature to minister calm to his despair his conscience  nay his very crimes invite us to him o holy monk convince my brother of this sir guise it seems has in the furious extreme of some unfortunate passion to which his nature alas is subject done a desperate deed which threatens his life exert i conjure you continued she falling at arthurs feet and catching one of his hands as dennison had done the other  exert i conjure you your pious eloquence to penetrate the filial heart of this good youth with a due sense of what he owes even to an erring parent  convince him that a father cannot be guilty beyond the reach of a childs commiseration  rise dearest caroline i am convinced that thou art as good and virtuous as he is vicious and unworthy but collect yourself my worthy friend said arthur and be not too rash in deciding any offense beyond the reach of gods pardon and if not past the reach of gods surely not beyond that of a son what offense has sir guise committed  charles incoherently related all the facts as they had happened asserting they ought no to be concealed  her fathers barbarity and calm determined rancour sir armines sufferings and ennobled humanity her brothers wounded spirit from the bleeding arrows of hopeless love lacerated friendship and a parents vices all shot into the bosom of caroline at once and alas not the least hard to bear the filial everactive vigilance of henry so like her own the agonizing struggle betwixt unconquerable love his consideration for olivia affection for his disappointed friends and duty to an injured father who by saving the almostforfeited life of sir guise had new claims on his sons obedience  all these and a thousand other piercing reflections bore down her spirits to the earth on which she fell with a wish that it were indeed the measure of her grave she recovered from these accumulated shocks only to feel new pangs for charles read the letter sent him by henry from adsell inn  dennison and arthur absorbed almost beyond sense of carolines situation lifted up their hands in silent astonishment and the latter on reviewing the wonderworking powers of providence thus making the very means that sir guise stuart had used to destroy others destructive of their ends burst out  yes it cannot be disputed the poet is right  all chance direction which we cannot see  caroline now again signified her unshaken resolve to seek her father and follow him wheresoever distress might pursue him enjoining her brother by all the laws of nature and of blood to do the same here a violent noise as of many voices shouting within and without the house arrested every ones attention but before any conjecture as to the cause could be assigned the tumult increased to a degree that baffled all inquiry and indeed rendered it unnecessary for dennison had scarce opened the door when every servant in the abbey with a number of those from the castle filled the room with the contrary cries of  spare him spare his life  kill him kill him he has murdered my poor master  help help i shall be destroyed in my own house  the last exclamation was soon known to proceed from the miserable sir guise at the sudden sight of whom caroline and charles stood like statues motionless with surprise the buffeting of the multitude however filling all the rooms and passages made it necessary that an active part should be taken by somebody unless a worse fate was suffered to overtake sir guise at the abbey than that he had escaped at adsell  accordingly the good father arthur and dennison  charles having forced himself from the rising storm of passion at the sight of sir guise to leave the house  so powerfully exerted themselves and produced a calm chiefly by an observation from father arthur on the impropriety indecency and impiety of such outrage before a fair and equitable trial had condemned a man however deeply accused exhorting them to remember they were englishmen and of course the supports of that grand charter of their country  a british jury  national vanity whether well or ill founded is seldom flattered in vain arthurs popular bait was instantly swallowed and anticipating that universal holiday when sir guise should be hanged the mob dispersed in the same manner and from the same motive that influenced the insurgents at adsell he was rescued however barely on this side death and otley was left without any visible signs that there remained any life in his worthless body  but a trial more awful was at hand  the baronet had yet to pass the ordeal of an indignant sons resentment indeed had not the populace driven sir guise into this snare he would have avoided it and had taken precaution once more to that effect his intention being to pass the first night at mrs tempests lodge in the forest where she herself had lain perdue and to remain there till he should learn whether the coast was clear at the abbey his hope was that his son would remain with the fitzortons and either not return home for some time or as he thought more likely wholly give him up in silent contempt which he could have far better supported and with him the eternal absence of the only being he loved than thus meet him in the height of his fury happy was it for sir guise  if disgraceful life can in any position be called happiness  that as usual the sweet and merciful caroline the humane dennison and that man of peace and of every virtue father arthur were at hand to attemper the rage of the lieutenant  happy in this crisis of his fate was even the hypocrisy of this worthless sire  to a painter who has the human passions at the command of his pencil the whole groupe might perhaps furnish materials for a picture of singular effect and some sublime and affecting pencils meditate enriching several of the passions persons and scenery of this history  the father of a family returning degraded from the discovery of an infamous action amidst the groans and hisses of those very persons who would have respected his rank and even looked up to his protection had not his vices made even the poor and simple hold his wealth and grandeur in utter contempt  a parent ashamed to meet the eye of his own children or enter except by felonious stealth into his own house once the mansion of honor and hospitality now the residence of a man so deformed by vice that the heir to all its ancient privileges would have fled from it as from the seat of pestilence behold too an injured daughter checked in her gentlest impulse of embracing a father by a high and holy sense of the dignity of insulted virtue yet still pushed forward by those impulses to plead a parents cause and save a brother from perhaps forgetting nature herself behold too the venerable and just steward joining in the appeal and the blameless priest restraining the impetuous arm of the youth from committing the crime of parricide and pointing to heaven while he exclaimed  there young man there alone in the majesty of justice resides the great avenger to finish the scene behold the abject father while his trembling minion happily too contemptible for notice is stealing out of the room  behold i say this abject father as dead to shame as alive to fear crawling on his knees in the spirit of serpent and satanic hypocrisy to beg the son when he reentered the apartment would pardon offenses which he himself repented of only in that they failed of success the humiliated son covers his eyes with his trembling hand that he should not look upon such meanness while raised from so grovelling a posture by the fair daughter burning with her blushes he suffers himself to be led away by dennison and arthur their wounded souls flashing through their eyes a silent but sublime indignation  do thou not feel thyself relieved o reader at his departure is not the decent pride of thy nature released from what it endured at the view of cowardice and of guilt when acting with full power on the heart of man yet will thou not be consoled to think that in that very guilt and cowardice is shown at once the allotments of vice and the awful distinctions of virtue  chapter xviii we have now briefly to unravel the mazes by which sir guise stuart and mr david otley encountered the dangers exhibited in the last chapter  no sooner then was the baronet and his two associates released from the fury of the exasperated rabble whom the reader will recollect were pursuing the culprits after they had received their freedom from sir armines clemency than the redoubted valentine having secured a horse the other conveyances being still at the inn set off as precursor for the residence of his dulcinea mrs tempest and where the knight of by this time the woeful countenance with his trusty but less sorrowful squire david otley might have arrived without any fresh enterprise or disaster had not sir guises evil genius suggested the policy of getting into his possession certain dangerous written testimonies of his own and his mercenaries combination to do mischief he therefore in an unfortunate hour advised otley to go now that the fitzortons were absent to take some movables out of the castle but particularly a small box containing a secret correspondence on several subjects which neither of the writers were desirous should fall into the hands of sir armine or any of the fitzortons  as to what had passed at adsell he supposed the time was yet too recent for the particulars of their achievements to have reached the castle as sir guise and his colleagues lost no time in returning from the scene of action after sir armine had permitted them to be set free and the hissing delays which saluted them on the road were past  now it fell out to the confusion of otleys calculations that the identical farmer spedman who brought the news to the abbey  where the alarm he spread prevented the good cheer which better tidings or better opportunity would have produced from the hospitable steward  did not make all the allowances that might have been expected for the distress he occasioned and seeing himself neglected after discharging himself of so much good money and so much important intelligence he repented him that he had brought either news or money taking therefore his horse no better treated than himself out of the stable he jogged on much out of humor and finding himself moreover both hungry and thirsty he stopped at the village of fitzorton at the sign of the fitzorton arms resolving to console himself where he was sure to meet a hearty welcome for some of the cash that still remained in the yellow canvas rentbag  scarce had he seated himself by the kitchen fire all the other rooms in the little inn being engaged and lighted his pipe  which has ever been considered a consolatory as well as companionable instrument and which when pipes were the mode angry gentlemen resorted to as angry ladies do their snuffboxes for composure  scarce then had she honest farmer puffed away the first whiff of his chagrin when a general huzza after three distinct cheers to the health of the new married couple assailed his ears the landlord coming at that instant from the company into the kitchen was questioned by our husbandman touching the jovial sounds he had just heard  sounds farmer why you must know that sir armine fitzorton our great gentleman of the castle has a son the lord love him who is this day or tomorrow or was yesterday married to the famust heiress miss clare of these parts so the young ladys father by misses desire ordered the servants and neighbors to make merry on the occasion  and merry we are you hear and you shall be so too for all comers are welcome tonight at the fitzorton arms  huzza huzza fitzorton for ever the halffuddled landlord now carried off the farmer nothing loath to the company assuring them he saw he was a fine old grecian and a lover of the family and would drink fitzorton for ever and no stuart and hour longer than he could stand  would he said one of the party assembled  d  mme  then he is one of us my boy  come  it is a nem con business  charge all filled  present all lifted their glasses to their lips  sire all drank but what think you gentlemen said the landlord who had an eye to profit as well as pleasure to our following this up with another bumper aye aye come a sentiment  d  mme i love a sentiment a sentiment is the soul of drinking  may the castle stand and the abbey fall what say you to that gentlemen i say said the landlord it must be drank  drank yes  but how said one marry out of our hats upon our knees with all our hearts cried one of the grooms  charge gentlemen  no no said one of mr clares footmen  no hats but pint basins  landlord  bring in all your cargo of crockery  leap fly you brave old youth said the landlord thumping him on the back i am flying said the host and ran out the farmer swore that he would drink the health of every honest man and the confusion of every rogue on the face of the earth especially the confusion of sir guise stuart whom he believed to be the greatest rogue under favor as yet unhanged upon which declaration a halfpint rummer of punch was poured out by one of the servants who giving for his toast  may every rogue have a halter submitted it to the company whether such a sentiment as in a particular manner applicable to sir guise should not be a swimmer as well as a brimmer so away some of us for that dear rosy gilled ancient boy who is gone for the crockery   the landlord while the man was yet speaking returned with his wife maid servant and waiter loaded with punchbowls sugarbasons and alepots the toast was repeated and drank every man kneeling and joining hands with his neighbor to this succeeded more drinking a great deal of pleasantry and as much wit as such associations whether in low or high life generally furnish but the sincere love of the families they served was manifested both by the domestics of the fitzortons and clares and an equal degree of universal execration of sir guise but with reservos in favor of charles and caroline the good son and daughter  hitherto farmer spedman had no possible opportunity  for there had been no recess from hard drinking  to mention the sorrowful tidings he had related at the abbey and the good man now softened by happiness and hospitality felt really a reluctance to damp it by unwelcome news particularly as he had an intimation the female servants of both the friendly houses were expected to a supper which was about to enter and the farmer thought bad news would arrive too soon even if kept till after supper making up his mind therefore to the maxim that bad luck never can come too late honest spedman set in for a full and complete atonement with his new friends at the castle for the illusage he supposed himself to have met with at the abbey with this idea he joined in the general spirit of the occasion shook hands with the landlord and all the servants as if they had been bred up together in the same kitchen he received the ladies with a salute as they came in and selected one of the prettiest as a partner and when his recollection had wholly left him begged the ladys pardon and fell asleep on one of the benches to the infinite diversion of the whole company his nasal organ gave sonorous evidence of solid repose till the peep of day apprised the partycolored assembly it was time to break up the butler observed to the landlord who would not himself have made the remark had they drank out the week even had they drank dry his cellar that there was reason in every thing and that though their masters were absent servants should be merry and wise the morality of this sentiment also being agreed to nem con save and except the aforesaid landlord who would have supported a very different doctrine while he could have supported himself  the snoring farmer was roused and reminded of the hour  so farewell my brave old blade said the butler you have been as welcome to whatever fare and fun you have found here among us aye and your good nap of a brace of hours into the bargain and so one sweepstakes one parting bowl to the young couple before we bid good bye and then to our several dwellings  the bowl was brought and soon emptied and so thoroughly had the whole company entered into the spirit of keeping it up that there is no conjecturing with how many more good wishes the supposed nuptials would have been celebrated in flowing indeed overflowing cups had not the farmer between the extremes of sleep intoxication forgetfulness and memory just found enough of the latter to tell the long concealed intelligence in nearly the substance he gave it to dennison attaching however many bitter epithets to the name of sir guise and as many hyperbolical encomiums whenever that of sir armine was mentioned it was not without many interruptions they heard him to the end of his tale and at last they all fell upon him for keeping them so long ignorant of their honored masters destiny indeed had it not been for the protection of the women the farmer who made his escape under their auspices would have paid dear for his good feasting and mental reservation of the ill tidings  the detestation they bore to sir guise was now augmented tenfold but the sentiment of rage they conceived for miles and more than all for david otley the betrayer of family secrets surpassed all description it could be equalled by nothing but their love pity and regret for the fate of sir armine on recollection of whose destiny their late universal joy was changed into as universal sorrow and they sought the now dismantled castle in the honest anguish of their souls so genuine is love and hate in the bosoms of the genuine children of nature and so true is the love or hate of domestics the criterion of the virtue or vice of the master and mistress otleys ingratitude forms but the exception which belongs to a general rule  chapter xix as the fitzorton servants were entering the castle gates they perceived the apostate otley coming with his letter box out of the house and suffering him to move a few paces they beheld the everdrooping sir guise who was waiting near one of the outhouses to join him the whole pack opened at once calling out  there they are  there are the assassinators of our dear dear  perhaps dead master escaped from prison it is both law and justice to slay them  they ought to be torn piecemeal and piecemeal they would have been instantly torn had the feet of rage been as rapid as those of fear the fugitives were however overtaken in the abbeyyard and driven into the house bruised and beaten almost to death as we have described  the miserable and dastardly heart of sir guise however permitted him not to rest even when he was withdrawn to his chamber where the filial caroline carried him and administered with her own hand every comfort that she was conscious he did not deserve nor did she forget to dispatch off a messenger for the family physician charles once so necessary to the happiness of sir guise was now become the grand impediment for he knew what heavy weights might yet be imposed on the feelings of the uncomplaining caroline and he had suffered of late so many pains and penalties from the resisting virtues of his son that a grand revolution was working in his heart that is to say the change of his inordinate affections toward charles into as extravagant an antipathy yet as this could not be evinced by any of the open cruelties he exercised upon his daughter he adopted a more secure yet no less effectual mode of manifesting his hate viz in giving it the smoothest appearance  even the appearance of love  he would have been best pleased indeed to have made his escape from the abbey but as every body had now an eye upon him and as the additional odium he incurred really rendered it unsafe for him to be seen abroad while his late unwarrantable assassination of a man universally beloved was recent in every memory he foresaw that he would be better accommodated in his own house than in that even of mrs tempest as it was by no means certain what the popular madness might effect on the property of a woman or her paramour or their agents who were considered as instrumental in such villainy though it must be owned he was impelled thereto by the artful practice of miles but if any mischief should result from it sir guise rather wished it might happen during his absence for the destruction of the whole world was an object of no figure in his mind compared with the slightest ill that could befall himself that the abbey therefore might be while he was thus constrained to do penance in it a place of tolerable captivity he caused it to be given out that he felt himself so much indisposed which was by accident the truth and it would be be necessary for him to keep his chamber and even to avoid company as he found it rather oppressive to speak  his object herein was to escape his son charles the shot of whose angry eye he dared not encounter but this did not avail him for though it is true he was ill enough in body and harassed enough in spirit to keep his chamber that very indisposition was a motive with the virtuous caroline to attend him in his hour of languor nay more judging from the goodness of her own heart that it would be a cordial to his  the most comfortable indeed he could receive  to see his darling son this duteous daughter by incessant entreaties and filial arguments contrived so far to pacify charles as to gain his assent to an interview with his father and that this supposed cordial might have the greater effect she introduced charles imperceptibly dropping on her knee at the instant of such introduction asserting at the same time that the blessing of everlasting consciousness would attend him if he offered the reconciling hand to his sick and unhappy father  the reader must have noticed it was a fixed maxim of this truly exemplary daughter that the duty from child to parent can never end but with the being he gave or with its own although she could make a clear distinction in her mind betwixt the offender and the offense her duty to the one being a parent was by this pious distinction as invariable and eternal as her abhorrence of the other and she maintained that the fathers throwing off either the virtues of the manly or of the paternal character was no good warrant for renouncing those of the filial on the contrary  i will not allow would she say to her brother contesting this point during sir guises sickness i cannot allow my dearest charles that either my services or yours admit one moments relaxation in the whole course of our lives we may deplore we may avoid we may even shudder at the conduct of the unhappy parent now brought by that conduct to the sick and sorrowing bed our filial ministrations may lose the sweet bloom which used to embalm them while we believed the author of our lives was good and just and worthy but a duty is not to die or even to languish because part of its acompanying delights are taken away no charles  it should survive the grave and when almost all our hopes are buried we should have a faithful memory of our impayable obligations to those who supported us in the years of infancy how often must i repeat that his great guilt should excite our compassion even if it robs us of our tenderness and we should continue from pity what we began from love  thus sometimes by strength and sometimes by softness but ever with sincerity did the charming caroline plead her own justification her fathers cause and win over to his side even his worst enemies at the same time after many attempts seconded by the good father arthur she resisted the resolves even of the firm charles who had fully determined never to see or hold intercourse with sir guise any more and whose mind was like his unhappy sisters torn by parental disgrace lacerated friendship and disappointed love she found means however as we have seen to soften the sternest resolutions of charles who partly by her eloquence partly by the pious remonstrances of arthur and partly by the natural compassion of his own heart was brought first to promise he would not quit the house till his father was in a condition to leave the chamber then to bear the mention of his name and lastly to endure the thought of an interview  but though caroline had done the very thing sir guise wished to have avoided the latter dared not to show any repugnance he therefore attempted to make the best of a very bad matter a tale was to be told and a point gained thereby which brooked not delay and this appeared to him a favorable at least a possible opportunity  thus therefore the baronet began to manceuvre this is more than i expected  more perhaps than i deserve my children for you know not the extent of my offenses great as is your duty i fear my imprudence in one instance goes beyond your power to forgive know that i have done a deed    here a profound sigh most likely from his heart  a deed  how shall i speak of it another pause and another sigh heavy almost to groaning and not less sincere caroline turned pale and arthur who had followed charles into the chamber crossed himself  charles trembled i say resumed sir guise i have been for some time  secretly  because i knew it would displease my children   in the name of god what cried charles  married replied sir guise  is that the offense quoth arthur  to whom questioned charles in terror  since it must be known  nay since this very house which was in the hour of my weakness given to my widow for her life  and as being a woman of a high temper  she may insist on residence    this house  a high temper  insist on residence  do not distract me said charles but speak  whomsoever you have thought fit to make your wife will of course deserve and receive the respect of your children said the trembling caroline for heavens sake then sir make us acquainted with the name of the lady we are to consider as  as  as    the remembrance of her amiable mother impeded her utterance and it was long before she could finish her question by repeating  whom sir are we to consider as lady stuart  mrs tempest answered sir guise  he then took shelter from the rage that might be expected to follow such thunderstriking intelligence under the bed clothes in which he so muffled himself that had the astonishment and anger of charles and the consternation of caroline and arthur been expressed with the voice of a lion they could scarcely have been heard  caroline was stunned and arthur shocked but both tried to pacify and reconcile charles to this irremediable circumstance accursed is he observed the good monk who puts asunder man and wife and although it might be wished these persons had never come together in holy matrimony they were now bound by a divine obligation and it behoved all persons  but a son and a daughter in particular  to    the good man was proceeding in his harangue every word of which sir guise contrived to hear when a vehement clamor assailed the ears of the company as of a person rushing up the stairs and exclaiming at every step  where where is he i will be shut out of my own house no longer tell not me of lieutenants or captains or sons or daughters are their claims superior to mine alas too long have ye withheld him from me i will see him though the congregated earth were to oppose me beat bruised and in bed good heaven  and now this vociferous personage in despite of the remonstrances and almost strength of dennison made a forcible entry into the chamber flew to the bedside caught hold of the sick mans hand and in a violence which rather overacted the character called out in all the rant of dramatic affectation my love my life my husband  the surprise of so sudden an appearance attended by such concomitants did not permit the company immediately to recognize the speaker and the astonishment was as much increased as it could be when at last they perceived the new lady stuart who continued to perform her conjugal duties in the same magnanimous style without seeming to know any third person was in the room how do you find yourself my dear husband why did you suffer a false delicacy perhaps i may call it an unkind fear of your children so long to banish your wife while you were well i submitted to my hard destiny and kept aloof even immured i bore the imputation of being a wicked woman rather than subject you to censure from a son and daughter who you taught me to believe would treat the woman to whom you gave your hand in holy wedlock with undutiful severity but now that i find your precious health is in danger i burst through all idle ceremonies and setting the whole universe at naught when in opposition to my love and duty i am come to insist that you permit me to remain here and to offer my share in your comforts no never never will i quit this roof this bed this hand till you promise to receive all the services i can give no power on earth shall tear you from me nor bolts nor bars nor chains of iron i am your wife sir guise yes sir guise your wedded wife your true and lawful lady and who shall dare to bar her way destructions in the thought  she then proceeded to string rhapsodies collected from different tragedies with which her memory furnished her and perhaps sir guise himself began to think she carried it a little too far for he emphatically desired her to stop declaring she had given him somewhat too much of this  my dear said he to mrs tempest meet my beloved children halfway then catching his sons eye he popped his head again under the clothes  as in duty bound his gentle spouse obeyed she begged pardon for her apparent oversight but was convinced her new relatives would make allowances for that overwhelming sorrow which they themselves shared too deeply not to account for  next with all possible condescension she advanced toward charles and caroline and made an offer to embrace them father arthur in the goodness of his heart earnestly promoting it as a fit preliminary of that domestic harmony he so anxiously desired to see take palce embrace my worthy friends embrace one another  the worthy caroline was so tortured between one sensation and another that halfwilling and halfreluctant she was just stepping forward to own mrs tempest as her fathers second wife when charles forcibly pulled her back grinding between his teeth something which in the ears of the lady sounded like the words  abandoned woman touch her not  abandoned repeated my lady in a thundering accent which did we not know the power of sudden rage we should have thought rather too violent for a lady under her circumstances abandoned  be not too severe upon the sinner said arthur i have not the least doubt but that now the lady is become the wife of a baronet and is by this unexpected stroke of good fortune brought into a respectable family and innocent connections which is more than she could reasonably have expected  she will not only quit for ever her former vile way of life but be wrought to so thorough a sense of that decency and modesty which becomes her sex the pureminded miss stuart herself would not have any more reason to be ashamed of her  a spectator less interested in the scene than any of the parties then present would have been variously amused at the winks and nods of sir guise who now peeped from the bedclothes to keep down the strong spirit which he saw working in his lady and at his signs to arthur to hold his peace but his bride disdained all considerations and consequences row has so exactly described her situation that you must suffer me to borrow it for your more perfect idea  at first her rage was dumb and wanted words but when the storm found way twas wild and loud mad as the priestess of the delphic god enthusiastic passion shook her soul enlarged her voice and ruffled all her form she raved she stamped and  swore  pardon me ye ornaments of the sex for painting a contrast to yourselves with all the force it deserves  swore  yes reader she did actually swear that sir guise was a poor cowardly fellow to take any pains to show that he was master of his own house hand or fortune  that if he however was mean enough to be trampled upon by his own children she being now his wife was determined by the privileges and authority of the nuptial character to assert herself and that she was humiliated disgraced and ashamed to have given into her husbands miserable plots and creeping schemes to conceal his marriage and bring his lawful wife into her own house  none of your winks to me guise  i say you were a poor meanspirited man and you ought to blush at all these pranks and fusses to do me justice  get up for shame get up  and dont play the fool any longer prithee and as for you mr impertinence  meaning arthur  if guise had the spirit of a butterfly he would twist your old babbling tongue out of your mouth  dont stand lifting up your eyes and hands at me you superannuated canting rascal for if you do woman as i am you shall repent it i promise you  in future i desire your visits may cease at this house sir if my husband has not the soul to forbid you i do and unless i see better manners in that young gentleman who is now swelling up in that manner ready to burst with venom the less he gives us of his company here the better as for the young lady  dont cry miss  you are the only decent young body in the house  any attempt to describe the situation of the party consequent on this harangue would be presumptuous absurdity  because the tears of caroline and the agony of her brothers struggling passions and the foaming madness of the speaker and the choking indignation of father arthur and above all the unutterable fears of sir guise whose teeth chattered in his head would baffle the united talents of shakespeare and hogarth and of all the painters and the poets in the world  arthur who first recovered speech declared after thrice crossing himself that she was certainly the devil himself sent into this world in female shape to punish sir guise as a dreadful example to all wicked hypocrites and that he did not doubt but her feet were cloven  would that my hands were so cried she furiously aiming a claw at his ears which were luckily buried in the bushiness of his wig  then said she there might be some hope that they would cleave in twain that impudent skull but before he had time to reply to this salutation charles whose passions were too often ungovernable had seized hold of sir guises arm  the only part of him that was visible the rest being hid under the bedclothes  and beginning to drag him forcibly exclaimed in a voice broken with excess of passion  o thou  most shameless  most pitiless  why why am i and this unhappy girl incessantly to be thus dishonored and why is it not piety and virtue in a son to relieve his family and the world of such a scourge  in a moment lady tempest arthur caroline and dennison whom the clamor had brought into the room were all employed the first without any respect of sex acted the amazon and opposing force to force tried to disengage the son from the father  caroline entreated yet was so much struck that her supplications were feeble and she went weeping out of the room  dennison and arthur drew off charles by main force into another apartment and the whole business concluded by leaving sir guise and his lady to a conjugal teteatete which was equally short and decisive it was however a curiosity in its kind and must therefore be recorded  after a pause of some minutes sir guise ventured to emerge  aye you may creep out of your hole poor trembling wretch  and a fine hand you have made of it  did not i tell you so  you have nothing now but to die in good earnest  if you come to that who was it that overset my plan but for your damned unreasonable passion and impetuous temper i had brought you into the house reconciled all parties to you and we should have had the abbey to ourselves for the old priest would have persuaded charles and the girl to leave us  instead of which i am now in a worse condition than ever  whatever may be your condition mine is that of a woman who has the misfortune to be married to a poltroon who is afraid to defend himself or avow his wife however here i am and here i will remain let who will go or stay live or die d  n me if i dont  chapter xx the heroic lady having said this she insisted upon sir guises getting up and dressing himself ill as he really was  yes and give orders like a man said his gentle lady to your servants for the proper reception of and obedience to your wife her yet more gentle lord was too well experienced in his spouses tempestuous talents to dispute her commands and his late miscarriages had so sunk his authority even in his own eyes that instead of opposing to her the power of the supposed lord of the creation he resigned himself in the most slavish humility to what censurers have called the weaker vessel  just adding therefore to his habiliments a pair of stockings and slippers he rose out of his sick bed and almost lamented now with his dear wife that it had not proved his dying one however he shook himself and his rumpled robes two or three times on feeling himself once more on terra firma and actually reeled with weakness and affright he had moreover suffered from sheer dismay his beard to grow to a great length his hair had been long neglected so that his face was pallid and cadaverous and he exhibited at the end of the scene a haggard ruefullooking wretch indeed  lady tempest for so henceforth though with the greatest reluctance we are constrained by the rights of a femme covert to call her deemed this no fit object of his bestirring himself to the ordering of her ladyships arrangements without any hope of obedience following command she therefore rang the bell and directed the servant who answered it to send the valet with warm water and the rest of the adonizing paraphernalia taking care to say it was for the immediate use of her husband sir guise who she said was now well enough thank god to rise and would soon be down stairs not any rumor of the baronets marriage having reached the abbey kitchen or indeed any part of the house the servant who received this message was scarce less the victim of astonishment than had been every body above stairs for neither charles arthur or dennison had as yet revealed the fresh disgrace which the baronet had brought into the family  yielding therefore to sudden surprise whose nature is to stand still the astonished domestic who happened to be thus taken unawares remained fixed at the wonderful word husband whereupon the lady repeated the orders with an emphasis so thoroughly convincing that if she was not the wife she would henceforward let him know she was mistress of the house  the poor fellow took to his heels scarce giving himself time or finding breath to stammer out in his exit  ye  ye  yes  yes  my  my  la  la  my mad  madam  a second delay happened in the servants hall where the ladystruck domestic no sooner arrived than the threw himself into the stewards great chair by way of recovering after which he summoned every adherent of the family from the underbutler dennison being otherwise employed to the underscullion girl prefacing the news he had to communicate by a solemn assurance that it would make every one of them run mad then seeing their mouths all opened wide to swallow the threatened insanity sir guise is mar  mar  mar  married to  to  to  to that rascal valentine miless con  con  concu  concubine think of that fellow servants  and has more  moreover brought his harlot of a wife into the house who answered the corpse culinary  that whore of babylon mrs tempest who seduced my dear young ladys young gentleman squire henry and gave up her wicked self to sir guise and that valentine and perhaps half a thousand others  is she to be our mistress and take the place of the good virtuous dear dead and buried lady whom we all followed to the grave with our hearts ready to break and willing to do so that we might follow her  the grievous reflections which followed these questionary exclamations produced so universal a groan of the spirit that it reechoed through all the dreary and subterraneous abodes and ascended even to the central cupola of the abbey  meantime lady tempest exasperated at the delay in the performance of her first conjugal commands resorted to the bell again with a vehemence that broke part of the wires and left the tassel in her hand the incessant vibrations which preceded this accident had more than the desired effect for it brought up not only sir guises valet but dennison and caroline who from habits rather of duty than reflection or sentiment now followed the idea of his being really at his last gasp they were soon undeceived by seeing sir guise walking backwards and forwards about the chamber and his lady insisting that every body should go about their business except her husbands valet seeing him amongst the crowd that had mechanically obeyed she drew him toward her by the profuse neckcloth and chitterling calling him at the same time a creeping lazy rascal slapping the door in the faces of the rest who were thus agreeably repulsed and were again left to their reflections on the prospect of domestic happiness  in a word their sorrows at the entrance of their new mistress into the abbey almost equalled that which they felt for the untimely exit of their first lady out of it indeed the marriage of the one could be exceeded in calamity only by the burial of the other and looking as very truly they might upon sir guise stuart as the wicked cause of both misfortunes the servants came after some farther consultation amongst one another to an honest resolve to save their character  that common necessary of a servant  by giving warning before they could be supposed to have received any taint of corruption that might disqualify them for more reputable places this combination being entered into with spirit nem con many of the domestics sacrificed their months wages and took themselves away on the instant others dropped off occasionally and at the end of the month the kitchen was emptied even down to a poor limping dwarf who acted under the scullion as a sort of human turnspit but who being assured that his good name and of course his good bread was in imminent danger hopped away with his brown paper bundle of property to save his reputation  the first mover of all this was robert irwin the cook and his wife the dairywoman the troubled valet having finished his part of the business of disembruting his master and certain other ablutions being performed sir guise in the course of two hours was humanized and the suits and ceremonies of sickness pain and death being thrown aside though he had really suffered severely in body and in mind yet he was still much better in health than any other of his family  the unhappy caroline and her brother passed some hours in the company of the good arthur and the consoling dennison but they were in a state of misery too severe to decide what course to take in a retrospect of her fathers course of life which the late occurrences had more especially forced upon her caroline saw a dreadful history of the past and an insupportable prospect of the future her uncorrupted nature shuddered at the view so far was she from suffering destruction of that moral principle which not only guided her actions but governed her very thoughts that she admitted not the slightest deprivation of it in herself nor could her penetrating mind discover it in another though but an acquaintance without great pain how aggravated then must have been this nice sense of rectitude when she reflected upon the utter extinction of every thing like a moral principle in her father whose conduct had so often covered her innocent cheek with blushes as if her own pure heart had unwittingly done something which produced and deserved the disgrace of her family  charles thought in the present posture of affairs it would be a right measure to expel the base intruder who had trepanned their father into a marriage  but this was overruled both by caroline and arthur who insisted that no man living could with a safe conscience divide man and wife while they consented to live together  caroline proposed that the abbey should be left to the unhappy couple and some place of escape be sought for us no matter where cried she with a trembling voice  alas i have done with choice save that i feel it necessary to remove hence since the thoughts of another lady stuart even were she better entitled to that precious regretted name than my fathers present wife  would be too much with other deep loads upon my heart  o it would be too much for me to bear  as i ought   she spoke or rather sobbed out the last words on her tender brothers bosom while the virtuous youth feeling the string jarred on which hung his own misery too much like his sisters in nature as in degree embraced her with all the sympathies of affection and of woe dennison held down his dejected head and kissed their hands with misery inferior only to their own and the pious gentlehearted arthur called upon the protection of that power he adored so truly and wept aloud after which circling his arms around them as if to afford a shelter he cried out there is a good and just providence my children who will take care of us all  charles however resolving that neither himself nor his sister should pass another night under the same roof with sir guise and his consort the monk after a short pause exclaimed in a rapture as at the acquisition of a lucky idea  ye may sojourn at the chapelhouse my children for a few days till we see what is best to be done there is room for four quiet people who love each other i include friend dennison in the number  yes there is space enough to be happy and though we fare not as the dwellers at the abbey in what are called the good things of life we shall there escape abundance of the worst the strife and discontent which will surely be found amongst the inmates of those we leave behind us in this lordly mansion  and as to attendants fear not our being tolerably served i am myself not a bad cook and my indian boy is both diligent and knowing  as to that matter quoth dennison seeming as if suddenly to have recovered his youth my young lady and master and your reverence can tell i can bestir myself upon occasion and do not doubt but i shall have every thing prepared in the little chapelhouse and in such good order that the old furniture shall give a shining welcome before we have been twentyfour hours its inhabitants  while they were discoursing thus a servant brought down word from the new mistress of the house that sir guise and her ladyship desired to dine private that day and to pass the evening by themselves previous to certain family arrangements which they intended in future to make and which when properly digested should be presented to them to the end that whatever rules the principal thought fit to lay down might be adopted and pass unquestioned into domestic laws charles and caroline were therefore to give orders for themselves  this imperious message which every one of the family servants refused to carry was brought by one of her ladyships own domestics who within the last hour had called with dispatches from valentine miles  father arthur imposing silence on charles returned for answer that neither he nor his children for so he often called charles and caroline were surprised at the desire expressed by sir guise to keep out of sight and that as it was probable certain arrangements below stairs  meaning those of his own party at the chapelhouse  would take place before those in agitation above he for his part would advise them to turn their studies from the laws of eating and drinking to those of fasting and prayer and all the other laws instituted and appointed for the use and performance of wicked sinners who were desirous to be saved  the servant was scarce departed before the monk presented one hand to caroline the other to charles beckoning dennison with a smile to bring up the rear  come my dear children let us remove with all convenient dispatch out of the habitation of guilt misery and hardened insolence and seek refuge in that decent unobtrusive abode where peace honor innocence and the merits of a life pure and undefiled await to receive us  this proposition was accepted by charles because he felt that his longer continuance at the abbey would probably be attended by events too dire to name by caroline because her poor heart was bowed by sorrows too manifold and mighty to resist or to make any lection for herself and by dennison because the good old man as he lived at the abbey only to be of service to his young lady and master so he wished to pass the residue of his blameless days wheresoever their fate or fortune their happiness or misery should carry them orders being therefore given to charless man and carolines woman to pack up and bring their different trunks and other baggage after them  they set out in the manner above described for their small but comfortable dwelling  they had gone about half way when caroline stopped suddenly and declared she had left something which none of the keys given to her woman could disclose and which as none but herself could find she must beg the delay of a few minutes while she returned for it observing that she should be wretched in the extreme to know it was in the abbey after her banishment without waiting any reply she ran back as fast as her delicate limbs could carry her and in about a quarter of an hour returned breathless and bathed in tears yet with a smiling countenance declaring that she was much easier for what she had brought out of the house though she had the misfortune to meet the strange lady in her way and heard her ask somebody just as she entered whether miss too was of the runaway party yet do not think my dear charles it was an improper or trifling errand that could make me detain you thus long on the road no it was for what my brother will esteem no less than myself  this precious  precious picture of her  who  o my god what a change what an alteration has this second marriage made in that abbey which could once boast of the angel whom this little miniature  in her mortality scarcely mortal  resembled and on whose honored head these tresses once grew  turning the picture  she exclaimed o my ever beloved and ever lamented mother how will thou forgive him this last this greatest of his offenses  as if jealous and fearful of again parting with it even for a moment and to a loving brother who yet seemed wishing to pay it homage she took it from her own lips warmed with the sensations of her filial heart and pressed it upon his while arthur who never suffered the mourner to sorrow alone when he was at hand broke forth into those moving sentiments of hamlet so truly applying to the present picture that it should come to this  these and other reflections in the same train of solemn thought were interrupted just as the little chapelhouse appeared in view it was opened by irwin the cook the footmen and all the maid and men servants of the family who understanding from the young ladys woman left in care of the baggage that charles and his sister with the old steward were leaving the abbey and as the woman told them never to return but to live at the chapelhouse till they could suit themselves had come in a body like volunteers to offer their poor but honest services to their honored young master and mistress they protested their humble love and duty with a fervor that denoted their sincerity one declared he would serve their worthy honors and the good mr dennison by night and by day far and near all the world over  nay as to that said another you know william we had rather a thousand times pass our whole lives with some good gentry in hard labor without fee or reward than with sir guise and his goodfornothing madam for half his fortune they then with one voice supplicated to be received declaring that they had all a little modicum hoarded up and got in their late good ladys days and which would keep them in comfort without wages till it pleased god to bring things about a little and for that matter we had all of us exclaimed irwin resolved amongst ourselves to leave our present place before we knew of your worthy honors quitting the abbey but now we have nothing left there to make us amends for what we suffer  our poor dear true and virtuous lady stuart is dead and gone and another woman not fit to be named with her or with any christian woman is put into our poor ladys place the abbey is no abbey for us and we will not stay to do another hands turn  so pray good dear your honors let us follow and abide with you go where you may do your reverence and mr dennison continued irwin speak a word for us  pray pray do and bid young my lady and the squire consider that we were all in the family when the true lady stuart was alive and followed her to the grave when she was dead and we are sure her soul would not rest in heaven where for certain it is gone if she knew the doings that were now at the abbey and that her poor old servants staid in the house when her blessed son and daughter were in a manner turned out of it  the voice of natural eloquence seldom pleads in vain for it generally is exerted in the cause of genuine and unaffected goodness this unexpected appeal however produced some generous embarrassment the affections were strongly touched but the little chapelhouse would scarce have held the supplicants and as that in the present moment of indecision was literally to be the resting place such a retinue would be inconsistent with their decent and unobtrusive plan of life father arthur therefore putting on the arch smile which reconciled every thing in a moment observed that the chapel itself would be barely sufficient to the purposes of the accommodation of his own little family though he would readily give up his monks bed to them as a reward for the honorable feelings which must have dictated their offer of service  and me would give mine masser cried floresco his indian boy who had joined the company as he saw them gathered together  yes masser me would give my ickle bed and make up anoder wis my warm blankey and shawl i brought out of my country if masser will let good hearts peoples come and live wis us and well be so merry and so glad  aye my noble child of the sun which i see has taught your heart to glow like his own beams but here is a whole congregation you see   charles was greatly moved caroline experienced emotions peculiar to her character  they were composed of the tenderness of her heart and the firmness of her soul  and she settled the business by assuring the petitioners that if they went back to the abbey and gave proper notice of their intentions to quit their service but without entering into any improper explanations so that all might be done with decency and order they would probably find her at the chapel house at least obtain her address there should she have left it and they might depend on her best services and those of her brother to settle them reputably and comfortably in new situations father arthur charles and dennison giving their fullest sanction to this measure the groupe were persuaded to turn back after receiving the honor to shake the hand of the gentleman and to kiss that of the young lady the next morning however robert irwin contrived to send his sweetheart margaret one of the chambermaids with a basket with the best things of his larder and though all these were rejected and returned as coming from the abbey the motive with which they were tendered was not forgotten  chapter xxi the assiduous floresco opened the chapelhouse door and arthur who to the gravity of a monk adjoined the courtesy of a man fashioned by courts with a hospitable smile gave that smile in welcome and by the endearing names of friends and children had entreated his little train to enter in and be at peace  but one of the domestics returned in haste and presented a little packet to caroline i fancy miss this must have been dropped by your ladyship as this slip of a card was found with it and william the footman who is a scholar says he knows it is a piegram or cross stick which means rhyming verses made upon letters in ladies names or some such gonundrum and see miss it begins with c and ends lookee with e which william says makes out caroline which to be sure is your ladyship god bless you and please your honor there it is miss  and i will now go to fellow servants who are a waiting for me of the woodside  caroline had begun to outglow the riband that bound the packet as soon as she saw it and the hue of confession increased and spread to such a degree before the servant had done speaking that when she received it her whole frame attested it was a matter of great importance coming at such a moment it is nothing but a  nothing said she but a  small  little bit  of  paper  and  and  a  kind of  and  a  which you  brother  you know  desired me  to  to  to take care of for you  as carolines head heart and voice confederated to betray were all fluttering at once the discovery of her situation was threefold for while her delicate fingers were as she thought tightening the riband round the paper they in reality were loosening it at every turn and being thus detached a little engine of mighty power in cases of affection known by the name of a locket dropped from the paper and was caught on its way to the ground by charles who instantly recognized what it was to whom it belonged and from whence it came  that the reader may be in the secret also he is to understand that this locket containing a braid of henrys hair was in the happier days of henry and carolines intercourse and yet when there had happened one of those slight yet delicious differences which sweeten agreement given to their mutual friend charles to the end that it should find its way by that medium into carolines bosom where the kind charles took care it should repose shortly after and he watched his opportunity so well that he procured for it that enviable resting place in the course of the very day it was presented and could it have known its happiness right proud would it have been of its lodging it was a token of reconcilement and as caroline then under the influence of those hopes which an innocent passion and the first of the heart believed as all lovers do every thing possible or more truly speaking to the sweet extravagance of the affections impossibilities probable she looked a vow as she tied that very riband round her neck which had lately bound the paper then fastened to the locket that neither time nor chance nor aught but the dissolving power of death should rob her of that talismanic offering  a cruel combination of circumstances inexorable as death itself ever since that fatal hour which extinguished every tender hope had made her take it with a trembling hand from its lovely mansion yet tenderness like hers survives even the extinction of hope and manifests itself perhaps most firmly in the moment of despair her ultimate design was to return it by the medium she received it in the meantime she looked upon it as a sacred property in trust and deemed it worthy a place in the little sanctuary where her mothers picture and other relics of the heart were deposited nay she had carefully put them not only into the same drawer but bound them together in the same paper as fit companions for each other separating them only since she brought them from the abbey perhaps to avoid the discovery which putting them as she supposed in different pockets produced  as the locket remained in the hand of charles caroline cast a look first upon it and then upon her brother which was clearly understood by both and perhaps by the whole company to imply alas it is ours no longer it is the property of olivia and must be resigned to the donor with a secret injunction to remember the friendship of charles but to forget the love of caroline some such sympathy must have struck the brother and sister at this crisis for as if suffering on the same sentiment they ran into each others embraces consoling and commiserating one another  arthur saw the dilemma was of a singular kind but had yet no clear idea of its cause charles unwilling to deprive his sister of the locket and caroline reluctant to part with yet resolved not to keep it longer in her possession a train of objections having by this time mustered themselves arthur exclaimed my dear children entrust this to my charge till it suits with the time to reclaim or restore it it shall be preserved as a relic of innocence sensibility and adversity the severe but salutary school in which those gifts of heaven are best taught  thus have we seen the gentle caroline earnest in the preservation of a small unornamented miniature of her mother and of a simple braid of henrys hair and to rescue them from the sacrilege of that plunder which might be expected from the new lady stuart and in short jealous in her care of two precious trifles of nothing worth to the unfeeling heart while she abandoned her pearls jewels and other attractive ornaments which have charms for many of her sex without bestowing a thought on what might become of them and this would have been the case had every drawer been filled with gems of golconda  and now they all entered the chapelhouse where by the soothing attentions of dennison father arthur and his good little whitehearted blackamoor as he used to call him in the course of the evening they recovered a more considerable portion of their tranquillity in the habitation of a poor monk than could have been expected in the most spendid apartments of the lofty mansion from whose vicious influence their virtue had escaped  the broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears less pleasing far than virtues very tears chapter xxii they had remained at the chapelhouse some days and by the mingled powers of sympathy holy friendship and unaffected communications with the author of comfort by the medium of his zealous and upright minister father arthur had found relief when one evening just as they had finished a twilight conversation the purport of which was their yetundetermined scheme of life the bell of death from the church of fitzorton assailed their ears   and now it paused and now with rising knell flung to the hollow gale its sullen sound they had rather looked than expressed apprehensions when alas fresh trials of their fortitude arose  true george with a countenance like that which drew old priams curtains in the dead of night came charged with a letter to charles containing the following words   o charles my father is no more  his soul has taken with him to heaven my oath  an oath ratified by my lips on the book of life and given in the dying moment of the best of fathers  to become the husband of olivia yes dear unhappy one to marry her so soon as the decent forms of sepulture will permit my rebel heart delayed giving this fatal bond till he appeared to be in the last extremity i could not endure to embitter a period so agonizing and awful i gave up myself you and even caroline to the ease of an expiring parent alas my friend the author of my being spoke to me methought on the border of eternity he appeared to me then scarcely an inhabitant of this earth and the voice with which he implored a son to bless a dying father sounded as if it came from heaven trembling i gave the fatal affirmation  i dared in that deep moment of lacerated nature in which my soul seemed like sir armines prepared to leave this world and all its hopes and fears  i dared to promise that i would give my prostitute hand to the beloved of my friend and prove a traitor to my hearts former vows to  oh fill up the space with the name of one precious to thy friend as olivia is to thee and tell me how this double duty or this double violation  this infidelity to one and hypocrisy to another  an hypocrisy too which is to last for life  ah it may be a long miserable mournful life  are to be reconciled to you only i can i dare appeal john is more awful than  forget that thou art the son of sir guise stuart and speak to me as the friend of my youth the partner of my few joys the deposit of my many sorrows dying my father separated your name from the name of him that gave it you and requested the good charles might be told he knew how to love and pity him olivia too dear unsuspicious girl then kneeling at the side of his bed entreated he would extend his blessing his pity and his love to one no less deserving of them  o thou best of innocents cried sir armine pressing her soliciting hands to his quivering lip and casting at me a look which my bleeding heart interpreted i do bequeath caroline stuart all thou requirest and next to thyself the report of her virtues are nearest to me circumstances my dear child may so fall out  for the world i am leaving teems with hourly revolution  that one day thou may contrive to impart to her my benediction without pain to thyself or others another interpretable look was here addressed to me and the artless olivia who without being able to construe it fervently exclaimed she hoped he would live to be himself the bearer of his blessing and that for her part she did not believe even henrys society could make her quite happy without that of the suffering caroline but added she taking my hand i am sure his own heart will incline to indulge me in this instance will you not my dearest henry promise sir armine that you will imitate his fathers almost divine goodness in making distinctions betwixt the wicked and virtuous of the same family one may better support undue severity than an excess of unmerited kindness why do not the neverending virtues of this exalted woman soften my soulfelt esteem to heartfelt fondness o thou recentlydeparted spirit of my dear father intercede with thy now associate angels yea with thy god to infuse new love into my heart or intercede with that fountain of love to release me from an oath which falsifies the passion that feeds upon my life how can i support this pitiless storm which rages on every side how could that dear parent give it birth  o my friend the tyranny of olivias virtues oppress me almost to madness they touch me with enthusiasm  they animate my whole frame  they throb at every pulse and every nerve of my soul attests their power but the heart my friend the heart in the midst of all this is cold insensible uninfluenced uninspired alas it is anothers  o did thou know this my olivia thou would more than pardon  thou would pity me and so well do i know thy tender nature would become a willing sacrifice  the continued excellence charles of this young woman to my father to me and to all of us strengthens her claims and adds to the infinity of my despair  for my heart is still undivided uncontrolled and still is caroline unrivalled there behold me at once the victim of gratitude and love  to detail the scenes i have past since last i wrote would be impossible have you any thing to propose by which i may escape an event that though chained by the most solemn but coercive bonds i dare not think upon were i alone the sacrifice of my promise it should be fulfilled but when i turn my thoughts toward you and  and  i dare not trust myself with her name  there seems to be no sanctity in extorted vows nor any crime which can measure to the anguish of my friend and the eternal loss of her whom i hourly beg of the good god to surround with blessings why did i ever behold her  yet i bless my destroyer how shall i commit my dear fathers body to the grave the bell at this moment tells the rich the poor and all who have heard his name and felt the influence of his virtues that their companion benefactor patron and common parent is this very night to be closed in the cold vault  a cruel accident was the immediate cause of his death but sir guise  o that he were not the father of my friend i will add no more  olivia my agonized brothers my afflicted james and the subdued john deathlike in looks as in silence yet soft as love when those looks are directed to us and partington forgetful of all his singularities and weeping like a stricken babe are gathered together around the venerable corpse surveying his lifeless face  just as i was about to quit the room i thought i beheld the smile which my alas extorted obedience impressed on every feature and made him die happy how am i involved in the depths of misery and what a calamity is even my respite from these oathbound nuptials for is it not derived from the death of the noblest of men and dearest best of fathers i write in this desolate hour to save myself from perhaps greater desolation my brothers john and james preserve their senses and though they feel like duteous sons they resign themselves like christians they can bear the apparatus of the parting hour even the afflicted matron the mourning widow and the gentlest or almost the gentlest of the sympathizing sex support the ceremonies of the tomb with a decent dignity of grief which in vain holds out an example to your friend the sound of the hammer that closed the coffin almost unsettled my senses methinks i could at this moment lay myself at my dead fathers side and clasping his claycold hand be buried alive as well from filial affection as to end this anarchy of my brain  o god i am summoned to attend the hearse  olivia with sainted voice and solemn steps bids me remember my father is in heaven  she bids me be resigned with her eyes swimming in tears  my father is in heaven o that i were any where my friend but in this hateful world and yet i am told selfrelease from it is the hydra of human crimes  i can no more  my father is carrying out of the house  never never to return adieu i feel greatly disordered olivia wonders at my delay and at my employment she little suspects i had perhaps been dead ere this had i not thus relieved my bursting heart and burning brain  chapter xxiii every passion of his friends soul was aroused by the perusal of this letter which having read he put into the trembling hand of his sister exclaiming our ordeal is not yet over  sir armine fitzorton is passing from the castle to the tomb  he then conferred apart with the bearer of the letter and informed arthur and dennison with the contents while caroline was left the victim of some indescribable emotions excited by every sentence  for every sentence had its appropriate pang  she often paused and every pause was filled with the dismal bell that still rang out for the father of her soulbeloved henry the night was dark and the air was still so that not a vibration of the lengthening toll was lost there is in solemn and sudden sounds an aweinspiring power which suspends for a time the more clamorous sallies of grief  caroline having finished the letter stood fixed as in profound thought she then entreated to be left alone with her brother while dennison and arthur disposed of true george she walked with charles by the light of the moon and insensibly taking the path which led from the chapelhouse to the chapel she stopped at the porch of the latter  sole support of our fallen family said she and only hope of an unhappy sister honor me in this heartsearching crisis of both our lives with your attention we are called upon by every solemn appeal to show ourselves not wholly degenerate deep are the atonements which we owe to that illtreated family now mourning their irreparable loss and deep are the sacrifices which we must make alas that piercing note of death which sends its sound from the church of fitzorton to the chapel of stuart informs us that all we can offer up will fall short of the ruin which our unhappy father has contributed i fear to produce  there was a pause of a minute and charles said yes there is much to be done ah my sister many are the victims now demanded  you and i are of the number  i know the nature of the duty but fear  fear nothing interposed caroline it is not heroism we must invoke it is honor and justice whose aid will do more for us than all that fabled deities have devised my part is already decided yours should be so too we have long been and are still the grand impediments in the way of henry fitzortons duty yet hitherto we have been only unfortunate all beyond the present hour would be guilt  alas answered charles must we resign henry to olivia for ever  we must rejoined caroline do some act to prove to henry the utter impossibility of an union elsewhere this part is mine and can be done only in one way  and that i will pursue  a life devoted to the god that gave it ought never my dear charles to be thought a sacrifice not even in the blossom of youth and happiness but when there is not a single joy left in the bereaved heart  when every aching sense bears throbbing witness of hopeless destitution a secluded state employed in holy offices is not only a refuge from present despair but will gradually obliviate the past disappointment and light up in the soul sublime hopes that shall irradiate the future tomorrow i will consult the good father arthur and my part of reply to that letter shall be the communication of a resolve which henry fitzorton knows i will not enter upon lightly nor violate when adopted for the wealth of all created worlds though every star which is now glowing above our heads was a globe of gems with caroline he would be wretched with olivia he cannot long be unhappy  we are within a few paces of our dear mothers tomb and by the sacred ashes it contains and o an oath more holy by her fainted spirit which is above i have here unfolded my intents and expect you will not obstruct me in their performance  obstruct no my dearest charles you will assist your sister in the performance of her duty  for whom of all her house has she now but thee my brother  caroline replied charles you shall be assisted and though a monastic life is no fit refuge for a soldier i will not be left behind you in becoming a selfdevoted victim as my tenderness for olivia is not surpassed by that you have felt for henry neither shall my resignation be inferior  have felt exclaimed caroline  ah you are yet to know the extent of your poor sisters affection and despair my youth has been a series of heartbreaking duties and this last is  not the most easy to be born but born it shall be have felt o god that see and searchest the heart  thou know at this moment the bleeding sensibility of mine i blush not o thou that have adorned the being i love with every virtue of the human heart and every grace of the human form i blush not before thee to avow the affection which thou have thyself inspired and i withdraw myself under thy assistance only to promote his good prevent the evil which my abiding longer in his sight would bring upon him and in the humble hope that my unceasing prayers for his temporal and eternal happiness will be heard  during this ejaculation charles paid the tribute of a tear to the virtuous distress of a sister of whom his heart was proud and of whom he determined to prove himself worthy he interrupted not her pious rhapsody but when she had ended it gently pressed her hand as they walked on silently meditating the important task they had undertaken the moon suddenly became clouded yet they continued to walk arm wreathed in arm as if to bring their designs into arrangement  they were in that profound occupation of the mind whereof the body has no share whereof indeed even the faculties of the mind are excluded save the one godlike faculty of virtuous fortitude which may be supposed in a case like the present to emulate two young people summoned on a great occasion to yield up the dearest part of themselves to another and to confirm the mutual sacrifice by some act which shall put it beyond their own power to retract their engagement should even the seducing weakness of the heart at any time convene the relapsing passions to repent of what they had done under such absorbing employment of the soul the motions of the body are wholly mechanical we are carried we know not whither for neither time nor space can then be measured in this situation were caroline and charles their feet had wandered from the track and followed a direct contrary path they found themselves at length in that which led to fitzorton church the moment that succeeded this discovery presented to their view the solemn light of funeral torches and ere they were aware of it they perceived themselves at the gate of the churchyard where the hearse had stopped and its sacred deposit sir armines corpse was just lifted on the shoulders of six of his servants as he had ordered o gracious heaven whispered caroline whither charles have our devious steps beguiled us alas to the grave of sir armine  even so answered charles retreating some few paces they hastily walked into a remote path of the churchyard while the procession kept its way to the burialplace of the fitzortons ah god exclaimed caroline to charles i discover henry amongst the mourners and there close at his side replied charles is olivia supporting her weeping father with one hand and receiving the support of henry with the other leaning for his help  in one moment they both forgot they had been making resolutions  as the bearers gained the porch of the church and the multitude followed in decent sorrow charles and caroline passed in the train undistinguished and were as sincere mourners as any of the assembly they felt themselves involved in the public calamity to which they had still their suspicions that their own father had been accessory holding down their humiliated heads from the opposite pressures of grief shame and fear of discovery they went with the lamenting multitude into the church forgetting all modes of faith they joined with the fervor of devotion in that sublime form of prayer appointed in the protestant service for the burial of the dead  the widowed matron the venerable clare the sweet and mourning olivia and the three heartunited brothers were arranged on one side of the body partington with the whole family of the poor atwoods on the other the household servants the gentry of the neighborhood and all the tradesmen and tenants of the deceased were gathered into distinct groupes within view of the coffin and a mixed multitude filled not only every other part of the church but the churchyard so that every grave and tombstone was loaded with living spectators  the vault of the fitzortons lay in the eastern side of the church bordering the steps of the altar the coffin was slowly moving toward it when caroline carried forcibly along by the press of the too eager multitude lost the hitherto protecting arm of her brother and was driven forward even within sight of the chief mourners the solemn resignation of dust to dust was at this instant pronouncing by the priest the sexton proceeded to close the vault and the assembly dispersed  henry remained  stop for pitys sake stop one moment exclaimed he disregard me not good friends but as you honored the dead and love the living i conjure you leave me to myself  then finding himself obeyed and the sexton suspending his office he kneeled down bowing his head to the vault and clasping his hands forcibly together remained mute olivia and lady fitzorton overwhelmed by excess of grief had been led away by partington and mr clare from the scene they could no longer support  an action so characteristic of the enthusiasm of henry had a too powerful effect on caroline whose tenderness and terror of heart proved in this one instance too powful for the firmness of her soul she sprang forward exclaiming o god o god as she pronounced which words she perceived henry fitzorton he started at the wellknown sound of her voice and caught her in his arms her face being concealed by her posture and most of the congregation being by this time dispersed and in disorder little notice was taken by the sexton of a circumstance which might naturally happen at a funeral in two of the supposed same family after henry and caroline both deprived of utterance had been in this situation the space of a minute charles who had followed olivia unseen only for the melancholy satisfaction of a last look came up and finding caroline in the attitude above described kneeled down by the side of his sister and friend and in a suppressed voice exclaimed o heaven is it possible whom do i see caroline and henry  charles took caroline by the hand and they walked out of the church by the chancel door escaping thus the general observation henry followed and did not speak till they had reached the grand avenue of afflicting memory and which led equally to the abbey and castle i know not said caroline how to account for this otherwise than an event brought about without the consent or i might almost say the knowledge of either me or my brother the wisdom of providence worked by ways inscrutable the story of our wanderings at this awful hour is unnecessary to mention but deeming it of heavenly direction i shall use it to acknowledge that your letter found its way into our souls and that it is our joint desire and supplication that you observe your oath and obey your father and your god  caroline trembled as she spoke the effort to be firm and to recover herself did but the more plainly show the excesses of her agitation  henry looked at charles who tenderly taking his hand entered into a brief explanation of all that had passed in their discourse at the porch of the chapel which preceded their meeting at the funeral he ended with the determination of his sister if the monk approved and for my part added charles i have come to resolves which will render it no less impossible for me to obstruct your union with olivia whom it is my solemn entreaty  here charles paused  my solemn entreaty  alas my earnest supplication  that you should  o henry henry  you know the rest caroline in a state of equal trouble undertook to apologize for her brothers want of words to express the act on which he was not the less resolved  and endeavoring to make up the deficiency she fell into language so incoherent obstructed and inaudible that relieving herself by a violent burst of tears she declared it was a subject which defied the power of words and depended on deeds only  what those deeds were to be had been in part explained and this alas was no time to enlarge  brother said caroline we must cross yonder part of the forest to the chapel  and not one token of eternal remembrance at an eternal parting cried henry whom extremity of sensation had hitherto kept silent remembrance replied caroline o it shall it must be indeed eternal and for an eternity of blessings upon thee if we now leave each other to our respective duties the performance of which may and alas must give us misery but of which the omission would be shame horror and despair i speak added she with solemn reference to the living and the dead dearest and best of men farewell  farewell  for ever  henry plunged in unutterable anguish pressed her extended hand to his lips  and copious were the burning tears that bathed it  caroline turned away her head  charles spoke not but clung round henrys neck nature could carry the sensation no farther they separated in dreadful silence henry taking the road to the castle and the brother and sister returned to the chapelhouse  chapter xxiv they had scarce reached the forest path when they saw a light advancing toward them and heard the sound of voices which they knew to proceed from dennison and father arthur my dear children exclaimed the latter running toward them you have alarmed us by your untimely absence whither have you been wandering explanations must be deferred said charles let us make the best of our way to the chapelhouse for our minds and bodies equally demand repose  lend charles your arm my good dennison and mine shall be the support of this dear young lady cried arthur and i command you both not to add to your fatigues by another word till we regain our peacerestoring abode and then you shall silently partake of the refreshment we have prepared for you and the word farewell shall be all that passes between us till the morning  this truly excellent monk was on the next day made acquainted with all that had happened  from the conversation at the chapelhouse to the rencontre at the church  i see i see the almighty hand in it all said arthur by what unsearchable means is the will of heaven fulfilled your resolves are the result of virtue strongly proved and for every tear you shed in her cause a smile from that heaven shall await you your temporal sufferings have been indeed extreme but eternity is before you and i foresee with a prophets eye that even in this world you shall have an earnest of your reward in that which is to come nay you have it at this hour my children look into your own pure hearts and tell me if you would exchange the conscious reflections which are there lodged for all that is heaping up in the breasts of those who now inhabit the abbey is your loss infinite so shall be your gain he who tries the very heart and reins has tried you but o my dear dear children he has examined and proved you and made your way acceptable to him what a consolation what a victory to be acquitted with honor by  nay to claim the approbation of your conscience and your god tell me does it not deprive adversity of her sting enlarge every generous affection of the soul and crush every selfish thought it does it does my children and it will give to returning prosperity come when it may more delightful charms and besides extracting thorns from the present shall confer more sweets than he perfume of the flowers of paradise on the future yes my children when you rest this night on your pillow if your eyes should overflow at the retrospect of your sufferings and disappointments reflect but for one moment that you have gained the applause of him whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain and you will slumber in peace and wake in triumph  there was no professional pedantry no unmeaning priestcraft in the character of father arthur he seldom held down his friends to long dissertations but when he did assert the dignity of his office his eloquence touched at once the understanding the fancy and the heart while he spoke the tumultuous passions seemed to die away and the hearer thought it folly and delusion to disquiet himself about any pursuits less exalted than those which fill up the highest capacities of our nature from his venerable lips the auditor became intimate with the lofty character of his being and the sublime ends of his mind the passions were purified the desires elevated and every faculty of the soul assumed new energy and extent as he painted the joys of conscience and the bright recompense of the crown that passes not away  he deemed this the fit opportunity to invigorate and encourage suffering virtue he entered feelingly into the variety of sorrows which beset two amiable persons his benevolent heart melted at the scenes of woe they had undergone and at all they might yet have to endure their disappointments in whatever was most dear to the human heart called forth all his compassion all his powers and giving vent to his bounteous feelings he addressed to them the sentiments we have here recorded  every word had its due force and they alternately embraced the good man when he had done as if they were indeed his children  such reasonings are not lost on worthy minds they had their effect on charles and caroline who appeared on the following day endued with new vigor to conduct them with patience and honor through the strong duties they had to perform  the admonition of father arthur respecting the affair of the convent was consistent with the wisdom and goodness that pervaded his councils and after a private conference with caroline whom he prevailed upon to put the entire management of the business such as seeking out a fit place for her reception and fit associations where and with whom to begin her pious offices he convened his little auditory consisting of caroline and charles dennison and his indian boy and smiling upon them all begged their attention to a few observations which pressed on his mind in a survey he had taken of the late occurrences  my dear children and friends said he it is worthy your notice that in the petty space of a few weeks have fallen out a variety of events which must sink deep into the reflecting mind in the degradation of sir guise stuart and in the circumstances that preceded and followed it we have seen the pageantry of power and the pride of fortune unable to shield the hypocrite  pardon me for the use of strong words to paint strong truths  the hypocrite i say from detection misery and shame we have seen him deserted by his own servants they fled from the contagion of vice to the protection of virtue they left with an honest disdain the lordly mansion and sought the cottage of piety and resignation my dear children does not this point out the sublime authority and protection of virtue even when she is depressed by misfortunes and bowed down with or rather elevated by sorrows at the least fear of sir armines danger did not the attesting country manifest in its woe the inestimable value of a good mans life did not the heartswoln grief of friends neighbors children illustrate the importance and the majesty of virtue and when it pleased him who lives from eternity to eternity to call the good man to the inheritance of the just did it not seem by the attendance the tears the groans of the countless multitude as if each spectator was following a father to the grave did not you yourselves feel as if you were his children  o that it had pleased heaven to have made us such exclaimed charles the tears of caroline began to flow the hoary cheek of dennison was not dry and the indian child of nature crowded close to arthur touched his robe with pious awe and doubted whether man or angel had spoken but resumed arthur when it was but rumoured that sir guise was on the bed of death did it not rather seem to be the approach of some happy and unexpected revolution in favor of mankind at but the distant prospect of being emancipated from some despotic tyrant whose life was obnoxious and whose dissolution was implored and had his death followed is there a sigh which would have been heaved save those of mercy and terror for his departing soul or a tear shed by one of all the congratulating thousands on his hearse o yes a thousand sighs  a thousand tears exclaimed caroline sighing and weeping in proof  my dearest child rejoined arthur taking her hand pardon my having forcibly touched a wounding subject the allgood is of long patience and of eternal kindness thy father may be yet preserved as an example of penitence as constant as his crimes have hitherto been lasting  caroline dropped on her knee elevating her hands and seemed to offer up a prayer which these chearing words had excited in her soul dennison and charles lifted their eyes to heaven and the indian boy raised up caroline saying young lady was so pretty and so good that good god would make her father good yet for her sake  we have seen too in yourselves my children concluded arthur the upright finding favor and honor followed by the prayers of the living nay the persecutors themselves in despite of the inveteracy of habit or natural hardness of heart feel the awful powers of persisting innocence and perhaps the deepest resentment of the bad against the good arises from a consciousness that even the happiest triumphs of vice are less to be envied than the miseries of suffering virtue which we are told and blessed be the great rewarder we know is but more relished as the more distressed witness for me o recompensing power how sincerely i weep at the griefs and disasters of this afflicted brother and sister how my heart glows at the fidelity of this good old man how it beats with a paternal tenderness toward this poor artless youth whose untutored mind is filled with natural goodness witness all this and witness at the same time that i experience more soulfelt satisfaction in suffering with them in affording them my humble protection and encouragement in showing to this enlightened pair the benevolence of heaven made manifest even in their adversity in pointing to the sure rewards that await this venerable man and in opening upon the dawning reason of this boy those sublime truths which may convince him not only that his god is to be seen in clouds and heard in winds but that his creative protective and sustaining power embraces all climes and encircles all nature and lastly that whatever may be the distinctions of partial man the maker of us all acts under influence of no such prejudices  but attending only to the complexion of the heart has allotted a place of happiness and glory to all that wear the forms of men whether born under the blaze of the sun or placed beyond the reach of his beams  while father arthur made this apostrophe his eyes sparkled his cheeks glowed and the sincerity of his heart was visible in his features  masser said floresco me could hear you talk all times and me am better boy and better good christian black every time and me shall go to good place like white man and live all times with good peoples and good masser and be in gods heaven though negro boy  chapter xxv the parties then separated for the night and the next morning showed the effects of what had past in the subsequent letters one of which was the spontaneous effusion of the writers unassisted heart and the other the result of an early conversation betwixt charles and caroline  without clogging either of them by any commentary the reader shall be left at large to form his own reflections  to miss caroline stuart honored my lady after begging a thousand pardons for this boldness seeing i am but an humble servant but i trust in god of good designs i must let your ladyship know of my state which is the windfall of my brother neds farm and the like come to me by death of ned this past week which i have to notice to your honors valuation for being on lease for    years of which    are yet to come of goods and chattels as per advice   00l and ready money upwards of  00l besides the savings up of   00l in your honored honors family by the mothers side with whom i was bred and born and with whom god willing i will die and if i may be so free buried now i can hardly go on with penning my letter for what i hear about your honors going to shut yourself up for life and young squire masters taking himself over sea as to the first consider my dear good young lady  pardon my boldness  if any thing should happen you dont foresee  for lord save us we are poor shortsighted creatures  and i have my thoughts about some matters that may not be spoken to what a sad thing it would turn out to be closed as it were between walls and never to come out  and your dear honor should consider a day is to come when the poor and rich too of this parish will call for you  and alas you cannot hear them nor do them good  the thought whereof if it should come across in your lonesome cell would be a heartbreaking to you  and what if other matters should come round  i must not speak of the castle therefore shall only say love is not to be fastened out by bolts nor bars and i have my misgivings i will say no more miss but i have my misgivings and i told all this and more to his reverence as to the other affair  the squires going to transport himself his honor should think he is heir and god give him life to take possession of this estate and sir guise cannot hope to live for ever  and begging pardon for my boldness it is not fit he should i hope the good squire will think what will betide every thing at the old abbey if the new fangled strange woman  i cannot for the heart of me call her my lady  is left to have every thing her own way and if the lawful heir is away and your honor shut up who is to prevent these doings if an humble servant therefore may be so bold to advise it is this that your honor will be so kind as to make use of the above   00l seeing it belongs to the family by your ladyships side and as the chapelhouse is as i may say in a straight between two the abbey and the castle both being too near neighbors seeing they are not friends and must be as circumstances now are eyesores to your honor and the squire my brother neds farm has a topping good house upon it  and as i know something of the business i could carry on the farming and your honors might live upon the same and with his reverence and his good little black we might be happy in an humble way considering what your honors have been used to till god sees good time to restore you to your own and as his reverence says we carry our own heaven or hell about us so our heaven upon earth may as well be at neds farm as any where else till we all get into your heavens above such is your humble servants good counsel but if it so be it be not taken and your honors prefer a london town life or the like of this public way neds farm might be turned into hard money for as to carrying it on against your honors good will or your honors to live in one place and dennison in another it is not to be reckoned upon seeing it cannot be for as it is said in the holy bible used in churches wheresoever you lodge will i lodge and so on the lease and the stock and the households would make up a roundishlike sum and your honors   00l might go thereto and together we might live bobbishly now do not my good lady miss think my humble designs hereby to hurt you the squire or his reverence by making a mighty matter of the aforesaid in the way of vainglory which is a sin forbidden and if it were not i should be ashamed of for if a mans heart goes to the thing that should not be what are laws and gospels in churches and chapels your honor old dennison is no boaster an please your ladyship when your honors can render back unto caesar that is dennison even to the uttermost farthing that which is caesars towit dennisons so be it i dont gainsay it forasmuch as i know by myself the joy of giving is greater than taking and i would desire your honors to have joy both ways i only mean that if in my time the wherewithal should not come it would not signify as i have neither chick nor child and my last testament would be as well put in force by your dear worthy honors when i am in my grave but i pray it may be in the parish where your honors mean to lie which i suppose will be here in stuart chapel but this matter will be found more fully in what i shall leave behind i mean in the testament therein too is all and severally specified my devisings hoping your honors will be the sole executors of your poor humble servant to command  nestor dennison p s finding i did not well know how to speak the above to your honors i have put it down on paper though i am in the same house     to write this epistle was dennisons employment after he had withdrawn for the night and it took him up some hours after which he laid himself on the bed without undressing and enjoyed the most sweet repose till the usual hour of rising when going into the chamber of the little indian who he found had been at his pen and ink also borrowing from sleep what he gave to his studies dennison put the letter into his hand desiring it might be laid on the breakfast table nearest the lady carolines seat and covered over with these sweet flowers which i have fresh gathered  but stay says dennison my good boy we must brush off this morning dew or it will wet the paper and i would not for all the flowers in the field have that happen here he shook them gently and dried them one by one then gave them to floresco who artlessly said me guess who that letter comes from  it is from somebody that loves missey you are right boy replied dennison it is from one that loves her dearly aye i tought so but why you put pinks roses and suchum like over dat missey will tink dear is no sweet but de sweet words of him him loves ah me knows dat though negro boy look you dis ickle letter come from mine own zoraida in mine own country it is dear as mine own heart and it make me cry and it make me laugh but see it is almost gone into bits and scraps with shutting and opening for i have a peep at it every times i am by myself  but masser is almost makey me write de nice words and i learn de faster that i may send to my own hearts dear zoraida for another letter as dis is almost wear out see i have been writin a b c d and e and tink me shall pick my own zoraidas name out by and bye but i must make him hold together till dat you know i wish him was as fresh as dis to missey  previous to this observation the poor boy took out of his pocketbook a little leathern case from which he produced a parcel wrapped in several papers and lastly a piece of shawl made its appearance in which was guarded zoraidas epistle that was sent to him after he had been sold but now terribly torn in the foldings and indeed almost in tatters after showing it dennison with a disconsolate look he kissed it somewhat too devoutly for two of the pieces incapable of bearing the ardour of the salutation fell to the ground his distress is not easily described at the discovery of this disaster it was expressed by a sort of shriek at the end of which he exclaimed stooping down oh mine heart  mine poor heart  is drop in bits and i no write yet to get him fresh  he then gathered up the pieces in which dennison assisted promising to write a letter to zoraida for him and in the mean time to contrive some means of patching up the old one  this compromised the matter and the grateful boy putting up the precious relics with the same care he had taken them out went to dispose of the stewards packet according to the orders he had received  the company soon appeared at their morning repast and the letter was discovered under the flowers by the lovely eyes for whose perusal it was intended they dropped many a lucid testimony to denote that the contents were interesting to the affections while they paused on the sentiments and good dear excellent old man exclaimed she at the conclusion were our misfortunes to answer no greater end than calling forth such virtues as thine we should not suffer in vain the letter was then given to charles who with equal emotions read it aloud not that any part of the honest creatures offer can possibly be accepted said charles but it is honorary to the human soul to be in friendship with such a man true said arthur but to consider ourselves worthy to be followed by such a man from the house of feasting into that of mourning is a triumph which is reserved only for the good  floresco who had listened to every syllable with the utmost attention struggled with his sensations some time and at last burst into tears amidst the flow of which he exclaimed o make me masser like mr dennison but me am poor negro boy and no money but me give ickle to poor beggarman and would diggey and workey all day all night all life for feel as him feels  but dennison himself witnessed not these tender effects of his letter on the contrary he purposely absented himself and was missing the whole morning oh reader what is in the human heart when it has either done any thing remarkably meritorious or base to avoid the eyes while the action is recent of the benefitted or wronged is it the honest internal shame which conscience dictates on one hand and the ingenuous modesty and delicate fear of wounding the feelings of the object whom we have served on the other both produce blushes but as different in their effect as in their cause when dennison at last made his reluctant appearance he could not have cast down his eyes nor discovered a more glowing cheek or tumultuous voice had he been detected in robbing the parties of the sum he had offered to lend them but his generous distress was soon lost in the embraces of his friends  chapter xxvi the second letter of which we promised our readers a faithful copy was as follows from  charles stuart to henry fitzorton esquire  my still and for ever beloved friend it is now that i am to confirm in the name of myself and sister her resolves and my own to put it out of the power of either of us to do you or your muchinjured family any further wrong humiliated to the very dust and overwhelmed with confusion i turn back my view on the evils which have been brought upon your house by the animosity of mine nor do i think i could bear the anguish of these reflections were i not instantly on my part to make all the atonement in my power at the same time my almost angel sister equals the sacrifice on hers  know then my friend that we like you have now our solemn vows registered in heaven we concur in giving up our eternal hopes to the vows made to your dying father and to the happiness of olivia clare we have long struggled with impossibilities such were the pretensions of us all we yield and if we did not such has been the horror of past occurrences that were even our former affections to take their bent the greatest impossibility would be to reconcile even with possession of our darling objects those deep wounds in the memory which must for ever open wide and stream with the blood of sir armine shed by sir guise neither olivia nor henry with all their magic could demolish this everlasting barrier to our repose the father rising against the father and the broken oath of a friend and the breaking heart of an adorable woman  perhaps her hate superadded  oh insupportable addition  and all this as a judgment on our violations  would mix in every thought and empoison felicity even in the arms of love think o think my friend what must be the state of my feelings or of carolines piercingly tender alas as they ever were when conscience tells us we ought to felicitate ourselves on a mutual escape from the only injuries which sir guise has left in the power of his children to do the children of sir armine yet felicitate ourselves we cannot for our loss is infinite and eternal but that we may become the victims of a stern and absolute law of honor and of conscience we have in the most awful manner and in a situation the most solemn even kneeling at the tomb of our sainted mother mutually sworn you will not even receive this letter till no earthly power could change our resolves my sister joins me in wishing you all the good that can be thought and far more than can be expressed she unites too in the firm persuasion and belief that the graces and virtues of  o stubborn heart why do thou throb with a violence that makes the unsteady hand almost unable to mark the name upon paper  the virtues of olivia  as much the object of your tenderness as she has ever been of your admiration and esteem how full of despair alas is our condition when sacrificing ourselves we implore of heaven that this may be the issue of your  your  your  by my soul fitzorton it seems like the stroke of death or of life prolonged by torture to mention your  marriage with olivia and yet heaven that knows the weakness of my heart knows also that i would not accept the hand of that very olivia taxed as it would be with ten thousand scorpion reflections for the eastern world nor would i have her become the wife of any man breathing but of henry fitzorton notwithstanding which i dare not confess even to my gentle sister these marks of distracting hopeless yet tyrannizing affection which i have blended with the simple expression of our resolves and good wishes that i undertook to communicate the constancy of her own virtue might expect better things of mine but her confidence is illimitable and her trusting heart will believe that i have performed my pangful task as i ought lest i disgrace it yet more let me hasten to beg you will present the enclosure according to its address and that you accept the prayers of  caroline and charles stuart p s we have left the abbey and taken refuge in the chapelhouse but only till we could mature our several plans of life which now being arranged we shall shortly quit this place nor can we ascertain our next address and if we could it would be superfluous for any reply to these final dispatches would be in the highest degree improper in one instance my henry has deceived his charles the latter has discovered  by what means it matters not  that the former was the medium of his brother johns benevolence in regard to the lieutenancy in short it turns out to be a fraternal confederacy between the brothers to serve an unhappy friend the son of their bitterest enemy  the enclosure to sir john fitzorton sir as i can offer no atonement for injuries i can no longer bear the calamitous burden of benefits from the man so injured this will at once account to you for the resignation of my lieutenancy of which by accident i have found you to have been the donor and if you judge of the firmness of my mind by the vigor of your own or will so far exert your candor as to admit any parallel in our principles you will accept of my heartfelt gratitude for the past and not turn that generous emotion into its reverse by any vain attempt to reconcile what is in its own nature irreconcilable since i received your honored admonition a train of tremendous incidents have as you know fallen out to render unnecessary all farther warnings you will hereafter find that i shall even do more than you required in regard to one distracting subject but this alas is no time to burden your full heart with either my past misfortunes or future resolves my commission sir may much more honorably be bestowed for myself i am still attached to the military life and shall remain a soldier but must take the liberty to serve my king and country without violating my own feelings  i have the honor to be sir your most grateful and obedient servant charles stuart      the above packet was dispatched by the trusty dennison who was made acquainted with so much of its contents as to convince him of the necessity of its being delivered to henry fitzortons own hand and in private without waiting any replies  olivia was walking with henry in a back avenue of the castle as dennison rode up to the house and by a concealment of the trees which were there thicker than ordinary to serve as a screen from the northeast wind he did not perceive either henry or the young lady till they were too close for any retreat and this would have been rendered yet more difficult as little fitz  who as usual was the attendant on henry and olivia  happening to wander on the hunt into the path that dennison had taken  announced by cries of gladness that one of the abbey family was at hand a iversal tremor seized henry dennison had always been the faithful medium of his affections and silently shared in his regrets and disappointments dennison was himself greatly moved at this sudden encounter and the mutual endeavor of both to conceal it from olivia more effectually betrayed them far however far as tender sympathy is from jealous suspicion was that spirit of candor from conjecturing that the real cause was seated in the despairing henrys heart or that the good old man was in its fullest confidence attributing the whole to some untold calamity which had happened in a family in whose misfortunes they were all in a manner involved and the sufferings of her everremembered caroline first exciting her sympathy alas exclaimed she i fear some fresh distress has fallen out at the abbey tell me sir is miss stuart or the good charles in any new distress  what less can be the cause of these emotions  dennison answered only by a heavy sigh and shake of the head on recovering himself he said he was charged with a commission from his young master to squire henry which must be deferred till he regained his strength and spirits i am a poor infirm creature miss and a little matter oversets me  olivia who was in every sense of the word one of the least suspecting of human beings desired henry to assist the old steward into the house where they had no sooner arrived than receiving a summons from her father she left henry and dennison together  alas said dennison i fear me much the weakness i have been guilty of has well nigh discovered what my master and mistress enjoined me to conceal but your honor and madam took me unwares  i was not in the best spirits before  i have lost my rest of some nights  sleep is an old mans friend  i did not think to see your honor so much changed  and i forgot you were all in black and poor little fitzs love put me in mind of former times and i had just left one set of sorrowfuls to meet another  so that it was too much for an old creature and i doubt the young ladys suspicion    ah she has not an atom in her disposition cried henry but for pitys sake thou to whom i owe eternal gratitude  gratitude which even despair cannot extinguish tell me the message you have brought from the abbey  not from the abbey but the chapelhouse sighed forth dennison he then took out charless packet which having put into one of henrys hands he pressed the other to his aged bosom kissed it then wished him all gods choicest blessings saying if that lovely young lady was to be his bride she must be a happy one even though he thereby lost miss caroline i cannot must not stay my dear honored squire but upon earth and in heaven i shall remember love and bless you  the tears of an old whiteheaded man whose honesty we have long known and whose affection we have often proved shed over us at probably an eternal parting are at all times affecting but in henrys case  combined as it was with the most touching circumstances of gratitude doubt terror and tenderness  it is no wonder that he suffered dennison to leave the castle without the utterance of another word  it was indeed a considerable time before he had sufficient strength to open the eventful packet of which his inmost soul felt at once the virtue the energy and the irremediable necessity  excellent charles divine caroline said he yes your henry shall be added to swell the sacrifice of selfdevoted victims and our oaths shall be respected  by degrees his mind softened to a sort of pious acquiescence and seeing himself hemmed round by innumerable duties at the castle and insurmountable difficulties at the abbey a new oath ascended silently from his lips to that heaven which had received his former and kneeling down he cried out in a loud voice thrice repeating it here then again i swear to devote my hand to olivia witness the oath o god  olivia reentering distinctly overheard henry pronounce this solemn asseveration he was yet on his knees olivia raised him into her innocent arms  join join my fervent and humble prayer said she to the attesting god that i may deserve the blessing those vows impart henry reiterated them in her embrace  whoever wants any explanation of this little incident would not comprehend its force were it illustrated by all the books of the sorbonne to every tender heart it will be intelligible and to such only it is addressed  chapter xxvii while they were thus situated john fitzorton came into the apartment to witness this olivia to ease the overflowing of her heart which had now felt the first returns of joy since the death of sir armine could not forbear describing to john the circumstance which had given birth to her happiness  henry delivered to his brother the letter which had been addressed to his care and john after hastily reading it went out of the room  henry and olivia being again left together fell into a train of reflections which insensibly brought round the conversation to the present posture of affairs at the abbey  alas cried olivia i dread yet wish to hear what are those sad events which have the power to affect not only the sympathising heart of my beloved henry but to move the firm temper of john it was i see not without difficulty he restrained his tears but did you notice the affecting turn of his powerful eyes as he directed them to us the more i see of him the stronger is my veneration how gratifying to the inmost soul to possess his approbation but good heaven how insupportable would be his anger  although this was an hour in which olivia gained extremely on henry he had presence of mind enough to communicate only such parts of the chapelhouse packet as might satisfy the solicitude which he saw it had raised to have told her all he knew would only have destroyed her happiness and augmented his own infelicity and he had now firmly resolved to resign himself to the inevitable destiny of his life he informed her therefore of the baronets indiscreet marriage of the open rupture which had happened in consequence of making such a wife the mistress of his family of the impossibility there was that caroline or her brother should remain longer at the abbey of their departure thence of their present residence with the venerable father arthur and their domestic the good dennison of their forlorn state of mind and fortunes and of their future destination bound by oaths which from my acquaintance with both said henry with a trembling voice i know to be irrevocable as fate itself  olivia not only gave him full credit for the tender feelings of friendship but countenanced them by generous testimonies of her own and asked with the most fascinating simplicity and ardour whether it were not possible essentially to serve these excellent persons without wounding their delicacy my beloved henry will not suppose that i involve their virtues in the faults of their father or that i do not as fervently wish and intend to sue for the revived friendship and society of caroline and if i have been withheld from the like avowals it has been in conformity to the melancholy which must alas long hang over our house and which suspends every promise of the heart but indeed henry i have a faithful memory and think it is a solemn duty incumbent on us both to consult each other till we strike upon some expedient by which your friend charles and my caroline should be reconciled to the felicity we should feel in rendering them happy  generous creature cried henry it is impossible  john reentered and read the letter he had received from charles because he said it was to the honor of the human race that such an action should be known  where said olivia where must be the heart of sir guise stuart that it catches not some sparks of virtue from such a son  and how irrefragable must be that sons virtue added john which receives no foul tints from the contagious example of such a father  henry sighed in the heaviness of his soul  something might surely be contrived notwithstanding whispered olivia  henry fully sensible of her excellence begged the subject might drop for the present  olivia however took an early opportunity of renewing it little imagining that she was laboring the very point which kept alive the only subject it was her interest to annihilate instead of suffering it to die silently away henry after strong repetitions of his assurances that nothing could be devised again put an end to the subject  it occurred to olivia that henry might be deterred from serving his friend on consideration that as the power of conferring pecuniary obligations to any very considerable amount would originate from her she thought that she could not possibly give him a more graceful instance of her affection and at the same time effectually indulge her own bounteous disposition than by entering privately and without assistance into such arrangements as might answer the ends proposed she could not easily settle on a plan but she felt in every fiber of her heart that she would adopt any one that might be likely to promote an object which by tender prepossession for and long meditation upon was become in addition to the assured affection of henry the one thing necessary to her happiness day and night did she revolve the point in her fancy but apprehensive that either charles or caroline would put their scheme into execution before her own should be matured or even engendered she formed the resolution of paying a visit to caroline convinced that when they got once together something might be done which should facilitate the happiness of all  a pursuit of this kind in which all the generous affections are convened to assist is among the highest delights of a young and animated mind the agitation which attends and the secrecy with which it is conducted are parts of its happiness olivia  whose whole life was too innocent for the disguises or concealments of an action or a thought  intended that henry her father and everybody concerned should be at a fit season in confidence of her designs but she wished to give them something like form and pressure before they were revealed and this secret interview with caroline was designed as the general outline she knew that two women of warm imaginations could do more toward the advancement of a favorite project by one hours conversation than by an age of solitary thinking and she was predetermined to believe that her mind was so exactly in sympathy with that of charless sister that their wits would be in immediate unison and that something would be struck out  from this collision of discourse  which would make her return to her soulbeloved henry doubly happy from the discovered power of enlarging the sphere of his enjoyment the grand point in which were concentered all the hopes and endeavors of her life  while she was yet in search of an ostensible motive for her visit  at least such a one as could be reasonably assigned  and while she began to feel somewhat embarrassed at the difficulty carolines spaniel  which had been for some time asleep at her feet  started in slumber as if dreaming of the chase then barked as if after long puzzling at the scent he had hit it off and after running it at full cry awoke courting his new mistresss caresses he leaped into her lap and at the selfsame instant leaped into olivias mind which had also been on the hunt an idea that he would be a fit instrument of her operations on the present occasion the most proper and natural apology in the world dear little creature exclaimed she smoothing his velvet ears and patting his downy sides the keeping thee agreeable as thou art so long from thy poor mistress has lain on my conscience and now that she is under affliction thy society and various endearing ways may happily beguile her of her grief and steal her sometimes from herself thou will soon discover dear sensible sagacious little being that she wants every relief which an old friend can afford and wilt therefore double thy fondness nor shall she have cause to think thou have been unfaithful by voluntary desertion albeit thy first ramblings discovered the little truant of an hour they were intended only that thy neighboring friends should share thy company and thou would have returned to her who owned thee  i know thou would  had not thy sympathy for our sorrows and my seductions kept thee from thy own house all this shall thy lovely owner be told and if there be ought of blame it shall light on olivia or to clear thy fame from ingratitude as rare in thy race as common in ours even my henry shall be made a partner in the trespass we have committed and thy lady shall understand the arts he too used to make thee sensible his attentions were never paid in vain and yet trust me kindhearted creature nothing but a sense of thy duty and mine own honesty should induce me to part with thee  but it will not be for ever since i tell my affections thy best friends shall be mine and thou who art now to be an assistant in the plan wilt be entitled to part of its felicity  ah reader what arguments the inventive heart can find when it wants their aid all this was very true and it would have been no less so had it been thought of many days before but a feeble spaniel was now a tower of strength to a favorite plan of operations  chapter xxviii nothing now remained to perfect olivias enterprise but a fit opportunity of sallying forth and this soon presented itself john had desired of henry a mornings private conference lady fitzorton was employed in her own apartment mr clare was going his usual ride thus favored by circumstances she gave out that as the day invited she should live in the air and wander about like one of its feathered inhabitants but said she to her father as he was mounting his horse i shall only make a circular flight of it and at the sound of the dressing bell return to my nest she soon summoned her fourfooted associate who seemed to take the hint and with a bounding step and beating heart she set forward toward the chapelhouse it was an enterprise that more than emulated the spirit of older times it put the flower of knighthood to the blush it had the purest motive and proposed the noblest end there were dangers to be past and difficulties to be subdued but these all yielded to youthful hope and imagination those generous quixotes in the chivalric adventures of the human heart  there is assuredly an exultation seldom felt and never to be described attendant upon the performance of every hard and difficult duty charles and caroline stuart were in the possession of this after they had performed the sacrifices with an account of which dennison had been charged and while that honest creature was on his commission the brother and sister wept and smiled in the fullness of their hearts sensible of their forlorn condition yet proud to suffer with the dignity of virtue what virtue required in this tearful triumph they related what they had done to father arthur whose reflection on their conduct produced the subsequent remark my children said he the majesty or the meanness yet more than the strength or weakness of the soul is only to be ascertained by an occasion like this the mean will temporize the majestic will stoop to no accommodation short of the point which honor prescribes the mean will shift about for an evasion methinks i see him trembling at the approach of a duty which menaces the deprivation of what he has long cherished his conscience and his passions are at war within him the insurrection of the little invisible world is hot and obstinate but his spirit is abject virtue with a frown demands her sacrifice he arms against her all his forces she is immortal and he arms in vain such a point must absolutely be yielded says she somewhat austerely he still resists and calls in his auxiliaries  sophistry prevarication and delay they prevail not for his own conscience another divinity goes over to the side of virtue even when every one of his passions keep the field behold how he waits to the last moment in a miserable balance betwixt the disgrace of the most vile and the glory of the most virtuous action every hope and fear upon the scout to hunt for possibilities of an escape till pushed by circumstances he at last gives way only to an arbitrary necessity to that he yields without any impulse from the moral principle and repines for the rest of his life the majestic on the other hand not less sensible of what is dear to keep and difficult to part from obeys for a while the dictate of human nature he sees the advancing power that is to dismantle his breast of a cherished joy he receives him with a sacred awe that wants a name disdaining to hold in equipoise the choice of good and evil or when a great and positive duty arrayed it may be in terrors and pronouncing what is fitting to be done  in the still small voice of conscience whose whispers are to such minds more loud and alarming than the thunder  the majestic i say my dear children your recent experience tells you takes the treasure which had been long enthroned on the heart of hearts out of the bosom where it was lodged and treated as a guest from heaven  innocent affection is such  and like the patriarch offering up his only son at the command of god prepares to sacrifice the majestic weeps and trembles at the altar as he binds the beloved victim  the blood of the heart seems to blend with his tears but they are the tears neither of weakness nor of rebellion they are not the bitter waters of repining on having made that sacrifice but a sacred stream flowing from a tender heart which mingles the feelings of a man with the duties of a christian my children he who made us tremblingly alive sanctions the feeling which the agonizing yet blissful sensibility he gave creates even i who have had my heart educated in the pale cloister there laboring early to govern the passions of nature hesitate not do declare such sorrow is indeed heavenly  the whole of the time that arthur was uttering this speech the brother and sister illustrated it by example and perhaps without hearing one half of it continued to smile and weep as if their sensations were beyond the reach of declamation or eloquence the proudest forms of words are indeed wretched mediums to paint any of the grander movements of the soul and particularly the struggles of honor and affection these are unspeakable and when arthur had paused it was perhaps some relief to the afflicted friends whom he addressed that he was prevented from going on by the unexpected sight of the little animal lately mentioned he had often roved away and often returned for caress yet gained the chapelhouse before olivia nay he had made his best apologies there for absence and by every testimony of tenderness had conciliated the favor of caroline while olivia though the generous purpose of her visit hastened her steps was scarce midway  excuse the human heart good reader if thou have any knowledge of it thou will excuse too the truly virtuous and resolved charles and his sister if the slight surprise of suddenly observing a poor truant dog return to his friends renewed a train of tender sorrows which would have at the moment been too powerful for a folio of moralities even from father arthur though truths divine come mended from his tongue  but what will to thee appear a yet greater weakness  if indeed thou art not a delineator  father arthur knowing and feeling as he did the history of this quadruped dismounted in an instant from his vaulting steed of eloquence and when caroline exclaimed ah my poor poor fitz and art thou come to be of the chapelhouse party  or did my  my  my  did  mr  henry  fitz  orton send thee to comfort us  father arthur forgot to reason but remembered to feel to him to dennison and to themselves yea and even to floresco it was in a moment discovered that olivia was as dear to charles and henry to caroline as at any period of their lives and had any corresponding testimony been wanting the following miscellaneous converse would have arisen in proof happy little creature how sleek and smooth he looks said caroline continuing her caresses and have they been very tender to thee poor fellow  sister said charles as his hand followed carolines along the dogs glossy back henry has told me such instances of my olivias  hem  hem  of miss clares partial fondness for this little animal that i am almost sorry he has quitted her and yet is it not comfortable to look at any thing which has found favor in the eyes of those we love  caroline blushed assent i am persuaded cried the lieutenant the fair hand of that sweet girl has honored him in this manner a thousand times  he stepped in henrys bedchamber said caroline   the squire and young madam were fondling him by turns even while i was at the castle interposed dennison and methought the dog when he lay down and whined piteously at my feet  which he did  seemed aware that all was not as it should be caroline drew her cheek across the dogs forehead and floresco went and brought him a sweet cake of his own preparing then kneeling down to feed him told him whisperingly you no speak ickle ting  you no speak  but young lady and masser squire love somebodys that you loves and that loves you dearly  i see dat as plainer than you ickle ting  while the good floresco was thus employed olivia made her appearance at the chapelhouse she stood on the threshold of the door which was open and supporting herself with one hand by the doorhandle which trembled as she held it she pointed with the other to the spaniel as an apology for her intrusion then slightly curtesying she ventured to step over the threshold and with accents of hyblean sweetness the bloom of a generous heart mounting into her cheek she assured caroline that the detention of her favorite lay upon her conscience and she thought nothing could make her pardon possible but coming herself to surrender him at its mistresss feet it had the wicked feeling of robbing you of his little faithful heart and what is there amongst the wide circuit of crimes so bad as to steal away the object of ones affections but he is now restored and you must try to forgive me  caroline felt the very anguish of a truth which reached a deeper sentiment than the loss or even the death of her spaniel could create but to form any idea of the state into which charles and his sister were thrown by this unlookedfor interview with the cause of all their admiration and agony you must have a heart friend that can enter into their several situations as well in times past as present so that unless such internal evidence is at your command this whole incident which might otherwise have come quite home to the business of your bosom must be found miserably wanting all that we can do for you is to describe the mere matters of fact without a thousandth part of the appertaining emotions and passions and if you have neither fancy or feeling to supply these it is not our fault  chapter xxix neither charles nor caroline were able to mark their welcome by a single word they bowed trembled blushed turned pale endeavored to reach a chair attempted utterance and failed in both dennison and father arthur were scarcely more collected and had it not been for the happy alertness and urbanity of floresco the hospitalities would have deserted the chapelhouse on the first entrance of its lovely guest  olivia by a very natural construction attributed this general confusion partly to the variety of embarrassing circumstances which now subsisted between the two families and partly to the situation in which she found charles and caroline at the chapelhouse where she supposed they felt themselves as exiles almost within sight of the paternal home from whence they had been driven in pursuance of which opinion she begged to speak a few words to them apart and being conducted into another room by the trembling charles she gave the brother and sister each a hand and with a frankness that spoke the soul and in a voice whose sweetness was in itself an antidote to the poisons of life she said we meet not as strangers you and i caroline have been friends from our infant days cruelly have our amiable designs been broken but we have daily and hourly conversed with each other by secret and silent intelligence i know we have so it is vain to deny it this is no time for ceremony or for concealments let us be ingenuous then i have been greatly alarmed at the discovery of a plot  here she assumed a graver air and accent  a plot which i am told you have actually laid against the happiness of henry and olivia  the scarlet of a fever and the pale of death tyrannized alternately in the cheeks of charles and caroline  you are i find about to rob continued olivia addressing them both two of your most sincerely admiring friends of what their souls hold most dear    there is no adequate expression to the looks of caroline or charles  rob us i say of our inalienable property in your society resumed olivia to the infinite comfort of her hearers who felt relieved past utterance i am come therefore she added not only to restore your favorite but as a friend to claim the interest which you mr stuart promised to create for me in carolines affections nay i come to assert myself those claims of sympathy  of childhood  of softest tenderest hours  and if they meet any congenial advocate in your bosoms will be instantly rewarded with an assurance that this cruel convent scheme  for there begins your confederacy against us  will be wholly laid aside  and a more social plan which has been some time forming in my mind  adopted a plan my dear friends  you must allow me to call you so  which includes the felicity of all and though it is not yet mature i can make no farther progress in it till you here promise me you will not throw an insurmountable bar in my way by putting your plot upon our peace in execution and so throw down my new raised edifice and bury the happiness of henry and olivia in its ruins  in short continued olivia glowing as she proceeded my heart dear and suffering friends is in the history of all your unmerited misfortunes and disappointments and i truly consider them as much my own as if i even had created them and am as sincerely interested in their removal  the surprise and puzzling kind of perplexed astonishment which seized on charles and his sister became again inexpressible the words seemed to involve much more than met the ear and although olivia intended them to express with the most liberal simplicity her general knowledge of the abbey calamities the auditors believed they included even a discovery of their unfortunate loves to which they supposed  judging from themselves  that olivia had determined to become a martyr  it is decreed by all the powers of honor and tenderness said she that the castle must make reparation to the abbey and by a union of fortunes fates and affections be for ever of one family  the equivoque increased and why this trembling reserve said olivia i will prove to you sweet caroline said she carrying her hand to her heart and gently holding that of charles  i will prove to you both that this is to be done consistently with the nicest feelings and duties to suffering friends below and pitying angels above  the gordian knot was now to the apprehension of charles and caroline less difficult to untie  after this confession continued olivia it remains with you to send me back to the eastle the most successful or the most disappointed of human beings i ought to tell you however that your compliance will enable me to make our friend henry of human beings the happiest and it will be accompanied by the sweetest surprise in the world for though i know and you cannot be ignorant that it is the nearest wish and design of his heart that ample atonement should be made to you for all the pangs you must have undergone before alas you were driven to this extremity the distress into which the news of your intention to steal yourselves away from us has so disordered him as well it might that he can think upon nothing decisive and my proud heart aspiring to gain the conquest of your promise not to leave us and my earnest desire to carry the tidings of my victory to him myself has made me dare to undertake the whole matter without his knowing or even suspecting it so that i have my plot too you see judge therefore what a generous occasion presents itself for your exalting me in his esteem if you permit me in this great instance to assure him of your friendship and it can be done in no other way than by such a family compact as i have suggested you will thereby raise the value of mine and my obligations to you will be everlasting  what was to be said what done by caroline or charles even what was done and said  nothing the mystery was inextricable yet a strange opening of trembling light of hope and of happiness all which had been yielded to the influence of despair seemed to break in upon them like a vision or rather daydream which they knew not how to encourage or dispel  all i at present solicit rejoined olivia earnestly is your promise to adopt no fatal measure that may put it even beyond your own power to make us and yourselves i trust happy o grant me this and i will fly with the wing of affection to mature my project but why do i talk of your granting what neither of you can in conscience refuse you owe it to yourselves  you owe it to henry fitzorton  you owe it to me betwixt henry and you charles there subsists even a brotherly affection and my beating heart tells me it is not wholly without a kindred emotion in the bosom of caroline i anticipate then your full compliance and will now therefore go on with my darling scheme of which you shall have the particulars at my next visit but remember you have both looked a complete assurance that we have no more to fear from your former insufferable scheme  though it might be sincerely said that during the delivery of these sentiments soft as the dew from heaven distills her gentle accents fell the disorder surprise and a thousand sensations known only to the minds which feel them wholly took from charles and his sister the power of speech olivia saw a variety of symptoms part of which she thought auspicious and part she feared were unfavourable to her designs interpreting however their silence into a kind of modest assent she would have now hurried out of the apartment had not charles with a melancholy but determined air assured her there were invincible reasons which he feared must for ever interrupt her benevolent endeavors to unite the families of fitzorton and stuart  i know every one of those reasons rejoined olivia maintaining her point but they are all to be reconciled my good sir they are all to be reconciled the riddle appeared now resolved the generous animation with which olivia repeated this assurance brought into the mind of charles the most delicious of all human delusions his fancy had been achieving wonders all the time and now he even supposed what cannot the tender heart that henry had like himself forgot every thing but love and had told the story of all their hapless passion to olivia who had determined at whatever risk to save them all from the threatened despair o thou unheard of excellence is it possible said he throwing himself at her feet shall we then owe to thy unparalleled sweetness the mighty blessing  olivia believing his rapture proceeded from the prospect of being restored againto the arms of his friend replied with an ardour scarcely inferior to his own that she was satisfied there was not a wish which he or his enchanting sister could form but the proposal she should speedily make would gratify to its utmost height  the strength of this expression seeming to dispel all that remained of the mystery moved the firm spirit even of caroline who in her turn ceased for an instant to remember her scheme of sequestration and all the resolves she had made to bid the world an eternal farewell  but alas it was the rhapsody only of a few blissful moments yet those who have hearts to feel might weigh those moments against a thousand insipid years and find in all the dull and freezing truths of the latter nothing to balance the shortlived but heartfelt transports of this delusive joy  obtrude not upon these children of imagination thy more sober reasonings sage reader in this their delirium as well might thou argue with a fever or declaim against the fury of a whirlwind avaunt thy catalogue of cold interrogations  have they forgot say thou in the spirit of a man supinely stretching in the elbowchair of apathy have they forgot the long epistle of victorious virtue which they sent in the conviction of their souls to the castle of fitzorton has the upright charles and the correct caroline so soon annihilated what appeared to be engraven on their heart of hearts where is their heroism their fortitude their philosophy and that nice internal sense which their parading historian would have persuaded us had prompted the glorious sacrifice which virtue demanded yes redoubted querist all these things were for the moment as if they had never been enslaved by a delicious impossibility which the heart inly stirred made practicable as the plainest point in nature fancy and affection opened to them the gates of hope and moved with more than the lightnings celerity those bars which their own reason  peradventure with all its pliability strong as thine  had so solemnly and so recently declared were more immovable than the everlasting hills in a word their heroism fortitude and philosophy were what thine would have been even if thou art more intrepid than achilles more gigantic than ajax and a better reasoner than nestor  chapter xxx alas exclaimed caroline whatever destiny intends for us we must be lost to every thing that is good and lovely in human nature before we are unmindful of olivias kindness and her friendly wishes will be in the nature of blessings to us go where we may  they had by this time reached the other apartment and olivia supposing she had gained ground proceeded to pursue her advantages then insensibly slid to the door of the chapelhouse and was stealing off without seeming to move away charles and caroline as insensibly followed we were all formed to be of one family said olivia surely your hearts must convince you of this how happy shall we be when our arrangements are made can any thing interrupt it methinks i see as in a mirror the times to come we are all seated by our fireside the arts the pleasures and the affections smiling before us we shall be all in alliance in friendship in love  they were now in the path that led from the chapelhouse to the castle charles perhaps without knowing it pressed one of olivias hands to his lips and the other was thrown round the waist of caroline in this manner they walked on coloring the fairy paradise of their fancy more highly at every step ah that it should be necessary for reason to advance with a frown and dissolve the charm yet how quickly is it done under influence of any vehement affection of the heart the step is quick and almost keeps pace with the emotion it is incredible how soon our three friends were within the bounds of fitzorton olivia had now placed herself in the middle wreathing her lovely arms within those of charles and caroline had a sentiment soft as that which charles might wish to inspire animated her bosom its effects would have been demostrated nearly in the same way in which she now proved the loving kindness compassion and sympathy of her gentle heart which all the time felt only what such feelings allowed nor had it one throb of a tenderer passion for any mortal but her henry  the spaniel led the way  see said olivia smiling that dear thing certainly knows our convention i find our george calls him little fitz the time i trust is not far off when every one of us shall assert our share of property in that worthy little fellow nay and i predict that the prospect from the castle to the abbey will one day be as clear and bright as it is now obscure and cloudy methinks half the grand avenue even to the little side alcove which is never to be forgotten looks full of promise already  here was a stroke of recollection which though intended by olivia as a memento of her affecting scene with henry brought back to carolines heart ten thousand feelings of which olivia had not the most distant idea  such converse brought them absolutely within a few paces of the castle gates at which all three who had seen and heard nothing but themselves expressed equal surprise  o cried olivia that the moment were now come in which we might all be presented to one another hand and heart in the way each best desires  and why not it is but anticipating the event and in such a cause    olivias hand was upon the gate bell and a single sound was given just as caroline from some secret impulse trembled and begged her to stop  it was a tumultuous and indefinable as well as indescribable moment charles and caroline stuart conducted by olivia clare were at the gate of that castle which they intended never more to approach  a new and unexpected hope naturally arising out of a chain of misconceptions as naturally corresponding to their wishes suddenly expelled despair every passion which was before refused admittance reentered the bosom an almostinvited guest and even reason seemed at length to nod assent  i have a thought said olivia how it may even now be contrived and without farther warning she rung the bell with a force which that thought seemed to inspire  heavens what have you done exclaimed caroline attempting to stop the sound the vibrations trembling from her disordered pressure  away with reserves said olivia  my longpromised longpostponed hand will be given to my beloved henry when  o my heart there he is  you may see him through the iron work of the gate  how rejoiced will he be to see you  i will undertake to explain  stop  hide yourselves a moment  stand behind me that his surprise may be the greater  charles and caroline were shot through and through by the second sentence that sentence like despair and death dissolved their fairy dream in a moment they had no ear for more their delusion their weakness their affection their disappointment their misery were by those few words made palpable and had the gate of the castle and the castle itself fallen upon them it would have been deemed a tender mercy luckily for them olivia was too much busied to notice their consternation in what she had now at a moments warning to say and to do and too much taken up with the approach of henry who catching a glimpse of olivia ran to receive her exclaiming  my sweet olivia i have been watching here this hour we thought we had lost the treasure of the castle  according to olivias arrangements charles and caroline were so situated that henry could not see them in his advance she heard therefore the tender greeting which was in strict conformity to henrys wish to love and oath to live for her alone  henry opened the gate  olivia immediately presented her friends they had retreated several paces henry saw and became in an instant a statue of astonishment olivia ran and taking their hands would have advanced his joy you see is too great said she  i will for ever love and bless you olivia replied caroline  exerting herself  if you will go with henry to the castle and suffer us to return to the chapelhouse it is for the ease and happiness of all that this be done but it must be instantaneous for i see not only mr fitzorton but all the family and servants are pouring upon us and we shall be disgraced and exposed beyond the pardon even of olivia  this petition was made in a manner and in a voice that rendered compliance necessary olivia believing the disgrace and exposure alluded to suggested by a too deep though delicate sense of their situation as exiled children from the abbey and the behavior of their father at the castle answered  you shall be obeyed  heaven forbid i should violate your worthy feelings go then but remember your promise and be prepared to expect the fulfilling of mine  you must leave our beloved friends to their own plans at present and hear mine  said she to henry who was now close behind her and whose eyes followed charles and caroline now turning sadly into the path they had so chearily trod a few minutes before  you must not pursue them for my word is given the series of mysteries shall in due time be explained there was not opportunity for saying more as john lady fitzorton and mr clare with several of the servants summoned by the bell were gathering about olivia  she had outstaid her time more than two hours and was surprised to hear that dinner was over or rather had been sent away untasted each individual wondering what had become of the fair truant she gratified their curiosity without betraying either her own designs or the emotions of her chapelhouse friends laying the whole blame on herself for having neglected to take her watch  that is to wind it up added she as she perceived her father putting it to his ear declared it ticked  really said she does it indeed none of my excuses then will do it seems well then i must own myself a truant and beg pardon she supplicated and was forgiven and cold must be the reader who is not convinced she would have had neither eye or ear to time had a thousand clocks reminded her that dinners of ortolan and deserts of paradise waited her return  charles and caroline save by ejaculations spoke not till they regained the chapelhouse and then desiring to pass an uninterrupted hour in their separate apartments they retired to compose afflicted hearts in the best manner they could  chapter xxxi when henry had an opportunity to converse with olivia alone  an opportunity which he sought with unusual diligence for his thoughts fastened on the foregoing scene with an eagerness that had olivia been endued with one particle of suspicion or been furnished with any clue to it would have discovered the cause to lie deeper in his bosom than the interests of friendship  i see said olivia you are earnest to know the history of my rencontre with your friend and mine my henry and though a train of little untimely events have gone blundering on to the disorder of the whole scheme which i intended to have kept a profound secret even from you till all was ripe for discovery i cannot now but let you into the whole matter for indeed henry i would not give you the pain of one moments suspense for all the schemes upon earth and even this was plotted for your felicity  hereupon she related all the circumstances from each of which the goodness of her mind and the tenderness of her heart were displayed so clearly and with such force that penetrated as henry was to the quick with the unexpected sight and as sudden departure of caroline the very glimpse of whom conjured up myriads of ideas which arose like the specter of departed joy as from their tombs in his bosom he embraced her with the utmost tenderness and swore she was too generous too good and that he was utterly unworthy of her but though the plan is impossible added he your kind wishes can in this instance be accomplished  i shall for ever cherish a remembrance of them in my grateful heart  why do you talk of impossibilities resumed olivia charles held the same language he too said it was impossible where pray is the difficulty of our making two of the best people in the world a part of us i should blush with shame for us if i thought we could dispose of more than a third of our income on ourselves and i know of but one difficulty in appropriating some of the surplus and that is in reconciling the acceptance of it to minds as proud and noble as our own but this we must meditate upon i have gained meanwhile the one thing needful  charles and carolines implied though not expressed promise not to leave the chapelhouse till you or i visit them again  henry the more he heard the more he admired the generous speaker but with an agitation that rather seemed to proceed from a tenacity of opinion than any thing else in the judgment of olivia still insisted on the impracticability of the thing  i protest exclaimed olivia warmly you do not enter into my views with half the spirit my dear henry i might have expected from your friendship to the stuarts and your love to me i could almost call you unkind  for is not charles your friend and is not caroline his sister  bythebye henry i am astonished how you have guarded your heart against the  i should have thought  unerring darts of this allconquering girl though the deep shades of melancholy are cast about her one discovers such ineffable sweetness grace and beauty through their veils that i really could not help thinking as i beheld her nothing but the prepossession or prejudice of old habits  such as our being born bred reared and educated together  could account for it  and although i verily believe my heart would break and my death ensue  heaven knows i hope it would  on the loss or the slightest abatement of your tenderness for me i should have enough of candor in the midst of my despair almost to justify the infidelity that would nay that ought  for how is the loss of henry fitzorton to be repaired  yes that ought to shorten my days your affection has taught me to be ambitious henry as you have no superior in your sex methinks  vain and proud wish  i would be the first of mine  methinks for your sake i would be a caroline how infinite must be your attachment to prefer an olivia precious precious preference which at once makes me proud and humbles me  in this artless and animated address as there were so many points to wound and so many to heal henry struck a kind of balance between both and in the compromise his gratitude and admiration of olivia seemed almost to outweigh his love of caroline and made it even more impossible than it had ever been before to declare in whose favor the trepidations of the scale preponderated  the conversation ended with henrys desiring to know the particulars of olivias plan  the particulars replied olivia would run into too much length for the time allowed us to detail it but the substance is  if it met your approbation  to make charles and caroline as independent as ourselves but that only you and i should be concerned or be in confidence of the means indeed it would be yet better if the parties themselves could imagine it came from some fund on which they had a claim for this reason i blame my hasty visit to the chapelhouse but you terrified me with the thoughts of their leaving us for ever with your assistance however it may not yet be too late to redeem my rashness at all events my heart is set upon their remaining amongst us  tell us reader if thou think the ancient epicure sardinapalus or the modern voluptuary quin who is said to have expressed a wish that his throat had been a mile in length and every inch of it palate  tell us if the grecian alexander who conquered worlds or the roman nero who rejoiced to throw them away could at any time of their lives boast a feeling equal to that which possessed the mind of this amiable young woman while projecting to rebuild the fortunes of two persons whom she valued only on account of their virtues and misfortunes and as they were dear to the man she loved if thy heart be as the unmelting snows on the mountains of scandinavia thaws it not at the contemplation of such goodness and if we tell thee that henry fitzorton  touched to the inmost recesses of his soul at what he heard dropped upon his knees as in homage to a superior being burst into tears of consciousness and with a fervor more glowing even than love can excite in some bosoms  renewed his oath to live only for olivia  will thou not own he did as thou would have done if thou would have done less renounce thy claims on humanity  if thou think thou would have done more in like circumstances thou have not known  and oh may thou never know  the force of sublime passions in contention friendship for one woman and love for another  and both warring at once in thy bosom  nor have thou been like him compelled by every principle of honor good faith and piety to wed the former and renounce the latter  the renounced alas still the fool object of his doting heart just torn from his longing arms and straining eyes  but the generous romance of olivias adventure increased the griefs she intended to heal or rather tore open again those deepmouthed wounds which she little supposed had bled so long much less did she imagine her virtuous self the innocent cause on this subject her ignorance was assuredly her bliss and it would not have been folly only but wickedness in the extreme to have made her wise  henry to do him justice now concealed from her with the most generous and tender care so soon as he found no discovery had taken place at the chapelhouse all that could lead to a fact which he every hour received some fresh conviction would were it but surmised plant an eternal thorn in the breast of the woman he had sworn to a dying father who took his oath to the registering angel that he would make his wife and whom even in the storm of passion which shook his heart he felt had claims upon him independent of all bonds  yet olivia made this necessary concealment of henrys emotions the more difficult she imputed the occasional cloud that in despite of his utmost caution overshadowed his brow and the involuntary sigh that stole from his bosom solely to the loss of his father sir armine and the absence of his beloved friend charles a day seldom passed without her reminding him that the virtues of the former ensured him that heaven to which his soul had ascended and from whence it looked benignly down and blessed that forgiving spirit which led his beloved henry to succor the children of his mortal foe whose vices rendered those children the more perfect objects of pardon and of love  certain i am would she say lifting her beautiful eyes to heaven sir armine approves all we may or can do for those afflicted and deeply injured beings his sacred form was before my minds eye as i entered the chapelhouse  he smiled methought as i rose above the shrinking diffidence of my own timid nature and the fancy that he did so gave me confidence in what i spoke as i came back such a glow spread over my heart that i have since considered it as an emanation sent from the bright region in which he now resides to signify that even god himself in whose sacred presence he now moves pronounced what i had undertaken was good your image too dearest henry came in with its encouragements henry will be so surprised  so pleased thought i  o my little offering of good will is abundantly overpaid why henry will not every body do kind things since the smallest urbanity is sure to be returned in bliss a thousand fold virtue seems to me to be common interest my friend and all the powers of earth and heaven reward it with happy feelings even to usury sweet dejected drooping caroline noblehearted generous charles how infinitely am i already indebted to ye how can i repay my obligations  indeed every object that presented itself was productive of something designed to create the felicity of that heart which it kept in continual agitation as she ended the above effusions which were poured forth on the very evening of the eventful day that she arrived from the chapelhouse she cast her eyes on that little adherent who has already been so fruitful of adventure in the course of this history  as i live said she this dear little fitz is with us again he already anticipates the time when we shall all be of one house and even now considers himself as one of the family but methinks he ought to have gone back with his sweet mistress too now she is unhappy  it was impossible for henry not to be at once distressed and delighted by these kind revivals of what it was for the happiness of both olivia and himself to forget  chapter xxxii meantime the amiable brother and sister whom we so lately reconducted to the chapelhouse had a conference with father arthur as soon as they were able to appear before him the subject was their preparations to leave the neighborhood they ingenuously related to him the particulars of their discourse with olivia nor did they conceal the strong emotions of their hearts  it is time to make an escape from ourselves said charles our hearts are not to be trusted every hour we continue here is replete with pain and peril and the very air we breathe is full of temptation i cannot answer for myself if i remain any longer in this strait betwixt scylla and carybdis  the abbey and the castle and my sister concurs with me in thinking that when she is properly and honorably placed something may be determined as to myself let us then lose no time for i will honestly confess a second visit from olivia which she has given us reason to expect would perhaps prove too strong for all that reason piety or prayer could urge  a second rencontre of that kind would at least afflict us both to no good end said caroline and as my fixed and solemn purpose is to go the sooner that purpose is fulfilled the better  caroline uttered these few words with much delay and difficulty the sight of henry fitzorton and the contest it produced in her gentle bosom had thrown her into such a state of agony that she remained several hours speechless in her chamber  late on the following day she arose and came into the hall of the chapelhouse pale almost as if she were indeed in her shroud and feeble even to staggering but her principles knew no weakness and what was due to virtue she still resolved to pay without one appeal from the rigours of justice to the softness of love  o father arthur said she we have confided with you our hearts  dispose of us before any discovery takes place which may make the angelhearted olivia as wretched as ourselves perhaps already something has transpired from the late fatal interview we rely on your instant services to your moral guidance o dear adopted parent we commit ourselves  dennison who was within the hearing of this threw himself upon his aged knees and embracing by turns those of charles and father arthur and then taking the hand of caroline humbly entreated that since his dear young mistress was resolved on retiring from the world that it might be in some asylum where the attendance of an old and faithful servant would be admitted  declaring that if he were denied this he would build himself a hut at the gate of the convent that enclosed her and live and die near the daughter of his dear lady to whose family he had sworn the dedication of himself while life remained  so it will be in vain to shut me out cried the old man remember miss remember young squire what i said in my letter  where she lives there will i live where she lodges there will i lodge  i know what the true lady stuart as she lay dying said  i shall never forget it  dennison said she poor dennison you are an old standard of my dear fathers family and must needs love my children and then she whispered something about what might come to pass  what alas has happened  sure she was a prophetess i am sure she is a saint and a spirit in heaven at the right hand of the lord god as sure as i am now speaking upon earth  reverend sir do not think of letting me leave my young lady if you part me from her my heart will break and my death shall be upon your head  aye i would say so if you were my father by blood  we will all go my honest fellow exclaimed arthur melted with his earnest and simple eloquence and assisting charles and caroline to raise him up  i have already been turning the matter in my mind and think it behooves all of us to depart for a time at least from a place which is as you say my dear child beset with danger the day may arrive when some of us may return to it with joy be that as it may i trust you will put yourselves wholly under my guidance and convincing yourselves that i have your best interest temporal and eternal in view i must have your promise to submit unquestioned however mysterious may be my seemings to what i shall propose and to follow wherever i shall lead  having vowed the most implicit and unlimited obedience and dennisons worthy mind being made easy the rest remained with the good arthur who told them that on the third day counting from that in which he spoke their route should be fixed and their journey might begin on the morning of the fourth in truth the sagacious monastic had already made his arrangements for he soon perceived the chapelhouse would be no resting place and as well read in the weakness of the human heart as in its strength he thought it foolhardiness to set virtue too severe a task or impose on her approved votaries mere trials of strength  a saving knowledge this which our spiritual guides do not always know since numberless are the misfortunes and the crimes which have arisen from experimenting upon the principles and as it were screwing them up to the top of their bent to see what degree of tension they can bear and laying in their way unnecessary difficulties he had little to apprehend from the established rectitude of those whom he called and loved as his children but now that he was more completely in the secret of their hearts he said they were surrounded by snares which virtue herself had set and that their own sensibility was lying in ambush to entrap them a speedy refuge was therefore expedient and his honest heart had been and was still diligent to prepare it  but short as was the space betwixt the determination and the departure of this little party it was filled with incidents of great account to each individual  the point was scarce agreed on as to the time of setting out ere true george in that sort of haste which made him blow as if he was laboring with an asthma and in which indeed he performed all his commissions delivered a packet to charles  gave several reverential bows with like rapidity in distinct respect to every one present  apportioning his bend to the degree of claim which each had on his affections and then set off with the same speed he entered  the billet contained these few words  charles that you may not suffer by surprise expect within an hour from your receipt of this a friendly call from  john fitzorton   though the surprise was broken by this note of annunciation the curiosity which it excited as to what might be the motive of the visit was extreme  charles read the billet aloud to his friends and the expectation of something extraordinary became general they knew indeed that the writer of it would say nothing without a meaning and that his meaning was always characteristic of himself apposite to some point that he believed to be strong and momentous they laid no stress on the messengers bustling address for as it was a maxim of old dennisons to do business a round trot so was it young georges to fetch and carry messages at full gallop but with this line of variation between the two that dennison generally as has been noted conversed with himself or others all the way going and coming and george seldom spoke any sentence but that which made up his message which he would in repetition mutter to himself lest he should drop a syllable on the road for miles together and if the errand had nothing verbal in it he would conduct himself exactly as he did at the chapelhouse on the delivery of johns billet  from the hurryscurry of george therefore nothing could be gathered by those who were acquainted with his paces although these alone to any one who knew him not would have been sufficiently alarming to denote an affair of life or death whereas in fact he would bring you a toothpick or a challenge with equal dispatch  yet no one at the chapelhouse except charles had seen john fitzorton since the death of sir armine or the conspiracy of sir guise charles silently interpreted the interview partly to his delay in returning to the regiment and partly to disregard of the captains admonitions caroline knowing johns high sense of honor and insult had her silent fears also  while they were involved in the labyrinth of these conjectures the object of them appeared to the moment of his appointment and after a more respectful bow than it was his practice to give and which was a deference he paid sometimes to real misfortunes but never to the affectation of them nor indeed to false pretensions of any kind he desired to exchange a few words with mr stuart and they went out together  chapter xxxiii lieutenant said john i hate letterwriting  not the trouble but the vexatious inefficiency of it it multiplies words and embarrasses meaning to explain which we run into replies and rejoinders till we imperceptibly involve ourselves in a correspondence the chaos of obscurity is then complete i come therefore to answer your resignation personally i accept that resignation i think i should have acted as you have done in your situation you have done nothing to dishonor the commission you received but i do not see how you could have publicly held it to the satisfaction of your private feelings which are not only the best judges but the surest rewards and punishments of a mans actions  charless cheek began to glow  john paused and extended his hand which charles met half way  it would be tyranny continued john to impose on the son of the wretched and pestilent man who has contributed to murder my father any thing that has the air or weight of an obligation  o insupportable said charles stretching out both his arms to their utmost width as if to figure the immeasurable burden removing from his bosom  your lieutenancy is therefore elsewhere disposed proceeded john and of your fathers attempt on the sacred life of mine  but let me hurry from the dreadful circumstance alas not millions of such lives as  but i will not name him to you  could atone even for imagining the death of sir armine fitzorton why is there not a law my friend that the parent should consign to immediate death a thankless child and the dishonored child be the sanctioned executioner of an unnatural father  what less can expunge the spot which infamy entails on a family to all posterity ejaculated charles  posterity itself replied john and the example of children like my friend charles  but all that was in the power of sir guise has reluctantly been done this packet  here john took some papers from his pocket and desired charles would deposit them in his own  this packet will explain every thing i trust to your satisfaction because it is both to me and to you an act of justice and not of obligation i am as happily you suspect put by your own lips and from my own observation in the most secret sorrows of your heart they are profound  they are pitiable  but  they are not without a parallel  alas no said charles they find one no less bitter in the bosom of   charles was just about to pronounce the name of his sister when checking himself he left the sentence unfinished he thought it unnecessary to commit or involve caroline the knowledge of whose similar disappointments could lead to no good effect since like his own her passion was hopeless it was one of the maxims settled by johns noble disposition as a rule of conduct never to make a good mind betray itself nor if possible to suffer a bad one to escape its own snare in the latter case he would hurry on a rogue to confession of villainy by every terrifying power in the former he would prevent confession by all the kind interventions that offered he saw the worthy charles embarrassed and without pushing the generous soul into painful declaration or waiting to gratify curiosity he relieved him by saying yes dear charles they find another where possibly you little expected  in the bosom of a friend  even in him who now gives you the hand of sympathy said john  in yours exclaimed charles with all the emphasis of amazement  even so responded john you are amongst the number of those who impute to the coldness of my nature what proceeds from the vigor of my discipline imitate that vigor  emulate that discipline to such an end i disclose and confide it with you i have been for eleven years perhaps i am still as much devoted to olivia as yourself or as henry i now find is to caroline had i not discovered her affection for my brother henry i would have tried the fortune of my rougher heart or at least ruder manners and might possibly have been your rival but her whole soul was anticipated and had you my friend or had even an enemy of worth and honor preengaged it i would have acted as i have done  promoted her happiness with the object of her affection this my friend is not the sally of a hero but the common duty of an honest man for though it were to be wished she could have inspired the man of her choice with an equal passion she had better wed a man of honor whom she tenderly loves than one to whom she is wholly indifferent which must have been the case had she fallen to the lot of either you or me my friend to struggle honorably and silently continued john to convert unavailing hope and unwarranted jealousy into an honest endeavor to serve her with the man of her heart was all that remained  charles admitted the fact but gave a heavy sigh at the words wholly indifferent for though he knew these words described the truth of his own case and had resolved never to see olivia again he could not hear that truth without an uneasy sensation  any other conduct you are aware resumed john would have aggravated my disappointment and driven olivia to the necessity of refusing me the distress of which to her and the disgrace to me would have been equal  charles considered this inference as incontrovertible yet could not help thinking the worthy speaker more a hero than a lover  i therefore prosecuted my plan continued john  a severe system of selfdenial but do not think that i suffered less on that account i have an aversion to confidences in sorrow whether from pride or a better motive i know not but miserable feelings are best kept to ones self methinks though i will communicate matter that is comfortable with any man these remarks are superfluous as it is impossible either you or i can indulge a farther hope of olivia who is now little less than my brothers  wife  betwixt the utterance of the words brother and wife there was a long line of circumvallation drawn by johns heart which now began visibly to sound the alarm  ah my friend ejaculated he that henry were as sensible to her merits as either you or i  but she cannot make him miserable alas if she should in the end be so herself that would be a hard stroke on us both john took out his handkerchief and applied it to that part of his face which demanded it not violently protesting at the same time that the cold in his head  then first discovered  almost distracted him  as  i  say  as continued john excuse me charles  i am as you must perceive getting quite hoarse  i shall not be able to speak  in short let us remember  let us never forget  let us have it eternally in recollection  in short you see clearly    i do alas i do most clearly said charles  these keen easterly winds my friend force the water from ones eyes exclaimed john  charles looking on the weathercock of the chapel which stood opposite to the spot where they discoursed and seeing it point due west whispered to his own heart that john was no more of a philosopher than himself  but john tried again  let us remember taking charles by the hand that we are brothersufferers  brothersoldiers  and men of honor you see how i bear it my friend  bear it as    three hems  ending in as many coughs  could not stifle johns sensations for the tears as if in perfect despite of his efforts to conceal them streamed along his face and it was in vain that he pretended in this extremity to substitute a weakness in the eyes as the cause of that effusion which flowed from the tenderness of his heart perceiving this  behold said he one of the many curses of what is called social sorrow i have had ten thousand of these momentary infirmities in my solitary walks  in my chamber  in my tent  and even in the field of battle where public duty prevented private observation yet still it was an affair of the secret heart that involved none but myself and did not expose the mind that agonized not that i ought to be ashamed of it continued john resuming himself for with this hand will i give away at the altar that of olivia to him only whom she can love and in order my friend to prove that you and i love her still love her as we ought to do let us take every opportunity to make her husband    john declared a fly had got into his throat  her husband as proud of  of  of pos  pos  possessing her    the fly had somehow leapt from his throat again into his eyes  as  happy i say as  had it pleased heaven to have inclined her heart to either of us  we  should have been    the latter part of this sentence in point of tone and emphasis was many degrees lower than the former one was in unison with the loftiest sentiment of the human mind the other attuned to the trembling vibrations of the human heart but it was the same noble composition of nature in all her grand and tender movements  john rallied and was reassuming the philosopher when observing charles shake his head i will yield the point exclaimed john  answering to that significant shake we have talked each other into this condition another blessed effect of confidence i told you what would come of it i protest to you charles more words have been wasted and more weakness displayed in this short interview than in my eleven years of silent forbearance and yet i confided only that you might not think your sufferings and situation unexampled you are right my friend this is no moment to be magnanimous yet our being men of sensibility involved in similar disappointment prevents not our being men of honor we are in possession of each others misfortune and may secretly resort to one another for support and sympathy should the approaching event require greater strength than our own  john perceived that charless heart was full but his arms open he run into those with an ardency that was returned with an ingenuous zeal the friends then bade each other farewell john hastened back to the castle first assuring charles that he had but half performed his errand and that he should see him and his party again on some momentous business he could not then stay to impart  noble highfeeling and highthoughted man said charles apostrophizing in soliloquy as he passed on what a moment has he chosen for the discovery he knew my domestic sorrows to be deep and mighty the ruins of my fortune to be complete the disgrace of my family to be desolating  and the agonies of my heart to swell almost to bursting then then it was that he came to separate the sufferer from the offender to embrace me as an unfortunate friend show me that we were involved in one common calamity and taught me to bear it  not by the stubborn example of the cynics virtue which is but another word for affectation or stupidity but by convincing me he struggled with a disappointment mighty as my own  chapter xxxv from the time that john fitzorton had received the resignation of the lieutenancy he was truly anxious to atone for the loss which that unfortunate young soldier whom he at once loved and pitied sustained by an action which he felt to be the consequence of a brave delicate and independent spirit and on conversing with henry he found his brother officer laboring under the various ills and injuries which charles himself recapitulated in this soliloquy john therefore without wasting time or words in barren and ostentatious compassion or speaking to henry a single word about tender disappointments seriously although silently meditated how he might essentially serve this young man and his no less meritorious no less suffering sister  indeed his attachment to their virtues had all along been as sincere as the detestation he had borne to the vices of their father nor had any insults which he had himself sustained from the one the power to affect his unprejudiced and clearjudging mind from what was due to the others not even the outrage of sir guise at adsell forest shook his impartiality although the interdicted particulars of that outrage all fatal as they were had come to his knowledge no immediate opportunity however presented itself it was a point of delicacy and difficulty and john not only rejected confidence in his sorrows but his benevolence whenever it could possibly be avoided and till the hour of giving them effect his most generous designs lay hid in his bosom but the miscarriage of one two three or threeandtwenty efforts did not discourage him from going on till he succeeded his maxim then was to impart the rise and progress of his lucky endeavors considering the rest as irrelevant he would however much oftener present the happy piece of fortune he had procured to the person deserving it without annexing to it any history at all which he usually considered as a bait for applause on which he looked down with all the pride of a magnificent spirit  several days elapsed before john could satisfy himself as to the mode of redressing the grievances of his two friends at the chapelhouse although he was early determined that the chief author of the calamity should be instrumental in its relief  at length an accident brought about without any difficulty what had cost the persevering john so much labor in thought and so much of that labor in vain  the history must look back a little our companions in this work will not have forgotten that the person fixed on by john to carry his billet to charles was true george  that faithful fellow who had in his heart the very simplicity and sincerity of goodness was accessory to the prosperity which was now about to gild the chapelhouse he had with unspeakable assiduity sought to wean the affections of jenny atwood from the unworthy object who too long possessed them and place them in his own honest bosom and though he made slow progress he had begun an impression the first visible mark of which was her suffering him to mention the baronets name with a part of the indignation it deserved  indeed the vile and abject spirit of her quondam lover manifested both before and after the assassinationscheme the base injustice practiced against the respectable fitzortons and his own children and more especially the marriage with mrs tempest and which was not like poor janes a mock but bona fide a real wedding after a time worked together for georges good she began to find a kind of relief in his company which had before been burdensome she suffered his little attentions which formerly she had declared were intolerable and always in possession of her good will and esteem for his virtues she by degrees and insensibly encouraged his flame not that she could yet be said to return his love  she had still a child which had been the fruit of her former illrequited and unfortunate passion and by that tenure the faithless seducer had some hold on her maternal sensibility yet she was pleased to merit the daily increasing tenderness of a worthy man  one evening as george returned from an errand his master henry had sent him on jenny perceived his eyes were filled with tears which he in vain attempted to conceal what is the matter george said she in a voice softer than she had ever before addressed him putting her handkerchief at the same time up to his face unable to make any reply he sat for some moments rocking himself in a chair and then broke forth into the following exclamation interrupted by a torrent of grief which had its fountain in his generous heart i do not like mrs jenny to bring up the name of that sir  somebody in your hearing because i would not have you think i disparage him to make you have a better liking to me but i would not have what he did no longer ago than yesterday to answer for if i might have the whole world no not to have you  yesterday repeated jenny  but i may as well speak of it as another said george the unnatural  gentleman  no sooner brought home the madam whom he had married than he picked a quarrel with the poor lieutenant and miss stuart and turned them out of doors and the worthy popish doctor you have heard so much of took them into his little chapelhouse where they now are almost distracted for thus runs the rumor in the parish  the hardhearted  person continued george still sinking the name even refused sending their wearing apparel this also was reported and if it had not been proceeded george for my master and good mr dennison they might have wanted a morsel of bread  morsel of bread said jenny gracious god  why have not they  00l ayear each left to them by sir marmaduke stuart their relation in the west indies  not they poor souls nor five hundred farthings and as for sir marmaduke i never heard of him before nor i dont believe they either i thought my master henry would have gone raving distracted mad while he was speaking of them though i found thank god he did not know the worst which you may be sure mrs jenny  i wish i might call you jane as i find sir  somebody called you mrs jenny  i did not i say tell my master the worst and so poor gentleman he got up into his own chamber that none of the family might see the trouble he was in  ah jenny  i thought you were to call me jane mr george sighed she  thank ye mrs jane answered george bowing ah dear mrs jane there is a great deal of trouble that nobody but god almighty sees  and mr henry is a great sufferer for all he is so kind spoken george said his honor to me is the door fast i went and locked it trembling all the way but saying never a word  george if you would save me from dipping my hands in blood  in the blood of sir guise stuart  take this purse and give it to old dennison whom you will find at the chapelhouse and for your life speak not a word either to charles or caroline as he pronounced these names i thought his heart would have broke  speak not a syllable to any body george well i was at the chapelhouse and back almost directly and by good luck only saw mr dennison  though he looked almost as bad as my master i did not open my lips but mr dennison whispered  he feared it was all over with his young master and mistress  you astonish me said jane more and more at every word certainly unless sir marmadukes will is good for nothing by there being one of a later date the son and daughter of a  a  certain person are in possession of  00l a year each  for i saw the will with my own eyes but in the calamities that fell so thick on each other about that time perhaps sir  sir  guise forgot the circumstance  what circumstance demanded george eagerly  why the will i just now spoke of and if it be so how fortunate shall i think myself in not having destroyed or lost it and you must know my good george that while i was living  alas i then thought as innocently as happily  in london i had occasion to look into a kind of traveling chest which belonged to sir guise and which mr valentine miless man brought saying it was full of old papers it must be put into a careful place as some of the papers might be of consequence and were to be sorted and i remember on the afternoon mr dabble the attorney had settled some law business i observed sir guise throw several packets into that chest telling me he would have a fire lighted the next time he came and could spare an hour to overlook and burn most of that trumpery but this was forgotten and as the baronet was then in a great hurry to go out the key was forgot also which i myself put into my pocket with an intention to give it sir guise the next time he came but it went out of my head and as the lodgings were scanty of drawers and such conveniences i put into it any thing that would otherwise have laid littering about in tumbling over these i misplaced some of the papers which sir guise had thrown in for burning and was struck with these words on the back of one of them copy of sir marmadukes will i dont know what possessed me to look into it and though i could not very well make it out i read sufficient to see it was much in favor of the baronets children  but you have got the papers yet you say cried george with the blessing of god we may still recover their property i have a thought mrs jane you must be ruled by me  if no harm is intended sir guise who i am sure cannot be to blame in this i consent george exclaimed she  i dare not tell my master mr henry fitzorton of this because i know the consequence but you must let me mention it to his brother mr sir john   so he usually called him since sir armines death mr sir john said he is as firm as a rock and as stouthearted as a lion yet goes quietly about a thing  do any thing you like said the agitated girl so as you rescue the poor injured creatures rights though i fear it is too late only do not let any harm come to sir guise who was made to do whatever those lawyers thought proper if any body has been to blame in this affair it rests with me in not speaking of it before which was only from thinking it of no consequence for i recollect once mentioning it to sir guise who said the business was taken care of and i dare say he thought so not that i pretend to understand these matters nor i suppose he neither  may be so cried george but i know who does as well as any lawyer in the land so do you go and get the papers ready dear mrs jane and leave the rest to me but not a word to any living soul and as to harm  god help us we only want to do what is right and would not wrong any body  chapter xxxv this affectionate conduct on the part of george during the disclosure of a history from which reproaches were expected won extremely on the grateful heart of the timid jane atwood who on taking leave recompensed him with a look that richly paid the cordial he had bestowed on her wounded spirit and this was the first moment he dared to tell himself  i am not indifferent to her  but the history and the historian as well as the new sensation which filled his heart did not allow of his going to sleep or even to bed the morning beginning to dawn he waited johns hour of rising with the utmost impatience at length it came and as john had past the night in fruitless meditations upon the mode of extorting some provision for poor charles and his sister out of the fathers daily dissipated finances it was the crisis most favorable to the tidings that the worthy domestic had to communicate to render all things pliant john weary with cogitations adopting an idea this minute and rejecting it the next had left his chamber at sunrise and taken a meditative walk round a shrubbery that was fenced in by the park paling on one side and by a quickset of hawthorns on the other running about a mile circularly from each wing of the house  george triumphed in this opportunity and desired permission to unfold to his honor a scene of villainy as bad as that of guy faukes  seeing it was against one of the best young gentlemen and gentlewomen in the country aye in the world  captain and miss stuart  a man already debating on a subject which interests his affections eagerly catches at every thing that applies john  we should ere this have marked his right of inheritance by calling him sir john but that in his strong way he forbid every one of the family to use any title that reminded them or him of so irreparable a loss as the death of sir armine fitzorton and whenever any one annexed to his name the title which that loss conferred on him he would check the observance of that mark of respect with as stern a frown as newmade honourables generally give to those who presume to neglect it but the dignity of john fitzorton depended on nothing external  he ordered george to follow him into a summer house at the south corner of the shrubbery where the subsequent discourse passed between them  relate every circumstance george  only your honor will take it into consideration that poor mrs jane atwood who is the cause of the plot being discovered comes to no harm but indeed your honor will see she deserves none and i have passed my word before god and mrs jane that should sir guise stuart be found to have any hand in the matter not to peach so as to get him hanged as to be sure he ought to have been long agone  john nodded assent george related all that jane had told him about the will saying at the close of his narrative i am glad at heart to see your honor takes it so well i knew you would not fly out into hurryscurry  lord love his honor  as mr henry would  but take your measures to get back what belongs to poor captain and miss caroline more coolly and cunningly ant please your honor and it was therefore i thought to myself says i george you had better tell squire sir john than squire henry about this will and as to my jane  that is  our jane atwood  i have done jennying her by permission  your honor sees she is as harmless in the affair as the newborn baby and perhaps so is sir guise but if it had not been for jane the thing might have been smushed up for ever  at least in this world  john did not interrupt this story by a single question what george called taking it so well arose from the magnitude of the emotion at some passages in the narrative torrents of blood rushed into his cheeks which the next moment were left of as deathlike a pale as if there had not been one drop of that blood remaining in his body he threw open the window and thrust his head out for air  a common habit with him in desperate cases  and left it open till he was as often obliged to shut it his teeth chattering and his hands shaking as if the chills of death had come suddenly upon him at length collecting all his powers of selfcontrollment he conferred an unusual mark of distinction on george whom he shook by the hand  an honor never before granted to any domestic for though he was kind considerate and even bountiful to servants his favors were always bestowed as if they came from the hand of a master of which character he never lost the distinction or the awe  henry on the other hand was apt to condescend a little too much it produced affection but it sometimes engendered also undue familiarity and relaxed the wellpoised authority so necessary to be preserved inviolate but george had a disposition not to be spoiled by any extremes of behavior and was a rare example  amongst tens of thousands which form the rule of subordinate pride folly and ingratitude  how far the enriching hand of simple nature can store the heart with the principles of humility honor and goodness not to be shaken by any interest nor corrupted by any examples  i am going to my chamber george said john follow me thither when you have got the papers you speak of tell jane atwood she ought to love and honor true george and do you and she guard every syllable that respects this will in your own bosoms for on that silence depend not only my good opinion but possibly the lives of many here  and elsewhere  lives cried george lord help  well your honor but dont forget i have passed my word for sir guises  there was in johns speech or in the manner of uttering it something so affecting to true george that he bowed and looked looked and bowed himself out of the room silent obedience however in servants was ever a charm in the eyes of john  but jane atwoods lover did not suffer even love itself to delay carrying the bundle of papers she gave him but still with the injunctions as to sir guise  john received them graciously and retiring to his chamber dropped the bolt of his door and sat down with a palpitating heart to examine these eventful materials in the heat of the perusal the breakfast summons was rather abruptly given by olivias footman puppy exclaimed john get down stairs tell them i shall not leave this room till dinner dinnertime came and henry himself ventured a tap at the door if you disturb me henry quoth john i protest i will break in upon your muse and frighten her away when she is inspiring you with happy thoughts i shall be busy all day perhaps all night and as to eating i shall not starve depend upon it i have a room full of food both for body and soul so leave me to my repast and go quietly to yours  henry withdrew and as he rejoined the family he applied the wellknown words of king richard  he is not in the vein and we must not disturb him till the fit is over  chapter xxxvi nothing surely but the designation of that providence which gives to its direction the form of casualty could make the timid and apprehensive sir guise stuart either so negligent or so forgetful as to leave the credentials of his intended fraud  for we will ease the reader so far as to tell him it had not been completely perpetrated  upon his children to the mercy of whomsoever might find them but thus it is that the crafty is entrapped by his own snare thus too is there often to be seen even in this world in earnest of that which is to come a just distribution of punishments and rewards  from the written testimonies it appeared that sir marmaduke stuart a first cousin to sir guise had made a will though sir guise had given out he died intestate in consequence of which sir guise being heir at law took possession of his property which though not very considerable was sufficient to discharge the testators debts and answer the several bequests amongst which were lifeannuities to the children of sir guise of five hundred pounds each to be paid into a certain specified government fund one twelvemonth and a day after his decease and the interest to accumulate until the parties came of age but both interest and principal to be delivered up at their arriving at that period it was likewise manifest that this will had been duly executed but the signatures were torn off and sir guise made up his conscience to the enjoying the fruit of his deceit but unluckily for the baronet sir marmadukes solicitor who was obliged to go suddenly and take possession of some property in the west indies where he afterward established sent over to sir guise a second will the date of which revoked all others and in this decisive one charles and caroline were mentioned with no less marks of distinction before however the end of the same year an account arrived from jamaica of the attorneys death an event which still promised secresy to the designs of sir guise who finding his own estates begin to ebb apace felt a strong propensity to supply them from sir marmadukes reservoir to which end he still gave out to his son and daughter that they had not been remembered  he supposed because sir marmaduke knew the property would devolve to them as effectually after their tender fathers death as if it had been devised charles and caroline being then very young and very generous and of course very unsuspecting rested satisfied with this account and taking its truth for granted never renewed or perhaps never thought on the subject they had never seen sir marmaduke who chiefly lived abroad and left so large a portion of his fortune to his cousins children merely because he did not wish to give it out of the family and yet did not choose to bequeath it to sir guise whom he never esteemed and to whom he left only fifty pounds with these remarkable words  i give and bequeath the sum of fifty pounds to my kinsman sir guise stuart in token of my contempt this mark of ignominy however sir guise pocketed as he did every other affront even when it was not gilded like the present matters remained in this undivulged way to the infinite content of sir guise till he discovered that at the time the attorney sent over to him a copy of the will the original sent by the same conveyance had been deposited in doctors commons but which sir guise was informed had been destroyed this thundering intelligence arrived at the time of the baronets maturest aversion to the first lady stuart and to caroline and when his affections to charles were in the decline all these were motives to run any hazards rather than make a confession of the fact to the parties concerned but there was yet a more important inducement to hush up the business we must make a short digression to state the nature of it  the finances of sir guise had even then been some time under the pupillage of mrs tempest and her paramour miles the baronets unconquerable love of the dice and his complete ignorance with their consummate skill gave them both the best pretense of plundering him in an honorable way one fatal evening therefore when he was literally stripped even from his diamond shirtbuckle to his watch and downward to his shoebuckles at a friendly party composed of mrs tempest valentine miles a common companion of theirs and himself he grew frantic with his ill luck and execrating fortune resolved on complete redemption or utter ruin at a stroke mrs tempest had in a few hours won several thousand pounds valentine no less the friend abovementioned whom mrs tempest called cousin had singly netted a draft for  000 l claret burgundy champaigne and last of all imperial tokay had been called in to support the drooping heart aching head and trembling hand the disappointed rage of sir guise till it was put to flight by fear was always phrenzy without the inflammations of the bottle but these being adjoined raving madness is a phrase somewhat too temperate to express the nondescript distraction of this memorable hour he overset the dicetable threw one of the boxes into the fire tore and stamped upon some of the cards gnashed others between his teeth piled one chair upon another slapped his forehead and at length being worked up to the proper ferment he leaped upon the table and proposed double or quits damnation i insist on restitution or ruin the bet was taken amounting to a sum of forty thousand pounds which had been the aggregate winnings of the friendly trio during the night the ignorance and insanity of sir guise had no chance with the dexterity and double dealings of three expert gamblers he soon rose therefore the above sum worse for that single throw and at one sitting became debtor to the three friends in the sum of eighty thousand pounds  sir guise now declared himself a ruined man and muttered something about packed cards and loaded dice whereupon valentine mills strutted up to him assuming the man of nice honor and insisted on satisfaction the bodily fear of sir guise always brought him to his senses whether he was deliriously intoxicated with wine or losses or insults in a tone wholly altered he declared he had been strangely misconceived but it was plaguey hard to have such a cursed run in one night mrs tempest said she was sure her dear baronet meant nothing personal the friend protested for his part he thought people in luck ought to do an handsome thing to the losing party swearing that he would accept only sir guises note at his own time for ten thousand and cry quits the cue was no sooner given than the other performers acted their parts to perfection miles asseverated that he had as great a regard for sir guise as for any man in the world and would let him off easily and i will answer for the ladys liberality aye he knows my weak part too well sighed mrs tempest do what you will with me gentlemen answered the baronet if you think fit to save me from ruin it is more than i deserve thus they parted and the next day sir guise being wholly out of cash as the trio very well knew a mortgage was given on the abbey estate for ten thousand pound to the friend and the foundation was laid for the approbation and sale of poor charles and carolines annuities to satisfy the two other moderate claims of mrs tempest and her valentine  versatile to the numberless meanders of the town mr miles soon adjusted the sale of the property in mr dabble the man in the world to make or mar a thousand last wills and testaments the subsequent curious epistle which fell into johns possession will give the reader a happy specimen of that gentlemans creative

dealer and looks close parties to represent annuitants should be healthy constitution price according affidavits certificates etc etc ready at a moments warning  at the finishing of this eloquent morsel which was amongst the papers delivered by jane atwood john worked the letter into a twist in his clenched hand precisely as he would have twisted the neck of the writer had he been present and then personifying the innocent paper bestowed upon it all those opprobrious names which were due to mr nicholas dabble but of which the said paper was to the full as sensible in point of conscience as the aforesaid nicholas who had lived in the city of london a practicing doer of all dirty works eight and thirtyyears without once committing an action even by mistake which did not deserve the halter he had been the bosom friend of mr miles and mrs tempest half their lives during which time he had got both of them out of as many hangworthy escapes as he had got every person they connected with into them and indeed few judges had ordered more guilty persons from the prison to the gallows than nicholas had prepared innocent ones for both but as mr dabble will turn out by no means like one of those heroes who strut their hour upon the stage and then are heard no more we will reserve what may further be proper to say of him to his second appearance convinced that his first has fixed an impression of his character in the mind of the reader not speedily to be effaced  john soon recollecting himself deemed the epistolary philippic of this prostitutor of the law of too high value to destroy and therefore rescued it almost griped asunder to as nearly its pristine state as he could in the consolatory hope that like the handwriting on the wall it might one day be given in evidence against the author meanwhile he carefully folded it up and having sat a full hour in the profound thought that usually preceded his deeds of moment he rose from his chair indignant and determined his plan was mature and he lost not an instant in its execution  chapter xxxvii by a perseverance which uneasiness of mind rather rendered more intense than obstructed john had by this time secured his seat in parliament where the independent display of his talents and principles had gained him the respect of all parties as his attention to military duty at home and abroad had rendered him honorable in the opinion of friends and enemies but in the intervals of peace it was always a lucky circumstance to favor any of johns secret maneuvers or in retreating from any chagrin or bosom service at the castle to gain the regiment and whenever the colonel the colonels horse or groom were not to be found which was often the case it was concluded he was gone to quarters and when his own servant was indisposed he would without ceremony borrow true george from henry for an hour a day or a week for instance the colonels servants being otherwise employed or thought less proper for the business george was now ordered to have horses saddled at five the next morning the colonel only saying to him overnight you must leave your master aye and your mistress too george to accompany me at five tomorrow on the matter we spoke about in the summer house george bounded rather than ran out of the room and on that occasion would have left even the arms of his jane had they been enfolding him in the bridal hour punctual as lovers to the moment sworn therefore john fitzorton and true george kept their assignation in the stable the morning was heavy with clouds which as the colonel mounted his steed broke in deluges of rain neither of our heroes appeared at all disposed to advert to the circumstance nor indeed to be sensible of it the tempest in their minds as the great dramatic delineator says took from them all feeling else they had cleared the park and got about a mile on the road when george recollected that the colonels great coat was belted to his back and the colonel so far from feeling the want of it was jogging on at a gentle trot with his eyes fixed on the pummel of the saddle as if he were counting the drops that fell from the spout of his hat which having the cock military filled like a reservoir and from the downward bend of his head flowed like a fountain  george however having unbuckled the great coat rode up to the side of john fitzorton but seeing his position for george critically understood all the family attitudes he feared to interrupt his mind by an unseasonable care of his body which he knew was always secondary in colonel sir johns cogibundusses after due deliberation therefore what in so difficult a case was proper to be done he passed by john a sew paces holding the great coat at arms length so that it might strike in the most favorable point of view and thereby recommend itself but this not succeeding and the shower not only increasing but driving with the wind full in their faces george drew in his own steed and gently threw the coat on johns shoulders this arousing the latter who had been all that time making sir guise his new married lady her gallant mr miles their agent mr nick dabble and even the purchaser of annuities dance the tight rope from one scaffold had the desired effect the colonel throwing the bridle on his horses neck took up the great coat and put it on slightly saying to george who stood at the horses head and i advise you to follow the example which the obedient george would certainly have taken even had the dogstar raged  so implicit was he as to the word of command  but for a trifling impediment  that is to say he had no great coat to put on for when he unbuckled johns he forgot to save his own which therefore dropped for the use of the next traveller who might wish for such a convenience upon this discovery however george contented his honest heart with gently condemning and striking his own head kept his station behind and only said to himself what a silly simon it is well it was not mr sir johns though  the colonel pushed on much increasing his pace  not because the morning continued showery but because he had perhaps satisfied his imagination with seeing the parties swing their hour in his fancy and he seemed ridingpost to take the news to his friends the colonel and his attendant had traveled upwards of twentyfour miles ere george had hazarded a conjecture where they might be going for john had not said a syllable as to that particular nor indeed would george have made an inquiry had he been journeying to the worlds end but that feeling a misgiving they were wrong he supposed matters had better be set right he conceived john was at least twoandtwenty miles out of the road he was therefore on the very rim of a question the rarest of all things with george when john pulling in his steed signified his intention to stop at the next market town and if the weather did not clear go post the rest of the way for added he i am as i suppose you may guess going to mr partingtons  bless us your honor replied george i wish i had known that before because i could have gone several miles nearer across the country we should have left the london road which your honor knows we are still upon at the two milestone and gone over the heaths and pray how happens it thou art so well acquainted with this road interrogated john it is quite out of henrys beat prosaic or poetical and partington is but recently settled in these parts  your honor knows i have been backwards and forwards on one business or the other ever since    ever since  jenny atwoods father i suppose was put by partington into a farm in his neighborhood hey george what you went for his vote and interest i suppose george blushed and took in a copious mouthful of rain he then said we must now go right an end please your honor then take the road slipside of the town which will bring us to  to the farmers your honor while george was accurately describing the geography of the road to partingtons a man on horseback rode by at a full trot when george immediately exclaimed  your honor there is my great coat if your honor will give me leave i will have it off that fellows back in a jiffy  john assenting to this the dripping george gallopped after the man who believing himself pursued and whose horse having the speed of georges would perhaps have escaped with the surtout after all had not some little altercation at the turnpike taken place and occasioned a delay which brought the pursuer near enough to catch the arm of the man pursued and to say  this is mine sir i will make affidavy of it before a justice of peace and there is one just behind who is asquire and a barrow night and a colonel and a parliament man at the same time and who knows the coat as well as i do the word justice sounded more ominously in the ears of the party accused than all the other titles of his worship had they outpedigreed cadwallader he therefore owned the fact saying though i found it in the kings highway friend and could therefore keep it by law i will surrender it if the pikeman will open the gate and let me through as i am in a very great hurry this haste produced a suspicion in the mind of the tollreceiver who swore he would detain him as a thief on his own confession the goods being found upon him and as to your finding a good great coat on the road such a morning as this said the man sneeringly it is a likely story indeed seeing that there is not such a ninny in the world to throw away the best friend to a mans back in such a ducibus of a day as here is for the proof of which assertion he appealed to george himself putting it to him whether such a nincompoop ignoramus was ever known in king georges dominions he then added i suppose young man this fellow has robbed both you and your master  i believe said george he might find it for i was fool enough to let it drop but still it is my coat and i must have it all this time the stranger resisted for fear of some worse discovery and while he was laboring to muffle up his face in the said coat which had now become necessary as a disguise george labored to uncase him assisted by the tollman and indeed by his wife who now came forth from the turnpikehouse half undressed to see what was the matter these contentions gave john time to come up and he gained the scene of action just as the victorious george had unhooded his antagonist  a victory which unfolded to the view of the company the illustrious mr david otley late as the reader remembers a faithful domestic in the clare and now a no less worthy confident in the stuart family at the sight of john fitzorton his usual presence of mind which in a case of stratagem was scarcely inferior to that of the swedish monarch wholly forsook him and he fell upon his knees assuring every one present that  though he knew he was a very infamous rascal greater rascals than he had made him so and particularly the love of gold the root of all evil and which he verily thought was the greatest rascalmaker in the world and would sooner or later bring him  a number of his friends to the gallows old t indeed your honor my conscience has  done what i thought would never come to pass worked a miracle upon me for i am now running away from the abbey and going to london to repent  john could scarcely help unbending his muscles braced up as they had long been to thoughts of vengeance and indeed he almost smiled at the place which otley had chosen for the scene of his reformation however commanding george to take his property the youth had no sooner obeyed than feeling something hard and heavy in the pockets he took out from thence a brace of pistols which in an instant george discovered to be loaded  as our pistols your honor are in their cases on the saddles these cannot be they said george significantly  and are these the books sirrah from which you study the art of penitence questioned the colonel sternly tie him on the horse george and bring him away  janes lover performed this with surprising agility he belted him with the strap  had before bound the very great coat  to his discovery then threw him on his back over the horses shoulders and getting up before him trotted off with him calffashion with as much ease as if he had been carrying his masters portmanteau  the turnpikeman who was an arch fellow and a great lover of seeing thieves taken tried and executed begged a holiday of his wife  now do oblige me my dear love by letting one of your pretty eyes look to the gate and your two pretty hands take the toll just while i see this gentleman limbod it is for the good of my country to lend a lift to hang off its rogues and next to you i love my country you know  the wife pleased with the wording of her husbands petition charitably and lovingly replied well  but mind you bring me back news the fellow is to be hanged at our next sises because then i shall have a gossiping as well as you and limping beck will see to the gate and i know husband that is a villain because the young man says he went from squire clares family to that of sir guise we know old devilcome guise of old  thus authorized the turnpikeman jumping up behind george reached his colonel and the town which was but a short mile from the turnpike at the same time they stopped at the sign which bore the name of george with the addition of saint for the prowess of conquering the dragon but perhaps the reader will presently be of opinion as great honors ought to be adjudged to our modern george for his achievements in bringing to condign punishment an animal more baneful to society than the dragon which fable asserts or all the actual wild beasts of the earth for what troop of them can cause half the mischief that has often been produced by one dishonest man  the culprit being unbound to observe which a greater concourse of spectators had gathered than suited the colonels purpose he took in his hand otleys pistols and went with him into a room and sat on him in his judicial capacity as successor by right of eldership as well as nomination in the commission of the peace assuming therefore his terrible graces he told david in a very succinct manner that he was apprised of enough of his villainy as well as that of his employers to hang the whole gang but as you know me otley said john few words are necessary answer then the questions i shall put to you  first whither are you going  to london sir as i hope to be spared answered the trembler  to london for what  to  to  to    have a care if your affectation of penitence was not in itself an ample ground of my suspicion the thorough knowledge of you and your associates warrants my insisting upon  sir your honor i see knows me as well as i know myself interrupted the quivering wretch i am only going sir  am going a going  i am going ant please your honor  i am only going   where rascal  to town on a little business to sir guise and mr miless attorney sir  his attorney exclaimed john staring wildly what is that attorneys name sirrah  his name ant please your honor  his name is  that is to say the name he does business in is  is   is what abominable caitiff questioned the terrible john losing all temper the name he does some of his businesses in please your hon  hon  hon  hon  our replied otley cutting the word exactly in twain between his chattering teeth is n d which means nic dabble please your honor but his real name i have heard say is    perdition on his real name that in which he cheats heirs at law out of their estates is sufficient for me  the aliass under which he will be hanged are immaterial said john  oh lord lord your honor save me i am but a servant a secondhanded little personage as it were and obliged to do as i am bid but i see your honor knows all yes i see i shall suffer yet i told myself so years agone both at the manorhouse and castle david said i depend upon it my friend the abbey will sooner or later take you to tyburn  the abbey for once told truth said john  here david dropped on his knees imploring mercy and protesting he would from that moment be an honest man and give instant proof of it by peaching his master mistress and miles and the lawyer and his clerk and in short bring all their necks into the noose if his worship would but promise to let his own slip out of it  john instead of making any promise held one of the pistols to each ear of the miserable petitioner till he confessed that he was going to mr dabbles chambers to meet the family  what family interposed john  sir guise and the new lady stuart and mr miles your honor will be there presently having set off before daylight from the abbey only they come into the open road by back ways and are going to settle some little affair with a gentleman who lives in this very place and then for london to mr dabbles and  and there has been a  a  a  a    what said john in thundering accents a little bit of a rumbustion at the abbey and mr dabble is to commodate  he is a vast commodater your worship  and i am a party  something about a little bit of an affair of honor between mr miles and my lady  and this  this  is the whole truth as we are all wicked sinners an please your worshipful merciful honor  what further questions john would have put to the captive is uncertain for true george tapped at the door of the chamber of examination and speaking through the keyhole said the mob was so great they would not leave the innyard till they knew what was to be done with the rogue john by the same mode of communication desired them to be told that the man had given satisfactory answers to all his questions and that as the great coat had been actually found and restored the prisoner must be acquitted in case he cleared up some other points for which he must proceed with him to london the multitude though they appeared much discontented with these tidings dispersed lest they themselves should become responsible to justice the turnpikeman in particular was mortified and began to fear it was decreed for him to return home to his wife without his welcome having pledged himself at parting to bring the good news she expected as to the thiefs being committed to prison and in a fair way of the gallows and indeed several of the mob now shifted their censure from the thief to the justice whom in a general muttering they accused of undue severity in taking a poor honest man up and packing him upon a horse as if he was a beast nay one of the byestanders observed that justices of the peace ought to be sure what they are about before they go such lengths otherwise nobody is safe said he addressing those nearest to him and you or i may be clapped into prison when we are as innocent as the child unborn and as to the coats being dropped  i dont doubt but that was designed as a trick upon travelers all done for the purpose i have been in the law myself and wish every gentleman of the faculty  you mean of the profession perhaps said his nexthand neighbor well resumed the other it is the same thing faculty or profession in the greek and i say again what i meant to say before  i wish all gentlemen were of my opinion then somebody would be ducked or so for trying to make rogues of honest men  justice or no justice george who though in regard to his own interests he was the most peaceable young fellow in the world had a spirit of vindictive fire that mounted into flame the moment any of his masters friends or favorites were accused having heard therefore these reflections on justice he caught hold of the professional gentleman of the faculty swearing that his master was the best justice in all the country as well as one of the best men in all the world and if every man had his deserts he did not doubt but the rascal that dared to say any thing to the contrary ought to swing under the gallows my masters name the justice of peace now in that room cried george aloud and with triumph is colonel mr sir john fitzorton who is the son of sir armine fitzorton and shall such a fellow as this here that i am shaking by the collar and who i dare say is no more a lawyer than i am  shall the son i say of sir armine  several of the populace to whom the name of sir armine was not only known but held in reverence would not permit george to finish what he intended to say but levelling their resentment at its proper mark they took the accuser of justice from the grasp of george into their own hands and were proceeding with him to a copious pond at the bottom of the inn backyard when a female voice exclaimed stop stop thief  there is my handkerchief sticking out of the corner of that mans pocket  give it me gentlemen  i will swear to my property this exclamation produced a search the consequence of which was a redemption not only of the handkerchief in question but of several others all of which were owned by different claimants amongst whom was george himself who said he would swear to a silk india handkerchief which the thief had thrust into his bosom it is marked in the corner exclaimed george vehemently with j a and i would not take all the handkerchiefs that ever was born for it indeed it was that which jane atwood had with her own fair hand tied round his neck the very morning before he set out on the present expedition in our haste to prepare for which we forgot to tell the reader this affectionate girl had risen notwithstanding the unseasonableness of the hour to make george for whom her regard grew apace a comforting dish of tea before he went into the cold air  the worthy gentleman whose morality touching the subject of justice had been so violent turned out a pickpocket and as the reader will perhaps hereafter be of opinion something worse thus there was fresh business for justice john before whom instead of the horsepond it was thought expedient to secure the arraigner of rash justices of the peace with all his credentials of moral sentiment about him save and except that precious mark of janes attachment which george declared he would show to the justice himself but that he would not let it be polluted by touching such a fellows neck  chapter xxxviii the clamor in the yard had induced john to open the door first commanding the stilltrembling otley on pain of death neither to speak or stir in less than two minutes the room of justice was filled with people of all descriptions  the two prisoners that is to say mr david otley and the pickpocket moralist no sooner saw each other than in despite of the penitence of the one and the morality of the other an involuntary recognition took place in a very curious way  to wit in a determination not to own each other but the struggle on either side to effect the concealment produced the discovery a discovery dear reader of their being not only brothers in iniquity according to the vulgar but expressive phrase but brothers in blood it is a nice point in feeling and certainly a desperate case in politics when two such personages are by a sudden and unthoughtof rencontre so thoroughly ashamed of their relationship that each deeming the other the greater scoundrel both resolve on disavowal nature however sometimes seizes upon men unawares to the total overthrow of their bestconcerted designs  now the discovery of brotherhood in the case of the otleys was a stroke of that absolute nature treated of by john himself in one of the fitzorton conversations and of nature too in one of her most determined moments to prove nearness of kin after john had heard the depositions of several of the witnesses with georges account of the theft of jane atwoods handkerchief about which george still stormed like another othello the justice was struck with something very particular in the behavior of his two criminals who happening to stand parallel to each other were biting their lips gnashing their teeth and making many other grimaces which they supposed were not noticed for hitherto the noise and confusion of relating the thefts and of asserting claim to the several properties were favorable to such deportment at length being perplexed in the extreme by this demonstration of vengeance in dumb show the moralist exasperated probably by some gesture in the penitent too provoking to be borne broke through the laws of pantomime by exclaiming  what brother davy you scoundrel are you unhanged yet yes brother gam answered the penitent with an overflow of malicious spleen that forgot all consequences  yes brother gam you villain i know my duty and staid on purpose to see my elder brother swing first  scoundrels interposed john i make no doubt however the precedence may be adjusted but you will both die the same honorable death my business at present is to direct you the nearest way to the accomplishment of your fraternal wishes  for which purpose    while john was speaking a noise was heard at the door of make way make way for justice barhim and in the next minute the said justice and his attendant having by dint of fist and elbows made an avenue through the spectators his egregious worship appeared in view discovering thus his great abilities and good manners mr thingum  thangum   said he addressing himself to john fitzorton  i understand you have taken upon you to examine to harbor and detain in durance my thief thieves or what not  the which is neither law nor gospel nor like one gentleman to another thief taken on my jurisdiction is as much my thief as game taken on my manor is my game perhaps mr thingum you dont know any more who i am than i know or cares who be you but i must tell you if you be a justice this here township has rights and i thereby take up whip stock pound pillar cage bind over or bind down or what not in my own right so that whoever takes up whips stocks pounds pillars cages etc etc in my bounds commits a trespass on my rights and is thereby guilty of a breach and an action will stand go and lie against him you will do well therefore to surrender my thief thieves or what not and look after your own for there is enough in reason in every mans parish if a gentleman will look after um therefore  which are the prisoners what are their offenses and where be they going  he now vaulted into the seat of justice squatting down on a chair by the side of justice john when there past a scene of dumb eloquence betwixt john fitzorton and his brother of the quorum not inferior to that which had been acted by the moralist and penitent for nowithstanding his pretended ignorance as to personal identity the obtruding magistrate as thoroughly knew john as john knew him and they bore to each other an aversion not less inveterate than that born by the brother prisoners though very different in kind for john fitzorton despised mr barhim because he considered him abundantly more mischievous than either of the scoundrels in custody and barhim hated john because he was conscious the said contempt was founded on such knowledge in short the antipathy on either side was no more than that which an honest man feels toward a rogue and a rogue toward an honest man  the mob had now fresh objects of surprise and curiosity before them john fitzorton declared he by no means wished to dispute with barhim his natural or inherent right to any or to all the vagabonds and villains of the land inasmuch as he believed no man had so just a claim on the villain who had a fellow feeling in the villainy and that so far from disputing pretensions with mr barhim to a property in the prisoners now before him that he thought it a pity two jails should part them for which reason unless a certain misdemeanor be atoned for committed some years since by the said barhim on the person of the late sir armine fitzorton   my father sir said john exalting his voice i shall include three of the greatest scoundrels that ever came before a magistrate to the same place of confinement  before the great man accused had opportunity to make any reply to this insinuation which indeed it is more than probable he would not have attempted for it had a visible effect upon him a chariot and four followed by two servants drove into the innyard and the words  this way my lady this way ant please your ladyship  the justices and a couple of thieves are in the angel  hope your ladyship and his honor therefore will put up with the devil for a moment till they are gone  thieves exclaimed the lady i am glad they are taken we might have been robbed perhaps  i hate pettyfogging waylaying thieves of all things i have a great fancy to see the fellows observed one of the two gentlemen who came out of the coach and so have i said the other let us go into the room then said the lady but pray added she has not some gentleman been here to ask for  though of course he is one of the justices so lead on to the thieves  the reader who has been in some sort prepared for the company of sir guise lady tempest stuart and mr valentine by their courier mr david otley the penitent will not be surprised by any means in the degree that the said good company were when on entering the apartment of equity they beheld their own confidential servant in one of the prisoners  his brother who had been of no less use in their affairs in the other and the two magistrates  equally known to them  john fitzorton the avowed and indignant enemy of their vices and mr barhim as their mercenary and timeserving friend  but great as was the mystery and amazement in which the miscellaneous groupe now gathered together in the room of justice were involved destiny fortune or some superior power that controls these had preordained to thicken the plot by making it impossible for any of the parties to go into explanation and though the reader should wonder how the devil the said parties came there we are ourselves at this moment so full of business that he must wait for elucidation to a more convenient season  another arrival this instant demands our attention even as it did at the time it happened that of the landlord and landlady of the inn and every servant who had from time to time run to the door of the angel then taken a mouthful of justice between one summons and another crying coming coming gemmin as the different bells rang then from the angel to the devil from the star to the bear and from the red lion to the fox the rumble of a stagecoach was succeeded by the rattle of two postchaises following it and by a miserable jealousy which the gentlemen of the whip almost universally feel to drive furiously through a market town or if their passengers stop at any inn in the said town a no less absurd vanity of turning into the yard with velocity and dispatch animated both the postillions with two sublime determinations  the one to pass the stage coach and then to contend between themselves which should take the lead into the george yard  the stage coachman however happened to have as great a thirst for glory as the postillions and giving his horses the encouraging word and the commanding whip had almost gained the entrance when the postillions taking each a side made a vigorous push which carried them all three into the mouth of the gateway at the same moment by which maneuver all the wheels were locked together and the axletrees of the carriage so wedged that they could have but one movement even as if they had been one body seeing which the high blooded drivers by this time like all great souls in the heart of action superior to consequences plied the lash when they ought to have pulled the reins and by driving forward when they should have backed the heavier body namely the stage coach disengaged itself from the lighter one and carrying all before it worked its victorious way into the yard where it broke down with one grand jump upon the stones almost shivering its two petty rivals in its fall  the scream of the passengers who were tossed or tumbled out in heaps from all the vehicles were drowned in the louder cries of the spectators within and without the gateway but even these ejaculations were lost in the dissonant tones and trembling oaths of the stage coachman and the two postillions who with no less than four men who were jerked from the top of the coach and as many of the inside passengers as could recover their fall and consternation were all in arms at one and the same moment the justice room was emptied even faster than it had filled and the inhabitants of the angel would have run to the devil had not one of the combatants who appeared by a handful of hair which he held in triumph to have been the most active in the affray cried out in as loud a voice as a mouth filling with the blood of his own nose would permit  stop stop thief  stop the worthy gentleman to whom this head of hair belongs without uttering more the exclaimer darted amongst the crowd in search of the fugitive alarmed at this john fitzorton and true george supposing the thief who had stolen away was one of their own prisoners looked about and saw both of them secured the one in the custody of a stout young man which happened to be jonathan armstrong jane atwoods cousin the other in that of as sturdy a young and as hearty an old one being no other than the two atwoods father and son the colonels aim therefore was to recover his brother justice who taking advantage of the new disturbances had discreetly withdrawn himself as did messrs miles sir guise and his amiable spouse but by the vigilance of george they were recovered and will be forthcoming when their reappearance may be necessary  still raged the battle in the inn yard with unabated fury and in less than half an hour such a collection of the halt and blind of bruised and bloodied of teeth displaced heads broken women crying children bawling and men swearing were surely never before brought together out of an hospital or indeed out of bedlam the two postillions lay to all appearance defunct upon the pavement a pair of as miserable carcases as ever were dragged at the chariot wheels of any of the stage coachmen of former times when heroes gods and goddesses delighted to tear their mortal victims with immortal rage limb from limb and indeed sometimes to tear themselves the coachman himself was a man of rags every passenger having had a pull at him for obtaining a victory too dear even at the expense of many wounds and much bloodshed  amongst the female sufferers also all the hysterical restoratives and pocket medicines were at work my landlord was holding hartshorn to the nose of one lady my landlady chaffing the temples of another the chambermaids and waiters were running against each other and an apothecary was applying salts opodildoc brown paper plasters steeped in thieves vinegar volatile lineaments etc etc while another party comforted themselves with ample doses of cherrybounce unsophisticated brandy or honest hollands  meantime the gentleman who had in the first instance given the alarm as to the escape of a thief returned conducting that personage by the collar declaring as he held the honors of his head in his hand that he was sure of his man for that what he had borrowed from the scalp would fit it to an hair come gentlemen said the hero to his three attendants who were at the heels of the prisoner help to escort him into a place of safety they accordingly took him into the room which the baronet and his lady and her friend had vacated the attendants followed and as the gentleman was himself about to enter true george plucked him gently by the coat saying bless me squire partington is it you as i live sir here is my masters parliament brother mr  sir john the colonel  and we have had such a to do  but mr  sir john will be so glad to see you sir for he was going to your honors house only he was stopped on the way by a thief or two  partington immediately conferred on george who was a singular favorite the high and distinguished mark of his most coarse abuse and exclaimed in high spirits why then all the rascals are got together for look you there are the two atwoods coming with as i suppose your friends for mine is gone into this room with three as honest personages as himself  at the name of the two atwoods george seeing john coming up to partington left them together to enter into further explanations and running to his janes father and brother who had the otleys still in their gripe he gave them a hearty welcome and had their hands been at liberty would have demonstrated his sincerity by the usual token but scarce a moments opportunity was given for caress or conversation as partington beckoned the atwoods to advance with their prisoners and as they passed him partington bowed very respectfully telling them as he thrust them into the room where his own party were enclosed that they would there probably meet with an old acquaintance  he now locked the door put the key into his pocket and clapping his own cudgel into georges hand saying you must stand sentinel here you scoundrel as you did at the inn at adsell he then gave his arm to john and desiring the atwoods to follow they shut themselves into the apartment which had been before and as the reader will presently find was still decreed by the powers that ruled on this eventful day to be the room of justice it may not meantime be improper to observe that true george previously to these arrangements had dispatched the turnpike man to the place where the angry justice and his friends had betaken themselves with a strict charge to have an eye on all their motions and that they might not steal out of town before they had mr  sir johns sanction so to do george had in the bustle of affairs taken care to order the landlord of the inn the only one where postchaises were to be had not to put horses to the carriage of sir guise or any other without giving him the said george notice the turnpike man was too well pleased to find the mischiefs in which he so much delighted multiply upon him  and to think that he should not go home with an empty budget  not to execute the commands of george on this occasion with as much vigilance as if his own property and life were at stake  so indefatigable are some men in the business of others and so officiously do they engage in punishing the follies and vices of their neighbors to the utter oblivion of their own  and now reader having cleared the obstructed path which literally blocked up every loophole to explanation having taken two thieves into custody who little expected to find a brother in that spot having conveyed to the same scene sir guise and lady stuart and valentine miles in a coach and four presented to your view two of his majestys justices of the peace and set them together almost by the ears having also unexpectedly produced your old friend partington two of the atwoods three thieftakers in their train and the thief himself having likewise rescued georges coat and jennys handkerchief and lastly brought into the yard of this evermemorable inn three carriages at once broken them almost to pieces to stand for future ages amongst the ruins of ambition maimed and mended the passengers clapped our honest men into the angel and sent our rogues to the devil we will leave them awhile to hold discourse on the subject of those very surprises of which we will unfold the causes and in good truth we must say it is high time that this were done and yet thou will have the candor to allow it could not have been done sooner  chapter xxxix it will scarce be necessary to refresh the memory in any thing that compounds the singular but veritable character of partington the author might have added the word existing for the original of this copy still lives to the delight of his friends  who under the most unornamented leaf concealed the fairest fruit and within the roughest husk shut up the richest kernel in short he was like john fitzorton earnest and indefatigable in searching out misery and misfortune of every size and of every sort purely for the satisfaction of relieving it and like john also though utterly different in the means of effecting the same ends he was no less persevering in his researches after fraud and villainy for the gratification of exposing it to scorn and infamy his hale constitution lofty courage and ample fortune were all knit together to produce these effects the means indeed were as just observed not only dissimilar to his friend the colonels but such as scarcely any other man would think of using but in the way of counteraction and contrariety yet never did a human being more infinitely love an honest nor more abundantly hate a dishonest man  never would human being go farther or try harder to save the one and hang the other  the moment that he returned from taking an eternal leave of his inestimable friend sir armine which was not till almost the expiring hour he hurried to his house in london and after bringing the whole of sir guise stuarts character into a point he concluded it would be a meritorious thing as well to the family in particular as to human society in general to bring the noble baronet to the gallows  the focus of that honest gentleman said he presents to my view halters by the thousand now the summit of my ambition would be to twist them all together with my own hand and tie them about his neck for i can assert with the moor  my great revenge has stomach for them all but as this supreme happiness is denied me he must i fancy be put out of the world the ordinary way and with that i must try to be content i must learn some of my friend johns philosophy  while he was in the spirit of this soliloquy which he pronounced on his arrival from london  even as he was just setting down to a dish of tea after his journey  the two atwoods and their kinsman jonathan armstrong whom he had situated in the comfortable and independent way the reader has been informed of came running in to know whether their patron had returned and to their infinite satisfaction hearing that he had just drawn off his boots they followed the agitated feelings which impelled them and rushed without asking the usual questions into his presence tell me you dear goodfornothing scoundrels tell me said partington the instant they entered  pushing them down by their shoulders till they were seated in chairs  which of you has gratitude and religion enough in your hearts to assist a scoundrel like yourselves even my magnanimous self in a plan that i am forming to hang an honest man but before you determine remember that you owe something to providence and that one good turn deserves another  as your honest man please your honor i have observed is always a rogue replied atwood the father trying to conceal his disturbance of mind i think i may safely promise you my poor efforts and i fancy i can answer for those of my boy and his coz young atwood fervently but rather more fuddled than affrighted declared he would knock all the honest men in the kingdom on the head and no questions asked which his honor should think ought to be put to death but as to that added the highmettled youth with increased impetuosity father and i are come to wait on your honor about as i take it another hanging or knocking down matter whether the party be overhonest your honor will be the best judge when you have heard the story  tell it you insufferable caitiff exclaimed partington  why then there is a goodfornothing rogue of a lawyer ant please your honor said young atwood  out upon you vociferated partington what is that you say sirrah  i ask your honors pardon replied the youth very gravely correcting his mistake under favor there is one of your honors honestest men by trade a lawyer who has sent two illlooking fellows into our farm swearing we owe him above two hundred pounds though we never clapped eyes on him before and then they tossed about our things and rummaged our boxes and drawers and almost frightened poor mother out of her wits whereupon i thought your honor it was time for me to begin  especially as they got father by the collar and mother set up a roar and there was no time to run for neighbors and your honors justiceship was as i thought from home so with that cousin jonathan here and i made bold to trip up one of the lawmens heels and knock down the other smack your honor with backhanded stroke this fashion so we downd with em both then wi a couple of halters cousin jonathan who was with us at farm had bought at market in the morning  yes i had been to market and got rather mellow your honor said jonathan and was in order as i may say for any thing and cousin jerome is in the same way so i tied un till they squeakd and then rolled un into backhouse slip side kitchen and icod there they be now your honor and they took it as kindly as thof they had been used to it only one oum gave a bit of a growle and said summut about sir guise stuart should pay for his bloody nose yet  sure enough his nose spouted finely  so thought i as sure as a gun that son of a  gentleman sir guise is at the bottom of all this but i did not stay to ax questions thinking to get neighbors and your honors servants  glad enough are we your honors come home yourself just in the nick  fine fellows in a kind of gulp and giving a sort of hysterical catch at the name of sir guise stuart fine fellows said partington then doubling his fist at young atwood and armstrong swore the scoundrel meaning atwood should die upon the spot if he stopped to breathe till he had given his old rascal of a father a bumper of brandy and taken another himself and made jonathan then swallow a third  this command the son obeyed with great dispatch and dexterity declaring when he had swallowed one half of his allowance he should now be a match for all the rogues i beg pardon your honor i mean for all the honest gentlemen who take a fancy to come into other peoples houses in christendom o but i should have told your honor said jonathan one of these genusses when he first came in just as uncle aunt and cousin were keeping out the cold of this biting night from our stomachs and drinking to your honors health  which we do every night as sure as the night comes after supper  and as i do now god bless your honor in the rest of this brandy interposed jerome taking up the story  one of the genusses said we had better letum do things quietly and letum take account of goods and chattels as we could not pay money for that lawyer himself would be down shortly and then said he you will all go to pot  at the close of this narrative partington snapped his fingers rubbed his hands and danced about the room as if he had been hearing the extrication instead of the involvement of the family in question charming noble exhilarating delightful and triumphant exclaimed partington putting on his gloves and great coat and taking his hat and grasping the cudgel which we have celebrated in this history and then leaping by bounds rather than long steps out of the house the elder atwood in one arm and ordering jonathan and jerome to follow but never slackening his pace till he gained atwoods farm nor aught abating his demonstrations of joy in his way thither exclaiming however almost at every stride it shall be  it must be  it can be no other than sir guise who set this amiable pair at work i know him by his marks  i will swear to his noble deeds out of a thousand  after shaking goody atwood as he usually called her by the hand and assuring her that she was a silly goodfornothing old woman to whimper at her present unexpected good fortune he ordered the son to unlock the door of the prisonroom which being done he ran to the prisoners whom he found bound hand and foot by those halters which had they been fastened by the hand of justice would have been placed in a more elevated part of the human body gentlemen said partington bowing himself almost to the ground teach me how to thank you here he began to draw the ropes harder in their knots teach me i pray how to express my thanks  my  my  sincere  est  thanks  here three pulls and three bows  for making me the  happiest  of mankind but the load which you have taken from my mind is so heavy  so  heavy  i say  four pulls and as many bows  so  very heavy  that i can never hope to make a suitable return  a grand jerk of the halters  suitable  return  unless it were within my power to save your necks  here many strong tugs in succession at the ropes his foot on the body of one of the prisoners  to save  i say your necks  for the opportunity you will give me of stretching those of the worthy  very worthy  gentleman who sent you hither i suppose you have the honor to know sir guise  stuart  at pronoucing the name three enormous bends and pulls  yes we do said one of the men  that is we have heard of such a gentleman  aye  i thought so replied partington  which binds me to you  here he pulled the halters with redoubled force  binds me to you  for ever  take care master that your own neck is not stretched for your outrage of his majestys officers in the discharge of their bounden duty said the other captive almost gagged and struggling like a lion in the toils then lifting up the only eye which some former contest had left in his head young atwood would certainly have deprived him of this had not partington interposed by insisting on the honest gentlemans being permitted to see his way to the gallows  further remarks were interrupted by the appearance of the great personage who had set these subordinate instruments to work namely the lawyer himself he had come post haste from london for many great and important purposes amongst which not the least in his dear love was the pure and laudable design of turning a whole innocent family into the streets in the bitterest weather that a rigorous december ever inflicted  and that upon a mock execution instituted against them and to be served unless he could obtain a certain security which was indeed the great object he came in search of and of which the reader shall not die in ignorance unless his death be very sudden indeed this pest of the laws of england began to exhibit a specimen of the goodness of his heart the moment he entered by demanding whether the distress had been made and the goods inventoried observing that he had not a single moment to spare and unless he had satisfaction must take them all into custody that very night then seeing the instruments of his office bound he cast his eyes about in a wild sort of surprise and in so doing threw them on partington and his associates whom till then he had not noticed and at the sight of whom though he did not personally know either his honest conscience the only thing which even rogues cannot always bring over as parties assenting  his honest conscience suspected perhaps instinctively were no friends to his cause partington without speaking one syllable and even without making his bow a rare omission in his dealings with a knave of distinction gave the cue to the atwoods and co and zealously assisted first in tripping up the heels then in pinioning the arms and finally in fettering the legs of the principal even as the legs and arms of the petty agents had been fettered and pinioned with a slight difference only in the materials of bondage  substituting for ropes the handkerchiefs tied together and the garters  which were loosened in a moment  even of the aforesaid agents and principals while this ceremony was performing partington suggested a trifling alteration which he thought might be an improvement in the article of fastening  to wit tying the prisoners neck and heels together and then arranging them so close that they might enjoy the benefits of a conversation which no doubt said he must be interesting while you and i ye scoundrels and this old goodfornothing whimpering woman said partington pointing to mrs atwood retire to the bury and consult about their future promotion meantime worthy gentlemen continued partington i will by virtue of mine office perform the duty of searching your pockets convinced that i shall find nothing therein but the most unequivocal testimonies of your virtue and humanity  partingtons hands were ransacking the pockets of the prisoner in chief and the atwoods and jonathan those of the subalterns in captivity all the time they were thus speaking then possessing themselves of the spoil the parties thus literally bound over to their better behavior were packed in the way partington proposed the windows were made fast neither fire or candle allowed every article of furniture moved out of the room a comfortable cold brick floor was their bed the key of the street door was then turned upon the vanquished and the conquerors marched away taking goody atwood in protection to headquarters at partingtonbury  here over a bottle of the best wine which partingtons cellar afforded the victorious party examined the plunder which they had taken from the enemy it consisted of the following interesting particulars a commentary on which would call for a hundred pens each of them better at description than ours and yet which any single person with a heart as honest as that of partington jonathan armstrong or the atwoods may furnish as he reads but these particulars are of too great consequence not to be given in an appropriate chapter nay they
