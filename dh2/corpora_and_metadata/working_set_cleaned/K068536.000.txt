an answer to a pamphlet entitled an argument to prove the affections of the people of england to be the best security of the government  by the author of the freeholder  according to the copy printed at london by s gray in amencorner anne dom      price   d  this pamphlet and the argument to prove the affections of the people of england the best security of the government are sold at the printing house opposite to the tronechurch price of each   d  the freeholder omnes homines p c qui de rebus dubiis consultant ab odio amicitia ira atque misericordia vacuos esse decet  caesar ap sallust i have purposely avoided during the whole course of this paper to speak any thing concerning the treatment which is due to such persons as have been concerned in the late rebellion because i would not seem to irritate justice against those who are under the prosecution of the law nor incense any of my readers against unhappy though guilty men but when we find the proceedings of our government in this particular traduced and misrepresented it is the duty of every good subject to set them in their proper light  i am the more prompted to this undertaking by a pamphlet entitled an argument to prove the affections of the people of england to to be the best security of the government humbly offered to the consideration of the patrons of severity and applied to the present juncture of affairs had the whole scope of the author been answerable to his title he would have only undertaken to prove what every man in his wits is already convinced of but the drift of the pamphlet is to stir up our compassion toward the rebels and our indignation against the government the author who knew that such a design as this could not be carried on without a great deal of artifice and sophistry has puzzled and perplexed his cause by throwing his thoughts together in such a studied confusion that upon this account if upon any his pamphlet is as the party have represented it unanswerable  the famous monsieur bail compares the answering of an immethodical author to the hunting of a duck when you have him full in your sight and fancy your self within reach of him he gives you the slip and becomes invisible his argument is lost in such a variety of marter that you must catch it where you can as it rises and disappears in the several parts of his discourse  the writer of this pamphlet could doubtless have ranged his thoughts in much better order if he had pleased but he knew very well that error is not to be advanced by perspicuity in order therefore to answer this pamphlet i must reduce the substance of it under proper heads and disembroil the thoughts of the author since he did not think fit to do it himself  in the first place i shall observe that the terms which the author makes use of are loose general and undefined as will be shown in the sequel of this paper and what less becomes a fair reasoner he puts wrong and invidious names on every thing to color a false way of arguing  he allows that the rebels indisputably merit to be severely chastised that they deserve it according to law and that if they are punished they have none to thank but themselves page   how can a man after such a concession make sometimes use of the word cruelty but generally of revenge when he pleads against the exse of that which according to his own notion is at the most but rigid justice or why are such executions which according to his own opinion are legal so often to be called violences and slaughter not to mention the appellations given to those who do not agree with him in his opinion for clemency as the bloodthirsty the political butchers state surgeons and the like  but i shall now speak of that point which is the great and reigning fallacy of the pamphlet and runs more or less through every paragraph his whole argument turns upon this single consideration whether the king should exert mercy or justice toward those who have openly appeared in the present rebellion by mercy he means a general pardon by justice a general punishment so that he supposes no other method practicable in the juncture than either the forgiving all or the executing all thus he puts the question whether it be the interest of the prince to destroy the rebels by fire sword or gibbet page   and speaking of the zealots for the government he tells us they think no remedy so good as to make clear work and that they declare for the utter extirpation of all who are its enemies in the most minute circumstances as if amputation were the sole remedy these political butchers could find out for the distempers of a state or that they thought the only way to make the top flourish were to lop off the underbranches p   he then speaks of the coffeehouse politicians and the casuists in redcoats who he tells us are for the utmost rigor that their laws of war or laws of conveniencie can inspire them with p   again it is represented says he that the rebels deserve the highest punishment the laws can inflict p   and afterward tells us the question is whether the government shall show mercy or take a reverend divines advice to slay man and woman infant and suckling p   thus again he tells us the friends to severe counsels allege that the government ought not to be moved by compassion and that the law should have its course p   and in another place puts these words in their mouths he may still retain their affection and yet let the laws have their course in punishing the guilty p    he goes upon the same supposition in the following passages it is impracticable in so general a corruption to destroy all who are infected and unless you destroy all you do nothing to the purpose p  0 shall our rightful king show himself less the true father of his people and afford his pardon to none of those people who like king lear to his daughter had so great a confidence in his virtue as to give him all p    i shall only add that the concluding paragraph which is worked up with so much artificial horror goes upon a supposition answerable to the whole tenor of the pamphlet and implies that the impeached lords were to be executeed without exception or discrimination  thus we see what is the authors idea of that justice against which all his arguments are levelled if in the next place we consider the nature of that clemency which he recommends we find it to be no less universal and unrestrained  he declares for a general act of indemnity p  0 and tells us it is the sense of every dispassionate man of the kingdom that the rebels may and ought to be pardoned p    one popular act says he would even yet retrieve all p    he declares himself not overfond of the doctrines of making examples of traitors ibid and that the way to prevent things from being brought to an extremity is to deal mildly with those unfortunate gentlemen engaged in the rebellion  the reader may now see in how fallacious a manner this writer has stated the controversy he supposes there are but two methods of treating the rebels that is by cutting off every one of them to a man or pardoning every one of them without distinction now if there be a third method between these two extremes which is on all accounts more eligible than either of them it is certain that the whole course of his argumentation comes to nothing every man of the plainest understanding will easily conclude that in the case before us as in most others we ought to avid both extremes that to destroy every rebel would be an excessive severity and to forgive every one of them an unreasonable weakness the proper method of proceeding is that which the author has purposely  because says he the very means or the apprehensions of them have brought things to the pass in which they are and consequently will reduce them from bad to worse p  0 and afterward this growth of disaffection is in a great measure owing to the groundless jealousies men entertained of the present administration as if they were to expect nothing but cruelty under it if our author would have spoken out and have applied these effects to the real cause he would have ascribed this change of affections among the people to nothing else but the change of the ministry for we find that a great many persons lost their loyalty with their places and that their friends have ever since made use of the most base methods to infuse those groundless discontents into the minds of the common people which have brought so many of them to the brink of destruction and proved so detrimental to their fellow subjects  however this proceeding has shown how dangerous it would have been for his majesty to have continued in their places of trust a set of men some of whom have since actually joined with the pretender to his crown while others may be justly suspected never to have been faithful to him in their hearts or at least whose principles are precarious and visibly conducted by their interest in a word if the removal of these persons from their posts has produced such popular commotions the continuance of them might have produced something much more fatal to their king and country and have brought about that revolution which has now been in vain attempted the condition of a british king would be very poor indeed should a party of his subjects threaten him with a rebellion upon his bringing malefactors to justice or upon his refusing to employ those whom he dare not trust  i shall only mention another argument against the punishment of any of the rebels whose executions he represents as very shocking to the people because they are their countrymen p    and again the quality of the sufferers their alliance their character their being englishmen with a thousand other circumstances will contribute to breed more ill blood than all the state surgeons can possibly let out p    the impeached lords likewise in the last paragraph of the pamphlet are recommended to our pity because they are our countrymen by this way of reasoning no man that is a gentleman or born within the three seas should be subject to capital punishment besides who can be guilty of rebellion that are not our countrymen as for the endearing name of englishmen which he bestows upon every one of the criminals he should consider that a man deservedly cuts himself off from the affections as well as the privileges of that community which he endeavors to subvert  these are the several arguments which appear in different forms and expressions through this whole pamphlet and under which every one that is urged in it may be reduced there is indeed another set of them derived from the example and authority of great persons which the author produces in favors of his own scheme these are william the conqueror henry the  th of france our late king william king solomon and the pretender if a man were disposed to draw arguments for severity out of history how many instances might one find of it among the greatest princes of every nation but as different princes may act very laudably by different methods in different conjunctures i cannot think this a conclusive way of reasoning however let us examine this set of arguments and we shall find them no less defective than those abovementioned  one of the greatest of our english monarchs says our author was william the conqueror and he was the greater because he put to death only one person of quality that we read of and him after repeated treacheries yet he was a foreigner had power sufficient and did not want provocations to have been more bloody p    person of quality was the farl of waltheof who being overtaken with wine engaged in a conspiracy against this king but repenting of it the next morning came to him in person and revealed the whole matter notwithstanding of which he was beheaded upon the defeat of the conspiracy for having but thus far tampered in it and as for the rest of the conspirators who rose in an actual rebellion the king used them with the utmost rigor he cut off the heads of some put out the eyes of others some were hanged upon gibbets and those who faired the best were sent into banishment there are indeed the most dreadful examples of severity in this reign though it must be confessed that after the manner of these times the nobility generally escaped with their lives though multudes of them were punished with banishment perpetual imprisonment forfeitures and other great severities while the poor people who had been deluded by these their ringleaders were executed with the utmost rigor a partiality which i believe no commoner of england will ever think it to be either just or reasonable  the next instance is henry the  th of france who says our author so handsomely expressed his tenderness for his people when at signing the treaty of vervines he said that by one dash of his pen he had overcome more enemies than he could ever be able to do with his sword would not an ordinary reader think this treaty of vervins was a treaty between henry the  th and a party of his subjects for otherwise how can it have a place in the present argument but instead of that it was a treaty between france and spain so that the speech expressed an equal tenderness to the spaniards and french as multitudes of either nation must have fallen in that war had it continued longer as for this kings treatment of the conspirators though he is quoted thrice in the pamphlet as an example of clemency you have an eminent instance of it in his behavior to the marshall de biron who had been his old faithful servant and had contributed more than any one to his advancement to the throne this marshall upon some discontent was entered into a conspiracy against his master and refusing to open the whole secret to the king he was sent to the bastile and there beheaded notwithstanding he sought for mercy with great importunities and in the most moving manner there are other instances in this kings reign who notwithstanding was remarkable for his clemency of rebels and conspirators who were hanged beheaded or broken alive on the wheel  the late king william was not disturbed by any rebellion from those who had once submitted to him but we know he treated the persons concerned in the assasinationplot as so horrid a conspiracy deserved as for the saying which this author imputes to that monarch it being a piece of secret history one does not know when it was spoken or what it alluded to unless the author had been more particular in the account of it  the author proceeds in the next place to no less an authority than that of solomon amongst all the general observations of the wisest princes we know of i think there is none holds more universally that mercy and truth preserve a king and his throne is established in mercy p    if we compare the different sayings of this wise king which relate to the conduct of princes we cannot question but that he means by this mercy that kind of it which is consistent with reason and government and by which we hope to see his majestys throne established but our author should consider that the same wise man has said in another place that an evil man seeks rebellion therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him accordingly his practice was agreeable to his proverb no prince having given a greater testimony of his abhorrence to undertakings of this treasonable nature for he dispatched such a cruel messenger as is here mentioned to those who had been engaged in a rebellion many years before he himself was on the throne and even to his elder brother upon the bare suspicion that he was projecting so wicked an enterprise  how the example of the pretender came into this argument i am at a loss to find out the pretender declared a general pardon to all and shall our rightful king show himfelf less the true father of his people and afford his pardon to none etc p    the pretenders general pardon was to a people who were not in his power and had he ever reduced them under it it was only promised to such as immediately joined with him for the recovery of what he called his right it was such a general pardon as would have been consistent with the execution of more than nine parts of ten of the kingdom  there is but one more historical argument which is drawn from king philips treatment of the catalans i think it would not be unseasonable for some men to recollect what their own notions were of the treatment of the catalans how many declamations were made on the barbarity used toward them by king philip p    if the author remembers these declamations as he calls them were not made so much on the barbarity used toward them by king philip as on the barbarity used toward them by the english government king philip might have some color for treating them as rebels but we ought to have regarded them as allies and were obliged by all the ties of honor conscience and public faith to have sheltered them from those sufferings which were brought upon them by a firm and inviolable adherence to our interests however none can draw into a parallel the cruelties which have been inflicted on that unhappy people with those few instances of severity which our government has been obliged to exert toward the british rebels i say no man would make such a parallel unless his mind be so blinded with passion and prejudice as to assert in the language of this pamphlet that no instances can be produced of the least lenity under the present administration from the first hour it commenced to this day p  0 with other astonishing reflections of the same nature which are contradicted by such innumerable matters of fact that it would be an affront to a readers understanding to endeavor to confute them but to return to the catalans during the whole course of the war says the author which ever of them submitted to discretion were received to mercy p    this is so far from being truly related that in the beginning of the war they were executed without mercy but when in conjunction with their allies they became superior to king philips party in strength and extended their conquests up to the very gates of madrid it cannot be supposed the spanish court would be so infatuated as to persist in their first severities against an enemy that could make such terrible reprizals however when this reason of state ceased how dreadful was the havoc made among this brave but unhappy people the whole kingdom without any distinction to the ruin of many thousands of its innocent inhabitants was stripped of its immunities and reduced to a state of slavery barcelona was filled with executions and all the patriots of their ancient liberties either beheaded stowed in dungeons or condemned to work in the mines of america  god be thanked we have a king who punishes with reluctance and is averse to such cruelties as were used among the catalans as much as to those practiced on the persons concerned in monmouths rebellion our author indeed condemns these western assizers in king jamess reign p    and it would be well if all those who still adhere to the cause of that unfortunate king and are clamorous at the proceedings of his present majesty would remember that notwithstanding that rebellion fell very much short of this both in the number and strength of the rebels and had no tendency either to destroy the national religion to introduce an arbitrary government or to subject us to a foreign power not only the chief of the rebels was bebeheaded but even a lady who had only harbored one of the offenders in her house was in her extreme old age put to the same kind of death that about two hundred and thirty were hanged drawn and quartered and their limbs dispersed through several parts of the country and set up as spectacles of terror to their fellow subjects it would be too tedious a work to run through the numberless fines imprisonments corporal punishments and transportations which were then likewise practiced as wholesome severities  we have now seen how fallaciously the author has stated the cause he has undertaken by supposing that nothing but unlimited mercy or unlimited punishment are the methods that can be made use of in our present treatment of the rebels that he has omitted the middle way of proceeding between these two extremes that this middleway is the method in which his majesty like all other wise and good kings has chosen to proceed that it is agreeable to the nature of government religion and onr british constitution and that every argument which the author has produced from reason and example would have been a true one had it been urged from that restrained clemency which his majesty has exercised but it is a false one when applied to such a general undistinguishing mercy as the author would recommend  having thus answered that which is the main drift and design of this pamphlet i shall touch upon those other parts of it which are interwoven with the arguments to put men out of humor with the present government  and here we may observe that it is our authors method to suppose matters of fact which are not in being and afterward to discant upon them as he is very sensible that the cause will not bear the teft of reason he has indeed every where chosen rather topics for declamation than argument thus he intertains us with a labored invective against a standing army but what has this to do in the present case i suppose he would not advise his majesty to disband his forces while there is an army of rebels in his dominions i cannot imagine he would think the affections of the people of england a security of the government in such a juncture were it not at the same time defended with a sufficient body of troops no prince has ever given a greater instance of his inclinations to rule without a standing army if we consider that upon the very first news of the defeat of the rebels he declared to both houses of parliament that he had put an immediare stop to the levies which he had begun to raise at their request and that he would not make use of the power which they had entrusted him with unless any new preparations of the enemy should make it necessary for our defense this speech was received with the greatest gratitude by both houses and it is said that in the house of commons a very candide and honorable gentleman who generally votes with the minority declared that he had not heard so gracious a speech from the throne for many years last past  in another place he supposes that the government has not eavoured to gain the applause of the vulgar by doing something for the church and very gravely makes excuses for this their pretended neglect what greater instances could his majesty have given of his love to the church of england than these he has exhibited by his most solemn declarations by his daily example and by his promotions of the most eminent amongst the clergy to such vacancies as have happened in his reign to which we must add for the honor of his government in this particular that it has done more for the advantage of the clergy than those who are the most zealous for their interest could have expected in so short a time which will further appear if we reflect upon the valuable and royal donative to one of our universities and the provision made for those who are to officiate in the fifty new churches his majesty is indeed a prince of too much magnanimity and truth to make use of the name of the church for drawing his people into any thing that may be prejudicial unto them for what our author says to this purpose redounds as much to the honor of the present administration as to the disgrace of others nay i wish with all my soul they had stooped a little ad captum vulgi to take in these fluttering hearts which are to be caught by any thing called with the name of church p ii again the authorasks whether terror is to become the only national principle with other questions of the same nature and in several parts of his book harangues very plentifully against such a notion where he talks in generals upon this topic there is no question but every whig and tory in the kingdom perfectly agrees with him in what he says but if he would insinuate as he seems to do in several places that there should be no impressions of awe upon the mind of a subject and that a government should not create terror in those who are disposed to do ill as well as encourage those that do their duty in short if he is for an entire exclusion of that principle of fear which is supposed to have some influence in every law he opposes himself to the form of every governm  the world and to the common sense of mankind  the artifice of this author in starting objections to the friends of the government and the foolish answers which he supposes they return to them is so very visible that every one sees they are designed rather to divert his reader than to instruct him  i have now examined this whole pamphlet which indeed is written with a great deal of art and as much argument as the cause would bear and after having stated the true notion of clemency mercy compassion goodnature humanity or whatever else it may be called so far as it is consistent with wisdom and the good of manking or in other words so far as it is a moral virtue i shall readily concur with the author in the highest panegyric that he has bestowed upon it as likeways i heartily join with him in every thing he has said against justice if it concludes as his pamphlet supposes the extirpation of every criminal and is not exercised with a much greater mixture of clemency than rigor mercy in the true sense of the word is that virtue by which a prince approaches nearest to him whom he represents and whilst he is neither remiss nor extreme to animadvert upon those who offend him that logic will hold true of him which is applied to the great judge of all the earth with thee there is mercy therefore shall thou be feared  finis
