alzuma a tragedy as performed at the theater royal in covent garden  humana ante oculos faede cum vita jaceret in terris oppressa gravi sub religione lucret london printed for t lowndes no    in fleet street  mdcclxxiii  advertisement the precept which directs a poet to keep his piece nine years has been fully observed in regard to the following tragedy but the author will not claim the merit of voluntary submission to critical authority the delay he acknowledges did not arise from choice but was rather the consequence of difficulties that stood in his way and prevented an earlier access to the public  the play was written in the year      and the british forces were then actually doing at the havan nah what alzuma prays for in the third act the subject appeared of the first importance to the interests of humanity in perusing the history of the spanish conquests in ambrica the author found among unenlightened savages such instances of generosity truth justice courage and even clemency as would have done honor to those who professed in that part of the world to spread the light of truth and civilization the behavior of atahualpa called by english writers atabalipa the last inca of peru in his intercourse with friar vincenti appeared particularly striking he heard the spanish missioner with calm attention and replied that it was absurd on the part of the pope to grant away a territory which did not belong to him he would still continue to venerate the gods of his ancestors and if the christians worshipped a god that died he adored the sun that never died he viewed the the prayer book which the friar put into his hands and after saying that it conveyed to him no information threw it down with a smile by this honest simplicity which would have gained the affections of a generous mind father vincenti was so enraged that he gave the word of command crying out kill the dogs who trample under foot the word of god an incident like this could not fail to excite indignation and that indignation rose still higher when it appeared that articles of high treason were in form exhibited against atahualpa and after that execrable farce of state the prince of a world just discovered suffered as a rebel to the emperor charles v  when guatimozin one of the leading chiefs lies stretched upon the rack and hearing the groans of his fellow sufferer asks him in perfect tranquillity am i upon a bed of roses the heart that does not melt with tenderness for the american must be as hard as friar vincentis not to multiply instances the story of a people massacred because they abounded in goldmines and had not heard the important truths of the christian religion seemed of all others the fittest for the english stage as it tended in a strong degree to that pathetic distress and that vigor of sentiment which constitute the essential beauty of tragedy  the author regretted that such a genius as dryden had not left a play free from the jingle of rhyme and of a more legitimate kind that the present attempt might have been excluded he regretted also that from drydens time the poets of this nation seem to have abandoned the poor americans to their fate he knew that france was in possession of a beautiful play upon the subject but the taste of london and paris being very different the late mr aaron hills translation of that piece appeared upon the english stage and vanished  the present writer was of opinion that so interesting a subject ought not to be neglected his first design was to new mould the alzire of voltaire not in a vain presumption that he could excel a writer so justly famous throughout europe but with an idea that he could in some instances adapt the scenes to the relish of an english audience that plan however was soon deserted it occurred that if this author followed the steps of monsieur de voltaire the words french translator unblushing plagiary would fill the columns of every newspaper to civilities of this kind the author has been used if the persons who have been so liberal feel themselves disposed to lavish their favors on the present occasion they will perhaps be glad of a hint that may supply ample materials if they will look into the plays of sophocles and euripides they will perceive in what school the writer of alzuma has studied the art of constructing a fable  aspice ut exuvias veterumque insignia nobis aptemus  vida poetic there was another reason for not adhering to the plan of voltaire in a country like this it was thought that our scene ought not to be indebted to a foreign writer for a play which involves the first great point of human liberty namely the right of man to think for himself in this opinion alzuma was written and except a few minute corrections in the course of the rehearsals was in its present form ready for the stage above ten years ago  there were indeed at that time certain reasons which made the author unwilling to precipitate himself into a dealing with managers those reasons subsisted till nov      when this tragedy was put into the hands of mr garrick it was copied out by the prompter of drury lane theater but remained in suspense till sept    0 when the author found it upon his table without a letter or even a card the play it is true was not pronounced unworthy of representation but certainly was treated as a piece that did not deserve the least dispatch delay was studied and the reasons for that delay existed no where but in mr garricks imagination a certain political society he was sure would damn any production known to come from the pen of the present writer time however has shown that he had not given umbrage to any set of men whatever in political controversy he had not meddled for a number of years and he takes this opportunity to declare that in his whole life he never was the author of one clandestine line whatever he writ he had the spirit and honor to avow it mr garrick was told this but without effect the play was thrown back upon the authors hands he submitted to it and would have consigned all the circumstances of that transaction to oblivion if the same policy had not been practiced upon him in another inftance this very winter  that alzuma has at length appeared is owing to the friendship of mr harris he desired to draw forth the piece from the authors closet mr colman accepted it with great frankness and from that instant went right forward without delay without duplicity without equivocation the author takes this opportunity to thank all the proprietors of covent garden theater for the fairness of their dealings his thanks are also due to the performers for their assiduity in preparing the play for representation the rest is before the public mr bensley and mr hull did justice to their respective characters mr smiths exertion of distinguished merit is well known miss miller struggled even in illness for the public favor and mrs hartleys beauty and elegant performance adorned every scene in which she appeared  the author cannot conclude without declaring that exclusive of his late transaction with mr colman he has every reason to be disgusted at the internal occurrences of a theater it is therefore probable that he shall never again be a candidate for theatical fame from the farce of the apprentice to the tragedy of alzuma his endeavors have at all times met with a most generous reception from the town he feels the obligation with the warmest sensibility and remains with due respect to the public  their most obedient humble servant arthur

epilogue spoken by mrs hartley our play thus over now swells each throbbing breast with expectation of the coming jest by fashions law whenever the tragic muse with sympathetic tears each eye bedews when some bright virtue at her call appears waked from the dead repose of rolling years when sacred worthies she bids breathe anew that men may be  what she displays to view by fashions law with light fantastic mien the comic sister trips it over the scene armed at all points with wit and wanton wiles plays off her airs and calls forth all her smiles till each fine feeling of the heart be over and the gay wonder how they wept before say do you wish ye bright ye virtuous train that every tear that fell should fall in vain if this nights scenes soft pity could impart it is yours to fix the fashion of the heart adopt ye fair the lost alzumas cause his ruined empire and expiring laws for orellana may i dare to plead my faults will all your kind indulgence need on you my hopes are fixed
