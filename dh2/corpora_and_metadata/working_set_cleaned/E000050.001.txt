his excellency the royal minister of state baron von zedlitz xii xiii dedication sir to further so far as in us lies the growth of the sciences is to work in your excellencys own interest your own interest being intimately connected with them not only through the exalted position of a patron of science but through the far more intimate relation of a lover and enlightened judge for that reason i avail myself of the only means within my power of proving my gratitude for the gracious confidence with which your excellency honours me as if i too could help toward your noble work whoever delights in a speculative life finds with moderate wishes the approval of an enlightened and kind judge a powerful incentive to studies the results of which are great but remote and therefore entirely ignored by vulgar eyes to you as such a judge and to your kind attention i now submit this book placing all other concerns of my literary future under your special protection and remaining with profound respect  your excellencys most obedient servant immanuel kant königsberg march         xiv xv xvi xvii preface  our reason vernunft has this peculiar fate that with reference to one class of its knowledge it is always troubled with questions which cannot be ignored because they spring from the very nature of reason and which cannot be answered because they transcend the powers of human reason nor is human reason to be blamed for this it begins with principles which in the course of experience it must follow and which are sufficiently confirmed by experience with these again according to the necessities of its nature it rises higher and higher to more remote conditions but when it perceives that in this way its work remains for ever incomplete because the questions never cease it finds itself constrained to take refuge in principles which exceed every possible experimental application and nevertheless seem so unobjectionable that even ordinary common sense agrees with them thus however reason becomes involved in darkness and contradictions from which no doubt it may conclude that errors must be lurking somewhere but without being able to discover them because the principles which it follows transcend all the limits of experience and therefore withdraw themselves xviii from all experimental tests it is the battlefield of these endless controversies which is called metaphysic there was a time when metaphysic held a royal place among all the sciences and if the will were taken for the deed the exceeding importance of her subject might well have secured to her that place of honour at present it is the fashion to despise metaphysic and the poor matron forlorn and forsaken complains like hecuba modo maxima rerum tot generis natisque potens — nunc trahor exul inops ovid metam xiii  0  at first the rule of metaphysic under the dominion of the dogmatists was despotic but as the laws still bore the traces of an old barbarism intestine wars and complete anarchy broke out and the sceptics a kind of nomads despising all settled culture of the land broke up from time to time all civil society fortunately their number was small and they could not prevent the old settlers from returning to cultivate the ground afresh though without any fixed plan or agreement not long ago one might have thought indeed that all these quarrels were to have been settled and the legitimacy of her claims decided once for all through a certain physiology of the human understanding the work of the celebrated locke but though the descent of that royal pretender traced back as it had been to the lowest mob of common experience ought to have rendered her claims very suspicious yet as that genealogy turned out to be in reality a false invention the old queen metaphysic continued to maintain her claims everything fell back into the old rotten dogmatism and the contempt from which metaphysical science was to have been rescued remained the same as ever at present after everything has been tried so xix they say and tried in vain there reign in philosophy weariness and complete indifferentism the mother of chaos and night in all sciences but at the same time the spring or at least the prelude of their near reform and of a new light after an illapplied study has rendered them dark confused and useless it is in vain to assume a kind of artificial indifferentism in respect to enquiries the object of which cannot be indifferent to human nature nay those pretended indifferentists however they may try to disguise themselves by changing scholastic terminology into popular language if they think at all fall back inevitably into those very metaphysical dogmas which they profess to despise nevertheless this indifferentism showing itself in the very midst of the most flourishing state of all sciences and affecting those very sciences the teachings of which if they could be had would be the last to be surrendered is a phenomenon well worthy of our attention and consideration it is clearly the result not of the carelessness but of the matured judgment  of our age which will no longer rest satisfied with the mere appearance of knowledge xx it is at the same time a powerful appeal to reason to undertake anew the most difficult of its duties namely selfknowledge and to institute a court of appeal which should protect the just rights of reason but dismiss all groundless claims and should do this not by means of irresponsible decrees but according to the eternal and unalterable laws of reason this court of appeal is no other than the critique of pure reason i do not mean by this a criticism of books and systems but of the faculty of reason in general touching that whole class of knowledge which it may strive after unassisted by experience this must decide the question of the possibility or impossibility of metaphysic in general and the determination of its sources its extent and its limits — and all this according to fixed principles this the only way that was left i have followed and i flatter myself that i have thus removed all those errors which have hitherto brought reason whenever it was unassisted by experience into conflict with itself i have not evaded its questions by pleading the insufficiency of human reason but i have classified them according to principles and after showing the point where reason begins to misunderstand itself solved them satisfactorily it is true that the answer of those questions is not such as a dogmaenamoured curiosity might wish for for such curiosity could not have been satisfied except by juggling tricks in which i am no adept but this was not the intention of the natural destiny of our reason and it became the duty of philosophy to remove the deception which arose from a false interpretation even though many a vaunted and cherished dream should vanish at the same time in this work i have chiefly aimed at xxi completeness and i venture to maintain that there ought not to be one single metaphysical problem that has not been solved here or to the solution of which the key at least has not been supplied in fact pure reason is so perfect a unity that if its principle should prove insufficient to answer any one of the many questions started by its very nature one might throw it away altogether as insufficient to answer the other questions with perfect certainty while i am saying this i fancy i observe in the face of my readers an expression of indignation mixed with contempt at pretensions apparently so selfglorious and extravagant and yet they are in reality far more moderate than those made by the writer of the commonest essay professing to prove the simple nature of the soul or the necessity of a first beginning of the world for while he pretends to extend human knowledge beyond the limits of all possible experience i confess most humbly that this is entirely beyond my power i mean only to treat of reason and its pure thinking a knowledge of which is not very far to seek considering that it is to be found within myself common logic gives an instance how all the simple acts of reason can be enumerated completely and systematically only between the common logic and my work there is this difference that my question is — what can we hope to achieve with reason when all the material and assistance of experience is taken away so much with regard to the completeness in our laying hold of every single object and the thoroughness in our laying hold of all objects as the material of our critical enquiries — a completeness and thoroughness determined not by a casual idea but by the nature of our knowledge itself xxii besides this certainty and clearness with regard to form are two essential demands that may very properly be addressed to an author who ventures on so slippery an undertaking first with regard to certainty i have pronounced judgment against myself by saying that in this kind of enquiries it is in no way permissible to propound mere opinions and that everything looking like a hypothesis is counterband that must not be offered for sale at however low a price but must as soon as it has been discovered be confiscated for every kind of knowledge which professes to be certain a priori proclaims itself that it means to be taken for absolutely necessary and this applies therefore still more to a definition of all pure knowledge a priori which is to be the measure and therefore also an example of all apodictic philosophical certainty whether i have fulfilled what i have here undertaken to do must be left to the judgment of the reader for it only behoves the author to propound his arguments and not to determine beforehand the effect which they ought to produce on his judges but in order to prevent any unnecessary weakening of those arguments he may be allowed to point out himself certain passages which though they refer to collateral objects only might occasion some mistrust and thus to counteract in time the influence which the least hesitation of the reader in respect to these minor points might exercise with regard to the principal object i know of no enquiries which are more important for determining that faculty which we call understanding verstand and for fixing its rules and its limits than those in the second chapter of my transcendental analytic under the title of deduction of the pure concepts xxiii of the understanding they have given me the greatest but i hope not altogether useless trouble this enquiry which rests on a deep foundation has two sides the one refers to the objects of the pure understanding and is intended to show and explain the objective value of its concepts a priori it is therefore of essential importance for my purposes the other is intended to enquire into the pure understanding itself its possibility and the powers of knowledge on which it rests therefore its subjective character a subject which though important for my principal object yet forms no essential part of it because my principal problem is and remains what and how much may understanding verstand and reason vernunft know without all experience and not how is the faculty of thought possible the latter would be an enquiry into a cause of a given effect it would therefore be of the nature of an hypothesis though as i shall show elsewhere this is not quite so and it might seem as if i had here allowed myself to propound a mere opinion leaving the reader free to hold another opinion also i therefore warn the reader in case my subjective deduction should not produce that complete conviction which i expect that the objective deduction in which i am here chiefly concerned must still retain its full strength for this what has been said on pp             may possibly by itself be sufficient secondly as to clearness the reader has a right to demand not only what may be called logical or discursive clearness which is based on concepts but also what may be called æsthetic or intuitive clearness produced by intuitions ie by examples and concrete illustrations with regard to the former i have made ample provision that xxiv arose from the very nature of my purpose but it became at the same time the reason why i could not fully satisfy the latter if not absolute yet very just claim nearly through the whole of my work i have felt doubtful what to do examples and illustrations seemed always to be necessary and therefore found their way into the first sketch of my work but i soon perceived the magnitude of my task and the number of objects i should have to treat and when i saw that even in their driest scholastic form they would considerably swell my book i did not consider it expedient to extend it still further through examples and illustrations required for popular purposes only this work can never satisfy the popular taste and the few who know do not require that help which though it is always welcome yet might here have defeated its very purpose the abbé terrasson  writes indeed that if we measured the greatness of a book not by the number of its pages but by the time we require for mastering it many a book might be said to be much shorter if it were not so short but on the other hand if we ask how a complicated yet in principle coherent whole of speculative thought can best be rendered intelligible we might be equally justified in saying that many a book would have been more intelligible if it had not tried to be so very intelligible for the helps to clearness though they may be missed  with regard to details often distract with regard to the whole the reader does not arrive quickly enough at a survey of the whole because the bright colours xxv of illustrations hide and distort the articulation and concatenation of the whole system which after all if we want to judge of its unity and sufficiency are more important than anything else surely it should be an attraction to the reader if he is asked to join his own efforts with those of the author in order to carry out a great and important work according to the plan here proposed in a complete and lasting manner metaphysic according to the definitions here given is the only one of all sciences which through a small but united effort may count on such completeness in a short time so that nothing will remain for posterity but to arrange everything according to its own views for didactic purposes without being able to add anything to the subject itself for it is in reality nothing but an inventory of all our possessions acquired through pure reason systematically arranged nothing can escape us because whatever reason produces entirely out of itself cannot hide itself but is brought to light by reason itself so soon as the common principle has been discovered this absolute completeness is rendered not only possible but necessary through the perfect unity of this kind of knowledge all derived from pure concepts without any influence from experience or from special intuitions leading to a definite kind of experience that might serve to enlarge and increase it tecum habita et noris quam sit tibi curta supellex persius sat iv    such a system of pure speculative reason i hope myself to produce under the title of metaphysic of nature it will not be half so large yet infinitely richer than this critique of pure reason which has first of all to discover its source nay the conditions of its possibility xxvi in fact to clear and level a soil quite overgrown with weeds here i expect from my readers the patience and impartiality of a judge there the goodwill and aid of a fellowworker for however completely all the principles of the system have been propounded in my critique the completeness of the whole system requires also that no derivative concepts should be omitted such as cannot be found out by an estimate a priori but have to be discovered step by step there the synthesis of concepts has been exhausted here it will be requisite to do the same for their analysis a task which is easy and an amusement rather than a labour i have only a few words to add with respect to the printing of my book as the beginning had been delayed i was not able to see the clean sheets of more than about half of it i now find some misprints though they do not spoil the sense except on p     line   from below where specific should be used instead of sceptic the antinomy of pure reason from p     to p     has been arranged in a tabular form so that all that belongs to the thesis stands on the left what belongs to the antithesis on the right side i did this in order that thesis and antithesis might be more easily compared xxvii translators preface why i thought i might translate kants critique but how can you waste your time on a translation of kants critik der reinen vernunft this question which has been addressed to me by several friends i think i shall best be able to answer in a preface to that translation itself and i shall try to answer it point by point first then with regard to myself why should i waste my time on a translation of kants critik der reinen vernunft — that is were there not other persons more fitted for that task or more specially called upon to undertake it it would be the height of presumption on my part to imagine that there were not many scholars who could have performed such a task as well as myself or far better all i can say is that for nearly thirty years i have been waiting for some one really qualified who would be willing to execute such a task and have waited in vain what i feel convinced of is that an adequate translation of kant must be the work of a german scholar that conviction was deeply impressed on my mind when reading now many years ago kants great work with a small class of young students at oxford — among whom i may mention the names of appleton nettleship and wallace kants style is careless and involved and no wonder that it xxviii should be so if we consider that he wrote down the whole of the critique in not quite five months now beside the thread of the argument itself the safest thread through the mazes of his sentences must be looked for in his adverbs and particles they and they only indicate clearly the true articulation of his thoughts and they alone impart to his phrases that peculiar intonation which tells those who are accustomed to that byeplay of language what the author has really in his mind and what he wants to express if only he could find the right way to do it when reading and critically interpreting kants text i sometimes compared other translations particularly the english translations by haywood and meiklejohn  and excellent as in most places i found their renderings particularly the latter i generally observed that when the thread was lost it was owing to a neglect of particles and adverbs though sometimes also to a want of appreciation of the real and not simply the dictionary meaning of german words it is not my intention to write here a criticism of previous translations on the contrary i should prefer to express my obligation to them for several useful suggestions which i have received from them in the course of what i know to be a most arduous task but in order to give an idea of what i mean by the danger arising from a neglect of adverbs and particles in german i shall mention at least a few of the passages of which i am thinking on p         kant says da also selbst die auflösung xxix dieser aufgaben niemals in der erfahrung vorkommen kann this means as therefore even the solution of these problems can never occur in experience ie as taking experience as it is we have no right even to start such a problem much less to ask for its solution here the particle also implies that the writer after what he has said before feels justified in taking the thing for granted but if we translate although therefore the solution of these problems is unattainable through experience we completely change the drift of kants reasoning he wants to take away that very excuse that there exists only some uncertainty in the solution of these problems by showing that the problems themselves can really never arise and therefore do not require a solution at all kant repeats the same statement in the same page with still greater emphasis when he says die dogmatische auflösung ist also nicht etwa ungewiss sondern unmöglich ie hence the dogmatical solution is not as you imagine uncertain but it is impossible on p         the syntactical structure of the sentence as well as the intention of the writer does not allow of our changing the words so ist es klüglich gehandelt into a question it is the particle so which requires the transposition of the pronoun ist es instead of es ist not the interrogative character of the whole sentence on p  0      wenn cannot be rendered by although which is wenn auch in german wenn beide nach empirischen gesetzen in einer erfahrung richtig und durchgängig zusammenhängen means if both have a proper and thorough coherence in an experience according to empirical laws and not although both have etc sollen is often used in german to express what according xxx to the opinion of certain people is meant to be thus kant on p       0 speaks of the ideals which painters have in their minds and die ein nicht mitzutheilendes schattenbild ihrer producte oder auch beurtheilungen sein sollen that is which according to the artists professions are a kind of vague shadows only of their creations and criticisms which cannot be communicated all this is lost if we translate which can serve neither as a model for production nor as a standard for appreciation it may come to that in the end but it is certainly not the way in which kant arrives at that conclusion on p  0      den einzigmöglichen beweisgrund wofern überall nur ein speculativer beweis statt findet is not incorrectly rendered by the only possible ground of proof possessed by speculative reason yet we lose the thought implied by kants way of expression viz that the possibility of such a speculative proof is very doubtful the same applies to an expression which occurs on p         ein solches schema als ob es ein wirkliches wesen wäre kant speaks of a schema which is conceived to be real but is not so and this implied meaning is blurred if we translate a schema which requires us to regard this ideal thing as an actual existence on p         kant writes methoden die zwar sonst der vernunft aber nur nicht hier wol anpassen this has been translated the methods which are originated by reason but which are out of place in this sphere this is not entirely wrong but it blurs the exact features of the sentence what is really meant is methods which are suitable to reason in other spheres only i believe not here it is curious to observe that kant careless as he xxxi was in the revision of his text struck out wol in the second edition because he may have wished to remove even that slight shade of hesitation which is conveyed by that particle possibly however wol may refer to anpassen ie pulchre convenire the limitation remaining much the same in either case doch is a particle that may be translated in many different ways but it can never be translated by therefore thus when kant writes suppl xiv §    note p     folglich die einheit des bewusstseyns als synthetisch aber doch ursprünglich angetroffen wird he means to convey an opposition between synthetical and primitive ie synthetical and yet primitive to say nevertheless synthetical and therefore primitive conveys the very opposite it may be easily understood that in a metaphysical argument it must cause serious inconvenience if the particle not is either omitted where kant has it or added where kant has it not it is of less consequence if not is omitted in such a passage as for instance where kant says in the preface to the second edition p  0  that the obscurities of the first have given rise to misconceptions without his fault instead of not without his fault but the matter becomes more serious in other places thus supplement xiv §    p     kant says ohne diese tauglichkeit which means unless the categories were adequate for that purpose but not if the categories were adequate again supplement xvib p     kant agrees that space and time cannot be perceived by themselves but not that they can be thus perceived and it must disturb even an attentive reader when on p  0      he reads that the categories must be employed xxxii empirically and cannot be employed transcendentally while kant writes da sie nicht von empirischem gebrauch sein sollen und von transcendentalem nicht sein können as regards single words there are many in german which taken in their dictionary meaning seem to yield a tolerable sense but which throw a much brighter light on a whole sentence if they are understood in their more special idiomatic application thus vorrücken no doubt may mean to place before but jemandem etwas vorrücken means to reproach somebody with something hence p  0  die der rationalen psychologie vorgerückten paralogismen does not mean the paralogisms which immediately precede the rational psychology but the paralogisms with which rational psychology has been reproached on p         nachhängen cannot be rendered by to append er erlaubt der vernunft idealischen erklärungen der natur nachzuhängen means he allows reason to indulge in ideal explanations of nature but not to append idealistic explanations of natural phenomena on p         als ob er die bejahende parthei ergriffen hätte does not mean to attack the position but to adopt the position of the assenting party on p         wie kann ich erwarten does not mean how can i desire but how can i expect which may seem to be not very different but nevertheless gives a wrong turn to a whole argument i have quoted these few passages chiefly in order to show what i mean by the advantages which a german has in translating kant as compared with any other translator who has derived his knowledge of the language from grammars and dictionaries only an accurate and scholarlike xxxiii knowledge of german would no doubt suffice for the translation of historical or scientific works but in order to find our way through the intricate mazes of metaphysical arguments a quick perception of what is meant by the signposts i mean the adverbs and particles and a natural feeling for idiomatic ways of speech seem to me almost indispensable on the other hand i am fully conscious of the advantages which english translators possess by their more perfect command of the language into which foreign thought has to be converted here i at once declare my own inferiority nay i confess that in rendering kants arguments in english i have thought far less of elegance smoothness or rhythm than of accuracy and clearness what i have attempted to do is to give an honest and as far as possible a literal translation and before all a translation that will construe and i venture to say that even to a german student of kant this english translation will prove in many places more intelligible than the german original it is difficult to translate the hymns of the veda and the strains of the upanishads the odes of pindar and the verses of lucretius but i doubt whether the difficulty of turning kants metaphysical german into intelligible and construable english is less nor do i wish my readers to believe that i have never failed in making kants sentences intelligible there are a few sentences in kants critique which i have not been able to construe to my own satisfaction and where none of the friends whom i consulted could help me here all i could do was to give a literal rendering hoping that future editors may succeed in amending the text and extracting from it a more intelligible sense xxxiv why i thought i ought to translate kants critique but my friends in blaming me for wasting my time on a translation of kants critique of pure reason gave me to understand that though i might not be quite unfit i was certainly not specially called upon to undertake such a work it is true no doubt that no one could have blamed me for not translating kant but i should have blamed myself in fact i have blamed myself for many years for not doing a work which i felt must be done sooner or later year after year i hoped i should find leisure to carry out the longcherished plan and when at last the centenary of the publication of kants critik der reinen vernunft drew near i thought i was in honour bound not to delay any longer this tribute to the memory of the greatest philosopher of modern times kants critique has been my constant companion through life it drove me to despair when i first attempted to read it a mere schoolboy during my university days i worked hard at it under weisse lotze and drobisch at leipzig and my first literary attempts in philosophy now just forty years old were essays on kants critique having once learnt from kant what man can and what he cannot know my plan of life was very simple namely to learn so far as literature tradition and language allow us to do so how man came to believe that he could know so much more than he ever can know in religion in mythology and in philosophy this required special studies in the field of the most ancient languages and literatures but though these more special studies drew me away for many years towards distant times and distant countries whatever purpose or method there may have been in the work of my life was due to my beginning life with kant xxxv even at oxford whether i had to lecture on german literature or on the science of language i have often in season and out of season been preaching kant and nothing i have missed so much when wishing to come to an understanding on the great problems of life with some of my philosophical friends in england than the common ground which is supplied by kant for the proper discussion of every one of them we need not be blind worshippers of kant but if for the solution of philosophical problems we are to take any welldefined stand we must in this century of ours take our stand on kant kants language and by language i mean more than mere words has become the lingua franca of modern philosophy and not to be able to speak it is like studying ancient philosophy without being able to speak aristotle or modern philosophy without being able to speak descartes what rosenkranz the greatest among hegels disciples said in      is almost as true today as it was then engländer franzosen und italiener müssen wenn sie vorwärts wollen denselben schritt thun den kant schon      machte nur so können sie sich von ihrer dermaligen schlechten metaphysik und den aus einer solchen sich ergebenden schlechten consequenzen befreien it is hardly necessary at the present day to produce any arguments in support of such a view the number of books on kants philosophy published during the last century in almost every language of the world  speaks for itself there is no single philosopher of any note even among those who are decidedly opposed to kant who has xxxvi not acknowledged his preeminence among modern philosophers the great systems of fichte schelling hegel herbart and schopenhauer branched off from kant and now after a century has passed away people begin to see that those systems were indeed mighty branches but that the leading shoot of philosophy was and is still — kant no truer word has lately been spoken than what i believe was first said by professor weisse  in the philosophical society at leipzig of which i was then a member and was again more strongly enforced by my friend and former colleague professor liebmann of strassburg that if philosophy wishes to go forward it must go back to kant il faut reculer pour mieux sauter lange in his history of materialism calls kant the copernicus of modern philosophy aye kant himself was so fully conscious of the decentralising character of his system that he did not hesitate to compare his work with that of copernicus  but if kant was right in his estimate of his own philosophy it cannot be denied that with but few though memorable exceptions philosophy in england is still antekantian or antecopernican how little kant is read by those who ought to read him or how little he is understood by those who venture to criticise him i never felt so keenly as when in a controversy which i had some time ago with mr herbert spencer i was told that space could not be an a priori intuition because we may hear churchbells without knowing where the belfry stands two philosophers who both have read kants critique may differ from each other diametrically but they will at least understand each other they will not fire at each xxxvii other like some of the german students who for fear of killing their adversary fire their pistols at right angles thus endangering the life of their seconds rather than that of their adversaries this will explain why for a long time i have felt personally called upon to place the classical work of kant within the reach of all philosophical readers in england so that no one could say any longer that he could not construe it i thought for a time that professor cairds excellent work on the philosophy of kant had relieved me of this duty and no doubt that work has told and has opened the eyes of many people in england and in america to the fact that whatever we may think of all the outworks of kants philosophy there is in it a central thought which forms a real rest and an entrenched ground in the onward march of the human intellect but it is a right sentiment after all that it is better to read a book than to read about it and that as my friend stanley used to preach again and again we should never judge of a book unless we have read the whole of it ourselves i therefore pledged myself to finish a new translation of kants critique as my contribution to the celebration of its centenary and though it has taken more time and more labour than i imagined i do not think my time or my labour will have been wasted if only people in england and in america too will now read the book that is a hundred years old and yet as young and fresh as ever so far i have spoken of myself and more perhaps than a wise man at my time of life ought to do but i have still to say a few words to explain why i think that if the time which i have bestowed on this undertaking has xxxviii not been wasted others also and not philosophers by profession only will find that i have not wasted their time by inducing them at the present time to read kants masterwork in a faithful english rendering why a study of kants critique seemed necessary at present it is curious that in these days the idea of development which was first elaborated by the students of philosophy language and religion and afterwards applied with such brilliant success to the study of nature also should receive so little favour from the very sciences which first gave birth to it long before we heard of evolution in nature we read of the dialectical evolution of thought and its realisation in history and nature the history of philosophy was then understood to represent the continuous development of philosophical thought and the chief object of the historian was to show the necessity with which one stage of philosophical thought led to another this idea of rational development which forms a far broader and safer basis than that of natural development is the vital principle in the study of the human mind quite as much if not more than in the study of nature a study of language of mythology of religion and philosophy which does not rest on the principle of development does not deserve the name of a science the chief interest which these sciences possess is not that they show us isolated and barren facts but that they show us their origin and growth and explain to us how what is was the necessary result of what was in drawing the stemma of languages mythological formations religious beliefs and xxxix philosophical ideas science may go wrong and often has gone wrong so have students of nature in drawing their stemmata of plants and animals and human beings but the principle remains true for all that in spite of all that seems to be accidental or arbitrary there is a natural and intelligible growth in what we call the creations of the human mind quite as much as in what we call the works of nature the one expression it may be said is as mythological as the other because the category of substance cannot apply to either nature or mind both however express facts which must be explained nay it is the chief object of science to explain them and to explain them genetically is aristotle possible or intelligible without plato is spinoza possible or intelligible without descartes is hume possible or intelligible without berkeley is kant possible or intelligible without hume these are broad questions and admit of one answer only but if we have once seen how the broad stream of thought follows its natural bent flows onward and never backward we shall understand that it is as much the duty of the science of thought to trace the unbroken course of philosophy from thales to kant as it is the duty of natural science to trace the continuous development of the single cell to the complicated organism of an animal body or the possible metamorphosis of the hipparion into the hippos what i wanted therefore as an introduction to my translation of kants critique was a pedigree of philosophical thought showing kants ancestors and kants descent here too professor cairds work seemed to me at one time to have done exactly what i wished to see done valuable however as professor cairds work is on xl all sides acknowledged to be i thought that an even more complete list of kantian ancestors might and should be given and what weighed even more with me that these ancestors should be made to speak to us more in their own words than professor caird has allowed them to do at my time of life and in the midst of urgent work i felt quite unequal to that task and i therefore applied to professor noiré who more than any other philosopher i know seemed to me qualified to carry out that idea kants philosophy and more particularly the antecedents of kants philosophy had been his favourite study for life and no one as i happened to know possessed better materials than he did for giving in a short compass the ipsissima verba by which each of kants ancestors had made and marked his place in the history of thought professor noiré readily complied with my request and supplied a treatise which i hope will fully accomplish what i had in view the translation was entrusted by him to one of the most distinguished translators of philosophical works in england and though the exactness and gracefulness peculiar to professor noirés german style could hardly have full justice done to them in an english rendering particularly as the constant introduction of the verba ipsissima of various authors cannot but disturb the unity of the diction i hope that many of my english readers will feel the same gratitude to him which i have here to express for his kind and ready help  if then while making allowance for differences of opinion on smaller points we have convinced ourselves that kant is the last scion of that noble family of thinkers xli which professor noiré has drawn for us with the hand of a master what follows does it follow that we should all and on all points become kantians that we should simply learn his philosophy and be thankful that we know now all that can be known about the freedom of the will the immortality of the soul and the existence of god far from it no one would protest more strongly than kant himself against what he so well calls learning philosophy as opposed to being a philosopher all i contend for is that in our own modern philosophy the work done once for all by kant should be as little ignored as the work done by hume leibniz berkeley locke spinoza and descartes i do not deny the historical importance of the postkantian systems of philosophy whether of fichte schelling hegel herbart or schopenhauer in germany of cousin in france or of mill in england but most of these philosophers recognised kant as their spiritual father  even comte ignorant as he was of german and german philosophy expressed his satisfaction and pride when he discovered how near he had though unconsciously approached to kants philosophy  xlii some years ago i pointed out that as far as amid the varying aspects of his philosophical writings it was possible to judge mr herbert spencer also in what he calls his transfigured realism was not very far from kants fundamental position mr herbert spencer however has repudiated what i thought the highest compliment that could be paid to any writer on philosophy and i gladly leave it to others to judge but although whether consciously or unconsciously all truly important philosophers have since the publication of the critique of pure reason been more or less under the spell of kant and indirectly of hume and berkeley also this does not mean that they have not asserted their right of reopening questions which seemed to be solved and settled by those heroes in the history of human thought only if any of these old problems are to be taken up again they ought at least to be taken up where they were last left unless that is done philosophy will become a mere amusement and will in no wise mark the deep vestiges in the historical progress of the human intellect there are anachronisms in philosophy quite as much as in other sciences and the spirit in which certain philosophical problems have of late been treated both in england and in germany is really no better than a revival of the ptolemaic system would be in astronomy no wonder therefore that in both countries we should meet with constant xliii complaints about this state of philosophical anarchy mr challis in one of the last numbers of the contemporary review november      writes it is another familiar fact a much more important one that the present state of philosophy is exactly parallel to the present state of theology — a chaos of conflicting schools each able to edify itself without convincing any other every one regarding all the rest not as witnesses against itself but as food for dialectical powder and shot the impartial bystander sees no sign that we are now nearer to agreement than in the days of varro though the enthusiast of a school expects the world to be all some day of his opinion just as the enthusiast of a sect believes vaguely in an ultimate triumph of his faith exactly the same complaint reaches us from the very country where kants voice was once so powerful and respected then was silenced for a time and now begins to be invoked again for the purpose of restoring order where all seems confusion since the year    0 writes dr vaihinger there has been hopeless philosophical anarchy in germany there were the disciples of schelling hegel herbart and schopenhauer and by their side the founders and defenders of many unknown systems of philosophy then followed the socalled realidealists or idealrealists who distilled a philosophical theism out of the pantheism of greater thinkers and as their antipodes the materialists who on the new discoveries of natural science founded the saddest shallowest and emptiest system of philosophy  in england and america even more than in germany i believe that a study of kant holds out the best hope of xliv a philosophical rejuvenescence in germany a return to kant has brought about a kind of renaissance in england and america kants philosophy if once thoroughly understood will constitute i hope a new birth no doubt there are and there have been in every country of europe some few honest students who perfectly understood kants real position in the onward march of human thought but to the most fertile writers on philosophy and to the general public at large which derives its ideas of philosophy from them kants philosophy has not only been a terra incognita but the very antipodes of what it really is mr watson in his instructive work kant and his english critics is perfectly right when he says that till very lately kant was regarded as a benighted a priori philosopher of the dogmatic type afflicted with the hallucination that the most important part of our knowledge consists of innate ideas lying in the depths of consciousness and being capable of being brought to the light by pure introspection that kant was the legitimate successor of hume on one side and of berkeley on the other was hardly conceived as possible and thus it has happened that english philosophy in spite of the large number of profound thinkers and brilliant writers who have served in its ranks during the last hundred years has not yet risen above the level of locke and hume no one can admire more than i do the dashing style in which some of the most popular writers of our time have ridden up to the very muzzles of the old philosophical problems but if i imagine kant looking back from his elevated position on those fierce and hopeless onslaughts i can almost hear him say what was said by a french general at balaclava cest magnifique — mais ce nest pas la guerre quite xlv true it is that but for hume and but for berkeley kant would never have been and philosophy would never have reached the heights which he occupies but after kant hume and berkeley have both an historical significance only they represent a position which has been conquered and fortified and has now been deliberately left behind professor noiré when he had written for this work the antecedents of kants philosophy sent me another most valuable contribution containing a full analysis of that philosophy considered not only as the continuation but as the fulfilment of all other philosophical systems and more particularly of the systems of berkeley and hume for that work it was unfortunately impossible to find room in these volumes but i still hope that it will not be withheld in german at least from those who both in england and germany have learnt to appreciate professor noirés accurate and luminous statements leaving therefore the task of tracing minutely the intimate relation between kant and his predecessors to the more experienced hand of my friend i shall here be satisfied with pointing out in the broadest way the connection and at the same time the diametrical opposition between kant and those two great heroes of speculative thought berkeley and hume berkeley holds that all knowledge that seems to come to us from without through the senses or through experience is mere illusion and that truth exists in the ideas of the pure understanding and of reason only kant proves that all knowledge that comes to us from pure understanding and from pure reason only is mere illusion and that truth is impossible without experience xlvi hume holds that true causality is impossible whether in experience or beyond experience kant proves that experience itself is impossible without the category of causality and of course without several other categories also which hume had overlooked though they possess exactly the same character as the concept of causality  the gist of kants philosophy as opposed to that of hume can be expressed in one line that without which experience is impossible cannot be the result of experience though it must never be applied beyond the limits of possible experience such broad statements and counterstatements may seem to destroy the finer shades of philosophical thought yet in the end even the most complicated and elaborate systems of philosophy rest on such broad foundations and what we carry about with us of plato or aristotle of descartes or leibniz consists in the end of little more than a few simple outlines of the grand structures of their philosophical thoughts and in that respect no system admits of being traced in simpler and broader outlines than that of kant voluminous and complicated it is and yet kant himself traces in a few lines the outcome of it when he says critique p       0 but it will be said is this really all that pure reason can achieve in opening prospects beyond the limits of experience nothing more than two articles of faith surely even the ordinary understanding could have achieved as much without taking counsel of philosophers xlvii i shall not here dwell on the benefits he answers which by the laborious efforts of its criticism philosophy has conferred on human reason granting even that in the end they should turn out to be merely negative on this point something will have to be said in the next section but i ask do you really require that knowledge which concerns all men should go beyond the common understanding and should be revealed to you by philosophers only the very thing which you find fault with is the best confirmation of the correctness of our previous assertions since it reveals to us what we could not have grasped before namely that in matters which concern all men without distinction nature cannot be accused of any partial distribution of her gifts and that with regard to the essential interests of human nature the highest philosophy can achieve no more than that guidance which nature has vouchsafed even to the meanest understanding i hope that the time will come when kants works and more particularly his critique of pure reason will be read not only by the philosopher by profession but by everybody who has once seen that there are problems in this life of ours the solution of which alone makes life worth living these problems as kant so often tells us are all the making of reason and what reason has made reason is able to unmake these problems represent in fact the mythology of philosophy that is the influence of dying or dead language on the living thought of each successive age and an age which has found the key to the ancient mythology of religion will know where to look for the key that is to unlock the mythology of pure reason kant has shown us what can and what cannot be known by man what remains to be done even after kant is to xlviii show how man came to believe that he could know so much more than he can know and this will have to be shown by a critique of language  how strange it is that kants great contemporary the magus of the north should have seen this at once and that for a whole century his thought has remained dormant language hamann writes is not only the foundation for the whole faculty of thinking but the central point also from which proceeds the misunderstanding of reason by herself and again  the question with me is not what is reason but what is language and here i suspect is the ground of all paralogisms and antinomies with which reason has been charged and again hence i feel almost inclined to believe that our whole philosophy consists more of language than of reason and the misunderstanding of numberless words the prosopopœias of the most arbitrary abstraction the antithesis τη̂ ς ψευδωνύμου γνώσεως nay the commonest figures of speech of the sensus communis have produced a whole world of problems which can no more be raised than solved what we want is a grammar of reason that kants critique will ever become a popular book in the ordinary sense of the word is impossible but that xlix it will for ever occupy a place in the small tourists library which every thoughtful traveller across this short lifes journey will keep by his side i have no doubt kant it must be admitted was a bad writer but so was aristotle so was descartes so was liebniz so was hegel and after a time as in climbing a mountain the very roughness of the road becomes an attraction to the traveller besides though kant is a bad builder he is not a bad architect and there will be few patient readers of the critique who will fail to understand goethes expression that on reading kant or rather i should say on reading kant again and again we feel like stepping into a lighted room i have tried hard very hard to remove some of the darkness which has hitherto shrouded kants masterwork from english readers and though i know how often i have failed to satisfy myself i still hope i shall not have laboured quite in vain englishmen who in the turmoil of this century found leisure and mental vigour enough to study once more the thoughts of plato and perceiving their bearing on the thoughts of our age may well brace themselves to the harder work of discovering in kant the solution of many of the oldest problems of our race problems which with most of us are still the problems of yesterday and of today i am well aware that for kant there is neither the prestige of a name such as plato nor the cunning of a translator such as jowett but a thinker who in germany could make himself listened to during the philosophical apathy of the wolfian age who from his ultima thule of königsberg could spring forward to grasp the rudder of a vessel cast away as unseaworthy by no less a captain than hume and who has stood at the helm for more than a century trusted by all whose trust was worth having l will surely find in england too patient listeners even though they might shrink as yet from embarking in his good ship in their passage across the ocean of life kants metaphysic in relation to physical science we live in an age of physical discovery and of complete philosophical prostration and thus only can we account for the fact that physical science and more particularly physiology should actually have grasped at the sceptre of philosophy nothing i believe could be more disastrous to both sciences no one who knows my writings will suspect me of undervaluing the progress which physical studies have made in our time or of ignoring the light which they have shed on many of the darkest problems of the mind only let us not unnecessarily move the old landmarks of human knowledge there always has been and there always must be a line of demarcation between physical and metaphysical investigations and though the former can illustrate the latter they can never take their place nothing can be more interesting for instance than recent researches into the exact processes of sensuous perception optics and acoustics have carried us deep into the inner workings of our bodily senses and have enabled us to understand what we call colours and sounds as vibrations definite in number carried on from the outer organs through vibrating media to the brain and the inmost centre of all nervous activity such observations have no doubt made it more intelligible even to the commonest understanding what metaphysicians mean when they call all secondary qualities subjective and deny that anything can li be for instance green or sweet anywhere but in the perceiving subject but the idea that these physical and physiological researches have brought us one inch nearer to the real centre of subjective perception that any movement of matter could in any way explain the simplest sensuous perception or that behind the membranes and nerves we should ever catch hold of what we call the soul or the i or the self need only to be stated to betray its utter folly that men like helmholtz and du boisreymond should find kants metaphysical platform best adapted for supporting their physical theories is natural enough but how can any one who weighs his words say that the modern physiology of the senses has in any way supplemented or improved kants theory of knowledge  as well might we say that spectrum analysis has improved our logic or the electric light supplemented our geometry empirical psychology as kant says must be entirely banished from metaphysic and is excluded from it by its very idea  metaphysical truth is wider than physical truth and the new discoveries of physical observers if they are to be more than merely contingent truths must find their appointed place and natural refuge within the immoveable limits traced by the metaphysician it was an unfortunate accident that gave to what ought to have been called prophysical the name of metaphysical science for it is only after having mastered the principles of metaphysic that the student of nature can begin his work in the right spirit knowing the horizon of human knowledge and guided by principles as unchangeable as the polestar it would be lii childish to make this a question of rank or precedence it is simply a question of work and order it may require for instance a greater effort and display more brilliant mental qualities to show that nature contains no traces of repeated acts of special creation than to prove that such a theory would make all unity of experience and consequently all science impossible but what are all the negative arguments of the mere observer without the solid foundation supplied by the metaphysician and with how much more of tranquil assurance would the geologist pursue his observations and develop his conclusions if he just remembered these few lines of kant when such an arising is looked upon as the effect of a foreign cause it is called creation this can never be admitted as an event among phenomena because its very possibility would destroy unity of experience  what can have been more delightful to the unprejudiced observer than the gradual diminution of the enormous number of what were called by students of nature who had never troubled their heads about the true meaning of these terms genera and species but when the true meaning and thereby the true origin of genera and species was to be determined is it not strange that not one word should ever have been said on the subjective character of these terms whatever else a genus or species may be surely they are first of all concepts of the understanding and without these concepts whatever nature might present to us nothing would ever be to us a genus or a species genus and species in that restricted sense as applied to organic beings represent only one side of that fundamental process on which all thought is founded namely liii the conception of the general and the special here again a few pages of kant  would have shown that the first thing to be explained is the process by which we conceive the genus or the general and that the only adequate explanation of it is what kant calls its transcendental deduction ie the proof that without it experience itself would be impossible and that therefore so far from being a concept abstracted from experience it is a sine qua non of experience itself if this is once clearly understood it will be equally understood that as we are the makers of all concepts we are also the makers of genera and species and that long before logicians came to define and deface these terms they were what we now are anxious to make them again terms for objects which have either a common origin or a common form long before aristotle forced the terms γένος and εἰ̂δος to assume a subordinate relation to each other language or the historical logic of the human race had formed these terms and meant them to be not subordinate but coordinate genos meant kin and the first genos was the gens or the family comprehending individuals that could claim a common ancestor though differing in appearance as much as a grandfather and a babe eidos or species on the contrary meant appearance or form and the first eidos was probably the troop of warriors comprehending individuals of uniform appearance nothing being asserted as to their common origin this was the historic or prehistoric beginning of these two fundamental categories of thought — and what has the theory of evolution really done for them it has safely brought them back to their original liv meaning it has shown us that we can hold together or comprehend or conceive or classify or generalise or speak in two ways and in two ways only — either by common descent genealogically or by common appearance morphologically difference of form is nothing if we classify genealogically and difference of descent is nothing if we classify morphologically what the theory of evolution is doing for us is what is done by every genealogist aye what was done in ancient time by every paterfamilias namely to show by facts that certain individuals however different from each other in form and appearance had a common ancestor and belonged therefore to the same family or kin in every case where such proof has been given we gain in reality a more correct general concept ie we are able to think and to speak better the process is the same whether we trace the bourbons and valois back to hugo capet or whether we derive the hippos and the hipparion from a common ancestor in both cases we are dealing with facts and with facts only let it be established that there is no missing link between them or between man and monkey and we shall simply have gained a new concept as we should gain a new concept by establishing the unbroken continuity of the apostolic succession only let us see clearly that in physical and historical researches too we are dealing with facts and with facts only which cannot excite any passion and that the wider issues as to the origin of genera and species belong to a different sphere of human knowledge and after having been debated for centuries have been determined once for all by kants critique of pure reason if one remembers the dustclouds of words that were raised when the question of the origin of species was lv mooted once more in our days it is truly refreshing to read a few of kants calm pages on that subject written one hundred years ago reason  he writes prepares the field for the understanding  st through the principle of homogeneousness of the manifold as arranged under higher genera  ndly through the principle of the variety of the homogeneous in lower species to which  rdly it adds a law of affinity of all concepts which requires a continual transition from every species to every other species by a gradual increase of diversity we may call these the principles of homogeneousness of specification and of continuity of forms and with reference to the practical application of these metaphysical principles to the study of nature he writes again with true philosophical insight  i often see even intelligent men quarrelling with each other about the characteristic distinctions of men animals or plants nay even of minerals the one admitting the existence of certain national characteristics founded on descent or decided and inherited differences of families races etc while others insist that nature has made the same provision for all and that all differences are due to accidental environment but they need only consider the peculiar character of the matter in order to understand that it is far too deeply hidden for both of them to enable them to speak from any real insight into the nature of the object it is nothing but the twofold interest of reason one party cherishing the one another party the other or pretending to do so but this difference of the two maxims of manifoldness and unity in nature may easily be adjusted lvi though as long as they are taken for objective knowledge they cause not only disputes but actually create impediments which hinder the progress of truth until a means is found of reconciling the contradictory interests and thus giving satisfaction to reason the same applies to the assertion or denial of the famous law of the continuous scale of created beings first advanced by leibniz and so cleverly trimmed up by bonnet it is nothing but a carrying out of the principle of affinity resting on the interest of reason for neither observation nor insight into the constitution of nature could ever have supplied it as an objective assertion the steps of such a ladder as far as they can be supplied by experience are far too wide apart from each other and the socalled small differences are often in nature itself such wide gaps that no value can be attached to such observations as revealing the intentions of nature particularly as it must always be easy to discover certain similarities and approximations in the great variety of things the method on the contrary of looking for order in nature according to such a principle and the maxim of admitting such order though it may be uncertain where and how far as existing in nature in general is certainly a legitimate and excellent regulative principle of reason only that as such it goes far beyond where experience or observation could follow it it only indicates the way which leads to systematical unity but does not determine anything beyond i know of course what some of my philosophical friends will say you speak of thoughts they will say we speak of facts you begin with the general we begin with the particular you trust to reason we trust to our lvii senses let me quote in reply one of the most positive of positive philosophers one who trusts to the senses who begins with the particular and who speaks of facts condillac in his famous essai sur lorigine des connaissances humaines writes soit que nous élevions pour parler métaphoriquement jusque dans les cieux soit que nous descendions dans les abîmes nous ne sortons pas de nousmêmes et ce nest jamais que notre pensée que nous apercevons this was written in      and what applies to these applies to almost all other problems of the day instead of being discussed by themselves and with a heat and haste as if they had never been discussed before they should be brought back to the broader ground from which they naturally arise and be treated by the light of true philosophy and the experience gained in former ages there is a solid ground formed by the thoughts of those who came before us a kind of intellectual humus on which we ourselves must learn to march on cautiously yet safely without needing those high stilts which seem to lift our modern philosophers above the level of locke and hume and kant and promise to enable them to advance across the unknown and the unknowable with wider strides than were ever attempted by such men as faraday or lyell or darwin but which invariably fall away when they are most needed and leave our bold speculators to retrace their steps as best they can kants philosophy as judged by history if my translation of kant were intended for a few professional philosophers only i should not feel bound to produce any credentials in his favour but the few true lviii students of philosophy in england do not want a translation they would as little attempt to study kant without knowing german as to study plato without knowing greek what i want and what i hope for is that that large class of men and women whose thoughts consciously or unconsciously are still rooted in the philosophy of the last century and who still draw their intellectual nutriment from the philosophical soil left by locke and hume should know that there is a greater than locke or hume though himself the avowed pupil and the truest admirer of those powerful teachers kant is not a man that requires testimonials we might as well require testimonials of plato or spinoza but to the english reader it may be of interest to hear at least a few of the utterances of the great men whose merit it is to have discovered kant a discovery that may well be called the discovery of a new world what goethe said of kant we have mentioned before schiller after having declared that he was determined to master kants critique and if it were to cost him the whole of his life says the fundamental ideas of kants ideal philosophy will remain a treasure for ever and for their sake alone we ought to be grateful to have been born in this age strange it is to see how orthodox theologians from mere laziness it would seem in mastering kants doctrines raised at once a clamour against the man who proved to be their best friend but whose last years of life they must needs embitter one of the most religious and most honest of kants contemporaries however jung stilling whose name is well known in england also quickly perceived the true bearing of the critique of pure lix reason in a letter dated march        jung stilling writes to kant you are a great a very great instrument in the hand of god i do not flatter — but your philosophy will work a far greater far more general and far more blessed revolution than luthers reform as soon as one has well comprehended the critique of reason one sees that no refutation of it is possible your philosophy must therefore be eternal and unchangeable and its beneficent effects will bring back the religion of jesus to its original purity when its only purpose was — holiness fichte no mean philosopher himself and on many points the antagonist of kant writes kants philosophy will in time overshadow the whole human race and call to life a new more noble and more worthy generation jean paul friedrich richter speaks of kant not only as a light of the world but as a whole solar system in one with more suppressed yet no less powerful appreciation wilhelm von humboldt writes of him some things which he demolished will never rise again some things which he founded will never perish again a reform such as he carried through is rare in the history of philosophy schopenhauer the most fearless critic of kants critique calls it the highest achievement of human reflection what he has written of kant is indispensable indeed to every student of the critique and i deeply regret that i could not have added to my translation of kant a translation of schopenhauers critical remarks i must add however one paragraph never schopenhauer writes in his parerga       never will a philosopher without an independent zealous and often repeated study of the principal works of kant gain any idea of this lx most important of all philosophical phenomena kant is i believe the most philosophical head that nature has ever produced to think with him and according to his manner is something that cannot be compared to anything else for he possessed such an amount of clear and quite peculiar thoughtfulness as has never been granted to any other mortal we are enabled to enjoy this with him if initiated by patient and serious study we succeed while reading the profoundest chapters of the critique of pure reason in forgetting ourselves and thinking really with kants own head thus being lifted high above ourselves if we go once more through the principles of pure reason and more particularly the analogies of experience and enter into the deep thought of the synthetical unity of apperception we feel as if lifted miraculously and carried away out of the dreamy existence in which we are here lost and as if holding in our hands the very elements out of which that dream consists if in conclusion we look at some of the historians of modern philosophy we find erdmann though a follower of hegel speaking of kant as the atlas that supports the whole of german philosophy fortlage the nestor of german philosophers  who wrote what he calls a genetic history of philosophy since kant speaks of him in the following terms in one word kants system is the gate through which everything that has stirred the philosophical world since his time comes and goes it is the universal exchange where all circulating ideas flow together before they vanish again in distant places it is the london of philosophy sending its ships into every part of the world and after a time lxi receiving them back there is no place in the whole globe of human thought which it has not visited explored and colonised in more homely language professor caird expresses much the same idea of kants philosophy when he says p   0 so much has kants fertile idea changed the aspect of the intellectual world that there is not a single problem of philosophy that does not meet us with a new face and it is perhaps not unfair to say that the speculations of all those who have not learned the lesson of kant are beside the point dr vaihinger who has devoted his life to the study of kant and is now bringing out a commentary in four volumes on his critique of pure reason  sums up his estimate in the following words the critique is a work to which whether we look to the grandeur of conception or the accuracy of thought or the weight of ideas or the power of language few only can be compared — possibly platos republic aristotles metaphysics spinozas ethics — none if we consider their lasting effect their penetrating and farreaching influence their wealth of thought and their variety of suggestions  nearly the same judgment is repeated by vacherot  who speaks of the critique as un livre immortel comme lorganum de bacon et le discours de la méthode de descartes while professor noiré with his wider sympathies for every sphere of intellectual activity counts six books in the literature of modern europe as the peers of kants lxii critique viz copernicus de revolutionibus orbium cœlestium      descartes meditationes de prima philosophia      newton principia philosophiæ naturalis mathematica      montesquieu esprit des lois      winckelmann geschichte der kunst des alterthums      and adam smith inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations      — but he places kants critique at the head of them all i confess i feel almost ashamed lest it should be supposed that i thought kant in need of these testimonies my only excuse is that i had to defend myself against the suspicion of having wasted my time and i therefore thought that by pointing out the position assigned to kants critique among the masterworks of human genius by men of greater weight than i could ever venture to claim for myself i might best answer the kindly meant question addressed to me by my many friends but how can you waste your time on a translation of kants critik der reinen vernunft on the text of kants critique of pure reason i have still to say a few words on the german text on which my translation is founded i have chosen the text of the first edition first of all because it was the centenary of that edition which led me to carry out at last my longcherished idea of an english translation that text represents an historical event it represents the state of philosophy as it was then it represents kants mind as it was then at the moment of the greatest crisis in the history of philosophy even if the later editions contained improvements these improvements lxiii would belong to a later phase in kants own development and it is this first decisive position as taken by kant against both hume and berkeley that more than anything else deserves to be preserved in the history of philosophy secondly i must confess that i have always used myself the first edition of kants critique and that when i came to read the second edition i never could feel so at home in it as in the first the first edition seems to me cut out of one block the second always leaves on my mind the impression of patchwork thirdly i certainly dislike in the second edition a certain apologetic tone quite unworthy of kant he had evidently been attacked by the old wolfian professors and also by the orthodox clergy he knew that these attacks were groundless and arose in fact from an imperfect understanding of his work on the part of his critics he need not have condescended to show that he was as wellschooled a philosopher as any of his learned colleagues or that his philosophy would really prove extremely useful to orthodox clergymen in their controversies with sceptics and unbelievers so far and so far only can i understand the feeling against the second edition which is shared by some of the most accurate and earnest students of kant but i have never been able to understand the exaggerated charges which schopenhauer and others bring against kant both for the omissions and the additions in that second edition what i can understand and fully agree with is jacobis opinion when he says  i consider the loss which the second edition of kants critique suffered by omissions and changes very considerable and i am lxiv very anxious by the expression of my opinion to induce readers who seriously care for philosophy and its history to compare the first edition of the critique of pure reason with the second improved edition    it is not sufficiently recognised what an advantage it is to study the systems of great thinkers in their first original form i was told by hamann that the very judicious ch j krause or kraus could never sufficiently express his gratitude for having been made acquainted with humes first philosophical work treatise on human nature      where alone he had found the right point of view for judging the later essays nor do i differ much from michelet in his history of the later systems of philosophy in germany      vol i p    where he says much that is of a more speculative character in the representation of kants system has been taken from the first edition it can no longer be found in the second and later editions which as well as the prolegomena keep the idealistic tendency more in the background because kant saw that this side of his philosophy had lent itself most to attacks and misunderstandings i can also understand schopenhauer when he states that many things that struck him as obscure and selfcontradictory in kants critique ceased to be so when he came to read that work in its first original form but everything else that schopenhauer writes on the difference between the first and second editions of the critique seems to me perfectly intolerable kant in the preface to his second edition which was published six years after the first in      gives a clear and straightforward account of the changes which he introduced my new representation lxv he writes changes absolutely nothing with regard to my propositions and even the arguments in their support he had nothing to retract but he thought he had certain things to add and he evidently hoped he could render some points of his system better understood his freedom of thought his boldness of speech and his love of truth are if i am any judge in these matters the same in      as in      the active reactionary measures of the prussian government by which kant is supposed to have been frightened date from a later period zedlitz kants friend and protector was not replaced by wöllner as minister till      it was not till      that kant was really warned and reprimanded by the cabinet and we must not judge too harshly of the old philosopher when at his time of life and in the then state of paternal despotism in prussia he wrote back to say that he would do even more than was demanded of him and abstain in future from all public lectures concerning religion whether natural or revealed what he at that time felt in his heart of hearts we know from some remarks found after his death among his papers it is dishonourable he writes to retract or deny ones real convictions but silence in a case like my own is the duty of a subject and though all we say must be true it is not our duty to declare publicly all that is true kant never retracted he never even declared himself no longer responsible for any one of those portions of the critique which he omitted in the second edition on the contrary he asked his readers to look for them in the first edition and only expressed a regret that there was no longer room for them in the second edition now let us hear what schopenhauer says he not only lxvi calls the second edition crippled disfigured and corrupt but imputes motives utterly at variance with all we know of the truthful manly and noble character of kant schopenhauer writes what induced kant to make these changes was fear of man produced by weakness of old age which not only affects the head but sometimes deprives the heart also of that firmness which alone enables us to despise the opinions and motives of our contemporaries as they deserve to be no one can be great without that all this is simply abominable first of all as a matter of fact kant when he published his second edition had not yet collapsed under the weakness of old age he was about sixty years of age and that age so far from making cowards of us gives to most men greater independence and greater boldness than can be expected from the young who are awed by the authority of their seniors and have often to steer their course prudently through the conflicts of parties and opinions  what is the use of growing old if not to gain greater confidence in our opinions and to feel justified in expressing them with perfect freedom and as to that firmness which alone enables us to despise the opinions and motives of our contemporaries let us hope that that is neither a blessing of youth nor of old age schopenhauer personally no doubt had a right to complain of his contemporaries but he would have been greater if he had despised them either less or more or at all events if he had despised them in silence i am really reluctant to translate all that follows and lxvii yet as schopenhauers view has found so many echoes it seems necessary to let him have his say kant had been told he continues that his system was only a réchauffé of berkeleys idealism this seemed to him to endanger that invaluable and indispensable originality which every founder of a system values so highly see prolegomena zu jeder künftigen metaphysik pp  0  0  sq at the same time he had given offence in other quarters by his upsetting of some of the sacred doctrines of the old dogmas particularly of those of rational psychology add to this that the great king the friend of light and protector of truth had just died      kant allowed himself to be intimidated by all this and had the weakness to do what was unworthy of him this consists in his having entirely changed the first chapter of the second book of the transcendental dialectic first ed p     leaving out fiftyseven pages which contained what was indispensable for a clear understanding of the whole work and by the omission of which as well as by what he put in its place his whole doctrine becomes full of contradictions these i pointed out in my critique of kant pp       because at that time in      i had never seen the first edition in which they are really not contradictions but agree perfectly with the rest of his work in truth the second edition is like a man who has had one leg amputated and replaced by a wooden one in the preface to the second edition p xlii kant gives hollow nay untrue excuses for the elimination of that important and extremely beautiful part of his book he does not confessedly wish that what was omitted should be thought to have been retracted by him people might read it in the first edition he says he had lxviii wanted room for new additions and nothing had been changed and improved except the representation of his system but the dishonesty of this plea becomes clear if we compare the second with the first edition there in the second edition he has not only left out that important and beautiful chapter and inserted under the same title another half as long and much less significant but he has actually embodied in that second edition a refutation of idealism which says the very contrary of what had been said in the omitted chapter and defends the very errors which before he had thoroughly refuted thus contradicting the whole of his own doctrine this refutation of idealism is so thoroughly bad such palpable sophistry nay in part such a confused galimatias that it is unworthy of a place in his immortal work conscious evidently of its insufficiency kant has tried to improve it by the alteration of one passage see preface p xxxix and by a long and confused note but he forgot to cancel at the same time in the second edition the numerous passages which are in contradiction with the new note and in agreement with what he had cancelled this applies particularly to the whole of the sixth section of the antinomy of pure reason and to all those passages which i pointed out with some amazement in my critique which was written before i knew the first edition and its later fate because in them he contradicts himself that it was fear which drove the old man to disfigure his critique of rational psychology is shown also by this that his attacks on the sacred doctrines of the old dogmatism are far weaker far more timid and superficial than in the first edition and that for the sake of peace he mixed them up at once with anticipations which are out of place nay lxix cannot as yet be understood of the immortality of the soul grounded on practical reason and represented as one of its postulates by thus timidly yielding he has in reality retracted with regard to the principal problem of all philosophy viz the relation of the ideal to the real those thoughts which he had conceived in the vigour of his manhood and cherished through all his life this he did in his sixtyfourth year with a carelessness which is peculiar to old age quite as much as timidity and he thus surrendered his system not however openly but escaping from it through a backdoor evidently ashamed himself of what he was doing by this process the critique of pure reason has in its second edition become a selfcontradictory crippled and corrupt book and is no longer genuine the wrong interpretation of the critique of pure reason for which the successors of kant both those who were for and those who were against him have blamed each other as it would seem with good reason are principally due to the socalled improvements introduced into his work by kants own hand for who can understand what contradicts itself the best answer to all this is to be found in kants own straightforward statements in the preface to his second edition supplement ii pp     seq that the unity of thought which pervades the first edition is broken now and then in the second edition no attentive reader can fail to see that kant shows rather too much anxiety to prove the harmlessness of his critique is equally true and it would have been better if while refuting what he calls empirical idealism he had declared more strongly his unchanged adherence to the principles of transcendental lxx idealism  but all this leaves kants moral character quite untouched if ever man lived the life of a true philosopher making the smallest possible concessions to the inevitable vanities of the world valuing even the shadowy hope of posthumous fame  at no more than its proper worth but fully enjoying the true enjoyments of this life an unswerving devotion to truth a consciousness of righteousness and a sense of perfect independence that man was kant if it is true that on some points which may seem more important to others than they seemed to himself he changed his mind or as we should now say if there was a later development in his philosophical views this would seem to me to impose on every student the duty which i have tried to fulfil as a translator also viz first of all to gain a clear view of kants system from his first edition and then to learn both from the additions and from the omissions of the second edition on what points kant thought that the objections raised against his theory required a fuller and clearer statement of his arguments the additions of the second edition will be found on pp     0  of this volume while the passages omitted in the second edition have been included throughout between parentheses critical treatment of the text of kants critique the text of kants critique has of late years become the subject of the most minute philological criticism and it certainly offers as good a field for the exercise of critical scholarship as any of the greek and roman classics lxxi we have first of all the text of the first edition full of faults arising partly from the imperfect state of kants manuscript partly from the carelessness of the printer kant received no proofsheets and he examined the first thirty clean sheets which were in his hands when he wrote the preface so carelessly that he could detect in them only one essential misprint then followed the second here and there improved edition      in which kant not only omitted and added considerable passages but paid some little attention also to the correctness of the text improving the spelling and the stopping and removing a number of archaisms which often perplex the reader of the first edition we hardly know whether these minor alterations came from kant himself for he is said to have remained firmly attached to the old system of orthography  and it seems quite certain that he himself paid no further attention to the later editions published during his lifetime the third edition in    0 the fourth in      the fifth in      at the end of the fifth edition of the critique of pure reason published in      there is a long list of corrigenda the authorship of which has exercised the critical students of kants text very much no one seems to have thought of attributing it to kant himself who at that time of life was quite incapable of such work professor b erdmann supposed it might be the work of rink or some other amanuensis of kant dr vaihinger has shown that it is the work of a professor grillo who in the philosophische anzeiger a supplement to l h jacobs annalen der philosophie und des philosophischen geistes      published a collection of corrigenda not only for kants lxxii critique of pure reason but for several others of his works also another contributor to the same journal meyer thereupon defended kants publisher hartknoch against the charges of carelessness rejected some of grillos corrections and showed that what seemed to be misprints were in many cases peculiarities of kants style it is this list of professor grillo which with certain deductions has been added to the fifth edition of the critique some of grillos corrections have been adopted in the text while others even those which meyer had proved to be unnecessary have retained their place in the list with such materials before him it is clear that a critical student of kants text enjoys considerable freedom in conjectural emendation and that freedom has been used with great success by a number of german critics the more important are — rosenkranz in his edition of kants critique text of first edition      hartenstein in his edition of kants critique text of second edition           kehrbach in his edition of kants critique text of first edition      leclair a von kritische beiträge zur kategorienlehre kants      paulsen versuch einer entwickelungsgeschichte der kantischen erkenntnisslehre      erdmann b kritik der reinen vernunft text of second edition      with a valuable chapter on the revision of the text many of the alterations introduced by these critics affect the wording only of kants critique without materially altering the meaning and were therefore of no importance lxxiii in an english translation it often happens however that the construction of a whole sentence depends on a very slight alteration of the text in kants long sentences the gender of the pronouns der die das are often our only guide in discovering to what substantive these pronouns refer while in english where the distinction of gender is wanting in substantives it is often absolutely necessary to repeat the substantives to which the pronouns refer but kant uses several nouns in a gender which has become obsolete thus he speaks  of der wachsthum der wohlgefallen der gegentheil die hinderniss die bedürfniss die verhältniss and he varies even between die and das verhältniss die and das erkenntniss etc so that even the genders of pronouns may become blind guides the same applies to several prepositions which kant construes with different cases from what would be sanctioned by modern german grammar  thus ausser with him governs the accusative während the dative etc for all this and many other peculiarities we must be prepared if we want to construe kants text correctly or find out how far we are justified in altering it much has been achieved in this line and conjectural alterations have been made by recent editors of kant of which a bentley or a lachmann need not be ashamed in cases where these emendations affected the meaning and when the reasons why my translation deviated so much from the textus receptus might not be easily perceived i have added the emendations adopted by me in a note those who wish for fuller information on these points will have to consult dr vaihingers forthcoming commentary which to judge from a few specimens kindly communicated lxxiv to me by the author will give the fullest information on the subject how important some of the emendations are which have to be taken into account before an intelligible translation is possible may be seen from a few specimens on p         the reading of the first edition antithesis must be changed into thesis page         noumenon seems preferable to phænomenon page         we must read keine instead of eine wahrnehmung page       0 we must keep the reading of the first edition transcendentalen instead of transcendenten as printed in the second while on p         transcendenten may be retained though corrected into transcendentalen in the corrigenda of the fifth edition on p         the first edition reads sind also keine privatmeinungen hartenstein rightly corrects this into reine privatmeinungen ie they are mere private opinions page         instead of ein jeder theil it is proposed to read kein theil this would be necessary if we took vermisst werden kann in the sense of can be spared while if we take it in the sense of can be missed ie can be felt to be absent the reading of the first edition ein jeder theil must stand see the preface to the first edition p xx note   on p         the first edition reads weil sie kein drittes nämlich reinen gegenstand haben this gives no sense because kant never speaks of a reinen gegenstand in the list of corrigenda at the end of the fifth edition reinen is changed into keinen which hartenstein has rightly adopted while rosenkranz retains reinen lxxv on pp    and    of the introduction to the second edition supplement iv p     dr vaihinger has clearly proved i think that the whole passage from einige wenige grundsätze to können dargestellt werden interrupts the drift of kants argument it probably was a marginal note made by kant himself but inserted in the wrong place it would do very well as a note to the sentence eben so wenig ist irgend ein grundsatz der reinen geometrie analytisch with these prefatory remarks i leave my translation in the hands of english readers it contains the result of hard work and hard thought and i trust it will do some good i have called kants philosophy the lingua franca of modern philosophy and so it is and i hope will become still more but that lingua franca though it may contain many familiar words from all languages of the world has yet like every other language to be learnt to expect that we can understand kants critique by simply reading it would be the same as to attempt to read a french novel by the light of english and latin a book which schiller and schopenhauer had to read again and again before they could master it will not yield its secrets at the first time of asking an indian proverb says that it is not always the fault of the post if a blind man cannot see it nor is it always the fault of the profound thinker if his language is unintelligible to the busy crowd i am no defender of dark sayings and i still hold to an opinion for which i have often been blamed that there is nothing in any science that cannot be stated clearly if only we know it clearly still there are limits no man has a right to complain that he cannot understand lxxvi higher mathematics if he declines to advance step by step from the lowest to the highest stage of that science it is the same in philosophy philosophy represents a long toil in thought and word and it is but natural that those who have toiled long in inward thought should use certain concepts and bundles of concepts with their algebraic exponents in a way entirely bewildering to the outer world kants obscurity is owing partly to his writing for himself rather than for others and partly to his addressing himself when defending a cause to the judge and not to the jury he does not wish to persuade he tries to convince no doubt there are arguments in kants critique which fail to convince and which have provoked the cavils and strictures of his opponents kant would not have been the really great man he was if he had escaped the merciless criticism of his smaller contemporaries but herein too we perceive the greatness of kant that those hostile criticisms even where they are well founded touch only on less essential points and leave the solidity of the whole structure of his philosophy unimpaired no first perusal will teach us how much of kants critique may safely be put aside as problematical or at all events as not essential but with every year and with every new perusal some of these mists and clouds will vanish and the central truth will be seen rising before our eyes with constantly increasing warmth and splendour like a cloudless sun in an eastern sky and now while i am looking at the last lines that i have written it may be the last lines that i shall ever write on kant the same feeling comes over me which i expressed in the preface to the last volume of my edition of the rigveda and its ancient commentary i feel as if lxxvii an old friend with whom i have had many communings during the sunny and during the dark days of life was taken from me and i should hear his voice no more the two friends the rigveda and kants critique of pure reason may seem very different and yet my life would have been incomplete without the one as without the other the bridge of thoughts and sighs that spans the whole history of the aryan world has its first arch in the veda its last in kants critique in the veda we watch the first unfolding of the human mind as we can watch it nowhere else life seems simple natural childlike full of hopes undisturbed as yet by many doubts or fears what is beneath and above and beyond this life is dimly perceived and expressed in a thousand words and ways all mere stammerings all aiming to express what cannot be expressed yet all full of a belief in the real presence of the divine in nature of the infinite in the finite here is the childhood of our race unfolded before our eyes at least so much of it as we shall ever know on aryan ground — and there are lessons to be read in those hymns aye in every word that is used by those ancient poets which will occupy and delight generations to come and while in the veda we may study the childhood we may study in kants critique of pure reason the perfect manhood of the aryan mind it has passed through many phases and every one of them had its purpose and has left its mark it is no longer dogmatical it is no longer sceptical least of all is it positive it has arrived at and passed through its critical phase and in kants critique stands before us conscious both of its weakness and of its strength modest yet brave it knows what the lxxviii old idols of its childhood and its youth too were made of it does not break them it only tries to understand them but it places above them the ideals of reason — no longer tangible — not even within reach of the understanding — yet real if anything can be called real — bright and heavenly stars to guide us even in the darkest night in the veda we see how the divine appears in the fire and in the earthquake and in the great and strong wind which rends the mountain in kants critique the divine is heard in the still small voice — the categorical imperative — the i ought — which nature does not know and cannot teach everything in nature is or is not is necessary or contingent true or false but there is no room in nature for the ought as little as there is in logic mathematics or geometry let that suffice and let future generations learn all the lessons contained in that simple word i ought as interpreted by kant i feel i have done but little for my two friends far less than they have done for me i myself have learnt from the veda all that i cared to learn but the right and full interpretation of all that the poets of the vedic hymns have said or have meant to say must be left to the future what i could do in this short life of ours was to rescue from oblivion the most ancient heirloom of the aryan family to establish its text on a sound basis and to render accessible its venerable commentary which so long as vedic studies last may be criticised but can never be ignored the same with kants critique of pure reason i do not venture to give the right and full explanation of all that kant has said or has meant to say i myself have learnt from him all that i cared to learn and i now give lxxix to the world the text of his principal work critically restored and so translated that the translation itself may serve as an explanation and in some places even as a commentary of the original the materials are now accessible and the englishspeaking race the race of the future will have in kants critique another aryan heirloom as precious as the veda — a work that may be criticised but can never be ignored f max müller oxford november         lxxx lxxxi translators preface to second edition so much has been done of late towards a critical restoration of the text of kants critique of pure reason that it was impossible to republish my translation without a thorough revision scholars who are acquainted with the circumstances under which kants work was originally written and printed will easily understand why the text of his critique should have required so many corrections and conjectural emendations not being able myself to find out all that had been written on this subject in successive editions of kants works and in various articles scattered about in german philosophical journals i had the good fortune to secure the help of dr erich adickes well known by his edition of kants critique published in      and now engaged in preparing a new critical text under the auspices of the royal academy of berlin dr adickes has not only given me the benefit of all the really important various readings and emendations which will form part of his standard edition but he has also pointed out to me passages in which i seemed to have misapprehended the exact meaning of kants peculiar and often very ambiguous style that emendations of kants text are often of great importance for a right understanding of his philosophical arguments can easily be seen from the list given in dr adickes edition of kants critique pp ivvii here we find for instance such mistakes as lxxxii helfen instead of fehlen erfolgt instead of verfolgt alle instead of allein realität instead of idealität veränderlich instead of teilbar einsicht instead of einheit reinen instead of keinen priori instead of posteriori einer instead of seiner anleitung instead of ableitung antithese instead of these eine instead of keine phaenomenon instead of nooumenon alle instead of als ungrund instead of urgrund more perplexing even than these gross mistakes are smaller inaccuracies such as ihr instead of sie sie instead of ihn den instead of dem noch instead of nach which frequently form very serious impediments in the right construction of a sentence i cannot conclude this preface without an ave pia anima to my departed friend professor ludwig noiré who encouraged and helped me when in commemoration of the centenary of its first publication i undertook the translation of kants critique the introduction which he contributed his sketch of the development of philosophy from the eleatics to kant seemed to me indeed the most valuable part of my book and the most likely to remain as a lasting monument of my friends comprehensive knowledge and clear understanding of the historical evolution of philosophy though it has been left out in this second edition i hope it may soon be republished as an independent work f max müller oxford november        introduction   i the idea of transcendental philosophy experience  is no doubt the first product of our understanding while employed in fashioning the raw material of our sensations it is therefore our first instruction and in its progress so rich in new lessons that the chain of all future generations will never be in want of new information that may be gathered on that field nevertheless experience is by no means the only field to which our understanding can be confined experience tells us what is but not that it must be necessarily as it is and not otherwise it therefore never gives us any really general truths and our reason which is particularly anxious for that class of knowledge is roused by it rather than satisfied general truths which at the same time   bear the character of an inward necessity must be independent of experience — clear and certain by themselves they are therefore called knowledge a priori while what is simply taken from experience is said to be in ordinary parlance known a posteriori or empirically only   now it appears and this is extremely curious that even with our experiences different kinds of knowledge are mixed up which must have their origin a priori and which perhaps serve only to produce a certain connection between our sensuous representations for even if we remove from experience everything that belongs to the senses there remain nevertheless certain original concepts and certain judgments derived from them which must have had their origin entirely a priori and independent of all experience because it is owing to them that we are able or imagine we are able to predicate more of the objects of our senses than can be learnt from mere experience and that our propositions contain real generality and strict necessity such as mere empirical knowledge can never supply but  what is still more extraordinary is this that certain kinds of knowledge leave the field of all possible   experience and seem to enlarge the sphere of our judgments beyond the limits of experience by means of concepts to which experience can never supply any corresponding objects and it is in this very kind of knowledge which transcends the world of the senses and where experience can neither guide nor correct us that reason prosecutes its investigations which by their importance we consider far more excellent and by their tendency far more elevated than anything the understanding can find in the sphere of phenomena nay we risk rather anything even at the peril of error than that we should surrender   such investigations either on the ground of their uncertainty or from any feeling of indifference or contempt  now it might seem natural that after we have left the solid ground of experience we should not at once proceed to erect an edifice with knowledge which we possess without knowing whence it came and trust to principles the origin of which is unknown without having made sure of the safety of the foundations by means of careful examination it would seem natural i say that philosophers should first of all have asked the question how the mere understanding could arrive at all this knowledge a priori and what extent what truth and what value it could possess if we take natural   to mean what is just and reasonable then indeed nothing could be more natural but if we understand by natural what takes place ordinarily then on the contrary nothing is more natural and more intelligible than that this examination should have been neglected for so long a time for one part of this knowledge namely the mathematical has always been in possession of perfect trustworthiness and thus produces a favourable presumption with regard to other parts also although these may be of a totally different nature besides once beyond the precincts of experience and we are certain that experience can never contradict us while the charm of enlarging our knowledge is so great that nothing will stop our progress until we encounter a clear contradiction this can be   avoided if only we are cautious in our imaginations which nevertheless remain what they are imaginations only how far we can advance independent of all experience in a priori knowledge is shown by the brilliant example of mathematics it is true they deal with objects and knowledge so far only as they can be represented in intuition but this is easily overlooked because that intuition itself may be given a priori and be difficult to distinguish from a pure concept thus inspirited   by a splendid proof of the power of reason the desire of enlarging our knowledge sees no limits the light dove piercing in her easy flight the air and perceiving its resistance imagines that flight would be easier still in empty space it was thus that plato left the world of sense as opposing so many hindrances to our understanding and ventured beyond on the wings of his ideas into the empty space of pure understanding he did not perceive that he was making no progress by these endeavours because he had no resistance as a fulcrum on which to rest or to apply his powers in order to cause the understanding to advance it is indeed a very common fate of human reason first of all to finish its speculative edifice as soon as possible and then only to enquire whether the foundation be sure then all sorts of excuses are made in order to assure us as to its solidity or to decline altogether such a late and dangerous enquiry the reason why during the time of building we feel free from all anxiety and suspicion and believe in the apparent solidity of our foundation is this — a great perhaps the greatest portion of what our reason finds to do consists in the analysis of our concepts of objects this gives us a great deal of knowledge which though it consists in no   more man in simplifications and explanations of   what is comprehended in our concepts though in a confused manner is yet considered as equal at least in form to new knowledge it only separates and arranges our concepts it does not enlarge them in matter or contents as by this process we gain a kind of real knowledge a priori which progresses safely and usefully it happens that our reason without being aware of it appropriates under that pretence propositions of a totally different character adding to given concepts new and strange ones a priori without knowing whence they come nay without even thinking of such a question i shall therefore at the very outset treat of the distinction between these two kinds of knowledge of the distinction between analytical and synthetical judgments in all judgments in which there is a relation between subject and predicate i speak of affirmative judgments only the application to negative ones being easy that relation can be of two kinds either the predicate b belongs to the subject a as something contained though covertly in the concept a or b lies outside the sphere of the concept a though somehow connected with it in the former case i call the judgment analytical in the latter synthetical analytical judgments affirmative are therefore those in which the connection of the   predicate with the subject is conceived through identity while others in which that connection is conceived without identity may be called synthetical the former might be called illustrating the latter expanding judgments because in the former nothing is added by the predicate to the   concept of the subject but the concept is only divided into its constituent concepts which were always conceived as existing within it though confusedly while the latter add to the concept of the subject a predicate not conceived as existing within it and not to be extracted from it by any process of mere analysis if i say for instance all bodies are extended this is an analytical judgment i need not go beyond the concept connected with the name of body in order to find that extension is connected with it i have only to analyse that concept and become conscious of the manifold elements always contained in it in order to find that predicate this is therefore an analytical judgment but if i say all bodies are heavy the predicate is something quite different from what i think as the mere concept of body the addition of such a predicate gives us a synthetical judgment it becomes clear from this    that our knowledge is in no way extended by analytical judgments but that all they effect is   to put the concepts which we possess into better order and render them more intelligible   that in synthetical judgments i must have besides the concept of the subject something else x on which the understanding relies in order to know that a predicate not contained in the concept nevertheless belongs to it in empirical judgments this causes no difficulty because this x is here simply the complete experience of an object which i conceive by the concept a that concept forming one part only of my experience for though i do not include the predicate of gravity in the general concept of   body that concept nevertheless indicates the complete experience through one of its parts so that i may add other parts also of the same experience all belonging to that concept i may first by an analytical process realise the concept of body through the predicates of extension impermeability form etc all of which are contained in it afterwards i expand my knowledge and looking back to the experience from which my concept of body was abstracted i find gravity always connected with the beforementioned predicates experience therefore is the x which lies beyond the concept a and on which rests the possibility of a synthesis of the predicate of gravity b with the concept a in synthetical judgments a priori however that   help is entirely wanting if i want to go beyond the concept a in order to find another concept b connected with it where is there anything on which i may rest and through which a synthesis might become possible considering that i cannot have the advantage of looking about in the field of experience take the proposition that all which happens has its cause in the concept of something that happens i no doubt conceive of something existing preceded by time and from this certain analytical judgments may be deduced but the concept of cause is entirely outside that concept and indicates something different from that which happens and is by no means contained in that representation how can i venture then to predicate of that which happens something totally different from it and to represent the concept of cause though not contained in it as belonging to it and belonging to it by necessity what is here the unknown x on which the understanding may rest in order to find beyond   the concept a a foreign predicate b which nevertheless is believed to be connected with it it cannot be experience because the proposition that all which happens has its cause represents this second predicate as added to the subject not only with greater generality than experience can ever supply but also with a character of necessity and therefore purely a priori and based on concepts all our speculative knowledge a priori aims at and rests on such synthetical ie expanding propositions for  0 the analytical are no doubt very important and necessary yet only in order to arrive at that clearness of concepts which is requisite for a safe and wide synthesis serving as a really new addition to what we possess already we  have here a certain mystery  before us which must be cleared up before any advance into the unlimited field of a pure knowledge of the understanding can become safe and trustworthy we must discover on the largest scale the ground of the possibility of synthetical judgments a priori we must understand the conditions which render every class of them possible and endeavour not only to indicate in a sketchy outline but to define in its fulness and practical completeness the whole of that knowledge which forms a class by itself systematically arranged according to its original sources its divisions its extent and its limits so much for the present with regard to the peculiar character of synthetical judgments it will now be seen how there can be a special      science serving as a critique of pure reason every kind of knowledge is called pure if not mixed with anything heterogeneous but more particularly is that knowledge called absolutely pure which is not mixed up with any experience or sensation and is therefore possible entirely a priori reason is the faculty which supplies the principles of knowledge a priori pure reason therefore is that faculty which supplies the principles of knowing anything entirely a priori an organum of pure reason ought to comprehend all the principles by which pure knowledge a priori can be acquired and fully established a complete application of such an organum would give us a system of pure reason but as that would be a difficult task and as at present it is still doubtful whether and when such an expansion of our knowledge is here possible we may look on a mere criticism of pure reason its sources and limits as a kind of preparation for a complete system of pure reason it should be called a critique not a doctrine of pure reason its usefulness would be negative only serving for a purging rather than for an expansion of our reason and what after all is a considerable gain guarding reason against errors i call all knowledge transcendental which is occupied not so much with objects as with our a priori concepts of objects  a system of such concepts might be    called transcendental philosophy but for the present this is again too great an undertaking we should have to treat therein completely both of analytical knowledge and of synthetical knowledge a priori which is more than we intend to do being satisfied to carry on the analysis so  0 far only as is indispensably necessary in order to recognise in their whole extent the principles of synthesis a priori which alone concern us this investigation which should be called a transcendental critique but not a systematic doctrine is all we are occupied with at present it is not meant to extend our knowledge but only to rectify it and to become the test of the value of all a priori knowledge such a critique therefore is a preparation for a new organum or if that should not be possible for a canon at least according to which hereafter a complete system of a philosophy of pure reason whether it serve for an expansion or merely for a limitation of it may be carried out both analytically and synthetically that such a system is possible nay that it need not be so comprehensive as to prevent the hope of its completion may be gathered from the fact that it would have to deal not with the nature of things which is endless but with the understanding which judges of the nature of    things and this again so far only as its knowledge a priori is concerned whatever the understanding possesses a priori as it has not to be looked for without can hardly escape our notice nor is there any reason to suppose that it will prove too extensive for a complete inventory and for such a valuation as shall assign to it its true merits or demerits  ii division of transcendental philosophy transcendental philosophy is with us an idea of a science only for which the critique of pure reason should    trace according to fixed principles an architectonic plan guaranteeing the completeness and certainty of all parts of which the building consists it is a system of all principles of pure reason  the reason why we do not call such a critique a transcendental philosophy in itself is simply this that in order to be a complete system it ought to contain likewise a complete analysis of the whole of human knowledge a priori it is true that our critique must produce a complete list of all the fundamental concepts which constitute pure knowledge but it need not give a detailed analysis of these concepts nor a complete list of all derivative concepts such an analysis would be out of place because it is not beset with the    doubts and difficulties which are inherent in synthesis and which alone necessitate a critique of pure reason nor would it answer our purpose to take the responsibility of the completeness of such an analysis and derivation this completeness of analysis however and of derivation from such a priori concepts as we shall have to deal with presently may easily be supplied if only they have first been laid down as perfect principles of synthesis and nothing is wanting to them in that respect all that constitutes transcendental philosophy belongs to the critique of pure reason nay it is the complete idea of transcendental philosophy but not yet the whole of that philosophy itself because it carries the analysis so far only as is requisite for a complete examination of synthetical knowledge a priori the most important consideration in the arrangement of such a science is that no concepts should be admitted    which contain anything empirical and that the a priori knowledge shall be perfectly pure therefore although the highest principles of morality and their fundamental concepts are a priori knowledge they do not    belong to transcendental philosophy because the concepts of pleasure and pain desire inclination freewill etc which are all of empirical origin must here be presupposed transcendental philosophy is the wisdom of pure speculative reason everything practical so far as it contains motives has reference to sentiments and these belong to empirical sources of knowledge if we wish to carry out a proper division of our science systematically it must contain first a doctrine of the elements secondly a doctrine of the method of pure reason each of these principal divisions will have its subdivisions the grounds of which cannot however be explained here so much only seems necessary for previous information that there are two stems of human knowledge which perhaps may spring from a common root unknown to us viz sensibility and the understanding objects being given by the former and thought by the latter if our sensibility should contain a priori representations constituting conditions under which alone objects can be given it would belong to transcendental philosophy and the doctrine of this transcendental senseperception would necessarily    form the first part of the doctrine of elements because the conditions under which alone objects of human knowledge can be given must precede those under which they are thought    i the elements of transcendentalism       part i transcendental æsthetic    whatever the process and the means may be by which knowledge reaches its objects there is one that reaches them directly and forms the ultimate material of all thought viz intuition anschauung this is possible only when the object is given and the object can be given only to human beings at least through a certain affection of the mind gemüth this faculty receptivity of receiving representations vorstellungen according to the manner in which we are affected by objects is called sensibility sinnlichkeit objects therefore are given to us through our sensibility sensibility alone supplies us with intuitions anschauungen these intuitions become thought through the understanding verstand and hence arise conceptions begriffe all thought therefore must directly or indirectly go back to intuitions anschauungen ie to our sensibility because in no other way can objects be given to us    the effect produced by an object upon the fancy of representation vorstellungsfähigkeit so far as we  0 are affected by it is called sensation empfindung an intuition anschauung of an object by means of sensation is called empirical the undefined object of such an empirical intuition is called phenomenon erscheinung in a phenomenon i call that which corresponds to the sensation its matter but that which causes the manifold matter of the phenomenon to be perceived as arranged in a certain order i call its form now it is clear that it cannot be sensation again through which sensations are arranged and placed in certain forms the matter only of all phenomena is given us a posteriori but their form must be ready for them in the mind gemüth a priori and must therefore be capable of being considered as separate from all sensations i call all representations in which there is nothing that belongs to sensation pure in a transcendental sense the pure form therefore of all sensuous intuitions that form in which the manifold elements of the phenomena are seen in a certain order must be found in the mind a priori and this pure form of sensibility may be called the pure intuition anschauung thus if we deduct from the representation vorstellung of a body what belongs to the thinking of the understanding viz substance force divisibility etc and likewise what belongs to sensation viz impermeability hardness colour etc there still remains something    of that empirical intuition anschauung viz extension and form these belong to pure intuition which a priori and even without a real object of the senses or of    sensation exists in the mind as a mere form of sensibility the science of all the principles of sensibility a priori i call transcendental æsthetic  there must be such a science forming the first part of the elements of transcendentalism as opposed to that which treats of the principles of pure thought and which should be called transcendental logic in transcendental æsthetic therefore we shall    first isolate sensibility by separating everything which the understanding adds by means of its concepts so that nothing remains but empirical intuition anschauung secondly we shall separate from this all that belongs to sensation empfindung so that nothing remains but pure intuition reine anschauung or the mere form of the phenomena which is the only thing which sensibility a priori can supply in the course of this investigation it will appear that there are as principles of a priori knowledge two pure forms of sensuous intuition anschauung namely space and time we now proceed to consider these more in detail    section i of space by means of our external sense a property of our mind gemüth we represent to ourselves objects as external or outside ourselves and all of these in space it is within space that their form size and relative position are fixed or can be fixed the internal sense by means of which the mind perceives itself or its internal state does not give an intuition anschauung of the soul seele itself as an object but it is nevertheless a fixed form under which alone an intuition of its internal state is    possible so that whatever belongs to its internal determinations bestimmungen must be represented in relations of time time cannot be perceived angeschaut externally as little as space can be perceived as something within us what then are space and time are they real beings or if not that are they determinations or relations of things but such as would belong to them even if they were not perceived or lastly are they determinations and relations which are inherent in the form of intuition only and therefore in the subjective nature of our mind without which such predicates as space and time would never be ascribed to anything in order to understand this more clearly let us first consider space   space is not an empirical concept which has been derived from external experience for in order that certain sensations should be referred to something outside myself ie to something in a different part of space from that where i am again in order that i may be able to    represent them vorstellen as side by side that is not only as different but as in different places the representation vorstellung of space must already be there therefore the representation of space cannot be borrowed through experience from relations of external phenomena but on the contrary this external experience becomes possible only by means of the representation of space   space is a necessary representation a priori forming the very foundation of all external intuitions    it is impossible to imagine that there should be no space though one might very well imagine that there should be space without objects to fill it space is therefore regarded as a condition of the possibility of phenomena not as a determination produced by them it is a representation a priori which necessarily precedes all external phenomena   on this necessity of an a priori representation of space rests the apodictic certainty of all geometrical principles and the possibility of their construction a priori for if the intuition of space were a concept gained a posteriori borrowed from general external experience the first principles of mathematical definition would be nothing but perceptions they would be exposed to all the accidents of perception and there being but one straight line between two points would not be a necessity but only something taught in each case by experience whatever is derived from experience possesses a relative generality only based on induction we should therefore not be able to say more than that so far as hitherto observed no space has yet been found having more than three dimensions   space is not a discursive or socalled general     0 concept of the relations of things in general but a pure intuition for first of all we can imagine one space only and if we speak of many spaces we mean parts only of one and the same space nor can these parts be considered as antecedent to the one and allembracing space and as it were its component parts out of which an aggregate is formed but they can be thought of as existing within it only space is essentially one its multiplicity and therefore the general concept of spaces in general arises entirely from limitations hence it follows that with respect to space an intuition a priori which is not empirical must form the foundation of all conceptions of space in the same manner all geometrical principles eg that in every triangle two sides together are greater than the third are never to be derived from the general concepts of side and triangle but from an intuition and that a priori with apodictic certainty   space is represented as an infinite quantity now a general concept of space which is found in a foot as well as in an ell could tell us nothing in respect to the quantity of the space if there were not infinity in the progression of intuition no concept of relations of space could ever contain a principle of infinity  conclusions from the foregoing concepts    a space does not represent any quality of objects by themselves or objects in their relation to one another ie space does not represent any determination which is inherent in the objects themselves and would remain    even if all subjective conditions of intuition were removed for no determinations of objects whether belonging to them absolutely or in relation to others can enter into our intuition before the actual existence of the objects themselves that is to say they can never be intuitions a priori b space is nothing but the form of all phenomena of the external senses it is the subjective condition of our sensibility without which no external intuition is possible for us if then we consider that the receptivity of the subject its capacity of being affected by objects must necessarily precede all intuition of objects we shall understand how the form of all phenomena may be given before all real perceptions may be in fact a priori in the soul and may as a pure intuition by which all objects must be determined contain prior to all experience principles regulating their relations it is therefore from the human standpoint only that we can speak of space extended objects etc if we drop the subjective condition under which alone we can gain external intuition that is so far as we ourselves may be affected by objects the representation of space means nothing for this predicate is applied to objects only in so far as they appear to us and are objects of our    senses the constant form of this receptivity which we call sensibility is a necessary condition of all relations in which objects as without us can be perceived and when abstraction is made of these objects what remains is that pure intuition which we call space as the peculiar conditions of our sensibility cannot be looked upon as conditions of the possibility of the objects themselves but only of their appearance as phenomena to us we may say indeed that space comprehends all things which may    appear to us externally but not all things by themselves whether perceived by us or not or by any subject whatsoever we cannot judge whether the intuitions of other thinking beings are subject to the same conditions which determine our intuition and which for us are generally binding if we add the limitation of a judgment to a subjective concept the judgment gains absolute validity the proposition all things are beside each other in space is valid only under the limitation that things are taken as objects of our sensuous intuition anschauung if i add that limitation to the concept and say all things as external phenomena are beside each other in space the rule obtains universal and unlimited validity our discussions teach therefore the reality ie the objective validity of space with regard to all that can come to us externally    as an object but likewise the ideality of space with regard to things when they are considered in themselves by our reason and independent of the nature of our senses we maintain the empirical reality of space so far as every possible external experience is concerned but at the same time its transcendental ideality that is to say we maintain that space is nothing if we leave out of consideration the condition of a possible experience and accept it as something on which things by themselves are in any way dependent with the exception of space there is no other subjective representation vorstellung referring to something external that would be called a priori objective this  subjective condition of all external phenomena cannot therefore be compared to any other the taste of wine does    not belong to the objective determinations of wine considered as an object even as a phenomenal object but to the peculiar nature of the sense belonging to the subject that tastes the wine colours are not qualities of a body though inherent in its intuition but they are likewise modifications only of the sense of sight as it is affected in different ways by light space on the contrary as the very condition of external objects is essential to their appearance or intuition taste and colour are by no means necessary conditions under which alone things    can become to us objects of sensuous perception they are connected with their appearance as accidentally added effects only of our peculiar organisation they are not therefore representations a priori but are dependent on sensation empfindung nay taste even on an affection gefühl of pleasure and pain which is the result of a sensation no one can have a priori an idea vorstellung either of colour or of taste but space refers to the pure form of intuition only and involves no kind of sensation nothing empirical nay all kinds and determinations of space can and must be represented a priori if concepts of forms and their relations are to arise through it alone is it possible that things should become external objects to us my object in what i have said just now is only to prevent people from imagining that they can elucidate the ideality of space by illustrations which are altogether insufficient such as colour taste etc which should never be considered as qualities of things but as modifications of the subject and which therefore may be different with different people for in this case that which originally is itself a phenomenon only as for instance a rose is taken    by the empirical understanding for a thing by itself which nevertheless with regard to colour may appear  0 different to every eye the transcendental conception on the contrary of all phenomena in space is a critical warning that nothing which is seen in space is a thing by itself nor space a form of things supposed to belong to them by themselves but that objects by themselves are not known to us at all and that what we call external objects are nothing but representations of our senses the form of which is space and the true correlative of which that is the thing by itself is not known nor can be known by these representations nor do we care to know anything about it in our daily experience  section ii of time i time is not an empirical concept deduced from any experience for neither coexistence nor succession would enter into our perception if the representation of time were not given a priori only when this representation a priori is given can we imagine that certain things happen at the same time simultaneously or at different times successively    ii time is a necessary representation on which all intuitions depend we cannot take away time from phenomena in general though we can well take away phenomena out of time time therefore is given a priori in time alone is reality of phenomena possible all    phenomena may vanish but time itself as the general condition of their possibility cannot be done away with iii on this a priori necessity depends also the possibility of apodictic principles of the relations of time or of axioms of time in general time has one dimension only different times are not simultaneous but successive while different spaces are never successive but simultaneous such principles cannot be derived from experience because experience could not impart to them absolute universality nor apodictic certainty we should only be able to say that common experience teaches us that it is so but not that it must be so these principles are valid as rules under which alone experience is possible they teach us before experience not by means of experience  iv time is not a discursive or what is called a general concept but a pure form of sensuous intuition different times are parts only of one and the same time representation which can be produced by a single    object only is called an intuition the proposition that different times cannot exist at the same time cannot be deduced from any general concept such a proposition is synthetical and cannot be deduced from concepts only it is contained immediately in the intuition and representation of time v to say that time is infinite means no more than that every definite quantity of time is possible only by limitations of one time which forms the foundation of all times the original representation of time must therefore be    given as unlimited but when the parts themselves and every quantity of an object can be represented as determined by limitation only the whole representation cannot be given by concepts for in that case the partial representations come first but it must be founded on immediate intuition  conclusions from the foregoing concepts a time is not something existing by itself or inherent in things as an objective determination of them something therefore that might remain when abstraction is made of all subjective conditions of intuition for in the former case it would be something real without being a real object in the latter it could not as a determination    or order inherent in things themselves be antecedent to things as their condition and be known and perceived by means of synthetical propositions a priori all this is perfectly possible if time is nothing but a subjective condition under which alone  intuitions take place within us for in that case this form of internal intuition can be represented prior to the objects themselves that is a priori b time is nothing but the form of the internal sense that is of our intuition of ourselves and of our internal state time cannot be a determination peculiar to external phenomena it refers neither to their shape nor their position etc it only determines the relation of representations in our internal state and exactly because this internal intuition supplies no shape we try to make good this deficiency by means of analogies and represent    to ourselves the succession of time by a line progressing to infinity in which the manifold constitutes a series of one dimension only and we conclude from the properties of this line as to all the properties of time with one exception ie that the parts of the former are simultaneous those of the latter successive from this it becomes clear also that the representation of time is itself an intuition because all its relations can be expressed by means of an external intuition c time is the formal condition a priori of all phenomena whatsoever space as the pure form of all    external intuition is a condition a priori of external phenomena only but as all representations whether they have for their objects external things or not belong by themselves as determinations of the mind to our inner state and as this inner state falls under the formal conditions of internal intuition and therefore of time time is a condition a priori of all phenomena whatsoever and is so directly as a condition of internal phenomena of our mind and thereby indirectly of external phenomena also if i am able to say a priori that all external phenomena are in space and are determined a priori according to the relations of space i can according to the principle of the internal sense make the general assertion that all phenomena that is all objects of the senses are in time and stand necessarily in relations of time if we drop our manner of looking at ourselves internally and of comprehending by means of that intuition all external intuitions also within our power of representation and thus take objects as they may be by themselves then time is nothing time has objective validity    with reference to phenomena only because these are themselves things which we accept as objects of our senses but time is no longer objective if we    remove the sensuous character of our intuitions that is to say that mode of representation which is peculiar to ourselves and speak of things in general time is therefore simply a subjective condition of our human intuition which is always sensuous that is so far as we are affected by objects but by itself apart from the subject nothing nevertheless with respect to all phenomena that is all things which can come within our experience time is necessarily objective we cannot say that all things are in time because if we speak of things in general nothing is said about the manner of intuition which is the real condition under which time enters into our representation of things if therefore this condition is added to the concept and if we say that all things as phenomena as objects of sensuous intuition are in time then such a proposition has its full objective validity and a priori universality what we insist on therefore is the empirical reality of time that is its objective validity with reference to all objects which can ever come before our senses and as our intuition must at all times be sensuous no object can ever fall under our experience that does not come under the conditions of time what we deny is that time has any claim on absolute reality so that without    taking into account the form of our sensuous condition it should by itself be a condition or quality inherent in things for such qualities which belong to things by themselves can never be given to us through the senses this is what constitutes the transcendental ideality of    time so that if we take no account of the subjective conditions of our sensuous intuitions time is nothing and cannot be added to the objects by themselves without their relation to our intuition whether as subsisting or inherent this ideality of time however as well as that of space should not be confounded with the deceptions of our sensations because in their case we always suppose that the phenomenon to which such predicates belong has objective reality which is not at all the case here except so far as this objective reality is purely empirical that is so far as the object itself is looked upon as a mere phenomenon on this subject see a previous note in section i on space explanation against this theory which claims empirical but denies absolute and transcendental reality to time even intelligent men have protested so unanimously that i suppose that every reader who is unaccustomed to these considerations may naturally be of the same opinion what they object to is this changes they say are real this is proved by the change of our own representations even    if all external phenomena and their changes be denied changes however are possible in time only and therefore time must be something real the answer is easy enough i grant the whole argument time certainly is something real namely the real form of our internal intuition time therefore has subjective reality with regard to internal experience that is i really have the representation of time and of my determinations in it time therefore is to be considered as real not so far as it is an object but so far as it is the representation of myself as an object if either i myself or any other being could  0 see me without this condition of sensibility then these selfsame determinations which we now represent to ourselves as changes would give us a kind of knowledge in which the representation of time and therefore of change also would have no place there remains therefore the empirical reality of time only as the condition of all our experience while absolute reality cannot according to what has just been shown be conceded to it time is nothing but the form of our own internal intuition  take away the peculiar condition of our sensibility and the idea of time vanishes because it is not inherent in the objects but in the subject only that perceives them    the reason why this objection is raised so unanimously and even by those who have nothing very tangible to say against the doctrine of the ideality of space is this they could never hope to prove apodictically the absolute reality of space because they are confronted by idealism which has shown that the reality of external objects does not admit of strict proof while the reality of the object of our internal perceptions the perception of my own self and of my own status is clear immediately through our consciousness the former might be merely phenomenal but the latter according to their opinion is undeniably something real they did not see that both without denying to them their reality as representations belong nevertheless to the phenomenon only which must always have two sides the one when the object is considered by itself without regard to the manner in which it is perceived    its quality therefore remaining always problematical the other when the form of the perception of the object is taken into consideration this form belonging not to the object in itself but to the subject which perceives it though nevertheless belonging really and necessarily to the object as a phenomenon time and space are therefore two sources of knowledge from which various a priori synthetical cognitions    can be derived of this pure mathematics give a splendid example in the case of our cognitions of space and its various relations as they are both pure forms of sensuous intuition they render synthetical propositions a priori possible but these sources of knowledge a priori being conditions of our sensibility only fix their own limits in that they can refer to objects only in so far as they are considered as phenomena but cannot represent things as they are by themselves that is the only field in which they are valid beyond it they admit of no objective application this ideality of space and time however leaves the truthfulness of our experience quite untouched because we are equally sure of it whether these forms are inherent in things by themselves or by necessity in our intuition of them only those on the contrary who maintain the absolute reality of space and time whether as subsisting or only as inherent must come into conflict with the principles of experience itself for if they admit space and time as subsisting which is generally the view of mathematical students of nature they have to admit two eternal infinite and selfsubsisting nonentities space and time which exist without their being anything real only in order to comprehend all that is real if they take the second view held by some metaphysical students  0    of nature and look upon space and time as relations of phenomena simultaneous or successive abstracted from experience though represented confusedly in their abstracted form they are obliged to deny to mathematical propositions a priori their validity with regard to real things for instance in space or at all events their apodictic certainty which cannot take place a posteriori while the a priori conceptions of space and time are according to their opinion creations of our imagination only their source they hold must really be looked for in experience imagination framing out of the relations abstracted from experience something which contains the general character of these relations but which cannot exist without the restrictions which nature has imposed on them the former gain so much that they keep at least the sphere of phenomena free for mathematical propositions but as soon as the understanding endeavours to transcend that sphere they become bewildered by these very conditions the latter have this advantage that they are not bewildered by the representations of space and time when they wish to form judgments of objects not as phenomena but only as considered by the understanding but they can neither account for the possibility of mathematical knowledge a priori there being according to them no true and objectively valid intuition a priori nor can they bring the laws of experience into true harmony with the a priori doctrines of mathematics according to our theory of the true character of these original    forms of sensibility both difficulties vanish lastly that transcendental æsthetic cannot contain more than these two elements namely space and time becomes clear from the fact that all other concepts belonging    to the senses even that of motion which combines both presuppose something empirical motion presupposes the perception of something moving in space however considered by itself there is nothing that moves hence that which moves must be something which as in space can be given by experience only therefore an empirical datum on the same ground transcendental æsthetic cannot count the concept of change among its a priori data because time itself does not change but only something which is in time for this the perception of something existing and of the succession of its determinations in other words experience is required    general observations on transcendental æsthetic in order to avoid all misapprehensions it will be necessary first of all to declare as clearly as possible what is our view with regard to the fundamental nature of    sensuous knowledge what we meant to say was this that all our intuition is nothing but the representation of phenomena that things which we see are not by themselves what we see nor their relations by themselves such as they appear to us so that if we drop our subject or the subjective form of our senses all qualities all relations of objects in space and time nay space and time themselves would vanish they cannot as phenomena exist by themselves but in us only it remains completely unknown to us what objects may be by themselves and apart from the receptivity of our senses we know nothing but our manner of perceiving them that manner being peculiar to us and not necessarily shared in by every being though no doubt by every human being this is what alone concerns us space and time are pure forms of our intuition while sensation forms its matter what we can know a priori — before all real intuition are the forms of space and time which are therefore called pure intuition while sensation is that which causes our knowledge to be called a posteriori knowledge ie empirical intuition whatever our sensation may be these forms are necessarily inherent    in it while sensations themselves may be of the most different character even if we could impart the    highest degree of clearness to our intuition we should not come one step nearer to the nature of objects by themselves we should know our mode of intuition ie our sensibility more completely but always under the indefeasible conditions of space and time what the objects are by themselves would never become known to us even through the clearest knowledge of that which alone is given us the phenomenon it would vitiate the concept of sensibility and phenomena and render our whole doctrine useless and empty if we were to accept the view of leibniz and wolf that our whole sensibility is really but a confused representation of things simply containing what belongs to them by themselves though smothered under an accumulation of signs merkmal and partial concepts which we do not consciously disentangle the distinction between confused and wellordered representation is logical only and does not touch the contents of our knowledge thus the concept of right as employed by people of common sense contains neither more nor less than the subtlest speculation can draw out of it only that in the ordinary practical use of the word we are not always conscious of the manifold ideas contained in that thought but no one would say therefore that the ordinary concept of right was sensuous containing a mere phenomenon for right can never become a phenomenon being a concept of    the understanding and representing a moral quality belonging to actions by themselves the representation of a body on the contrary contains nothing in intuition that could belong to an object by itself but is merely    the phenomenal appearance of something and the manner in which we are affected by it this receptivity of our knowledge is called sensibility even if we could see to the very bottom of a phenomenon it would remain for ever altogether different from the knowledge of the thing by itself this shows that the philosophy of leibniz and wolf has given a totally wrong direction to all investigations into the nature and origin of our knowledge by representing the difference between the sensible and the intelligible as logical only that difference is in truth transcendental it affects not the form only as being more or less confused but the origin and contents of our knowledge so that by our sensibility we know the nature of things by themselves not confusedly only but not at all if we drop our subjective condition the object as represented with its qualities bestowed on it by sensuous intuition is nowhere to be found and cannot possibly be found because its form as phenomenal appearance is determined by those very subjective conditions it has been the custom to distinguish in phenomena    that which is essentially inherent in their intuition and is recognised by every human being from that which belongs to their intuition accidentally only being valid not for sensibility in general but only for a particular position and organisation of this or that sense in that case the former kind of knowledge is said to represent the object by itself the latter its appearance only but that distinction is merely empirical if as generally happens people are satisfied with that distinction without again as they ought treating the first empirical intuition as purely phenomenal also in which nothing can be found    belonging to the thing by itself our transcendental distinction is lost and we believe that we know things by themselves though in the world of sense however far we may carry our investigation we can never have anything before us but mere phenomena to give an illustration people might call the rainbow a mere phenomenal appearance during a sunny shower but the rain itself the thing by itself this would be quite right physically speaking and taking rain as something which in our ordinary experience and under all possible relations to our senses can be determined thus and thus only in our intuition but if we take the empirical in general and ask    without caring whether it is the same with every particular observer whether it represents a thing by itself not the drops of rain for these are already as phenomena empirical objects then the question as to the relation between the representation and the object becomes transcendental and not only the drops are mere phenomena but even their round shape nay even the space in which they fall are nothing by themselves but only modifications or fundamental dispositions of our sensuous intuition the transcendental object remaining unknown to us the second important point in our transcendental æsthetic is that it should not only gain favour as a plausible hypothesis but assume as certain and undoubted a character as can be demanded of any theory which is to serve as an organum in order to make this certainty selfevident we shall select a case which will make its validity palpable let us suppose that space and time are in themselves objective and conditions of the possibility of things by themselves now there is with regard to both a large    number of a priori apodictic and synthetical propositions and particularly with regard to space which for this reason we shall chiefly investigate here as an illustration as the propositions of geometry are known synthetically a priori and with apodictic certainty i ask whence do you take such propositions and what does the    understanding rely on in order to arrive at such absolutely necessary and universally valid truths there is no other way but by concepts and intuitions and both as given either a priori or a posteriori the latter namely empirical concepts as well as the empirical intuition on which they are founded cannot yield any synthetical propositions except such as are themselves also empirical only that is empirical propositions which can never possess that necessity and absolute universality which are characteristic of all geometrical propositions as to the other and only means of arriving at such knowledge through mere concepts or intuitions a priori it must be clear that only analytical but no synthetical knowledge can ever be derived from mere concepts take the proposition that two straight lines cannot enclose a space and cannot therefore form a figure and try to deduce it from the concept of straight lines and the number two or take the proposition that with three straight lines it is possible to form a figure and try to deduce that from those concepts all your labour will be lost and in the end you will be obliged to have recourse to intuition as is always done in geometry you then give yourselves an object in intuition but of what kind is it    is it a pure intuition a priori or an empirical one in the latter case you would never arrive at a universally valid still less at an apodictic proposition because experience    can never yield such you must therefore take the object as given a priori in intuition and found your synthetical proposition on that if you did not possess in yourselves the power of a priori intuition if that subjective condition were not at the same time as to the form the general condition a priori under which alone the object of that external intuition becomes possible if in fact the object the triangle were something by itself without any reference to you as the subject how could you say that what exists necessarily in your subjective conditions of constructing a triangle belongs of necessity to the triangle itself for you could not add something entirely new the figure to your concepts of three lines something which should of necessity belong to the object as that object is given before your knowledge of it and not by it if therefore space and time also were not pure forms of your intuition which contains the a priori conditions under which alone things can become external objects to you while without that subjective condition they are nothing you could not predicate anything of external objects a priori and synthetically it is therefore beyond the reach of doubt and not possible    only or probable that space and time as the necessary conditions of all experience external and internal are purely subjective conditions of our intuition and that with reference to them all things are phenomena only and not things thus existing by themselves in such or such wise hence so far as their form is concerned much may be predicated of them a priori but nothing whatever of the things by themselves on which these phenomena may be grounded   0 part ii transcendental logic  0 introduction the idea of a transcendental logic i of logic in general our knowledge springs from two fundamental sources of our soul the first receives representations receptivity of impressions the second is the power of knowing an object by these representations spontaneity of concepts by the first an object is given us by the second the object is thought in relation to that representation which is a mere determination of the soul intuition therefore and concepts constitute the elements of all our knowledge so that neither concepts without an intuition corresponding to them nor intuition without concepts can yield any real knowledge both are either pure or empirical they are empirical when sensation presupposing the actual presence of the    object is contained in it they are pure when no sensation is mixed up with the representation the latter may be called the material of sensuous knowledge pure intuition therefore contains the form only by which    something is seen and pure conception the form only by which an object is thought pure intuitions and pure concepts only are possible a priori empirical intuitions and empirical concepts a posteriori we call sensibility the receptivity of our soul or its power of receiving representations whenever it is in any wise affected while the understanding on the contrary is with us the power of producing representations or the spontaneity of knowledge we are so constituted that our intuition must always be sensuous and consist of the mode in which we are affected by objects what enables us to think the objects of our sensuous intuition is the understanding neither of these qualities or faculties is preferable to the other without sensibility objects would not be given to us without understanding they would not be thought by us thoughts without contents are empty intuitions without concepts are blind therefore it is equally necessary to make our concepts sensuous ie to add to them their object in intuition as to make our intuitions intelligible editor illegible word bring them under concepts these two powers or faculties cannot exchange their functions the understanding cannot see the senses cannot think by their union only can knowledge be produced but this is no reason for confounding the share which belongs to each in the production of knowledge on the contrary they should always    be carefully separated and distinguished and we have therefore divided the science of the rules of sensibility    in general ie æsthetic from the science of the rules of the understanding in general ie logic logic again can be taken in hand for two objects either as logic of the general or of a particular use of the understanding the former contains all necessary rules of thought without which the understanding cannot be used at all it treats of the understanding without any regard to the different objects to which it may be directed logic of the particular use of the understanding contains rules how to think correctly on certain classes of objects the former may be called elementary logic the latter the organum of this or that science the latter is generally taught in the schools as a preparation for certain sciences though according to the real progress of the human understanding it is the latest achievement which does not become possible till the science itself is really made and requires only a few touches for its correction and completion for it is clear that the objects themselves must be very well known before it is possible to give rules according to which a science of them may be established general logic is either pure or applied in the    former no account is taken of any empirical conditions under which our understanding acts ie of the influence of the senses the play of imagination the laws of memory the force of habit the inclinations and therefore the sources of prejudice also nor of anything which supplies or seems to supply particular kinds of knowledge for all this applies to the understanding under certain circumstances of its application only and requires experience as a condition of knowledge general but pure logic has to deal with principles a priori only and is a canon of the understanding and of reason though with reference to its    formal application only irrespective of any contents whether empirical or transcendental general logic is called applied if it refers to the rules of the use of our understanding under the subjective empirical conditions laid down in psychology it therefore contains empirical principles yet it is general because referring to the use of the understanding whatever its objects may be it is neither a canon of the understanding in general nor an organum of any particular science but simply a catharticon of the ordinary understanding in general logic therefore that part which is to constitute the science of pure reason must be entirely separated from that which forms applied but for all    that still general logic the former alone is a real science though short and dry as a practical exposition of an elementary science of the understanding ought to be in this logicians should never lose sight of two rules—   as general logic it takes no account of the contents of the knowledge of the understanding nor of the difference of its objects it treats of nothing but the mere form of thought   as pure logic it has nothing to do with empirical principles and borrows nothing from psychology as some have imagined psychology therefore has no influence whatever on the canon of the understanding it proceeds by way of demonstration and everything in it must be completely a priori what i call applied logic contrary to common usage according to which it contains certain exercises on the rules of pure logic is a representation of the understanding and of the rules according to which it is necessarily    applied in concreto ie under the accidental conditions of the subject which may hinder or help its application and are all given empirically only it treats of attention its impediments and their consequences the sources of error the states of doubt hesitation and conviction etc and general and pure logic stands to it in    the same relation as pure ethics which treat only of the necessary moral laws of a free will to applied ethics which consider these laws as under the influence of sentiments inclinations and passions to which all human beings are more or less subject this can never constitute a true and demonstrated science because like applied logic it depends on empirical and psychological principles ii of transcendental logic general logic as we saw takes no account of the contents of knowledge ie of any relation between it and its objects and considers the logical form only in the relation of cognitions to each other that is it treats of the form of thought in general but as we found when treating of transcendental æsthetic that there are pure as well as empirical intuitions it is possible that a similar distinction might appear between pure and empirical thinking in this case we should have a logic in which the contents of knowledge are not entirely ignored for such a logic which should contain the rules of pure thought only would exclude only all knowledge of a merely empirical character it would also treat of the origin of our knowledge of objects so far as that origin cannot be attributed    to the objects while general logic is not at all    concerned with the origin of our knowledge but only considers representations whether existing originally a priori in ourselves or empirically given to us according to the laws followed by the understanding when thinking and treating them in their relation to each other it is confined therefore to the form imparted by the understanding to the representations whatever may be their origin and here i make a remark which should never be lost sight of as it extends its influence on all that follows not every kind of knowledge a priori should be called transcendental ie occupied with the possibility or the use of knowledge a priori but that only by which we know that and how certain representations intuitional or conceptual can be used or are possible a priori only neither space nor any a priori geometrical determination of it is a transcendental representation but that knowledge only is rightly called transcendental which teaches us that these representations cannot be of empirical origin and how they can yet refer a priori to objects of experience the application of space to objects in general would likewise be transcendental but if restricted to objects of sense it is empirical the distinction between transcendental    and empirical belongs therefore to the critique of knowledge and does not affect the relation of that knowledge to its objects on the supposition therefore that there may be concepts having an a priori reference to objects not as pure or sensuous intuitions but as acts of pure thought being concepts in fact but neither of empirical nor æsthetic origin we form by anticipation an idea of a science of that knowledge which belongs to the pure understanding    and reason and by which we may think objects entirely a priori such a science which has to determine the origin the extent and the objective validity of such knowledge might be called transcendental logic having to deal with the laws of the understanding and reason in so far only as they refer a priori to objects and not as general logic in so far as they refer promiscuously to the empirical as well as to the pure knowledge of reason iii of the division of general logic into analytic and dialectic what is truth is an old and famous question by which people thought they could drive logicians into a corner and either make them take refuge in a mere circle  or make them confess their ignorance and consequently    the vanity of their whole art the nominal definition of truth that it is the agreement of the cognition with its object is granted what is wanted is to know a general and safe criterion of the truth of any and every kind of knowledge it is a great and necessary proof of wisdom and sagacity to know what questions may be reasonably asked for if a question is absurd in itself and calls for an answer where there is no answer it does not only throw disgrace on the questioner but often tempts an uncautious listener into absurd answers thus presenting as the ancients said the spectacle of one person milking a hegoat and of another holding the sieve if truth consists in the agreement of knowledge with    its object that object must thereby be distinguished from other objects for knowledge is untrue if it does not agree with its object though it contains something which may be affirmed of other objects a general criterium of truth ought really to be valid with regard to every kind of knowledge whatever the objects may be but it is clear as no account is thus taken of the contents of knowledge relation to its object while truth concerns these very contents that it is impossible and absurd to ask    for a sign of the truth of the contents of that knowledge and that therefore a sufficient and at the same time general mark of truth cannot possibly be found as we have before called the contents of knowledge its material it will be right to say that of the truth of the knowledge so far as its material is concerned no general mark can be demanded because it would be selfcontradictory but when we speak of knowledge with reference to its form only without taking account of its contents it is equally clear that logic as it propounds the general and necessary rules of the understanding must furnish in these rules criteria of truth for whatever contradicts those rules is false because the understanding would thus contradict the general rules of thought that is itself these criteria however refer only to the form of truth or of thought in general they are quite correct so far but they are not sufficient for although our knowledge may be in accordance with logical rule that is may not contradict itself it is quite possible that it may be in contradiction with its object therefore the purely logical criterium of truth namely the agreement of knowledge with the general and formal laws of the understanding and reason is no doubt a conditio sine    qua non or a negative condition of all truth  0 but logic can go no further and it has no test for discovering error with regard to the contents and not the form of a proposition general logic resolves the whole formal action of the understanding and reason into its elements and exhibits them as principles for all logical criticism of our knowledge this part of logic may therefore be called analytic and is at least a negative test of truth because all knowledge must first be examined and estimated so far as its form is concerned according to these rules before it is itself tested according to its contents in order to see whether it contains positive truth with regard to its object but as the mere form of knowledge however much it may be in agreement with logical laws is far from being sufficient to establish the material or objective truth of our knowledge no one can venture with logic alone to judge of objects or to make any assertion without having first collected apart from logic trustworthy information in order afterwards to attempt its application and connection in a coherent whole according to logical laws or still better merely to test it by them however there is something so tempting in this specious art of giving to all our knowledge the form of the understanding though being utterly ignorant    as to the contents thereof that general logic which is meant to be a mere canon of criticism has been employed as if it were an organum for the real production of at least the semblance of objective assertions or more truly has been misemployed for that purpose this general logic which assumes the semblance of an organum is called dialectic    different as are the significations in which the ancients used this name of a science or art it is easy to gather from its actual employment that with them it was nothing but a logic of semblance it was a sophistic art of giving to ones ignorance nay to ones intentional casuistry the outward appearance of truth by imitating the accurate method which logic always requires and by using its topic as a cloak for every empty assertion now it may be taken as a sure and very useful warning that general logic if treated as an organum is always an illusive logic that is dialectical for as logic teaches nothing with regard to the contents of knowledge but lays down the formal conditions only of an agreement with the understanding which so far as the objects are concerned are totally indifferent any attempt at using it as an organum in order to extend and enlarge our knowledge at least in appearance can end in nothing but mere talk    by asserting with a certain plausibility anything one likes or if one likes denying it such instruction is quite beneath the dignity of philosophy therefore the title of dialectic has rather been added to logic as a critique of dialectical semblance and it is in that sense that we also use it iv of the division of transcendental logic into transcendental analytic and dialectic in transcendental logic we isolate the understanding as before in transcendental æsthetic the sensibility and fix our attention on that part of thought only which has its origin entirely in the understanding the application of  0 this pure knowledge has for its condition that objects are given in intuition to which it can be applied for without intuition all our knowledge would be without objects and it would therefore remain entirely empty that part of transcendental logic therefore which teaches the elements of the pure knowledge of the understanding and the principles without which no object can be thought is transcendental analytic and at the same time a logic of truth no knowledge can contradict it without losing at the same time all contents that is all relation to any    object and therefore all truth but as it is very tempting to use this pure knowledge of the understanding and its principles by themselves and even beyond the limits of all experience which alone can supply the material or the objects to which those pure concepts of the understanding can be applied the understanding runs the risk of making through mere sophisms a material use of the purely formal principles of the pure understanding and thus of judging indiscriminately of objects which are not given to us nay perhaps can never be given as it is properly meant to be a mere canon for criticising the empirical use of the understanding it is a real abuse if it is allowed as an organum of its general and unlimited application by our venturing with the pure understanding alone to judge synthetically of objects in general or to affirm and decide anything about them in this case the employment of the pure understanding would become dialectical the second part of transcendental logic must therefore form a critique of that dialectical semblance and is called transcendental dialectic not as an art of producing dogmatically such semblance an art but too popular with many metaphysical jugglers but as a critique of the    understanding and reason with regard to their hyperphysical employment in order thus to lay bare the false semblance of its groundless pretensions and to    reduce its claims to discovery and expansion which was to be achieved by means of transcendental principles only to a mere critique serving as a protection of the pure understanding against all sophistical illusions    division i transcendental analytic in two books with their chapters and sections transcendental analytic consists in the dissection of all our knowledge a priori into the elements which constitute the knowledge of the pure understanding four points are here essential first that the concepts should be pure and not empirical secondly that they should not belong to intuition and sensibility but to thought and understanding thirdly that the concepts should be elementary and carefully distinguished from derivative or composite concepts fourthly that our tables should be complete and that they should cover the whole field of the pure understanding this completeness of a science cannot be confidently accepted on the strength of a mere estimate or by means of repeated experiments only what is required for it is an idea of the totality of the a priori knowledge of the understanding and a classification of the concepts based    upon it in fact a systematic treatment pure understanding must be distinguished not merely from all that is empirical but even from all sensibility it constitutes therefore a unity independent in itself selfsufficient and not to be increased by any additions from without the sum of its knowledge must constitute a system comprehended    and determined by one idea and its completeness and articulation must form the test of the correctness and genuineness of its component parts this part of transcendental logic consists of two books the one containing the concepts the other the principles of pure understanding    book i analytic of concepts by analytic of concepts i do not understand their analysis or the ordinary process in philosophical disquisitions of dissecting any given concepts according to their contents and thus rendering them more distinct but a hitherto seldom attempted dissection of the faculty of the understanding itself with the sole object of discovering the possibility of concepts a priori by looking for them nowhere but in the understanding itself    as their birthplace and analysing the pure use of the understanding this is the proper task of a transcendental philosophy all the rest is mere logical treatment of concepts we shall therefore follow up the pure concepts to their first germs and beginnings in the human understanding in which they lie prepared till at last on the occasion of experience they become developed and are represented by the same understanding in their full purity freed from all inherent empirical conditions    chapter i method of discovering all pure concepts of the understanding when we watch any faculty of knowledge different concepts characteristic of that faculty manifest themselves according to different circumstances which as the observation has been carried on for a longer or shorter time or with more or less accuracy may be gathered up into a more or less complete collection where this collection will be complete it is impossible to say beforehand when we follow this almost mechanical process concepts thus discovered fortuitously only possess neither order nor systematic unity but    are paired in the end according to similarities and according to their contents arranged as more or less complex in various series which are nothing less than systematical though to a certain extent put together methodically transcendental philosophy has the advantage but also the duty of discovering its concepts according to a fixed principle as they spring pure and unmixed from the understanding as an absolute unity they must be connected with each other according to one concept or idea this connection supplies us at the same time with a rule according to which the place of each pure concept of the understanding and the systematical completeness    of all of them can be determined a priori instead of being dependent on arbitrary choice or chance section i of the logical use of the understanding in general we have before defined the understanding negatively only as a nonsensuous faculty of knowledge as without sensibility we cannot have any intuition    it is clear that the understanding is not a faculty of intuition besides intuition however there is no other kind of knowledge except by means of concepts the knowledge therefore of every understanding or at least of the human understanding must be by means of concepts not intuitive but discursive all intuitions being sensuous depend on affections concepts on functions by this function i mean the unity of the act of arranging different representations under one common representation concepts are based therefore on the spontaneity of thought sensuous intuitions on the receptivity of impressions the only use which the understanding can make of these concepts is to form judgments by them as no representation except the intuitional refers immediately to an object no concept is ever referred to an object immediately but to some other representation of it whether it be an intuition or itself a concept a judgment is therefore a mediate knowledge of an object or a representation of a representation of it in every judgment we find a concept applying to many and comprehending    among the many one single representation which is referred immediately to the object thus in the judgment that all bodies are divisible  the concept of divisible applies to various other concepts but is here applied in particular to the concept of body and this concept of body to certain phenomena of our experience    these objects therefore are represented mediately by the concept of divisibility all judgments therefore are functions of unity among our representations the knowledge of an object being brought about not by an immediate representation but by a higher one comprehending this and several others so that many possible cognitions are collected into one as all acts of the understanding can be reduced to judgments the understanding may be defined as the faculty of judging for we saw before that the understanding is the faculty of thinking and thinking is knowledge by means of concepts while concepts as predicates of possible judgments refer to some representation of an object yet undetermined thus the concept of body means something for instance metal which can be known by that concept it is only a concept because it comprehends other representations by means of which it can be referred to objects it is therefore the predicate of a possible judgment such as that every metal is a body thus the functions of the understanding can be discovered in their completeness if it is possible to represent the functions of unity in judgments that this is possible will be seen in the following section    section ii of the logical function of the understanding in judgments  0 if we leave out of consideration the contents of any judgment and fix our attention on the mere form of the understanding we find that the function of thought in a judgment can be brought under four heads each of them with three subdivisions they may be represented in the following table—  i   quantity of judgments   universal   particular  ii singular iii quality  relation affirmative  categorical negative  hypothetical infinite  disjunctive  iv   modality   problematical   assertory   apodictic  as this classification may seem to differ in some though not very essential points from the usual technicalities of logicians the following reservations against any    possible misunderstanding will not be out of place   logicians are quite right in saying that in using judgments in syllogisms singular judgments may be    treated like universal ones for as they have no extent at all the predicate cannot refer to part only of that which is contained in the concept of the subject and be excluded from the rest the predicate is valid therefore of that concept without any exception as if it were a general concept having an extent to the whole of which the predicate applies but if we compare a singular with a general judgment looking only at the quantity of knowledge conveyed by it the singular judgment stands to the universal judgment as unity to infinity and is therefore essentially different from it it is therefore when we consider a singular judgment judicium singulare not only according to its own validity but according to the quantity of knowledge which it conveys as compared with other kinds of knowledge that we see how different it is from general judgments judicia communia and how well it deserves a separate place in a complete table of the varieties of thought in general though not in a logic limited to the use of judgments in reference to each other   in like manner infinite judgments must in transcendental logic be distinguished from affirmative ones though in general logic they are properly classed together and do not constitute a separate part in    the classification general logic takes no account of the contents of the predicate though it be negative it only asks whether the predicate be affirmed or denied transcendental logic on the contrary considers a judgment according to the value also or the contents of a logical affirmation by means of a purely negative predicate and asks how much is gained by that affirmation with reference to the sum total of knowledge if i had said of the soul that it is not mortal i should by means of a negative  0 judgment have at least warded off an error now it is true that so far as the logical form is concerned i have really affirmed by saying that the soul is nonmortal because i thus place the soul in the unlimited sphere of nonmortal beings as the mortal forms one part of the whole sphere of possible beings the nonmortal the other i have said no more by my proposition than that the soul is one of the infinite number of things which remain when i take away all that is mortal but by this the infinite sphere of all that is possible becomes limited only in so far that all that is mortal is excluded from it and that afterwards the soul is placed in the remaining part of its original extent this part however even after its limitation still remains infinite and several more parts of it may be taken away without extending thereby in the least the concept of the soul or affirmatively determining    it these judgments therefore though infinite in respect to their logical extent are with respect to their contents limitative only and cannot therefore be passed over in a transcendental table of all varieties of thought in judgments it being quite possible that the function of the understanding exercised in them may become of great importance in the field of its pure a priori knowledge   the following are all the relations of thought in judgments— a relation of the predicate to the subject b relation of the cause to its effect c relation of subdivided knowledge and of the collected members of the subdivision to each other in the first class of judgments we consider two concepts in the second two judgments in the third several    judgments in their relation to each other the hypothetical proposition if perfect justice exists the obstinately wicked is punished contains really the relation of two propositions namely there is a perfect justice and the obstinately wicked is punished whether both these propositions are true remains unsettled it is only the consequence which is laid down by this judgment the disjunctive judgment contains the relation of two or more propositions to each other but not as a consequence but in the form of a logical opposition the sphere of the one excluding the sphere of the other and at the same time in the form of community all the propositions together filling the whole sphere of the intended knowledge the disjunctive judgment contains therefore    a relation of the parts of the whole sphere of a given knowledge in which the sphere of each part forms the complement of the sphere of the other all being contained within the whole sphere of the subdivided knowledge we may say for instance the world exists either by blind chance or by internal necessity or by an external cause each of these sentences occupies a part of the sphere of all possible knowledge with regard to the existence of the world while all together occupy the whole sphere to take away the knowledge from one of these spheres is the same as to place it into one of the other spheres and to place it in one sphere is the same as to take it away from the others there exists therefore in disjunctive judgments a certain community of the different divisions of knowledge so that they mutually exclude each other and yet thereby determine in their totality the true knowledge because if taken together they constitute the whole contents of one given knowledge this is all    i have to observe here for the sake of what is to follow hereafter   the modality of judgments is a very peculiar function for it contributes nothing to the contents of a judgment because besides quantity quality and relation there is nothing else that could constitute the contents of a judgment but refers only to the nature of the copula in relation to thought in general problematical judgments are those in which affirmation or negation are taken as possible optional only while in assertory judgments affirmation or negation is taken as real true in apodictic as necessary  thus the two judgments    the relation of which constitutes the hypothetical judgment antecedens et consequens and likewise the judgments the reciprocal relation of which forms the disjunctive judgment members of subdivision are always problematical only in the example given above the proposition there exists a perfect justice is not made as an assertory but only as an optional judgment which may be accepted or not the consequence only being assertory it is clear therefore that some of these judgments may be wrong and may yet if taken problematically contain the conditions of the knowledge of truth thus in our disjunctive judgment one of its component judgments namely the world exists by blind chance has a problematical meaning only on the supposition that some one might for one moment take such a view but serves at the same time like the indication of a false road among all the roads that might be taken to find out the true one    the problematical proposition is therefore that which expresses logical not objective possibility only that is a free choice of admitting such a proposition and a purely optional admission of it into the understanding the assertory proposition implies logical reality or truth thus for instance in a hypothetical syllogism the antecedens in the major is problematical in the    minor assertory showing that the proposition conforms to the understanding according to its laws the apodictic proposition represents the assertory as determined by these very laws of the understanding and therefore as asserting a priori and thus expresses logical necessity as in this way everything is arranged step by step in the understanding inasmuch as we begin with judging problematically then proceed to an assertory acceptation and finally maintain our proposition as inseparably united with the understanding that is as necessary and apodictic we may be allowed to call these three functions of modality so many varieties or momenta of thought section iii of the pure concepts of the understanding or of the categories general logic as we have often said takes no account of the contents of our knowledge but expects that representations will come from elsewhere in order to be turned into concepts by an analytical process transcendental logic on the contrary has before it the manifold contents    of sensibility a priori supplied by transcendental    æsthetic as the material for the concepts of the pure understanding without which those concepts would be without any contents therefore entirely empty it is true that space and time contain what is manifold in the pure intuition a priori but they belong also to the conditions of the receptivity of our mind under which alone it can receive representations of objects and which therefore must affect the concepts of them also the spontaneity of our thought requires that what is manifold in the pure intuition should first be in a certain way examined received and connected in order to produce a knowledge of it this act i call synthesis in its most general sense i understand by synthesis the act of arranging different representations together and of comprehending what is manifold in them under one form of knowledge such a synthesis is pure if the manifold is not given empirically but a priori as in time and space before we can proceed to an analysis of our representations these must first be given and as far as their contents are concerned no concepts can arise analytically knowledge is first produced by the synthesis of what is manifold whether given empirically or a priori that knowledge may at first be crude and confused and in need of analysis but it is synthesis which really collects the elements of knowledge and unites them to a certain extent it is therefore the first thing which we    have to consider if we want to form an opinion on the first origin of our knowledge we shall see hereafter that synthesis in general is the mere result of what i call the faculty of imagination a blind but indispensable function of the soul without    which we should have no knowledge whatsoever but of the existence of which we are scarcely conscious but to reduce this synthesis to concepts is a function that belongs to the understanding and by which the understanding supplies us for the first time with knowledge properly so called pure synthesis in its most general meaning gives us the pure concept of the understanding by this pure synthesis i mean that which rests on the foundation of what i call synthetical unity a priori thus our counting as we best perceive when dealing with higher numbers is a synthesis according to concepts because resting on a common ground of unity as for instance the decade the unity of the synthesis of the manifold becomes necessary under this concept by means of analysis different representations are brought under one concept a task treated of in general logic but how to bring not the representations but the pure synthesis of representations under concepts that is what transcendental logic means to teach the first that must be given us a priori for the sake of knowledge of all objects is the manifold in pure intuition the second is the synthesis of the manifold by means of    imagination but this does not yet produce true knowledge the concepts which impart unity to this pure synthesis and consist entirely in the representation of this necessary synthetical unity add the third contribution towards the knowledge of an object and rest on the understanding the same function which imparts unity to various representations in one judgment imparts unity likewise to the mere synthesis of various representations in one intuition    which in a general way may be called the pure concept of the understanding the same understanding and by the same operations by which in concepts it achieves through analytical unity the logical form of a judgment introduces also through the synthetical unity of the manifold in intuition a transcendental element into its representations they are therefore called pure concepts of the understanding and they refer a priori to objects which would be quite impossible in general logic in this manner there arise exactly so many pure concepts of the understanding which refer a priori to objects of intuition in general as there were in our table logical functions in all possible judgments because those functions completely exhaust the understanding and comprehend every one of its faculties borrowing a term of aristotle we shall call these concepts categories  0 our intention being originally the same as his though widely diverging from it in its practical application table of categories  i   of quantity   unity   plurality   totality  ii  iii of quality  of relation reality  of inherence and subsistence substantia et accidens negation  of causality and dependence cause and effect limitation  of community reciprocity between the active and the passive     iv   of modality   possibility impossibility   existence nonexistence   necessity contingency  this then is a list of all original pure concepts of synthesis which belong to the understanding a priori and for which alone it is called pure understanding for it is by them alone that it can understand something in the manifold of intuition that is think an object in it the classification is systematical and founded on a common principle namely the faculty of judging which is the same as the faculty of thinking it is not the    result of a search after pure concepts undertaken at haphazard the completeness of which as based on induction only could never be guaranteed nor could we otherwise understand why these concepts only and no others abide in the pure understanding it was an enterprise worthy of an acute thinker like aristotle to try to discover these fundamental concepts but as he had no guiding principle he merely picked them up as they occurred to him and at first gathered up ten of them which he called categories or predicaments afterwards he thought he had discovered five more of them which he added under the name of postpredicaments but his table remained imperfect for all that not to mention that we find in it some modes of pure sensibility quando ubi situs also prius simul also an empirical concept motus none of which can belong to this genealogical register of the understanding besides there are some derivative concepts counted among the fundamental concepts actio passio while some of the latter are entirely wanting    with regard to these it should be remarked that the categories as the true fundamental concepts of the pure understanding have also their pure derivative concepts these could not be passed over in a complete system of transcendental philosophy but in a merely critical    essay the mention of the fact may suffice i should like to be allowed to call these pure but derivative concepts of the understanding the predicabilia in opposition to the predicamenta of the pure understanding if we are once in possession of the fundamental and primitive concepts it is easy to add the derivative and secondary and thus to give a complete image of the genealogical tree of the pure understanding as at present i am concerned not with the completeness but only with the principles of a system i leave this supplementary work for a future occasion in order to carry it out one need only consult any of the ontological manuals and place for instance under the category of causality the predicabilia of force of action and of passion under the category of community the predicabilia of presence and resistance under the predicaments of modality the predicabilia of origin extinction change etc if we associate the categories among themselves or with the modes of pure sensibility they yield us a large number of derivative concepts a priori which it would be useful and interesting to mark and if possible to bring to a certain completeness though this is not essential for our present purpose i intentionally omit here the definitions of these categories though i may be in possession of them  in the    sequel i shall dissect these concepts so far as is    sufficient for the purpose of the method which i am preparing in a complete system of pure reason they might be justly demanded but at present they would only make us lose sight of the principal object of our investigation by rousing doubts and objections which without injury to our essential object may well be relegated to another time the little i have said ought to be sufficient to show clearly that a complete dictionary of these concepts with all requisite explanations is not only possible but easy the compartments exist they have only to be filled and with a systematic topic like the present the proper place to which each concept belongs cannot easily be missed nor compartments be passed over which are still empty   0 chapter ii of the deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding    section i of the principles of a transcendental deduction in general jurists when speaking of rights and claims distinguish in every lawsuit the question of right quid juris from the question of fact quid facti and in demanding proof of both they call the former which is to show the right or it may be the claim the deduction we not being jurists make use of a number of empirical concepts without opposition from anybody and consider ourselves justified without any deduction in attaching to them a sense or imaginary meaning because we can always appeal to experience to prove their objective reality there exist however illegitimate concepts also such as for instance chance or fate which through an almost general indulgence are allowed to be current but are yet from time to time challenged by the question quid juris in that case we are greatly embarrassed in looking for their deduction there being no clear legal title whether    from experience or from reason on which their    claim to employment could be clearly established among the many concepts however which enter into the complicated code of human knowledge there are some which are destined for pure use a priori independent of all experience and such a claim requires at all times a deduction  because proofs from experience would not be sufficient to establish the legitimacy of such a use though it is necessary to know how much concepts can refer to objects which they do not find in experience i call the explanation of the manner how such concepts can a priori refer to objects their transcendental deduction and distinguish it from the empirical deduction which shows the manner how a concept may be gained by experience and by reflection on experience this does not touch the legitimacy but only the fact whence the possession of the concept arose we have already become acquainted with two totally distinct classes of concepts which nevertheless agree in this that they both refer a priori to objects namely the concepts of space and time as forms of sensibility and the categories as concepts of the understanding it would be labour lost to attempt an empirical deduction of them because their distinguishing characteristic is that they refer to objects without having borrowed anything from experience for their representation    if therefore a deduction of them is necessary it can only be transcendental it is possible however with regard to these concepts as with regard to all knowledge to try to discover in    experience if not the principle of their possibility yet the contingent causes of their production and here we see that the impressions of the senses give the first impulse to the whole faculty of knowledge with respect to them and thus produce experience which consists of two very heterogeneous elements namely matter for knowledge derived from the senses and a certain form according to which it is arranged derived from the internal source of pure intuition and pure thought first brought into action by the former and then producing concepts such an investigation of the first efforts of our faculty of knowledge beginning with single perceptions and rising to general concepts is no doubt very useful and we have to thank the famous locke for having been the first to open the way to it a deduction of the pure concepts a priori however is quite impossible in that way it lies in a different direction because with reference to their future use which is to be entirely independent of experience a very different certificate of birth will be required from that of mere descent from experience we may call this attempted physiological derivation which cannot properly be called deduction    because it refers to a quaestio facti the explanation of the possession of pure knowledge it is clear therefore that of these pure concepts a priori a transcendental deduction only is possible and that to attempt an empirical deduction of them is mere waste of time which no one would think of except those who have never understood the very peculiar nature of that kind of knowledge but though it may be admitted that the only possible deduction of pure knowledge a priori must be transcendental it has not yet been proved that such a deduction    is absolutely necessary we have before by means of a transcendental deduction followed up the concepts of space and time to their very sources and explained and defined their objective validity a priori geometry however moves along with a steady step through every kind of knowledge a priori without having to ask for a certificate from philosophy as to the pure legitimate descent of its fundamental concept of space but it should be remarked that in geometry this concept is used with reference to the outer world of sense only of which space is the pure form of intuition and where geometrical knowledge being based on a priori intuition possesses immediate evidence the objects being given so far as their form is concerned through their very knowledge a priori in intuition when we come however    to the pure concepts of the understanding it becomes absolutely necessary to look for a transcendental deduction not only for them but for space also because they not being founded on experience apply to objects generally without any of the conditions of sensibility and speaking of objects not through predicates of intuition and sensibility but of pure thought a priori are not able to produce in intuition a priori any object on which previous to all experience their synthesis was founded these concepts of pure understanding therefore not only excite suspicion with regard to the objective validity and the limits of their own application but render even the concept of space equivocal because of an inclination to apply it beyond the conditions of sensuous intuition which was the very reason that made a transcendental deduction of it such as we gave before necessary before the reader has made a single step in the field of    pure reason he must be convinced of the inevitable necessity of such a transcendental deduction otherwise he would walk on blindly and after having strayed in every direction he would only return to the same ignorance from which he started he must at the same time perceive the inevitable difficulty of such a deduction so that he may not complain about obscurity where the object itself is obscure or weary too soon with our removal of obstacles the fact being that we have    either to surrender altogether all claims to the knowledge of pure reason — the most favourite field of all philosophers because extending beyond the limits of all possible experience — or to bring this critical investigation to perfection it was easy to show before when treating of the concepts of space and time how these though being knowledge a priori refer necessarily to objects and how they make a synthetical knowledge of them possible which is independent of all experience for as no object can appear to us that is become an object of empirical intuition except through such pure forms of sensibility space and time are pure intuitions which contain a priori the conditions of the possibility of objects as phenomena and the synthesis in these intuitions possesses objective validity the categories of the understanding on the contrary are not conditions under which objects can be given in intuition and it is quite possible therefore that objects should appear to us without any necessary reference to the functions of the understanding thus showing that the understanding contains by no means any of their conditions a priori there arises therefore here a difficulty which we did not meet with in the field of sensibility    namely how subjective conditions of thought can have objective validity that is become conditions of the possibility of the knowledge of objects it cannot be  0 denied that phenomena may be given in intuition without the functions of the understanding for if we take for instance the concept of cause which implies a peculiar kind of synthesis consisting in placing according to a rule after something called a something totally different from it b we cannot say that it is a priori clear why phenomena should contain something of this kind we cannot appeal for it to experience because what has to be proved is the objective validity of this concept a priori it would remain therefore a priori doubtful whether such a concept be not altogether empty and without any corresponding object among phenomena it is different with objects of sensuous intuition they must conform to the formal conditions of sensibility existing a priori in the mind because otherwise they could in no way be objects to us but why besides this they should conform to the conditions which the understanding requires for the synthetical unity of thought does not seem to follow quite so easily for we could quite well imagine that phenomena might possibly be such that the understanding should not find them conforming to the conditions of its synthetical unity and all might be in such confusion that nothing should appear in the succession of phenomena which could supply a rule of synthesis and correspond for instance to the concept of cause and effect so that this concept would thus be quite empty null and meaningless with all this phenomena would offer objects to our intuition because intuition by itself does not require the functions    of thought    it might be imagined that we could escape from the trouble of these investigations by saying that experience offers continually examples of such regularity of phenomena as to induce us to abstract from it the concept of cause and it might be attempted to prove thereby the objective validity of such a concept but it ought to be seen that in this way the concept of cause cannot possibly arise and that such a concept ought either to be founded a priori in the understanding or be surrendered altogether as a mere hallucination for this concept requires strictly that something a should be of such a nature that something else b follows from it necessarily and according to an absolutely universal rule phenomena no doubt supply us with cases from which a rule becomes possible according to which something happens usually but never so that the result should be necessary there is a dignity in the synthesis of cause and effect which cannot be expressed empirically for it implies that the effect is not only an accessory to the cause but given by it and springing from it nor is the absolute universality of the rule a quality inherent in empirical rules which by means of induction cannot receive any but a relative universality that    is a more or less extended applicability if we were to treat the pure concepts of the understanding as merely empirical products we should completely change their character and their use transition to a transcendental deduction of the categories two ways only are possible in which synthetical representations and their objects can agree can refer to each other with necessity and so to say meet each other either it is the object alone that makes the representation    possible or it is the representation alone that makes the object possible in the former case their relation is empirical only and the representation therefore never possible a priori this applies to phenomena with reference to whatever in them belongs to sensation in the latter case though representation by itself for we do not speak here of its  causality by means of the will cannot produce its object so far as its existence is concerned nevertheless the representation determines the object a priori if through it alone it is possible to know anything as an object to know a thing as an object is possible only under two conditions first there must be intuition by which the object is given us though as a phenomenon only secondly there must be a concept by which    an object is thought as corresponding to that intution from what we have said before it is clear that the first condition namely that under which alone objects can be seen exists so far as the form of intuition is concerned in the soul a priori all phenomena therefore must conform to that formal condition of sensibility because it is through it alone that they appear that is that they are given and empirically seen now the question arises whether there are not also antecedent concepts a priori forming conditions under which alone something can be if not seen yet thought as an object in general for in that case all empirical knowledge of objects would necessarily conform to such concepts it being impossible that anything should become an object of experience without them all experience contains besides the intuition of the senses by which something    is given a concept also of the object which is given in intuition as a phenomenon such concepts of objects in general therefore must form conditions a priori of all knowledge produced by experience and the objective validity of the categories as being such concepts a priori rests on this very fact that by them alone so far as the form of thought is concerned experience becomes possible if by them only it is possible to think any object of experience it follows that they refer by necessity and a priori to all objects of experience there is therefore a principle for the transcendental    deduction of all concepts a priori which must guide the whole of our investigation namely that all must be recognized as conditions a priori of the possibility of experience whether of intuition which is found in it or of thought concepts which supply the objective ground of the possibility of experience are for that very reason necessary an analysis of the experience in which they are found would not be a deduction but a mere illustration because they would there have an accidental character only nay without their original relation to all possible experience in which objects of knowledge occur their relation to any single object would be quite incomprehensible there are three original sources or call them faculties or powers of the soul which contain the conditions of the possibility of all experience and which themselves cannot be derived from any other faculty namely sense imagination and apperception on them is founded —   the synopsis of the manifold a priori through the senses   the synthesis of this manifold through the imagination      the unity of that synthesis by means of original apperception besides their empirical use all these faculties have a transcendental use also referring to the form only and possible a priori with regard to the senses we have discussed that transcendental use in the first part    and we shall now proceed to an investigation of the remaining two according to their true nature  section ii of the a priori grounds for the possibility of experience that a concept should be produced entirely a priori and yet refer to an object though itself neither belonging to the sphere of possible experience nor consisting of the elements of such an experience is selfcontradictory and impossible it would have no contents because no intuition corresponds to it and intuitions by which objects are given to us constitute the whole field or the complete object of possible experience an a priori concept therefore not referring to experience would be the logical form only of a concept but not the concept itself by which something is thought if therefore there exist any pure concepts a priori though they cannot contain anything empirical they must nevertheless all be conditions a priori of a possible experience on which alone their objective reality depends  0 if therefore we wish to know how pure concepts of the understanding are possible we must try to find out what are the conditions a priori on which the possibility    of experience depends nay on which it is founded apart from all that is empirical in phenomena a concept expressing this formal and objective condition of experience with sufficient generality might properly be called a pure concept of the understanding if we once have these pure concepts of the understanding we may also imagine objects which are either impossible or if not impossible in themselves yet can never be given in any experience we have only in the connection of those concepts to leave out something which necessarily belongs to the conditions of a possible experience concept of a spirit or to extend pure concepts of the understanding beyond what can be reached by experience concept of god but the elements of all knowledge a priori even of gratuitous and preposterous fancies though not borrowed from experience for in that case they would not be knowledge a priori must nevertheless contain the pure conditions a priori of a possible experience and its object otherwise not only would nothing be thought by them but they themselves being without data could never arise in our mind such concepts then which comprehend the pure thinking a priori involved in every experience are discovered in the categories and it is really a sufficient deduction of them and a justification of their objective validity if we succeed in proving that by them alone an object    can be thought but as in such a process of thinking more is at work than the faculty of thinking only namely the understanding and as the understanding as a faculty    of knowledge which is meant to refer to objects requires quite as much an explanation as to the possibility of such a reference it is necessary for us to consider the subjective sources which form the foundation a priori for the possibility of experience not according to their empirical but according to their transcendental character if every single representation stood by itself as if isolated and separated from the others nothing like what we call knowledge could ever arise because knowledge forms a whole of representations connected and compared with each other if therefore i ascribe to the senses a synopsis because in their intuition they contain something manifold there corresponds to it always a synthesis and receptivity can make knowledge possible only when joined with spontaneity this spontaneity now appears as a threefold synthesis which must necessarily take place in every kind of knowledge namely first that of the apprehension of representations as modifications of the soul in intuition secondly of the reproduction of them in the imagination and thirdly that of their recognition in concepts this leads us to three subjective sources of knowledge which render possible the understanding and through it all experience as an empirical product of the understanding    preliminary remark the deduction of the categories is beset with so many difficulties and obliges us to enter so deeply into the first grounds of the possibility of our knowledge in general that i thought it more expedient in order to avoid the lengthiness of a complete theory and yet to omit nothing in so essential an investigation to add the following four    paragraphs with a view of preparing rather than instructing the reader after that only i shall in the third section proceed to a systematical discussion of these elements of the understanding till then the reader must not allow himself to be frightened by a certain amount of obscurity which at first is inevitable on a road never trodden before but which when we come to that section will give way i hope to a complete comprehension i of the synthesis of apprehension in intuition whatever the origin of our representations may be whether they be due to the influence of external things or to internal causes whether they have arisen a priori or empirically as phenomena as modifications of the mind they must always belong to the internal    sense and all our knowledge must therefore finally be subject to the formal condition of that internal sense namely time in which they are all arranged joined and brought into certain relations to each other this is a general remark which must never be forgotten in all that follows every representation contains something manifold which could not be represented as such unless the mind distinguished the time in the succession of one impression after another for as contained in one moment each representation can never be anything but absolute unity in order to change this manifold into a unity of intuition as for instance in the representation of space it is necessary first to run through the manifold and then to hold it together it is this    act which i call the synthesis of apprehension because it refers directly to intuition which no doubt offers something manifold but which without a synthesis can never make it such as it is contained in one representation this synthesis of apprehension must itself be carried out a priori also that is with reference to representations which are not empirical for without it we should never be able to have the representations either of space or time a priori because these cannot be produced except  00 by a synthesis of the manifold which the senses offer in their original receptivity it follows therefore that we have a pure synthesis of apprehension ii of the synthesis of reproduction in imagination it is no doubt nothing but an empirical law according to which representations which have often followed or accompanied one another become associated in the end and so closely united that even without the presence of the object one of these representations will according to an invariable law produce a transition of the mind to the other this law of reproduction however presupposes that the phenomena themselves are really subject to such a rule and that there is in the variety of these representations a sequence and concomitancy subject to certain rules for without this the faculty of empirical imagination would never find anything to do that it is able to do and remain therefore buried within our mind as a dead faculty unknown to ourselves if cinnabar were sometimes red and sometimes black sometimes light and sometimes heavy if a man could be changed now into    this now into another animal shape if on the longest day the fields were sometimes covered with fruit  0  sometimes with ice and snow the faculty of my empirical imagination would never be in a position when representing red colour to think of heavy cinnabar nor if a certain name could be given sometimes to this sometimes to that object or if that the same object could sometimes be called by one and sometimes by another name without any rule to which representations are subject by themselves would it be possible that any empirical synthesis of reproduction should ever take place there must therefore be something to make this reproduction of phenomena possible by being itself the foundation a priori of a necessary synthetical unity of them this becomes clear if we only remember that all phenomena are not things by themselves but only the play of our representations all of which are in the end determinations only of the internal sense if therefore we could prove that even our purest intuitions a priori give us no knowledge unless they contain such a combination of the manifold as to render a constant synthesis of reproduction possible it would follow that this synthesis of the imagination is before all experience founded on principles a priori and that we must admit a pure transcendental synthesis of imagination which forms even the foundation of the possibility of all experience such experience being impossible without the reproductibility of phenomena  0  now when i draw a line in thought or if i think the time from one noon to another or if i only represent to myself a certain number it is clear that i must first necessarily apprehend one of these manifold representations after another if i were to lose from my    thoughts what precedes whether the first parts of a line or the antecedent portions of time or the numerical unities representing one after the other and if while i proceed to what follows i were unable to reproduce what came before there would never be a complete representation and none of the beforementioned thoughts not even the first and purest representations of space and time could ever arise within us the synthesis of apprehension is therefore inseparably connected with the synthesis of reproduction and as the former constitutes the transcendental ground of the possibility of all knowledge in general not only of empirical but also of pure a priori knowledge it follows that a reproductive synthesis of imagination belongs to the transcendental acts of the soul we may therefore call this faculty the transcendental faculty of imagination iii of the synthesis of recognition in concepts  0  without our being conscious that what we are thinking now is the same as what we thought a moment before all reproduction in the series of representations would be vain each representation would in its present state be a new one and in no wise belonging to the act by which it was to be produced by degrees and the manifold in it would never form a whole because deprived of that unity which consciousness alone can impart to it if in counting i forget that the unities which now present themselves to my mind have been added gradually one to the other i should not know the production of the quantity by the successive addition of one to one nor should i know consequently    the number produced by the counting this number being a concept consisting entirely in the consciousness of that unity of synthesis the very word of concept begriff could have suggested this remark for it is the one consciousness which unites the manifold that has been perceived successively and afterwards reproduced into one representation this consciousness may often be very faint and we may connect it with the effect only and not with the act itself ie with the production of a representation but in  0  spite of this that consciousness though deficient in pointed clearness must always be there and without it concepts and with them knowledge of objects are perfectly impossible and here we must needs arrive at a clear understanding of what we mean by an object of representations we said before that phenomena are nothing but sensuous representations which therefore by themselves must not be taken for objects outside our faculty of representation what then do we mean if we speak of an object corresponding to and therefore also different from our knowledge it is easy to see that such an object can only be conceived as something in general  x because beside our knowledge we have absolutely nothing which we could put down as corresponding to that knowledge now we find that our conception of the relation of all knowledge to its object contains something of necessity the object being looked upon as that which prevents our knowledge from being determined at haphazard and causes it to be determined a priori in a certain way because as they are all to refer to an object they must necessarily with regard to that object agree with each    other that is to say possess that unity which  0  constitutes the concept of an object it is clear also that as we can only deal with the manifold in our representations and as the x corresponding to them the object since it is to be something different from all our representations is really nothing to us it is clear i say that the unity necessitated by the object cannot be anything but the formal unity of our consciousness in the synthesis of the manifold in our representations then and then only do we say that we know an object if we have produced synthetical unity in the manifold of intuition such unity is impossible if the intuition could not be produced according to a rule by such a function of synthesis as makes the reproduction of the manifold a priori necessary and a concept in which that manifold is united possible thus we conceive a triangle as an object if we are conscious of the combination of three straight lines according to a rule which renders such an intuition possible at all times this unity of rule determines the manifold and limits it to conditions which render the unity of apperception possible and the concept of that unity is really the representation of the object  x which i think by means of the predicates of a triangle no knowledge is possible without a concept  0  however obscure or imperfect it may be and a concept is always with regard to its form something general something that can serve as a rule thus the concept of body serves as a rule to our knowledge of external phenomena according to the unity of the manifold which is thought by it it can only be such a rule of intuitions because representing in any given phenomena the necessary reproduction of their manifold elements or the synthetical    unity in our consciousness of them thus the concept of body whenever we perceive something outside us necessitates the representation of extension and with it those of impermeability shape etc necessity is always founded on transcendental conditions there must be therefore a transcendental ground of the unity of our consciousness in the synthesis of the manifold of all our intuitions and therefore also a transcendental ground of all concepts of objects in general and therefore again of all objects of experience without which it would be impossible to add to our intuitions the thought of an object for the object is no more than that something of which the concept predicates such a necessity of synthesis that original and transcendental condition is nothing else but what i call transcendental apperception  0  the consciousness of oneself according to the determinations of our state is with all our internal perceptions empirical only and always transient there can be no fixed or permanent self in that stream of internal phenomena it is generally called the internal sense or the empirical apperception what is necessarily to be represented as numerically identical with itself cannot be thought as such by means of empirical data only it must be a condition which precedes all experience and in fact renders it possible for thus only could such a transcendental supposition acquire validity no knowledge can take place in us no conjunction or unity of one kind of knowledge with another without that unity of consciousness which precedes all data of intuition and without reference to which no representation of objects is possible this pure original and unchangeable consciousness i shall call transcendental apperception    that it deserves such a name may be seen from the fact that even the purest objective unity namely that of the concepts a priori space and time is possible only by a reference of all intuitions to it the numerical unity of that apperception therefore forms the a priori condition of all concepts as does the manifoldness of space and time of the intuitions of the senses the same transcendental unity of apperception  0  constitutes in all possible phenomena which may come together in our experience a connection of all these representations according to laws for that unity of consciousness would be impossible if the mind in the knowledge of the manifold could not become conscious of the identity of function by which it unites the manifold synthetically in one knowledge therefore the original and necessary consciousness of the identity of oneself is at the same time a consciousness of an equally necessary unity of the synthesis of all phenomena according to concepts that is according to rules which render them not only necessarily reproducible but assign also to their intuition an object that is a concept of something in which they are necessarily united the mind could never conceive the identity of itself in the manifoldness of its representations and this a priori if it did not clearly perceive the identity of its action by which it subjects all synthesis of apprehension which is empirical to a transcendental unity and thus renders its regular coherence a priori possible when we have clearly perceived this we shall be able to determine more accurately our concept of an object in general all representations have as representations their object and can themselves in turn become objects of other representations the only objects which  0 can be given to us immediately are phenomena and whatever in them refers immediately to the object is  0  called intuition these phenomena however are not things in themselves but representations only which have their object but an object that can no longer be seen by us and may therefore be called the notempirical that is the transcendental object  x the pure concept of such a transcendental object which in reality in all our knowledge is always the same  x is that which alone can give to all our empirical concepts a relation to an object or objective reality that concept cannot contain any definite intuition and can therefore refer to that unity only which must be found in the manifold of our knowledge so far as it stands in relation to an object that relation is nothing else but a necessary unity of consciousness and therefore also of the synthesis of the manifold by a common function of the mind which unites it in one representation as that unity must be considered as a priori necessary because without it our knowledge would be without an object we may conclude that the relation to a transcendental object that is the objective reality of our empirical knowledge rests on a transcendental law that all phenomena if they are to give us objects must be subject to rules   0 a priori of a synthetical unity of these objects by which rules alone their mutual relation in an empirical intuition becomes possible that is they must be subject in experience to the conditions of the necessary unity of apperception quite as much as in mere intuition to the formal conditions of space and time without this no knowledge is possible    iv preliminary explanation of the possibility of the categories as knowledge a priori there is but one experience in which all perceptions are represented as in permanent and regular connection as there is but one space and one time in which all forms of phenomena and all relations of being or not being take place if we speak of different experiences we only mean different perceptions so far as they belong to one and the same general experience it is the permanent and synthetical unity of perceptions that constitutes the form of experience and experience is nothing but the synthetical unity of phenomena according to concepts unity of synthesis according to empirical concepts would be purely accidental nay unless these     were founded on a transcendental ground of unity a whole crowd of phenomena might rush into our soul without ever forming real experience all relation between our knowledge and its objects would be lost at the same time because that knowledge would no longer be held together by general and necessary laws it would therefore become thoughtless intuition never knowledge and would be to us the same as nothing the conditions a priori of any possible experience in general are at the same time conditions of the possibility of any objects of our experience now i maintain that the categories of which we are speaking are nothing but the conditions of thought which make experience possible as much as space and time contain the conditions of that intuition which forms experience these categories therefore    are also fundamental concepts by which we think objects in general for the phenomena and have therefore a priori objective validity this is exactly what we wish to prove the possibility nay the necessity of these categories rests on the relation between our whole sensibility and therefore all possible phenomena and that original apperception in which everything must be necessarily subject to the conditions of the permanent unity of selfconsciousness that is must submit to the general functions     of that synthesis which we call synthesis according to concepts by which alone our apperception can prove its permanent and necessary identity a priori thus the concept of cause is nothing but a synthesis of that which follows in temporal succession with other phenomena but a synthesis according to concepts and without such a unity which rests on a rule a priori and subjects all phenomena to itself no permanent and general and therefore necessary unity of consciousness would be formed in the manifold of our perceptions such perceptions would then belong to no experience at all they would be without an object a blind play of representations — less even than a dream all attempts therefore at deriving those pure concepts of the understanding from experience and ascribing to them a purely empirical origin are perfectly vain and useless i shall not dwell here on the fact that a concept of cause for instance contains an element of necessity which no experience can ever supply because experience though it teaches us that after one phenomenon something else follows habitually can never teach us that it follows necessarily nor that we could a priori and without any    limitation derive from it as a condition any conclusion as to what must follow and thus i ask with reference to that empirical rule of association which must always be admitted if we say that everything in the succession of events is so entirely subject to rules that nothing     ever happens without something preceding it on which it always follows — what does it rest on if it is a law of nature nay how is that very association possible you call the ground for the possibility of the association of the manifold so far as it is contained in the objects themselves the affinity of the manifold i ask therefore how do you make that permanent affinity by which phenomena stand nay must stand under permanent laws conceivable to yourselves according to my principles it is easily conceivable all possible phenomena belong as representations to the whole of our possible selfconsciousness from this as a transcendental representation numerical identity is inseparable and a priori certain because nothing can become knowledge except by means of that original apperception as this identity must necessarily enter into the synthesis of the whole of the manifold of phenomena if that synthesis is to become empirical knowledge it follows that the phenomena are subject to conditions a priori to which their synthesis in apprehension must always conform the representation of a general condition according to which something manifold can be arranged with uniformity is called a rule if it must be so arranged a law all phenomena therefore stand in a permanent connection according to necessary laws and thus possess     that transcendental affinity of which the empirical is a mere consequence    it sounds no doubt very strange and absurd that nature should have to conform to our subjective ground of apperception nay be dependent on it with respect to her laws but if we consider that what we call nature is nothing but a whole of phenomena not a thing by itself but a number of representations in our soul we shall no longer be surprised that we only see her through the fundamental faculty of all our knowledge namely the transcendental apperception and in that unity without which it could not be called the object or the whole of all possible experience that is nature we shall thus also understand why we can recognise this unity a priori and therefore as necessary which would be perfectly impossible if it were given by itself and independent of the first sources of our own thinking in that case i could not tell whence we should take the synthetical propositions of such general unity of nature they would have to be taken from the objects of nature themselves and as this could be done empirically only we could derive from it none but an accidental unity which is very different from that necessary connection which we mean when speaking of nature section iii of the relation of the understanding to objects in general and the possibility of knowing them a priori     what in the preceding section we have discussed singly and separately we shall now try to treat in connection with each other and as a whole we saw that there are three subjective sources of knowledge on    which the possibility of all experience and of the knowledge of its objects depends namely sense imagination and apperception each of them may be considered as empirical in its application to given phenomena all however are also elements or grounds a priori which render their empirical application possible sense represents phenomena empirically in perception imagination in association and reproduction apperception in the empirical consciousness of the identity of these reproductive representations with the phenomena by which they were given therefore in recognition the whole of our perception rests a priori on pure intuition if the perception is regarded as representation then on time as the form of our internal intuition the association of it the whole on the pure syn     thesis of imagination and our empirical consciousness of it on pure apperception that is on the permanent identity of oneself in the midst of all possible representations if we wish to follow up the internal ground of this connection of representations to that point towards which they must all converge and where they receive for the first time that unity of knowledge which is requisite for every possible experience we must begin with pure apperception intuitions are nothing to us and do not concern us in the least if they cannot be received into our consciousness into which they may enter either directly or indirectly knowledge is impossible in any other way we are conscious a priori of our own permanent identity with regard to all representations that can ever belong to our knowledge as forming a necessary condition of the possibility of all    representations because these could not represent anything in me unless they belonged with everything else to one consciousness and could at least be connected within it this principle stands firm a priori and may be called the transcendental principle of the unity of all the manifold of our representations therefore also of intuition this unity of the manifold in one subject is synthetical the pure apperception therefore supplies us with a principle of the synthetical unity of     the manifold in all possible intuitions  this synthetical unity however presupposes     or involves a synthesis and if that unity is necessary a priori the synthesis also must be a priori the transcendental unity of apperception therefore refers to the pure synthesis of imagination as a condition a priori of    the possibility of the manifold being united in one knowledge now there can take place a priori the productive synthesis of imagination only because the reproductive rests on conditions of experience the principle therefore of the necessary unity of the pure productive synthesis of imagination before all apperception constitutes the ground of the possibility of all knowledge nay of all experience the synthesis of the manifold in imagination is called transcendental if without reference to the difference of intuitions it affects only the a priori conjunction of the manifold and the unity of that synthesis is called transcendental if with reference to the original unity of apperception it is represented as a priori necessary as the possibility of all knowledge depends on the unity of that apperception it follows that the transcendental unity of the synthesis of imagination is the pure form of all possible knowledge through which therefore all objects of possible experience must be represented a priori this unity of apperception with reference to     the synthesis of imagination is the understanding and the same unity with reference to the transcendental synthesis of the imagination the pure understanding it must be admitted therefore that there exist in the understanding pure forms of knowledge a priori which contain the necessary unity of the pure synthesis of the imagination in reference to all possible phenomena these are the categories that is the pure concepts of the understanding the empirical faculty of knowledge of man contains therefore by necessity an understanding which refers to all objects of the senses though by intuition only and by its synthesis through    imagination and all phenomena as data of a possible experience must conform to that understanding as this relation of phenomena to a possible experience is likewise necessary because without it we should receive no knowledge through them and they would not in the least concern us it follows that the pure understanding constitutes by the means of the categories a formal and synthetical principle of all experience and that phenomena have thus a necessary relation to the understanding we shall now try to place the necessary connection of the understanding with the phenomena by means of the categories more clearly before the reader by beginning with the beginning namely with the empirical the first that is given us is the phenomenon   0 which if connected with consciousness is called perception without its relation to an at least possible consciousness the phenomenon could never become to us an object of knowledge it would therefore be nothing to us and because it has no objective reality in itself but exists only in being known it would be nothing altogether as every phenomenon contains a manifold and different perceptions are found in the mind singly and scattered a connection of them is necessary such as they cannot have in the senses by themselves there exists therefore in us an active power for the synthesis of the manifold which we call imagination and the function of which as applied to perceptions i call apprehension  this imagination    is meant to change the manifold of intuition into an image it must therefore first receive the impressions into its activity which i call to apprehend it must be clear however that even this apprehension     of the manifold could not alone produce a coherence of impressions or an image without some subjective power of calling one perception from which the mind has gone over to another back to that which follows and thus forming whole series of perceptions this is the reproductive faculty of imagination which is and can be empirical only if representations as they happen to meet with one another could reproduce each other at haphazard they would have no definite coherence but would form irregular agglomerations only and never produce knowledge it is necessary therefore that their reproduction should be subject to a rule by which one representation connects itself in imagination with a second and not with a third it is this subjective and empirical ground of reproduction according to rules which is called the association of representations if this unity of association did not possess an objective foundation also which makes it impossible that phenomena should be apprehended by imagination in any other way but under the condition of a possible synthetical unity of that apprehension it would be a mere accident that phenomena lend themselves to a certain connection in human knowledge though we might have the power of associating perceptions it would still be a matter of     uncertainty and chance whether they themselves are associable and in case they should not be so a number of perceptions nay the whole of our sensibility might possibly  00 contain a great deal of empirical consciousness but in a separate state nay without belonging to the one consciousness of myself which however is impossible only by ascribing all perceptions to one consciousness the original apperception can i say of all of them that i am conscious of them it must be therefore an objective ground that is one that can be understood as existing a priori and before all empirical laws of imagination on which alone the possibility nay even the necessity of a law can rest which pervades all phenomena and which makes us look upon them all without exception as data of the senses associable by themselves and subject to general rules of a permanent connection in their reproduction this objective ground of all association of phenomena i call their affinity and this can nowhere be found except in the principle of the unity of apperception applied to all knowledge which is to belong to me according to it all phenomena without exception must so enter into the mind or be apprehended as to agree with the unity of apperception this without a synthetical unity in their connection which is therefore necessary objectively also would be impossible we have thus seen that the objective unity     of all empirical consciousness in one consciousness that of the original apperception is the necessary condition even of all possible perception while the affinity of all phenomena near or remote is a necessary consequence of a synthesis in imagination which is a priori founded on rules imagination is therefore likewise the power of a synthesis a priori which is the reason why we called it productive imagination and so far as this aims at nothing but  0  the necessary unity in the synthesis of all the manifold in phenomena it may be called the transcendental function of imagination however strange therefore it may appear at first it must nevertheless have become clear by this time that the affinity of phenomena and with it their association and through that lastly their reproduction also according to laws that is the whole of our experience becomes possible only by means of that transcendental function of imagination without which no concepts of objects could ever come together in one experience it is the permanent and unchanging ego or pure apperception which forms the correlative of all our representations if we are to become conscious of them and all consciousness belongs quite as much to such an allembracing pure apperception as all sensuous intuitions belongs as a representation to a pure internal     intuition namely time this apperception it is which must be added to pure imagination in order to render its function intellectual for by itself the synthesis of imagination though carried out a priori is always sensuous and only connects the manifold as it appears in intuition for instance the shape of a triangle but when the manifold is brought into relation with the unity of apperception concepts which belong to the understanding become possible but only as related to sensuous intuition through imagination we have therefore a pure imagination as one of the fundamental faculties of the human soul on which all knowledge a priori depends through it we bring the manifold of intuition on one side in connection with the condition of the necessary unity of pure apperception on the other these two extreme ends sense and understanding  0  must be brought into contact with each other by means of the transcendental function of imagination because without it the senses might give us phenomena but no objects of empirical knowledge therefore no experience real experience which is made up of apprehension association reproduction and lastly recognition of phenomena contains in this last and highest     among the purely empirical elements of experience concepts which render possible the formal unity of experience and with it all objective validity truth of empirical knowledge these grounds for the recognition of the manifold so far as they concern the form only of experience in general are our categories on them is founded the whole formal unity in the synthesis of imagination and through it of  the whole empirical use of them in recognition reproduction association and apprehension down to the very phenomena because it is only by means of those elements of knowledge that the phenomena can belong to our consciousness and therefore to ourselves it is we therefore who carry into the phenomena which we call nature order and regularity nay we should never find them in nature if we ourselves or the nature of our mind had not originally placed them there for the unity of nature is meant to be a necessary and a priori certain unity in the connection of all phenomena and how should we a priori have arrived at such a synthetical unity if the subjective grounds of such unity were not contained a priori in the original sources of our knowledge and if those subjective conditions did not at the same time possess objective validity as being the grounds  0  on which alone an object becomes possible in     our experience we have before given various definitions of the understanding by calling it the spontaneity of knowledge as opposed to the receptivity of the senses or the faculty of thinking or the faculty of concepts or of judgments all of these explanations if more closely examined coming to the same we may now characterise it as the faculty of rules this characteristic is more significant and approaches nearer to the essence of the understanding the senses give us forms of intuition the understanding rules being always busy to examine phenomena in order to discover in them some kind of rule rules so far as they are objective therefore necessarily inherent in our knowledge of an object are called laws although experience teaches us many laws yet these are only particular determinations of higher laws the highest of them to which all others are subject springing a priori from the understanding not being derived from experience but on the contrary imparting to the phenomena their regularity and thus making experience possible the understanding therefore is not only a power of making rules by a comparison of phenomena it is itself the lawgiver of nature and without the understanding nature that is a synthetical unity of the manifold of phenomena     according to rules would be nowhere to be found because phenomena as such cannot exist without us but exist in our sensibility only this sensibility as an object of our knowledge in any experience with everything it may contain is possible only in the unity of apperception which unity of apperception is transcendental ground of the necessary order of all phenomena in an experience the  0  same unity of apperception with reference to the manifold of representations so as to determine it out of one  forms what we call the rule and the faculty of these rules i call the understanding as possible experience therefore all phenomena depend in the same way a priori on the understanding and receive their formal possibility from it as when looked upon as mere intuitions they depend on sensibility and become possible through it so far as their form is concerned however exaggerated therefore and absurd it may sound that the understanding is itself the source of the laws of nature and of its formal unity such a statement is nevertheless correct and in accordance with experience it is quite true no doubt that empirical laws as such cannot derive their origin from the pure understanding as little as the infinite manifoldness of phenomena could be sufficiently comprehended through the pure form of sensuous intuition but all empirical laws are only particular determinations of the pure laws of the     understanding under which and according to which the former become possible and phenomena assume a regular form quite as much as all phenomena in spite of the variety of their empirical form must always submit to the conditions of the pure form of sensibility the pure understanding is therefore in the categories the law of the synthetical unity of all phenomena and thus makes experience so far as its form is concerned for the first time possible this and no more than this we were called upon to prove in the transcendental deduction of the categories namely to make the relation of the  0  understanding to our sensibility and through it to all objects of experience that is the objective validity of the pure concepts a priori of the understanding conceivable and thus to establish their origin and their truth summary representation of the correctness and of the only possibility of this deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding if the objects with which our knowledge has to deal were things by themselves we could have no concepts a priori of them for where should we take them if we took them from the object without asking even the question how that object could be known to us our     concepts would be empirical only not concepts a priori if we took them from within ourselves then that which is within us only could not determine the nature of an object different from our representations that is supply a ground why there should be a thing to which something like what we have in our thoughts really belongs and why all this representation should not rather be altogether empty but if on the contrary we have to deal with phenomena only then it becomes not only possible but necessary that certain concepts a priori should precede our empirical knowledge of objects for being phenomena they form an object that is within us only because a mere modification of our sensibility can never exist outside us the very idea that all these phenomena and therefore all objects with which we have to deal are altogether within me or determinations of my own identical self  0  implies by itself the necessity of a permanent unity of them in one and the same apperception in that unity of a possible consciousness consists also the form of all knowledge of objects by which the manifold is thought as belonging to one object the manner therefore in which the manifold of sensuous representation intuition belongs to our consciousness precedes all knowledge of an object as its intellectual form and constitutes a kind of formal a priori knowledge of all objects in general if they are to be thought categories their synthesis   0 by means of pure imagination and the unity of all representations with reference to the original apperception precede all empirical knowledge pure concepts of the understanding are therefore a priori possible nay with regard to experience necessary for this simple reason because our knowledge has to deal with nothing but phenomena the possibility of which depends on ourselves and the connection and unity of which in the representation of an object can be found in ourselves only as antecedent to all experience nay as first rendering all experience possible so far as its form is concerned on this ground as the only possible one our deduction of the categories has been carried out  0  book ii analytic of principles general logic is built up on a plan that coincides accurately with the division of the higher faculties of knowledge these are understanding judgment and reason logic therefore treats in its analytical portion of concepts judgments and syllogisms corresponding with the functions and the order of the abovenamed faculties     of the mind which are generally comprehended under the vague name of the understanding as formal logic takes no account of the contents of our knowledge pure or empirical but treats of the form of thought only discursive knowledge it may well contain in its analytical portion the canon of reason also reason being according to its form subject to definite rules which without reference to the particular nature of the knowledge to which they are applied can be found out a priori by a mere analysis of the acts of reasoning into their component parts transcendental logic being limited to a certain content namely to pure knowledge a priori cannot follow general logic in this division for it is clear that the transcendental use of reason cannot be objectively valid and cannot therefore belong to the logic of truth that is to analytic but must be allowed to form a separate part of our scholastic  0  system as a logic of illusion under the name of transcendental dialectic understanding and judgment have therefore a canon of their objectively valid and therefore true use in transcendental logic and belong to its analytical portion but reason in its attempts to determine anything a priori with reference to objects and to extend knowledge beyond the limits of possible experience is altogether dialectical and its illusory assertions have no place in a canon     such as analytic demands our analytic of principles therefore will be merely a canon of the faculty of judgment teaching it how to apply to phenomena the concepts of the understanding which contain the condition of rules a priori for this reason and in order to indicate my purpose more clearly i shall use the name of doctrine of the faculty of judgment while treating of the real principles of the understanding introduction of the transcendental faculty of judgment in general if the understanding is explained as the faculty of rules the faculty of judgment consists in performing the subsumption under these rules that is in determining whether anything falls under a given rule casus datæ legis or not general logic contains no precepts for the faculty of judgment and cannot contain them for as it takes no account of the contents of our knowledge it has only to explain analytically the mere form of knowledge in concepts judgments and syllogisms and thus     to establish formal rules for the proper employment of the  0  understanding if it were to attempt to show in general how anything should be arranged under these rules and how we should determine whether something falls under them or not this could only take place by means of a new rule this because it is a new rule requires a new precept for the faculty of judgment and we thus learn that though the understanding is capable of being improved and instructed by means of rules the faculty of judgment is a special talent which cannot be taught but must be practised this is what constitutes our socalled motherwit the absence of which cannot be remedied by any schooling for although the teacher may offer and as it were graft into a narrow understanding plenty of rules borrowed from the experience of others the faculty of using them rightly must belong to the pupil himself and without that talent no precept that may be given is safe from abuse  a physician therefore a judge or     a politician may carry in his head many beautiful pathological juridical or political rules nay he may even become an accurate teacher of them and he may yet in the application of these rules commit many a blunder either because he is deficient in judgment though not in understanding knowing the general in the abstract but unable to determine whether a concrete case falls under it or it may be because his judgment has not been sufficiently trained by examples and practical experience it is the   0 one great advantage of examples that they sharpen the faculty of judgment but they are apt to impair the accuracy and precision of the understanding because they fulfil but rarely the conditions of the rule quite adequately as casus in terminis nay they often weaken the effort of the understanding in comprehending rules according to their general adequacy and independent of the special circumstances of experience and accustom us to use those rules in the end as formulas rather than as principles examples may thus be called the gocart of the judgment which those who are deficient in that natural talent  can never do without but although general logic can give no precepts     to the faculty of judgment the case is quite different with transcendental logic so that it even seems as if it were the proper business of the latter to correct and to establish by definite rules the faculty of the judgment in the use of the pure understanding for as a doctrine and a means of enlarging the field of pure knowledge a priori for the benefit of the understanding philosophy does not seem necessary but rather hurtful because in spite of all attempts that have been hitherto made hardly a single inch of ground has been gained by it for critical purposes however and in order to guard the faculty of judgment against mistakes lapsus judicii in its use of the few pure concepts of the understanding which we possess philosophy though its benefits may be negative only has to employ all the acuteness and penetration at its command     what distinguishes transcendental philosophy is that besides giving the rules or rather the general condition of rules which are contained in the pure concept of the understanding it can at the same time indicate a priori the case to which each rule may be applied the superiority which it enjoys in this respect over all other sciences except mathematics is due to this that it treats of concepts which are meant to refer to their objects a priori so that their objective validity cannot be proved     a posteriori because this would not affect their own peculiar dignity it must show on the contrary by means of general but sufficient marks the conditions under which objects can be given corresponding to those concepts otherwise these would be without any contents mere logical forms and not pure concepts of the understanding our transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgment will consist of two chapters the first will treat of the sensuous condition under which alone pure concepts of the understanding can be used this is what i call the schematism of the pure understanding the second will treat of the synthetical judgments which can be derived a priori under these conditions from pure concepts of the understanding and on which all knowledge a priori depends it will treat therefore of the principles of the pure understanding     chapter i of the schematism of the pure concepts of the understanding     in comprehending any object under a concept the representation of the former must be homogeneous with the latter  that is the concept must contain that which is represented in the object to be comprehended under it for this is the only meaning of the expression that an object is comprehended under a concept thus for instance the empirical concept of a plate is homogeneous with the pure geometrical concept of a circle the roundness which is conceived in the first forming an object of intuition in the latter now it is clear that pure concepts of the understanding as compared with empirical or sensuous impressions in general are entirely heterogeneous and can never be met     with in any intuition how then can the latter be comprehended under the former or how can the categories be applied to phenomena as no one is likely to say that causality for instance could be seen through the senses and was contained in the phenomenon it is     really this very natural and important question which renders a transcendental doctrine of the faculty of judgment necessary in order to show how it is possible that any of the pure concepts of the understanding can be applied to phenomena in all other sciences in which the concepts by which the object is thought in general are not so heterogeneous or different from those which represent it in concreto and as it is given there is no necessity to enter into any discussions as to the applicability of the former to the latter in our case there must be some third thing homogeneous on the one side with the category and on the other with the phenomenon to render the application of the former to the latter possible this intermediate representation must be pure free from all that is empirical and yet intelligible on the one side and sensuous on the other such a representation is the transcendental schema the concept of the understanding contains pure synthetical unity of the manifold in general time as the formal condition of the manifold in the internal sense consequently of the conjunction of all representations contains a manifold a priori in pure intuition a transcendental determination of time is so far homogeneous with the category which constitutes its unity that it is general and founded on a rule a priori and it is on the other hand so far homogeneous with the phenomenon     that time must be contained in every empirical     representation of the manifold the application of the category to phenomena becomes possible therefore by means of the transcendental determination of time which as a schema of the concepts of the understanding allows the phenomena to be comprehended under the category after what has been said in the deduction of the categories we hope that nobody will hesitate in answering the question whether these pure concepts of the understanding allow only of an empirical or also of a transcendental application that is whether as conditions of a possible experience they refer a priori to phenomena only or whether as conditions of the possibility of things in general they may be extended to objects by themselves without restriction to our sensibility for there we saw that concepts are quite impossible and cannot have any meaning unless there be an object given either to them or at least to some of the elements of which they consist and that they can never refer to things by themselves without regard as to whether and how things may be given to us we likewise saw that the only way in which objects can be given to us consists in a modification of our sensibility and lastly that pure concepts a priori must contain besides the function of the understanding in the category itself formal conditions a priori of sensibility particularly   0 of the internal sense which form the general condition under which alone the category may be applied to any object we shall call this formal and pure condition of sensibility to which the concept of the understanding is restricted in its application its schema and the function of the understanding in these schemata the schematism of the pure understanding the schema by itself is no doubt a product of the imagination     only but as the synthesis of the imagination does not aim at a single intuition but at some kind of unity alone in the determination of sensibility the schema ought to be distinguished from the image thus if i place five points one after the other       this is an image of the number five if on the contrary i think of a number in general whether it be five or a hundred this thinking is rather the representation of a method of representing in one image a certain quantity for instance a thousand according to a certain concept than the image itself which in the case of a thousand i could hardly take in and compare with the concept this representation of a general procedure of the imagination by which a concept receives its image i call the schema of such concept the fact is that our pure sensuous concepts do not depend on images of objects but on schemata     no image of a triangle in general could ever be adequate to its concept it would never attain to that generality of the concept which makes it applicable to all triangles whether rightangled or acuteangled or anything else but would always be restricted to one portion only of the sphere of the concept the schema of the triangle can exist nowhere but in thought and is in fact a rule for the synthesis of imagination with respect to pure forms in space still less does an object of experience or its image ever cover the empirical concept which always refers directly to the schema of imagination as a rule for the determination of our intuitions according to a certain general concept the concept of dog means a rule according to which my imagination can always draw a general outline of the figure of a fourfooted animal without being restricted to any particular figure supplied     by experience or to any possible image which i may draw in the concrete this schematism of our understanding applied to phenomena and their mere form is an art hidden in the depth of the human soul the true secrets of which we shall hardly ever be able to guess and reveal so much only we can say that the image is a product of the empirical faculty of the productive imagination while the schema of sensuous concepts such as of figures in space is a product and so to say a monogram of     the pure imagination a priori through which and according to which images themselves become possible though they are never fully adequate to the concept and can be connected with it by means of their schema only the schema of a pure concept of the understanding on the contrary is something which can never be made into an image for it is nothing but the pure synthesis determined by a rule of unity according to concepts a synthesis as expressed by the category and represents a transcendental product of the imagination a product which concerns the determination of the internal sense in general under the conditions of its form time with reference to all representations so far as these are meant to be joined a priori in one concept according to the unity of apperception without dwelling any longer on a dry and tedious determination of all that is required for the transcendental schemata of the pure concepts of the understanding in general we shall proceed at once to represent them according to the order of the categories and in connection with them the pure image of all quantities quanta before the external sense is space that of all objects of the senses in general time the pure schema of quantity quantitas     however as a concept of the understanding is number a representation which comprehends the successive addition of one to one homogeneous number therefore is nothing but the unity of the synthesis     of the manifold repetition of a homogeneous intuition in general i myself producing the time in the apprehension of the intuition reality is in the pure concept of the understanding that which corresponds to a sensation in general that therefore the concept of which indicates by itself being in time while negation is that the concept of which represents notbeing in time the opposition of the two takes place therefore by a distinction of one and the same time as either filled or empty as time is only the form of intuition that is of objects as phenomena that which in the phenomena corresponds to sensation constitutes the transcendental matter of all objects as things by themselves reality sachheit every sensation however has a degree of quantity by which it can fill the same time that is the internal sense with reference to the same representation of an object more or less till it vanishes into nothing equal to nought or negation there exists therefore a relation and connection or rather a transition from reality to negation which makes every reality representable as a quantum and the schema of a reality as the quantity of something which fills time is this very continuous and uniform production of reality in time while we either descend from the sensation which has a certain degree to its vanishing in time or ascend from the negation of sensation to some quantity of it the schema of substance is the permanence     of the real in time that is the representation of it as a     substratum for the empirical determination of time in general which therefore remains while everything else changes it is not time that passes but the existence of the changeable passes in time what corresponds therefore in the phenomena to time which in itself is unchangeable and permanent is the unchangeable in existence that is substance and it is only in it that the succession and the coexistence of phenomena can be determined according to time the schema of cause and of the causality of a thing in general is the real which when once supposed to exist is always followed by something else it consists therefore in the succession of the manifold in so far as that succession is subject to a rule the schema of community reciprocal action or of the reciprocal causality of substances in respect to their accidents is the coexistence according to a general rule of the determinations of the one with those of the other the schema of possibility is the agreement of the synthesis of different representations with the conditions of time in general as for instance when opposites cannot exist at the same time in the same thing but only one after the other it is therefore the determination of the representation of a thing at any time whatsoever the schema of reality is existence at a given time     the schema of necessity is the existence of an object at all times it is clear therefore if we examine all the categories that the schema of quantity contains and represents the production synthesis of time itself in the successive apprehension of an object the schema of quality the synthesis of sensation perception with the representation     of time or the fillingup of time the schema of relation the relation of perceptions to each other at all times that is according to a rule which determines time lastly the schema of modality and its categories time itself as the correlative of the determination of an object as to whether and how it belongs to time the schemata therefore are nothing but determinations of time a priori according to rules and these as applied to all possible objects refer in the order of the categories to the series of time the contents of time the order of time and lastly the comprehension of time we have thus seen that the schematism of the understanding by means of a transcendental synthesis of imagination amounts to nothing else but to the unity of the manifold in the intuition of the internal sense and therefore indirectly to the unity of apperception as an active function corresponding to the internal sense as receptive these schemata therefore of the pure concepts of the understanding are the true and only conditions     by which these concepts can gain a relation to objects that is a significance and the categories are thus in the end of no other but a possible empirical use serving only on account of an a priori necessary unity the necessary connection of all consciousness in one original apperception to subject all phenomena to general rules of synthesis and thus to render them capable of a general connection in experience all our knowledge is contained within this whole of possible experience and transcendental truth which precedes all empirical truth and renders it possible consists in general relation of it to that experience but although the schemata of sensibility serve thus to realise the categories it must strike everybody that they   0 at the same time restrict them that is limit them by conditions foreign to the understanding and belonging to sensibility hence the schema is really the phenomenon or the sensuous concept of an object in agreement with the category numerus est quantitas phaenomenon sensatio realitas phaenomenon constans et perdurabile rerum substantia phaenomenon — aeternitas necessitas phaenomenon etc if we omit a restrictive condition it would seem that we amplify a formerly limited concept and that therefore the categories in their pure meaning     free from all conditions of sensibility should be valid of things in general as they are while their schemata represent them only as they appear so that these categories might claim a far more extended power independent of all schemata and in truth we must allow to these pure concepts of the understanding apart from all sensuous conditions a certain significance though a logical one only with regard to the mere unity of representations produced by them although these representations have no object and therefore no meaning that could give us a concept of an object thus substance if we leave out the sensuous condition of permanence would mean nothing but a something that may be conceived as a subject without being the predicate of anything else of such a representation we can make nothing because it does not teach us how that thing is determined which is thus to be considered as the first subject categories therefore without schemata are functions only of the understanding necessary for concepts but do not themselves represent any object this character is given to them by sensibility only which realises the understanding by at the same time restricting it     chapter ii system of all principles of the pure understanding     we have in the preceding chapter considered the transcendental faculty of judgment with reference to those general conditions only under which it is justified in using the pure concepts of the understanding for synthetical judgments it now becomes our duty to represent systematically those judgments which under that critical provision the understanding can really produce a priori for this purpose our table of categories will be without doubt our natural and best guide for it is the relation of the categories to all possible experience which must constitute all pure a priori knowledge of the understanding and their relation to sensibility in general will therefore exhibit completely and systematically all     the transcendental principles of the use of the understanding  principles a priori are so called not only because they contain the grounds for other judgments but also because they themselves are not founded on higher and more general kinds of knowledge this peculiarity however does not enable them to dispense with every kind of proof for although this could not be given objectively as     all knowledge of any object really rests on it this does not prevent us from attempting to produce a proof drawn from the subjective sources of the possibility of a knowledge of the object in general nay it may be necessary to do so because without it our assertion might be suspected of being purely gratuitous we shall treat however of those principles only which relate to the categories we shall have nothing to do with the principles of transcendental æsthetic according to which space and time are the conditions of the possibility of all things as phenomena nor with the limitation of those principles prohibiting their application to things by themselves mathematical principles also do not belong to this part of our discussion because they are derived from intuition and not from the pure concept of the understanding as they are however synthetical judgments a priori their possibility will have to be discussed not in order to prove their correctness and apodictic certainty which would be unnecessary but in order to make the possibility of such selfevident knowledge a priori conceivable and intelligible we shall also have to speak of the principle of analytical     as opposed to synthetical judgments the   0 latter being the proper subject of our enquiries because this very opposition frees the theory of the latter from all misunderstandings and places them clearly before us in their own peculiar character section i of the highest principle of all analytical judgments whatever the object of our knowledge may be and whatever the relation between our knowledge and its object it must always submit to that general though only negative condition of all our judgments that they do not contradict themselves otherwise these judgments without any reference to their object are in themselves nothing but although there may be no contradiction in our judgment it may nevertheless connect concepts in a manner not warranted by the object or without there being any ground whether a priori or a posteriori to confirm such a judgment a judgment may therefore be false or groundless though in itself it is free from all contradiction the proposition that no subject can have a     predicate which contradicts it is called the principle of contradiction it is a general though only negative criterion of all truth and belongs to logic only because it applies to knowledge as knowledge only without reference to its object and simply declares that such contradiction would entirely destroy and annihilate it nevertheless a positive use also may be made of that     principle not only in order to banish falsehood and error so far as they arise from contradiction but also in order to discover truth for in an analytical judgment whether negative or affirmative its truth can always be sufficiently tested by the principle of contradiction because the opposite of that which exists and is thought as a concept in our knowledge of an object is always rightly negatived while the concept itself is necessarily affirmed of it for the simple reason that its opposite would be in contradiction with the object it must therefore be admitted that the principle of contradiction is the general and altogether sufficient principle of all analytical knowledge though beyond this its authority and utility as a sufficient criterion of truth must not be allowed to extend for the fact that no knowledge can run counter to that principle without destroying itself makes it no doubt a conditio sine qua non     but never the determining reason of the truth of our knowledge now as in our present enquiry we are chiefly concerned with the synthetical part of our knowledge we must no doubt take great care never to offend against that inviolable principle but we ought never to expect from it any help with regard to the truth of this kind of knowledge there is however a formula of this famous principle — a principle merely formal and void of all contents — which contains a synthesis that has been mixed up with it from mere carelessness and without any real necessity this formula is it is impossible that anything should be and at the same time not be here first of all the apodictic certainty expressed by the word impossible is added unnecessarily because it is understood by itself from the nature     of the proposition secondly the proposition is affected by the condition of time and says as it were something  a which is something  b cannot be at the same time notb but it can very well be both b and notb in succession for instance a man who is young cannot be at the same time old but the same man may very well be young at one time and not young that is old at another the principle of contradiction however as a purely logical principle must not be limited in its application by time and the beforementioned formula     runs therefore counter to its very nature the misunderstanding arises from our first separating one predicate of an object from its concept and by our afterwards joining its opposite with that predicate which gives us a contradiction not with the subject but with its predicate only which was synthetically connected with it and this again only on condition that the first and second predicate have both been applied at the same time if i want to say that a man who is unlearned is not learned i must add the condition at the same time for a man who is unlearned at one time may very well be learned at another but if i say no unlearned man is learned then the proposition is analytical because the characteristic unlearnedness forms part now of the concept of the subject so that the negative proposition becomes evident directly from the principle of contradiction and without the necessity of adding the condition at the same time this is the reason why i have so altered the wording of that formula that it displays at once the nature of an analytical proposition     section ii of the highest principle of all synthetical judgments     the explanation of the possibility of synthetical judgments is a subject of which general logic knows nothing not even its name while in a transcendental logic it is the most important task of all nay even the only one when we have to consider the possibility of synthetical judgments a priori their conditions and the extent of their validity for when that task is accomplished the object of transcendental logic namely to determine the extent and limits of the pure understanding will have been fully attained in forming an analytical judgment i remain within a given concept while predicating something of it if what i predicate is affirmative i only predicate of that concept what is already contained in it if it is negative i only exclude from it the opposite of it in forming synthetical judgments on the contrary i have to go beyond a given concept in order to bring something together with it which is totally different from what is contained in it here we have neither the relation of identity     nor of contradiction and nothing in the judgment itself by which we can discover its truth or its falsehood granted therefore that we must go beyond a given concept in order to compare it synthetically with another something else is necessary in which as in a third the synthesis of two concepts becomes possible what then     is that third what is the medium of all synthetical judgments it can only be that in which all our concepts are contained namely the internal sense and its a priori form time the synthesis of representations depends on imagination but their synthetical unity which is necessary for forming a judgment depends on the unity of apperception it is here therefore that the possibility of synthetical judgments and as all the three contain the sources of representations a priori the possibility of pure synthetical judgments also will have to be discovered nay they will on these grounds be necessary if any knowledge of objects is to be obtained that rests entirely on a synthesis of representations if knowledge is to have any objective reality that is to say if it is to refer to an object and receive by means of it any sense and meaning the object must necessarily be given in some way or other without that all concepts are empty we have thought in them but we have not by thus thinking arrived at any knowledge we have only played with representations to give an object if this is not meant again as mediate only but if     it means to represent something immediately in intuition is nothing else but to refer the representation of the object to experience real or possible even space and time however pure these concepts may be of all that is empirical and however certain it is that they are represented in the mind entirely a priori would lack nevertheless all objective validity all sense and meaning if we could not show the necessity of their use with reference to all objects of experience nay their representation is is a pure schema always referring to that reproductive imagination which calls up the objects of experience     without which objects would be meaningless the same applies to all concepts without any distinction it is therefore the possibility of experience which alone gives objective reality to all our knowledge a priori experience however depends on the synthetical unity of phenomena that is on a synthesis according to concepts of the object of phenomena in general without it it would not even be knowledge but only a rhapsody of perceptions which would never grow into a connected text according to the rules of an altogether coherent possible consciousness nor into a transcendental and necessary unity of apperception experience depends therefore on a priori principles of its form that is on general rules of unity in the synthesis of phenomena     and the objective reality of these rules can always be shown by their being the necessary conditions in all experience nay even in the possibility of all experience without such a relation synthetical propositions a priori would be quite impossible because they have no third medium that is no object in which the synthetical unity of their concepts could prove their objective reality although we know therefore a great deal a priori in synthetical judgments with reference to space in general or to the figures which productive imagination traces in it without requiring for it any experience this our knowledge would nevertheless be nothing but a playing with the cobwebs of our brain if space were not to be considered as the condition of phenomena which supply the material for external experience those pure synthetical judgments therefore refer always though mediately only to possible experience or rather to the possibility of     experience on which alone the objective validity of their synthesis is founded as therefore experience being an empirical synthesis is in its possibility the only kind of knowledge that imparts reality to every other synthesis this other synthesis as knowledge a priori possesses truth agreement with its object on this condition only that it contains nothing beyond what is necessary for the synthetical     unity of experience in general the highest principle of all synthetical judgments is therefore this that every object is subject to the necessary conditions of a synthetical unity of the manifold of intuition in a possible experience thus synthetical judgments a priori are possible if we refer the formal conditions of intuition a priori the synthesis of imagination and the necessary unity of it in a transcendental apperception to a possible knowledge in general given in experience and if we say that the conditions of the possibility of experience in general are at the same time conditions of the possibility of the objects of experience themselves and thus possess objective validity in a synthetical judgment a priori section iii systematical representation of all synthetical principles of the understanding that there should be principles at all is entirely due to the pure understanding which is not only the faculty of rules in regard to all that happens but itself the source   0 of principles according to which everything     that can become an object to us is necessarily subject to rules because without such phenomena would never become objects corresponding to knowledge even laws of nature if they are considered as principles of the empirical use of the understanding carry with them a character of necessity and thus lead to the supposition that they rest on grounds which are valid a priori and before all experience nay all laws of nature without distinction are subject to higher principles of the understanding which they apply to particular cases of experience they alone therefore supply the concept which contains the condition and as it were the exponent of a rule in general while experience furnishes each case to which the general rule applies there can hardly be any danger of our mistaking purely empirical principles for principles of the pure understanding or vice versa for the character of necessity which distinguishes the concepts of the pure understanding and the absence of which can easily be perceived in every empirical proposition however general it may seem will always prevent their confusion there are however pure principles a priori which i should not like to ascribe to the pure understanding because they are derived not from pure concepts but from pure intuitions although by means of the understanding the   0 understanding being the faculty of the concepts we find such principles in mathematics but their application to experience and therefore their objective validity nay even the possibility of such synthetical knowledge a priori the deduction thereof rests always on the pure understanding     hence my principles will not include the principles of mathematics but they will include those on which the possibility and objective validity a priori of those mathematical principles are founded and which consequently are to be looked upon as the source of those principles proceeding from concepts to intuitions and not from intuitions to concepts when the pure concepts of the understanding are applied to every possible experience their synthesis is either mathematical or dynamical for it is directed partly to the intuition of a phenomenon only partly to its existence the conditions a priori of intuition are absolutely necessary with regard to every possible experience while the conditions of the existence of the object of a possible empirical intuition are in themselves accidental only the principles of the mathematical use of the categories will therefore be absolutely necessary that is apodictic while those of their dynamical use though likewise possessing the character of necessity a priori can possess such a character subject only to the condition of empirical thought in experience that is mediately and indirectly and cannot therefore claim that immediate evidence which belongs to the former although their certainty with regard to experience in general remains unaffected by this of this we shall be better qualified to judge at     the conclusion of this system of principles our table of categories gives us naturally the best instructions for drawing up a table of principles because these are nothing but rules for the objective use of the former     all principles of the pure understanding are therefore  i   axioms of intuition  ii  iii anticipations of perception  analogies of experience  iv   postulates of empirical thought in general  i have chosen these names not unadvisedly so that the difference with regard to the evidence and the application of those principles should not be overlooked we shall soon see that both with regard to the evidence and the a priori determination of phenomena according to the categories of quantity and quality if we attend to the form of them only their principles differ considerably from those of the other two classes inasmuch as the     former are capable of an intuitive the latter of a merely discursive though both of a complete certainty i shall therefore call the former mathematical the latter dynamical principles  it should be observed however that i do not speak here either of the principles of mathematics or of those of general physical dynamics but only of the principles of the pure understanding in relation to the internal sense without any regard to the actual representations given in it it is these through which the former become possible and i have given them their name more on account of their application than of their contents i shall now proceed to consider them in the same order in which they stand in the table     i of the axioms of intuition  principle of the pure understanding all phenomena are with reference to their intuition extensive quantities i call an extensive quantity that in which the representation of the whole is rendered possible by the representation of its parts and therefore necessarily preceded by it i cannot represent to myself any line however small it may be without drawing it in thought that is without producing all its parts one after the other starting     from a given point and thus first of all drawing its intuition the same applies to every even the smallest portion of time i can only think in it the successive progress from one moment to another thus producing in the end by all portions of time and their addition a definite quantity of time as in all phenomena pure intuition is either space or time every phenomenon as an intuition must be an extensive quantity because it can be known in apprehension by a successive synthesis only of part with part all phenomena therefore when perceived in intuition are aggregates collections of previously given parts which is not the case with every kind of quantities but with those only which are represented to us and apprehended as extensive on this successive synthesis of productive imagination in elaborating figures are founded the mathematics of extension with their axioms geometry containing the conditions     of sensuous intuition a priori under which alone the schema of a pure concept of an external phenomenal appearance can be produced for instance between two points one straight line only is possible or two straight lines cannot enclose a space etc these are the axioms which properly relate only to quantities quanta as such but with regard to quantity quantitas that is with regard to the answer to the question how large something may be there are no axioms in the proper     sense of the word though several of the propositions referring to it possess synthetical and immediate certainty indemonstrabilia the propositions that if equals be added to equals the wholes are equal and if equals be taken from equals the remainders are equal are really analytical because i am conscious immediately of the identity of my producing the one quantity with my producing the other axioms on the contrary must be synthetical propositions a priori the selfevident propositions on numerical relation again are no doubt synthetical but they are not general like those of geometry and therefore cannot be called axioms but numerical formulas only that      is not an analytical proposition for neither in the representation of   nor in that of   nor in that of the combination of both do i think the number    that i am meant to think it in the addition of the two is not the question here for in every analytical proposition all depends on this whether the predicate is really thought in the representation of the subject although the proposition is synthetical it is a singular proposition only if in this case we consider only the synthesis of the homogeneous unities then the synthesis can here take place in one way only although afterwards     the use of these numbers becomes general if i say a triangle can be constructed with three lines two of which together are greater than the third i have before me the mere function of productive imagination which may draw the lines greater or smaller and bring them together at various angles the number   on the contrary     is possible in one way only and so likewise the number    which is produced by the synthesis of the former with   such propositions therefore must not be called axioms for their number would be endless but numerical formulas this transcendental principle of phenomenal mathematics adds considerably to our knowledge a priori through it alone it becomes possible to make pure mathematics in their full precision applicable to objects of experience which without that principle would by no means be selfevident nay has actually provoked much contradiction phenomena are not things in themselves empirical intuition is possible only through pure intuition of space and time and whatever geometry says of the latter is valid without contradiction of the former all evasions as if objects of the senses should not conform to the rules of construction in space for instance to the rule of the infinite divisibility of lines or angles must cease for one would thus deny all objective validity to space and with it to all mathematics and would no longer know why and how far mathematics can be applied to phenomena the synthesis of spaces and times as the synthesis of the essential form of all intuition is that which renders possible at the same time the apprehension of phenomena that is every external     experience and therefore also all knowledge of its objects     and whatever mathematics in their pure use prove of that synthesis is valid necessarily also of this knowledge all objections to this are only the chicaneries of a falsely guided reason which wrongly imagines that it can separate the objects of the senses from the formal conditions of our sensibility and represents them though they are phenomena only as objects by themselves given to the understanding in this case however nothing could be known of them a priori nothing could be known synthetically through pure concepts of space and the science which determines those concepts namely geometry would itself become impossible ii anticipations of perception the principle which anticipates all perceptions as such is this in all phenomena sensation and the real which corresponds to it in the object realitas phaenomenon has an intensive quantity that is a degree  all knowledge by means of which i may know and determine a priori whatever belongs to empirical knowledge may be called an anticipation and it is no doubt in this sense that epicurus used the expression     πρόληψις but as there is always in phenomena something which can never be known a priori and constitutes the real difference between empirical and a priori knowledge namely sensation as matter of perception it follows that this can never be anticipated the pure determinations on the contrary in space and time as     regards both figure and quantity may be called anticipations of phenomena because they represent a priori whatever may be given a posteriori in experience if however there should be something in every sensation that could be known a priori as sensation in general even if no particular sensation be given this would in a very special sense deserve to be called anticipation because it seems extraordinary that we should anticipate experience in that which concerns the matter of experience and can be derived from experience only yet such is really the case apprehension by means of sensation only fills no more than one moment if we do not take into account the succession of many sensations sensation therefore being that in the phenomenon the apprehension of which does not form a successive synthesis progressing from parts to a complete representation is without any extensive quantity and the absence of sensation in one and the same moment would represent it as empty therefore  0     what corresponds in every empirical intuition to sensation is reality realitas phaenomenon what corresponds to its absence is negation  0 every sensation however is capable of diminution so that it may decrease and gradually vanish there is therefore a continuous connection between reality in phenomena and negation by means of many possible intermediate sensations the difference between which is always smaller than the difference between the given sensation and zero or complete negation it thus follows that the real in each phenomenon has always a quantity though it is not perceived in apprehension because apprehension takes place by a momentary sensation not by a successive synthesis of many sensations it does     not advance from the parts to the whole and though it has a quantity it has not an extensive quantity that quantity which can be apprehended as unity only and in which plurality can be represented by approximation only to negation  0 i call intensive quantity every reality therefore in a phenomenon has intensive quantity that is a degree if this reality is considered as a cause whether of sensation or of any other reality in the phenomenon for instance of change the degree of that reality as a cause we call a momentum for instance the momentum of gravity and this because the degree indicates that quantity only the apprehension of     which is not successive but momentary this i mention here in passing because we have not yet come to consider causality every sensation therefore and every reality in phenomena however small it may be has a degree that is an intensive quantity which can always be diminished and there is between reality and negation a continuous connection of possible realities and of possible smaller perceptions every colour red for instance has a degree which however small is never the smallest and the same applies to heat the momentum of gravity etc this peculiar property of quantities that no part of them is the smallest possible part no part indivisible is called continuity time and space are quanta continua because there is no part of them that is not enclosed between limits points and moments no part that is not itself again a space or a time space consists of spaces only time of times points and moments are only limits mere places of limitation and as places     presupposing always those intuitions which they are meant to limit or to determine mere places or parts that might be given before space or time could   0 never be compounded into space or time such quantities can also be called flowing because the synthesis of the productive imagination which creates them is a progression in time the continuity of which we are wont to express by the name of flowing or passing away all phenomena are therefore continuous quantities whether according to their intuition as extensive or according to mere perception sensation and therefore reality as intensive quantities when there is a break in the synthesis of the manifold of phenomena we get only an aggregate of many phenomena not a phenomenon as a real quantum for aggregate is called that what is produced not by the mere continuation of productive synthesis of a certain kind but by the repetition of a synthesis beginning and ending at every moment if i call thirteen thalers a quantum of money i am right provided i understand by it the value of a mark of fine silver this is a continuous quantity in which no part is the smallest but every part may constitute a coin which contains material for still smaller coins but if i understand by it thirteen round thalers that is so many coins whatever their value in silver may be then i should be wrong in speaking of a quantum of thalers but should call it an aggregate that is a number of coins as every number must be founded on some unity every     phenomenon as a unity is a quantum and as such a continuum if then all phenomena whether considered as extensive   0 or intensive are continuous quantities it might seem easy to prove with mathematical evidence that all change also transition of a thing from one state into another must be continuous if the causality of the change did not lie quite outside the limits of transcendental philosophy and presupposed empirical principles for the understanding a priori tells us nothing of the possibility of a cause which changes the state of things that is determines them to the opposite of a given state and this not only because it does not perceive the possibility of it for such a perception is denied to us in several kinds of knowledge a priori but because the changeability relates to certain determinations of phenomena to be taught by experience only while their cause must lie in that which is unchangeable but as the only materials which we may use at present are the pure fundamental concepts of every possible experience from which all that is empirical is excluded we cannot here without injuring the unity of our system anticipate general physical science which is based upon certain fundamental experiences     nevertheless there is no lack of evidence of the great influence which our fundamental principle exercises in anticipating perceptions nay even in making up for their deficiency in so far as it that principle stops any false conclusions that might be drawn from this deficiency if therefore all reality in perception has a certain degree between which and negation there is an infinite succession of ever smaller degrees and if every sense must have a definite degree of receptivity of sensations it follows that no perception and therefore no     experience is possible that could prove directly or indirectly by any roundabout syllogisms a complete absence of all reality in a phenomenon we see therefore that experience can never supply a proof of empty space or empty time because the total absence of reality in a sensuous intuition can itself never be perceived neither can it be deduced from any phenomenon whatsoever and from the difference of degree in its reality nor ought it ever to be admitted in explanation of it for although the total intuition of a certain space or time is real all through no part of it being empty yet as every reality has its degree which while the extensive quality of the phenomenon remains unchanged     may diminish by infinite degrees down to the nothing or void there must be infinitely differing degrees in which space and time are filled and the intensive quantity in phenomena may be smaller or greater although the extensive quantity as given in intuition remains the same we shall give an example almost all natural philosophers perceiving partly by means of the momentum of gravity or weight partly by means of the momentum of resistance against other matter in motion that there is a great difference in the quantity of various kinds of matter though their volume is the same conclude unanimously that this volume the extensive quantity of phenomena must in all of them though in different degrees contain a certain amount of empty space who could have thought that these mathematical and mechanical philosophers should have based such a conclusion on a purely metaphysical hypothesis which they always profess to avoid by assuming that the real     in space i do not wish here to call it impenetrability or weight because these are empirical concepts must always be the same and can differ only by its extensive quantity that is by the number of parts i meet this hypothesis for which they could find no ground in experience and which therefore is purely metaphysical by a transcendental demonstration which though it is not intended to explain the difference in the     filling of spaces will nevertheless entirely remove the imagined necessity of their hypothesis which tries to explain that difference by the admission of empty spaces and which thus restores at least to the understanding its liberty to explain to itself that difference in a different way if any such hypothesis be wanted in natural philosophy we can easily perceive that although the same spaces are perfectly filled by two different kinds of matter so that there is no point in either of them where matter is not present yet the real in either the quality being the same has its own degrees of resistance or weight which without any diminution of its extensive quantity may grow smaller and smaller in infinitum before it reaches the void and vanishes thus a certain expansion which fills a space for instance heat and every other kind of phenomenal reality may without leaving the smallest part of space empty diminish by degrees in infinitum and nevertheless fill space with its smaller quite as much as another phenomenon with greater degrees i do not mean to say that this is really the case with different kinds of matter according to their specific of gravity i only want to show by a fundamental principle of the pure     understanding that the nature of our perceptions renders     such an explanation possible and that it is wrong to look upon the real in phenomena as equal in degree and differing only in aggregation and its extensive quantity nay to maintain this on the pretended authority of an a priori principle of the understanding nevertheless this anticipation of perception is apt to startle  an enquirer accustomed to and rendered cautious by transcendental disquisitions and we may naturally wonder that the understanding should be able to anticipate  a synthetical proposition with regard to the degree of all that is real in phenomena and therefore with regard to the possibility of an internal difference of sensation itself apart from its empirical quality and it seems therefore a question well worthy of a solution how the understanding can pronounce synthetically and a priori about phenomena nay anticipate them with regard to what properly speaking is empirical namely sensation the quality of sensation colour taste etc is always empirical and cannot be conceived a priori but the real that corresponds to sensations in general as opposed to negation 0 does only represent something the concept of which implies being and means nothing but the synthesis in any empirical consciousness in the internal sense that empirical consciousness can be raised from 0 to     any higher degree so that an extensive quantity of intuition for instance an illuminated plain excites the same     amount of sensation as an aggregate of many other less illuminated plains it is quite possible therefore to take no account of the extensive quantity of a phenomenon and yet to represent to oneself in the mere sensation in any single moment a synthesis of a uniform progression from 0 to any given empirical consciousness all sensations as such are therefore given a posteriori  only but their quality in so far as they must possess a degree can be known a priori it is remarkable that of quantities in general we can know one quality only a priori namely their continuity while with regard to quality the real of phenomena nothing is known to us a priori but their intensive quantity that is that they must have a degree everything else is left to experience iii the analogies of experience the general principle of them is all phenomena as far as their existence is concerned are subject a priori to rules determining their mutual relation in one and the same time      the three modi of time are permanence succession and coexistence there will therefore be three rules of all relations of phenomena in time by which the existence of every phenomenon with regard to the unity of time is determined and these rules will precede all experience nay render experience possible the general principle of the three analogies depends on the necessary unity of apperception with reference to     every possible empirical consciousness perception at every time and consequently as that unity forms an a priori ground on the synthetical unity of all phenomena according to their relation in time for the original apperception refers to the internal sense comprehending all representations and it does so a priori to its form that is to the relation of the manifold of the empirical consciousness in time the original apperception is intended to combine all this manifold according to its relations in time for this is what is meant by its transcendental unity a priori to which all is subject which is to belong to my own and my uniform knowledge and thus to become an object for me this synthetical unity in the time relations of all perceptions which is determined a priori is expressed therefore in the law that all empirical determinations of time must be subject to rules of the general     determination of time and the analogies of experience of which we are now going to treat are exactly rules of this kind these principles have this peculiarity that they do not refer to phenomena and the synthesis of their empirical intuition but only to the existence of phenomena and their mutual relation with regard to their existence the manner in which something is apprehended as a phenomenon may be so determined a priori that the rule of its synthesis may give at the same time this intuition a priori in any empirical case nay may really render it possible but the existence of phenomena can never be known a priori and though we might be led in this way to infer some kind of existence we should never be able to know it definitely or to anticipate that by which the empirical intuition of one differs from that of others     the principles which we considered before and which as they enable us to apply mathematics to phenomena i called mathematical refer to phenomena so far only as they are possible and showed how with regard both to their intuition and to the real in their perception they can be produced according to the rules of a mathematical synthesis so that in the one as well as in the other we may use numerical quantities and with them a determination of all phenomena as quantities thus i might     for example compound the degree of sensations of the sunlight out of say  00000 illuminations by the moon and thus determine it a priori or construct it those former principles might therefore be called constitutive the case is totally different with those principles which are meant to bring the existence of phenomena under rules a priori for as existence cannot be constructed they can only refer to the relations of existence and become merely regulative principles here therefore we could not think of either axioms or anticipations and whenever a perception is given us as related in time to some others although undetermined we could not say a priori what other perception or how great a perception is necessarily connected with it but only how if existing it is necessarily connected with the other in a certain mode of time in philosophy analogy means something very different to what it does in mathematics in the latter they are formulas which state the equality of two quantitative relations and they are always constitutive so that when three  terms of a proposition are given the fourth also is given by it that is can be constructed out of it in philosophy     on the contrary analogy does not consist in the equality of two quantitative but of two qualitative relations so that when three terms are given i may learn from them a priori the relation to a fourth only but not that   0 fourth term itself all i can thus gain is a rule according to which i may look in experience for the fourth term or a characteristic mark by which i may find it an analogy of experience can therefore be no more than a rule according to which a certain unity of experience may arise from perceptions but not how perception itself as an empirical intuition may arise it may serve as a principle for objects as phenomena  not in a constitutive but only in a regulative capacity exactly the same applies to the postulates of empirical thought in general which relate to the synthesis of mere intuition the form of phenomena the synthesis of perception the matter of them and the synthesis of experience the relation of these perceptions they too are regulative principles only and differ from the mathematical which are constitutive not in their certainty which is established in both a priori but in the character of their evidence that is in that which is intuitive in it and therefore in their demonstration also what has been remarked of all synthetical principles and must be enjoined here more particularly is this that these analogies have their meaning and validity not as principles of the transcendent but only as principles     of the empirical use of the understanding they can be established in this character only nor can phenomena ever be comprehended under the categories directly but     only under their schemata if the objects to which these principles refer were things by themselves it would be perfectly impossible to know anything of them a priori and synthetically but they are nothing but phenomena and our whole knowledge of them to which after all all principles a priori must relate is only our possible experience of them those principles therefore can aim at nothing but the conditions of the unity of empirical knowledge in the synthesis of phenomena which synthesis is represented only in the schema of the pure concepts of the understanding while the category contains the function restricted by no sensuous condition of the unity of that synthesis as synthesis in general those principles will therefore authorise us only to connect phenomena according to analogy with the logical and universal unity of concepts so that though in using the principle we use the category yet in practice in the application to phenomena we put the schema of the category as a practical key in its  place or rather put it by the side of the category as a restrictive condition or as what may be called a formula of the category     a first analogy principle of permanence      all phenomena contain the permanent substance as the object itself and the changeable as its determination only that is as a mode in which the object exists proof of the first analogy all phenomena take place in time time can determine in two ways the relation in the existence of phenomena so far as they are either successive or coexistent in the first case time is considered as a series in the second as a whole our apprehension of the manifold of phenomena is always successive and therefore always changing by it alone therefore we can never determine whether the manifold as an object of experience is coexistent or successive unless there is something in it which exists always that is something constant and permanent while change and succession are nothing but so many kinds modi of time in which the permanent exists relations of time are therefore possible in the permanent only coexistence and succession being the only relations of time     so that the permanent is the substratum of the empirical representation of time itself and in it alone all determination of time is possible permanence expresses time as the constant correlative of all existence of phenomena of all change and concomitancy for change does not affect time itself but only phenomena in time nor is   0 coexistence a mode of time itself because in it no parts can be coexistent but successive only if we were to ascribe a succession to time itself it would be necessary to admit another time in which such succession should be possible only through the permanent does existence in different parts of a series of time assume a quantity which we call duration for in mere succession existence always comes and goes and never assumes the slightest quantity without something permanent therefore no relation of time is possible time by itself however cannot be perceived and it is therefore the permanent in phenomena that forms the substratum for all determination of time and at the same time the condition of the possibility of all synthetical unity of perceptions that is of experience while with regard to that permanent all existence and all change in time can only be taken as a mode of existence of what is permanent in all phenomena therefore the permanent is the object itself that is the substance phenomenon while all that changes or can change     belongs only to the mode in which substance or substances exist therefore to their determinations i find that in all ages not only the philosopher but also the man of common understanding has admitted this permanence as a substratum of all change of phenomena it will be the same in future only that a philosopher generally expresses himself somewhat more definitely by saying that in all changes in the world the substance remains and only the accidents change but i nowhere find even the attempt at a proof of this very synthetical proposition and it occupies but seldom that place which it ought to occupy at the head of the pure and entirely a priori existing laws of nature in fact the proposition     that substance is permanent is tautological because that permanence is the only ground why we apply the category of substance to a phenomenon and it ought first to have been proved that there is in all phenomena something permanent while the changeable is only a determination of its existence but as such a proof can never be given dogmatically and as deduced from concepts because it refers to a synthetical proposition a priori and as no one ever thought that such propositions could be valid only in reference to possible experience and could therefore be proved only by a deduction of the possibility of     experience we need not wonder that though it served as the foundation of all experience being felt to be indispensable for every kind of empirical knowledge it has never been established by proof a philosopher was asked what is the weight of smoke he replied deduct from the weight of the wood burnt the weight of the remaining ashes and you have the weight of the smoke he was therefore convinced that even in fire matter substance does not perish but that its form only suffers a change the proposition also from nothing comes nothing was only another conclusion from the same principle of permanence or rather of the constant presence of the real subject in phenomena for if that which people call substance in a phenomenon is to be the true substratum for all determination in time then all existence in the past as well as the future must be determined in it and in it only thus we can only give to a phenomenon the name of substance because we admit its existence at all times which is not even fully expressed by the word permanence because it refers rather to future time only the internal necessity however of permanence     is inseparably connected with the necessity to have been always and the expression may therefore stand     gigni de nihilo nihil in nihilum nil posse reverti were two propositions which the ancients never separated but which at present are sometimes parted because people imagine that they refer to things by themselves and that the former might contradict the dependence of the world on a supreme cause even with regard to its substance an apprehension entirely needless as we are only speaking here of phenomena in the sphere of experience the unity of which would never be possible if we allowed that new things new in substance could ever arise for in that case we should lose that which alone can represent the unity of time namely the identity of the substratum in which alone all change retains complete unity this permanence however is nothing but the manner in which we represent the existence of things as phenomenal the different determinations of a substance which are nothing but particular modes in which it exists are called accidents they are always real because they concern the existence of a substance negations are nothing but determinations which express the nonexistence of something in the substance if we want to ascribe a particular kind of existence to these real determinations of the substance as for instance to motion as an accident of matter we call it inherence in order to distinguish it from the existence of substance which  we call subsistence this however has given rise to many misunderstandings     and we shall express ourselves better and more correctly if we define the accident through the manner only     in which the existence of a substance is positively determined it is inevitable however according to the conditions of the logical use of our understanding to separate as it were whatever can change in the existence of a substance while the substance itself remains unchanged and to consider it in its relation to that which is radical and truly permanent hence a place has been assigned to this category under the title of relations not so much because it contains itself a relation as because it contains their condition on this permanence depends also the right understanding of the concept of change to arise and to perish are not changes of that which arises or perishes change is a mode of existence which follows another mode of existence of the same object hence whatever changes is permanent and its condition only changes as this alteration refers only to determinations which may have an end or a beginning we may use an expression that seems somewhat paradoxical and say the permanent only substance is changed the changing itself suffers no change but only an alteration certain determinations ceasing to exist while others begin it is therefore in substances only that change     can be perceived arising or perishing absolutely and not referring merely to a determination of the permanent can never become a possible perception because it is the permanent only which renders the representations of a transition from one state to another from not being to being possible which changes consequently can only be known empirically as alternating determinations of what is permanent if you suppose that something has an absolute beginning you must have a moment of time in     which it was not but with what can you connect that moment if not with that which already exists an empty antecedent time cannot be an object of perception but if you connect this beginning with things which existed already and continue to exist till the beginning of something new then the latter is only a determination of the former as of the permanent the same holds good with regard to perishing for this would presuppose the empirical representation of a time in which a phenomenon exists no longer substances therefore as phenomena are the true substrata of all determinations of time if some substances could arise and others perish the only condition of the empirical unity of time would be removed and phenomena would then be referred to two different times in which existence would pass side by side which is absurd for there is but one time in which all different times     must be placed not as simultaneous but as successive permanence therefore is a necessary condition under which alone phenomena as things or objects can be determined in a possible experience what the empirical criterion of this necessary permanence or of the substantiality of phenomena may be we shall have to explain in the sequel     b second analogy principle of production  everything that happens begins to be presupposes something on which it follows according to a rule proof the apprehension of the manifold of phenomena is always successive the representations of the parts follow one upon another whether they also follow one upon the other in the object is a second point for reflection not contained in the former we may indeed call everything even every representation so far as we are conscious of it an object but it requires a more profound investigation to discover what this word may   0 mean with regard to phenomena not in so far as they as representations are objects but in so far as they only signify an object so far as they as representations only are at the same time objects of consciousness they cannot be distinguished from our apprehension that is from their being received in the synthesis of our imagination and we must therefore say that the manifold of phenomena is always produced in the mind successively if phenomena were things by themselves the succession of the representations of their manifold would never enable us to judge how that manifold is connected in the object we have always to deal with our representations only how things may be by themselves without reference to the representations by which they affect us is completely beyond the     sphere of our knowledge since therefore phenomena are not things by themselves and are yet the only thing that can be given to us to know i am asked to say what kind of connection in time belongs to the manifold of the phenomena itself when the representation of it in our apprehension is always successive thus for instance the apprehension of the manifold in the phenomenal appearance of a house that stands before me is successive the question then arises whether the manifold of the house itself be successive by itself which of course no one would admit whenever i ask for the transcendental meaning of my concepts of an object i find that a house is not a thing by itself but a phenomenon     only that is a representation the transcendental object of which is unknown what then can be the meaning of the question how the manifold in the phenomenon itself which is not a thing by itself may be connected here that which is contained in our successive apprehension is considered as representation and the given phenomenon though it is nothing but the whole of those representations as their object with which my concept drawn from the representations of my apprehension is to accord as the accord between knowledge and its object is truth it is easily seen that we can ask here only for the formal conditions of empirical truth and that the phenomenon in contradistinction to the representations of our apprehension can only be represented as the object different from them if it is subject to a rule distinguishing it from every other apprehension and necessitating a certain kind of conjunction of the manifold that which in the phenomenon contains the condition of this necessary rule of apprehension is the object     let us now proceed to our task that something takes place that is that something or some state which did not exist before begins to exist cannot be perceived empirically unless there exists antecedently a phenomenon which does not contain that state for a reality following on empty time that is a beginning of existence     preceded by no state of things can be apprehended as little as empty time itself every apprehension of an event is therefore a perception following on another perception but as this applies to all synthesis of apprehension as i showed before in the phenomenal appearance of a house that apprehension would not thereby be different from any other but i observe at the same time that if in a phenomenon which contains an event i call the antecedent state of perception a and the subsequent b b can only follow a in my apprehension while the perception a can never follow b but can only precede it i see for instance a ship gliding down a stream my perception of its place below follows my perception of its place higher up in the course of the stream and it is impossible in the apprehension of this phenomenon that the ship should be perceived first below and then higher up we see therefore that the order in the succession of perceptions in our apprehension is here determined and our apprehension regulated by that order in the former example of a house my perceptions could begin in the apprehension at the roof and end in the basement or begin below and end above they could apprehend the manifold of the empirical intuition from right to left or from left to right there was therefore no determined order in the succession of these perceptions determining the point where     i had to begin in apprehension in order to connect the     manifold empirically while in the apprehension of an event there is always a rule which makes the order of the successive perceptions in the apprehension of this phenomenon necessary in our case therefore we shall have to derive the subjective succession in our apprehension from the objective succession of the phenomena because otherwise the former would be entirely undetermined and unable to distinguish one phenomenon from another the former alone proves nothing as to the connection of the manifold in the object because it is quite arbitrary the latter must therefore consist in the order of the manifold in a phenomenon according to which the apprehension of what is happening follows upon the apprehension of what has happened in conformity with a rule thus only can i be justified in saying not only of my apprehension but of the phenomenon itself that there exists in it a succession which is the same as to say that i cannot arrange the apprehension otherwise than in that very succession in conformity with this there must exist in that which always precedes an event the condition of a rule by which this event follows at all times and necessarily     but i cannot go back from the event and determine by apprehension that which precedes for no phenomenon goes back from the succeeding to the preceding point of time though it is related to some preceding point of time while the progress from a given time to a determined following time is necessary therefore as there certainly is something that follows i must necessarily refer it to something else which precedes and upon which it follows by rule that is by necessity so that the event as being     conditional affords a safe indication of some kind of condition while that condition itself determines the event if we supposed that nothing precedes an event upon which such event must follow according to rule all succession of perception would then exist in apprehension only that is subjectively but it would not thereby be determined objectively what ought properly to be the antecedent and what the subsequent in perception we should thus have a mere play of representations unconnected with any object that is no phenomenon would by our perception be distinguished in time from any other phenomenon because the succession in apprehension would always be uniform and there would be nothing in the phenomena to determine the succession so as to render a certain sequence objectively necessary i could not say therefore that two states follow each other in a phenomenon but only that one apprehension follows     another which is purely subjective and does not determine any object and cannot be considered therefore as knowledge of anything even of something purely phenomenal if therefore experience teaches us that something happens we always presuppose that something precedes on which it follows by rule otherwise i could not say of the object that it followed because its following in my apprehension only without being determined by rule in reference to what precedes would not justify us in admitting an objective following  it is therefore always with reference to a rule by which phenomena as they follow that is as they happen are determined by an antecedent   0 state that i can give an objective character to my subjective synthesis of apprehension nay it is under this supposition only that an experience of anything that happens becomes possible it might seem indeed as if this were in contradiction to all that has always been said on the progress of the human understanding it having been supposed that only by a perception and comparison of many events following in the same manner on preceding phenomena we were led to the discovery of a rule according to which certain events always follow on certain phenomena and that thus only we were enabled to form to ourselves the concept of a cause if this were so that concept would be     empirical only and the rule which it supplies that everything which happens must have a cause would be as accidental as experience itself the universality and necessity of that rule would then be fictitious only and devoid of any true and general validity because not being a priori but founded on induction only the case is the same as with other pure representations a priori for instance space and time which we are only able to draw out as pure concepts from experience because we have put them first into experience nay have rendered experience possible only by them it is true no doubt that the logical clearness of this representation of a rule determining the succession of events as a concept of cause becomes possible only when we have used it in experience but as the condition of the synthetical unity of phenomena in time it was nevertheless the foundation of all experience and consequently preceded it a priori it is necessary therefore to show by examples that we never even in experience ascribe the sequence or consequence     of an event or something happening that did not exist before to the object and distinguish it from the subjective sequence of our apprehension except when there is a rule which forces us to observe a certain order of perceptions and no other nay that it is this force which from the first renders the representation of a     succession in the object possible we have representations within us and can become conscious of them but however far that consciousness may extend and however accurate and minute it may be yet the representations are always representations only that is internal determinations of our mind in this or that relation of time what right have we then to add to these representations an object or to ascribe to these modifications beyond their subjective reality another objective one their objective character cannot consist in their relation to another representation of that which one wished to predicate of the object for thus the question would only arise again how that representation could again go beyond itself and receive an objective character in addition to the subjective one which belongs to it as a determination of our mind if we try to find out what new quality or dignity is imparted to our representations by their relation to an object we find that it consists in nothing but the rendering necessary the connection of representations in a certain way and subjecting them to a rule and that on the other hand they receive their objective character only because a certain order is necessary in the time relations of our representations in the synthesis of phenomena the manifold     of our representations is always successive no object can thus be represented because through the succession     which is common to all apprehensions nothing can be distinguished from anything else but as soon as i perceive or anticipate that there is in this succession a relation to an antecedent state from which the representation follows by rule then something is represented as an event or as something that happens that is to say i know an object to which i must assign a certain position in time which after the preceding state cannot be different from what it is if therefore i perceive that something happens this representation involves that something preceded because the phenomenon receives its position in time with reference to what preceded that is it exists after a time in which it did not exist its definite position in time can only be assigned to it if in the antecedent state something is presupposed on which it always follows by rule it thus follows that first of all i cannot invert the order and place that which happens before that on which it follows secondly that whenever the antecedent state is there the other event must follow inevitably and necessarily thus it happens that there arises an order among our representations in which the present state     as having come to be points to an antecedent state as a correlative of the event that is given a correlative which though as yet indefinite refers as determining to the event as its result and connects that event with itself by necessity in the succession of time if then it is a necessary law of our sensibility and therefore a formal condition of all perception that a preceding necessarily determines a succeeding time because i cannot arrive at the succeeding time except through the preceding it is also an indispensable law of the empirical representation of the series of time that the phenomena of     past time determine every existence in succeeding times nay that these as events cannot take place except so far as the former determine their existence in time that is determine it by rule for it is of course in phenomena only that we can know empirically this continuity in the coherence of times what is required for all experience and renders it possible is the understanding and the first that is added by it is not that it renders the representation of objects clear but that it really renders the representation of any object for the first time possible this takes place by the understanding transferring the order of time to the phenomena and their existence and by assigning to each of them as to a consequence a certain a priori determined place in time with reference to antecedent phenomena without which place phenomena would not be in  00 accord with time which determines a priori their places to all its parts this determination of place cannot be derived from the relation in which phenomena stand to absolute time for that can never be an object of perception but on the contrary phenomena must themselves determine to each other their places in time and render them necessary in the series of time in other words what happens or follows must follow according to a general rule on that which was contained in a previous state we thus get a series of phenomena which by means of the understanding produces and makes necessary in the series of possible perceptions the same order and continuous coherence which exists a priori in the form of internal intuition time in which all perceptions must have their place that something happens is therefore a perception which belongs to a possible experience and this experience     becomes real when i consider the phenomenon as determined with regard to its place in time that is to say as an object which can always be found according to a rule in the connection of perceptions this rule by which we determine everything according to the succession of time is this the condition under which an event follows at all times necessarily is to be found in what precedes all possible experience therefore that is all objective knowledge of phenomena with regard to their relation in the succession of time depends on  0  the principle of sufficient reason the proof of this principle rests entirely on the following considerations all empirical knowledge requires synthesis of the manifold by imagination which is always successive one representation following upon the other that succession however in the imagination is not at all determined with regard to the order in which something precedes and something follows and the series of successive representations may be taken as retrogressive as well as progressive if that synthesis however is a synthesis of apperception of the manifold in a given phenomenon then the order is determined in the object or to speak more accurately there is then in it an order of successive synthesis which determines the object and according to which something must necessarily precede and when it is once there something else must necessarily follow if therefore my perception is to contain the knowledge of an event or something that really happens it must consist of an empirical judgment by which the succession is supposed to be determined so that the event presupposes another phenomenon in time on which it follows necessarily and according to a rule if it were different if the     antecedent phenomenon were there and the event did not follow on it necessarily it would become to me a mere play of my subjective imaginations or if i thought it to be objective i should call it a dream it is therefore the relation of phenomena as possible perceptions  0  according to which the existence of the subsequent what happens is determined in time by something antecedent necessarily and by rule or in other words the relation of cause and effect which forms the condition of the objective validity of our empirical judgments with regard to the series of perceptions and therefore also the condition of the empirical truth of them and of experience the principle of the causal relation in the succession of phenomena is valid therefore for all objects of experience also under the conditions of succession because that principle is itself the ground of the possibility of such experience here however we meet with a difficulty that must first be removed the principle of the causal connection of phenomena is restricted in our formula to their succession while in practice we find that it applies also to their coexistence because cause and effect may exist at the same time there may be for instance inside a room heat which is not found in the open air if i look for its cause i find a heated stove but that stove as cause exists at the same time with its effect the heat of the room and there is therefore no succession in time between cause and effect but they are coexistent and yet the law applies the fact is that the greater portion of the active  0  causes  in nature is coexistent with its effects and the     succession of these effects in time is due only to this that a cause cannot produce its whole effect in one moment but at the moment in which an effect first arises it is always coexistent with the causality of its cause because if that had ceased one moment before the effect would never have happened here we must well consider that what is thought of is the order not the lapse of time and that the relation remains even if no time had lapsed the time between the causality of the cause and its immediate effect can be vanishing they may be simultaneous but the relation of the one to the other remains for all that determinable in time if i look upon a ball that rests on a soft cushion and makes a depression in it as a cause it is simultaneous with its effect but i nevertheless distinguish the two through the temporal relation of dynamical connection for if i place the ball on a cushion its smooth surface is followed by a depression while if there is a depression in the cushion i know not whence a leaden ball does by no means follow from it the succession in time is therefore the only empirical criterion of an effect with regard to the causality of the cause which precedes it the glass is the cause of the rising of the water above its horizontal surface  0  although both phenomena are simultaneous for as soon as i draw water in a glass from a larger vessel something follows namely the change of the horizontal state which it had before into a concave state which it assumes in the glass this causality leads to the concept of action that to the concept of force and lastly to the concept of substance as i do not mean to burden my critical task which only concerns the sources of synthetical knowledge     a priori with analytical processes which aim at the explanation and not at the expansion of our concepts i leave a fuller treatment of these to a future system of pure reason nay i may refer to many wellknown manuals in which such an analysis may be found i cannot pass however over the empirical criterion of a substance so far as it seems to manifest itself not so much through the permanence of the phenomenon as through action wherever there is action therefore activity and force there must be substance and in this alone the seat of that fertile source of phenomena can be sought this sounds very well but if people are asked to explain what they mean by substance they find it by no means easy to answer without reasoning in a circle how can  0  we conclude immediately from the action to the permanence of the agent which nevertheless is an essential and peculiar characteristic of substance phaenomenon after what we have explained before however the answer to this question is not so difficult though it would be impossible according to the ordinary way of proceeding analytically only with our concepts action itself implies the relation of the subject of the causality to the effect as all effect consists in that which happens that is in the changeable indicating time in succession the last subject of it is the permanent as the substratum of all that changes that is substance for according to the principle of causality actions are always the first ground of all change of phenomena and cannot exist therefore in a subject that itself changes because in that case other actions and another subject would be required to determine that change action therefore is a sufficient empirical criterion to prove substantiality nor is it necessary     that i should first establish its permanency by means of compared perceptions which indeed would hardly be possible in this way at least with that completeness which is required by the magnitude and strict universality of the concept that the first subject of the causality of all arising and perishing cannot itself in the field of phenomena arise and perish is a safe conclusion pointing in  0  the end to empirical necessity and permanency in existence that is the concept of a substance as a phenomenon if anything happens the mere fact of something arising without any reference to what it is is in itself a matter for enquiry the transition from the notbeing of a state into that state even though it contained no quality whatever as a phenomenon must itself be investigated this arising as we have shown in no a does not concern the substance because a substance never arises but its state only it is therefore mere change and not an arising out of nothing when such an arising is looked upon as the effect of a foreign cause it is called creation this can never be admitted as an event among phenomena because its very possibility would destroy the unity of experience if however we consider all things not as phenomena but as things by themselves and objects of the understanding only then though they are substances they may be considered as dependent in their existence on a foreign cause our words would then assume quite a different meaning and no longer be applicable to phenomena as possible objects of experience how anything can be changed at all how it is possible that one state in a given time is followed by another  0  at another time of that we have not the slightest conception a priori we want for that a knowledge of     real powers which can be given empirically only for instance a knowledge of motive powers or what is the same a knowledge of certain successive phenomena as movements which indicate the presence of such forces what can be considered a priori according to the law of causality and the conditions of time are the form of every change the condition under which alone as an arising of another state it can take place its contents that is the state which is changed being what it may and therefore the succession itself of the states that which has happened  when a substance passes from one state a into another b the moment of the latter is different from the moment of the former state and follows it again that second state as a reality in phenomena differs from the first in which that reality did not exist as b from zero that is even if the state b differed from the state a in quantity only that change is an arising of b — a which in the former state was nonexistent and in relation to  0  which that state is  o the question therefore arises how a thing can pass from a state  a to another  b between two moments there is always a certain time and between two states in these two moments there is always a difference which must have a certain quantity because all parts of phenomena are always themselves quantities every transition therefore from one state into another takes place in a certain time between two moments the first of which determines   0 the state from which a thing arises the second that at which it arrives both therefore are the temporal limits of a change or of an intermediate state between two states and belong as such to the whole of the change every change however has a cause which proves its causality during the whole of the time in which the change takes place the cause therefore does not produce the change suddenly in one moment but during a certain time so that as the time grows from the initiatory moment a to its completion in b the quantity of reality also ba is produced through all the smaller degrees between the first and the last all change therefore is possible only through a continuous action of causality which so far as it is uniform is called a momentum  0  a change does not consist of such momenta but is produced by them as their effect this is the law of continuity in all change founded on this that neither time nor a phenomenon in time consists of parts which are the smallest possible and that nevertheless the state of a thing which is being changed passes through all these parts as elements to its new state no difference of the real in phenomena and no difference in the quantity of times is ever the smallest and thus the new state of reality grows from the first state in which that reality did not exist through all the infinite degrees thereof the differences of which from one another are smaller than that between zero and a it does not concern us at present of what utility this principle may be in physical science but how such a principle which seems to enlarge our knowledge of nature so much can be possible a priori that requires a careful investigation although we can see that it is real and true     and might thus imagine that the question how it was possible is unnecessary for there are so many unfounded pretensions to enlarge our knowledge by pure reason that we must accept it as a general principle to be always distrustful and never to believe or accept anything   0 of this kind without documents capable of a thorough deduction however clear the dogmatical proof of it may appear all addition to our empirical knowledge and every advance in perception is nothing but an enlargement of the determinations of our internal sense that is a progression in time whatever the objects may be whether phenomena or pure intuitions this progression in time determines everything and is itself determined by nothing else that is the parts of that progression are only given in time and through the synthesis of time but not time before this synthesis for this reason every transition in our perception to something that follows in time is really a determination of time through the production of that perception and as time is always and in all its parts a quantity the production of a perception as a quantity through all degrees none of them being the smallest from zero up to its determined degree this shows how it is possible to know a priori a law of changes as far as their form is concerned we are only anticipating our own apprehension the formal condition of which as it dwells in us before all given phenomena may well be known a priori in the same manner therefore in which time contains the sensuous condition a priori of the possibility     of a continuous progression of that which exists to that which follows the understanding by means of the unity of apperception is a condition a priori of the possibility     of a continuous determination of the position of all phenomena in that time and this through a series of causes and effects the former producing inevitably the existence of the latter and thus rendering the empirical knowledge of the relations of time valid for all times universally and therefore objectively valid c third analogy principle of community all substances in so far as they are coexistent stand in complete community that is reciprocity one to another  proof things are coexistent in so far as they exist at one and the same time but how can we know that they exist at one and the same time only if the order in the synthesis of apprehension of the manifold is indifferent that is if i may advance from a through b c d to e or contrariwise from e to a for if the synthesis were successive in time in the order beginning with a and ending with e it would be impossible to begin the apprehension with the perception of e and to go backwards to a because a belongs to past time and can no longer be an object of apprehension     if we supposed it possible that in a number of substances as phenomena each were perfectly isolated so that none influenced another or received influences from     another then the coexistence of them could never become an object of possible perception nor could the existence of the one through any process of empirical synthesis lead us on to the existence of another for if we imagined that they were separated by a perfectly empty space a perception proceeding from the one in time to the other might no doubt determine the existence of it by means of a subsequent perception but would never be able to determine whether that phenomenon followed objectively on the other or was coexistent with it there must therefore be something besides their mere existence by which a determines its place in time for b and b for a because thus only can these two substances be represented empirically as coexistent nothing however can determine the place of anything else in time except that which is its cause or the cause of its determinations therefore every substance since it can be effect with regard to its determinations only must contain in itself the causality of certain determinations in another substance and at the same time the effects of the causality of that other substance that is substances must stand in dynamical communion immediately or mediately     with each other if their coexistence is to be known in any possible experience now everything without which the experience of any objects would be impossible may be said to be necessary with reference to such objects of experience from which it follows that it is necessary for all substances so far as they are coexistent as phenomena to stand in a complete communion of reciprocity with each other the word communion gemeinschaft may be used in two senses meaning either communio or commercium     we use it here in the latter sense as a dynamical communion without which even the local communio spatii could never be known empirically we can easily per ceive in our experience that continuous influences only can lead our senses in all parts of space from one object to another that the light which plays between our eyes and celestial bodies produces a mediate communion between us and them and proves the coexistence of the latter that we cannot change any place empirically perceive such a change unless matter itself renders the perception of our own place possible to us and that by means of its reciprocal influence only matter can evince its simultaneous existence and thus though mediately only its coexistence even to the most distant objects without this communion every perception of any phenomenon     in space is separated from the others and the chain of empirical representations that is experience itself would have to begin de novo with every new object without the former experience being in the least connected with it or standing to it in any temporal relation i do not want to say anything here against empty space empty space may exist where perception cannot reach and where therefore no empirical knowledge of coexistence takes place but in that case it is no object for any possible experience the following remarks may elucidate this it is necessary that in our mind all phenomena as being contained in a possible experience must share a communion of apperception and if the objects are to be represented as connected in coexistence they must reciprocally determine their place in time and thus constitute a whole if this subjective communion is to rest on an objective ground or     is to refer to phenomena as substances then the perception of the one as cause must render possible the perception of the other and vice versa so that the succession which always exists in perceptions as apprehensions may not be attributed to the objects but that the objects should be represented as existing simultaneously this is a reciprocal influence that is a real commercium of substances without which the empirical relation of coexistence     would be impossible in our experience through this commercium phenomena as being apart from each other and yet connected constitute a compound compositum reale and such compounds become possible in many ways the three dynamical relations therefore from which all others are derived are inherence consequence and composition                                     these are the three analogies of experience they are nothing but principles for determining the existence of phenomena in time according to its three modes first the relation of time itself as to a quantity quantity of existence that is duration secondly the relation in time as in a series successively and thirdly likewise in time as the whole of all existence simultaneously this unity in the determination of time is dynamical only that is time is not looked upon as that in which experience assigns immediately its place to every existence for this would be impossible because absolute time is no object of perception by which phenomena could be held together but the rule of the understanding through which alone the existence of phenomena can receive synthetical unity in time determines the place of each of them in time therefore a priori and as valid for all time     by nature in the empirical sense of the word     we mean the coherence of phenomena in their existence according to necessary rules that is laws there are therefore certain laws and they exist a priori which themselves make nature possible while the empirical laws exist and are discovered through experience but in accordance with those original laws which first render experience possible our analogies therefore represent the unity of nature in the coherence of all phenomena under certain exponents which express the relation of time as comprehending all existence to the unity of apperception which apperception can only take place in the synthesis according to rules the three analogies therefore simply say that all phenomena exist in one nature and must so exist because without such unity a priori no unity of experience and therefore no determination of objects in experience would be possible with regard to the mode of proof by which we have arrived at these transcendental laws of nature and its peculiar character a remark must be made which will become important as a rule for any other attempt to prove intelligible and at the same time synthetical propositions a priori if we had attempted to prove these analogies dogmatically that is from concepts showing that all which exists is found only in that which is permanent that every event     presupposes something in a previous state on which it follows by rule and lastly that in the manifold which is coexistent states coexist in relation to each other by rule all our labour would have been in vain for we may analyse as much as we like we shall never arrive from one object and its existence at the existence     of another or at its mode of existence by means of the concepts of these things only what else then remained there remained the possibility of experience as that knowledge in which all objects must in the end be capable of being given to us if their representation is to have any objective reality for us in this namely in the synthetical unity of apperception of all phenomena we discovered the conditions a priori of an absolute and necessary determination in time of all phenomenal existence without this even the empirical determinations in time would be impossible and we thus established the rules of the synthetical unity a priori by which we might anticipate experience it was because people were ignorant of this method and imagined that they could prove dogmatically synthetical propositions which the empirical use of the understanding follows as its principles that so many and always unsuccessful attempts have been made to prove the proposition of the sufficient reason the other two analogies have not even been thought of though everybody followed them unconsciously  because the method of the categories     was wanting by which alone every gap in the understanding     both with regard to concepts and principles can be discovered and pointed out iv the postulates of empirical thought in general   what agrees with the formal conditions of experience in intuition and in concepts is possible   what is connected with the material conditions of experience sensation is real   that which in its connection with the real is determined by universal conditions of experience is exists as necessary explanation     the categories of modality have this peculiar character that as determining an object they do not enlarge in the least the concept to which they are attached as predicates but express only a relation to our faculty of knowledge even when the concept of a thing is quite complete i can still ask with reference to that object whether it is possible only or real also and if the latter whether it is necessary no new determinations of the object are thereby conceived but it is only asked in what relation it with all its determinations stands to the understanding and its empirical employment to the empirical faculty of judgment and to reason in its application to experience the principles of modality are therefore nothing but explanations of the concepts of possibility reality and necessity in their empirical employment confining all categories to an empirical employment only and prohibiting their transcendental  use for if these categories are     not to have a purely logical character expressing the forms of thought analytically but are to refer to things their possibility reality or necessity they must have reference to possible experience and its synthetical unity in which alone objects of knowledge can be given the postulate of the possibility of things   0 demands that the concept of these should agree with the formal conditions of experience in general this the objective form of experience in general contains all synthesis which is required for a knowledge of objects a concept is to be considered as empty and as referring to no object if the synthesis which it contains does not belong to experience whether as borrowed from it in which case it is called an empirical concept or as a synthesis on which as a condition a priori all experience in its form depends in which case it is a pure concept but yet belonging to experience because its object can only be found in it for whence could the character of the possibility of an object which can be conceived by a synthetical concept a priori be derived except from the synthesis which constitutes the form of all empirical knowledge of objects it is no doubt a necessary logical condition that such a concept must contain nothing contradictory but this is by no means sufficient to establish the objective reality of a concept that is the possibility of such an object as is conceived by a concept thus in the concept of a figure to be enclosed between two straight lines there is nothing contradictory because the concepts of two straight lines and their meeting contain no negation of a figure     the impossibility depends not on the concept itself but on its construction in space that is the conditions of space and its determinations and it is these that have objective   0 reality or apply to possible things because they contain a priori in themselves the form of experience in general and now we shall try to explain the manifold usefulness and influence of this postulate of possibility if i represent to myself a thing that is permanent while everything which changes belongs merely to its state i can never know from such a concept by itself that a thing of that kind is possible or if i represent to myself something so constituted that when it is given something else must at all times and inevitably follow upon it this may no doubt be conceived without contradiction but we have as yet no means of judging whether such a quality viz causality is to be met with in any possible object lastly i can very well represent to myself different things substances so constituted that the state of the one produces an effect on the state of the other and this reciprocally but whether such a relation can belong to any things cannot be learned from these concepts which contain a purely arbitrary synthesis the objective reality of these concepts is only known when we see that they     express a priori the relations of perceptions in every kind of experience and this objective reality that is their transcendental truth though independent of all experience is nevertheless not independent of all relation to the form of experience in general and to that synthetical unity in which alone objects can be known empirically but if we should think of framing new concepts of substances forces and reciprocal actions out of the material supplied to us by our perceptions without borrowing from experience the instance of their connection we should entangle ourselves in mere cobwebs of our brain the possibility     of which could not be tested by any criteria because in forming them we were not guided by experience nor had borrowed these concepts from it such purely imaginary concepts cannot receive the character of possibility like the categories a priori as conditions on which all experience depends but only a posteriori as concepts that must be given by experience so that their possibility can either not be known at all or a posteriori and empirically only thus for instance a substance supposed to be present as permanent in space and yet not filling it like that something between matter and the thinking subject which some have tried to introduce or a peculiar faculty of our mind by which we can see not only infer the future or lastly another faculty by which we can enter into a community of thought with other men however distant they may be all these are concepts the     possibility of which has nothing to rest on because it is not founded on experience and its known laws without these they are and can only be arbitrary combinations of thought which though they contain nothing contradictory in themselves have no claim to objective reality or to the possibility of such an object as is to be conceived by them with regard to reality it stands to reason that we cannot conceive it in the concrete without the aid of experience for reality concerns sensation only as the material of experience and not the form of relations which might to a certain extent allow us to indulge in mere fancies i here pass by everything the possibility of which can only be learned from its reality in experience and i only mean to consider the possibility of things through concepts a priori of these concepts i persist in maintaining that they can never exist as such concepts by themselves     alone but only as formal and objective conditions of experience in general  it might seem indeed as if the possibility of a triangle could be known from its concept by itself being independent of all experience for we can give to it an object entirely a priori that is we can construct it but as this is only the form of an object it would always remain a product of the imagination only the possibility     of its object would remain doubtful because more is wanted to establish it namely that such a figure should really be conceived under all those conditions on which all objects of experience depend that which alone connects with this concept the representation of the possibility of such a thing is the fact that space is a formal condition a priori of all external experiences and that the same formative synthesis by which we construct a triangle in imagination should be identical with that which we exercise in the apprehension of a phenomenon in order to make an empirical concept of it and thus the possibility of continuous quantities nay of all quantities the concepts of which are always synthetical can never be deduced from the concepts themselves but only from them as formal conditions of the determination of objects in all experience and where indeed should we look for objects corresponding to our concepts except in experience by which alone objects are given us if we are able to know and determine the possibility of things without any previous experience this is only with reference to those formal conditions under which anything may become     an object in experience this takes place entirely a priori but nevertheless in constant reference to experience and within its limits the postulate concerning our knowledge of     the reality of things requires perception therefore sensation and consciousness of it not indeed immediately of the object itself the existence of which is to be known but yet of a connection between it and some real perception according to the analogies of experience which determine in general all real combinations in experience in the mere concept of a thing no sign of its existence can be discovered for though the concept be ever so perfect so that nothing should be wanting in it to enable us to conceive the thing with all its own determinations existence has nothing to do with all this it depends only on the question whether such a thing be given us so that its perception may even precede its concept a concept preceding experience implies its possibility only while perception which supplies the material of a concept is the only characteristic of reality it is possible however even before the perception of a thing and therefore in a certain sense a priori to know its existence provided it hang together with some other perceptions according to the principles of their empirical connection analogies for in that case the existence of a thing hangs together at least with our perceptions in a possible experience and guided by our analogies we     can starting from our real experience arrive at some other thing in the series of possible perceptions thus we know the existence of some magnetic matter pervading all bodies from the perception of the attracted iron filings though our organs are so constituted as to render an immediate     perception of that matter impossible according to the laws of sensibility and the texture of our perceptions we ought in our experience to arrive at an immediate empirical intuition of that magnetic matter if only our senses were more acute for their actual obtuseness does not concern the form of possible experience wherever therefore perception and its train can reach according to empirical laws there our knowledge also of the existence of things can reach but if we do not begin with experience or do not proceed according to the laws of the empirical connection of phenomena we are only making a vain display as if we could guess and discover the existence of anything  with reference to the third postulate we find that it refers to the material necessity in existence and not to the merely formal and logical necessity in the connection of concepts as it is impossible that the existence of the objects of the senses should ever be known entirely a priori though it may be known to a certain extent a priori namely with reference to another already given existence and as even in that case we can only     arrive at such an existence as must somewhere be contained in the whole of the experience of which the given perception forms a part it follows that the necessity of existence can never be known from concepts but always from the connection only with what is actually perceived according to general rules of experience  now there is no existence that can be known as necessary under the condition of other given phenomena except the existence     of effects from given causes according to the laws of causality it is not therefore the existence of things substances but the existence of their state of which alone we can know the necessity and this from other states only which are given in perception and according to the empirical laws of causality hence it follows that the criterium of necessity can only be found in the law of possible experience viz that everything that happens is determined a priori by its cause in phenomena  we therefore know in nature the necessity of those effects only of which the causes are given and the character of necessity in existence never goes beyond the field of possible experience and even there it does not apply to the existence of things as substances because such substances can never be looked upon as empirical effects or as something that happens and arises necessity therefore affects only the relations of phenomena     according to the dynamical law of causality and the possibility dependent upon it of concluding a priori from a given existence of a cause to another existence that of an effect thus the principle that everything which happens is hypothetically necessary subjects all the changes in the world to a law that is to a rule of necessary existence without which there would not even be such a thing as nature hence the proposition that nothing happens by blind chance in mundo non datur casus is an a priori law of nature and so is likewise the other that no necessity in nature is a blind but always a conditional and therefore an intelligible necessity non datur fatum both these are laws by which the mere play of changes is rendered     subject to a nature of things as phenomena or what is the same to that unity of the understanding in which alone they can belong to experience as the synthetical unity of phenomena both are dynamical principles the former is in reality a consequence of the principle of causality the second of the analogies of experience the latter is one of the principles of modality which to the determination of causality adds the concept of necessity which itself is subject to a rule of the understanding the principle of continuity rendered every break in the series of phenomena changes impossible in mundo non datur saltus and likewise any gap between two     phenomena in the whole of our empirical intuitions in space non datur hiatus for so we may express the proposition that nothing can enter into experience to prove a vacuum or even to admit it as a possible part of empirical synthesis for the vacuum which one may conceive as outside the field of possible experience the world can never come before the tribunal of the understanding which has to decide on such questions only as concern the use to be made of given phenomena for empirical knowledge it is in reality a problem of that ideal reason which goes beyond the sphere of a possible experience and wants to form an opinion of that which surrounds and limits experience and will therefore have to be considered in our transcendental dialectic with regard to the four propositions in mundo non datur hiatus non datus saltus non datur casus non datur fatum it would be easy to represent each of them as well as all principles of a transcendental origin according to the order of the categories and thus to assign its proper place to every one of them but after what has been said before the versed     and expert reader will find it easy to do this himself and to discover the proper method for it they all simply agree in this that they admit nothing in our empirical synthesis that would in any way run counter to the understanding and to the continuous cohesion of all phenomena that is to the unity of its concepts for it is the understanding   0 alone through which the unity of experience in which all perceptions must have their place becomes possible whether the field of possibility be larger than the field which contains everything which is real and whether this again be larger than the field of what is necessary are curious questions and admitting of a synthetical solution which questions however are to be brought before the tribunal of reason only they really come to this whether all things as phenomena belong to the sphere of one experience of which every given perception forms a part that could not be connected with any other phenomena or whether my perceptions can ever belong to more than one possible experience in its general connection the understanding in reality does nothing but give to experience a rule a priori according to the subjective and formal conditions of sensibility and apperception which alone render experience possible other forms of intuition different from space and time and other forms of the understanding different from the discursive forms of thought or conceptual knowledge even if they were possible we could in no wise render conceivable or intelligible to ourselves and even if we could they would never belong to experience the only field of knowledge in which objects are given to us whether there be     therefore other perceptions but those that belong to our whole possible experience whether there be in fact a     completely new field of matter can never be determined by the understanding which is only concerned with the synthesis of what is given the poverty of the usual arguments by which we construct a large empire of possibility of which all that is real the objects of experience forms but a small segment is but too apparent when we say that all that is real is possible we arrive according to the logical rules of inversion at the merely particular proposition that some possible is real and thus seem to imply that much is possible that is not real nay it seems as if we might extend the number of things possible beyond that of things real simply on the ground that something must be added to the possible to make it real but this addition to the possible i cannot recognise because what would thus be added to the possible would be really the impossible it is only to my understanding that anything can be added concerning the agreement with the formal conditions of experience and what can be added is the connection with some perception and whatever is connected with such a perception according to empirical laws is real though it may not be perceived immediately but that in constant connection with what is given us in experience     there should be another series of phenomena and therefore more than one allembracing experience cannot possibly be concluded from what is given us and still less if nothing is given us because nothing can be thought without some kind of material what is possible only under conditions which themselves are possible only is not possible in the full sense of the word not therefore in the sense in which we ask whether the possibility of things can extend beyond the limits of experience     i have only touched on these questions in order to leave no gap in what are commonly supposed to be the concepts of the understanding but absolute possibility which has no regard for the formal conditions of experience is really no concept of the understanding and can never be used empirically but belongs to reason alone which goes beyond all possible empirical use of the understanding we have therefore made these few critical remarks only leaving the subject itself unexplained for the present and here when i am on the point of concluding this fourth number and at the same time the system of all principles of the pure understanding i think i ought to explain why i call the principles of modality postulates i do not take this term in the sense which has     been given to it by some modern philosophical writers and which is opposed to the sense in which mathematicians take it viz that to postulate should mean to represent a proposition as certain without proof or justification for if we were to admit with regard to synthetical propositions however evident they may appear that they should meet with unreserved applause without any deduction and on their own authority only all criticism of the understanding would be at an end and as there is no lack of bold assertions which public opinion does not decline to accept this acceptance being however no credential our understanding would be open to every fancy and could not refuse its sanction to claims which demand admission as real axioms in the same confident tone though without any substantial reasons if therefore a condition a priori is to be synthetically joined to the concept of a thing it will be indispensable that if not a proof at least a deduction   0 of the legitimacy of such an assertion should be forthcoming the principles of modality however are not objectively synthetical because the predicates of possibility reality and necessity do not in the least increase the concept of which they are predicated by adding anything to its representation but as nevertheless they are synthetical they are so subjectively only ie they add to the     concept of a real thing without predicating anything new the peculiar faculty of knowledge from which it springs and on which it depends so that if in the understanding the concept is only connected with the formal conditions of experience its object is called possible if it is connected with perception sensation as the material of the senses and through it determined by the understanding its object is called real while if it is determined through the connection of perceptions according to concepts its object is called necessary the principles of modality therefore predicate nothing of a concept except the act of the faculty of knowledge by which it is produced in mathematics a postulate means a practical proposition containing nothing but a synthesis by which we first give an object to ourselves and produce its concept as if for instance we draw a circle with a given line from a given point in the plane such a proposition cannot be proved because the process required for it is the very process by which we first produce the concept of such a figure we may therefore with the same right postulate the principles of modality because they never increase  the concept of a thing but indicate the manner     only in which the concept was joined with our faculty of knowledge          chapter iii on the ground of distinction of all subjects into phenomena and noumena we have now not only traversed the whole domain of the pure understanding and carefully examined each part of it but we have also measured its extent and assigned to everything in it its proper place this domain however is an island and enclosed by nature itself within limits that can never be changed it is the country of truth a very attractive name but surrounded by a wide and stormy ocean the true home of illusion where many a fog bank and ice that soon melts away tempt us to believe in new lands while constantly deceiving the adventurous mariner with vain hopes and involving     him in adventures which he can never leave and yet can never bring to an end before we venture ourselves on this sea in order to explore it on every side and to find out whether anything is to be hoped for there it will be     useful to glance once more at the map of that country which we are about to leave and to ask ourselves first whether we might not be content with what it contains nay whether we must not be content with it supposing that there is no solid ground anywhere else on which we could settle secondly by what title we possess even that domain and may consider ourselves safe against all hostile claims although we have sufficiently answered these questions in the course of the analytic a summary recapitulation of their solutions may help to strengthen our conviction by uniting all arguments in one point we have seen that the understanding possesses everything which it draws from itself without borrowing from experience for no other purpose but for experience the principles of the pure understanding whether constitutive a priori as the mathematical or simply relative as the dynamical contain nothing but as it were the pure schema of possible experience for that experience     derives its unity from that synthetical unity alone which the understanding originally and spontaneously imparts to the synthesis of imagination with reference to apperception and to which all phenomena as data of a possible knowledge must conform a priori but although these rules of the understanding are not only true a priori but the very source of all truth that is of the agreement of our knowledge with objects because containing the conditions of the possibility of experience as the complete sphere of all knowledge in which objects can be given to us nevertheless we do not seem to be content with hearing only what is true but want to know a great deal more if therefore this critical investigation does not teach us any more than what even without     such subtle researches we should have practised ourselves in the purely empirical use of the understanding it would seem as if the advantages derived from it were hardly worth the labour one might reply that nothing would be more prejudicial to the enlargement of our knowledge than that curiosity which before entering upon any researches wishes to know beforehand the advantages likely to accrue from them though quite unable as yet to form the least conception of such advantages even though they were placed before our eyes there is however one advantage in this transcendental investigation which can be rendered intelligible     nay even attractive to the most troublesome and reluctant apprentice namely this that the understanding confined to its empirical use only and unconcerned with regard to the sources of its own knowledge may no doubt fare very well in other respects but can never determine for itself the limits of its own use and know what is inside or outside its own sphere it is for that purpose that such profound investigations are required as we have just instituted if the understanding cannot decide whether certain questions lie within its own horizon or not it can never feel certain with regard to its claims and possessions but must be prepared for many humiliating corrections when constantly transgressing as it certainly will the limits of its own domain and losing itself in follies and fancies that the understanding cannot make any but an empirical and never a transcendental use of all its principles a priori nay of all its concepts is a proposition which if thoroughly understood leads indeed to most important consequences what we call the transcendental use of a     concept in any proposition is its being referred to things in general and to things by themselves while its empirical use refers to phenomena only that is to objects of a possible experience that the latter use alone is admissible will be clear from the following considerations     what is required for every concept is first the logical form of a concept of thought in general and secondly the possibility of an object to which it refers without the latter it has no sense and is entirely empty though it may still contain the logical function by which a concept can be formed out of any data the only way in which an object can be given to a concept is in intuition and though a pure intuition is possible a priori and before the object yet even that pure intuition can receive its object and with it its objective validity by an empirical intuition only of which it is itself nothing but the form all concepts therefore and with them all principles though they may be possible a priori refer nevertheless to empirical intuitions that is to data of a possible experience without this they can claim no objective validity but are a mere play whether of the imagination or of the understanding with their respective representations let us take the concepts of mathematics as an example and first with regard to pure intuitions although such principles as space has three dimensions between two points there can be only one straight line as well as the representation of the object with which that science is occupied may be produced in the mind a priori they would have no meaning if we were not able at all times   0 to show their meaning as applied to phenomena empirical objects it is for this reason that an abstract concept is required to be made sensuous that is that its corresponding     object is required to be shown in intuition because without this the concept as people say is without sense that is without meaning mathematics fulfil this requirement by the construction of the figure which is a phenomenon present to the senses although constructed a priori in the same science the concept of quantity finds its support and sense in number and this in turn in the fingers the beads of the abacus or in strokes and points which can be presented to the eyes the concept itself was produced a priori together with all the synthetical principles or formulas which can be derived from such concepts but their use and their relation to objects can nowhere be found except in experience of which those concepts contain a priori the formal possibility only that this is the case with all categories and with all the principles drawn from them becomes evident from the fact that we could not define any one of them really that is make conceivable the possibility of their object  without at once having recourse to the conditions of sensibility or the form of phenomena to which as their only possible objects these categories must necessarily be restricted it being impossible if we take away     these conditions to assign to them any meaning that is any relation to an object or to make it intelligible to ourselves by an example what kind of thing could be intended by such concepts when representing the table of the categories we dispensed with the definition of every one of them because at that time it seemed unnecessary for our purpose which concerned their synthetical use only and because entailing     responsibilities which we were not bound to incur this was not a mere excuse but a very important prudential rule viz not to rush into definitions and to attempt or pretend completeness or precision in the definition of a concept when one or other of its characteristic marks is sufficient without a complete enumeration of all that constitute the whole concept now however we can perceive that this caution had even a deeper ground namely that we could not have defined them even if we had wished  for if we remove all conditions of     sensibility which distinguish them as the concepts of a possible empirical use and treat them as concepts of things in general therefore as of transcendental use nothing remains but to regard the logical function in judgments as the condition of the possibility of the things themselves without the slightest indication as to where they could have their application and their object or how they could have any meaning or objective validity in the pure understanding apart from sensibility  no one can explain the concept of quantity in general except it may be by saying that it is the determination of an object by which we may know how many times the one is supposed to exist in it but this how many times is based on successive repetition that is on time and on the synthesis in it of the homogeneous     reality again can only be explained in opposition to a negation if we think of time as containing all being being either filled or empty were i to leave out permanence which means existence at all times nothing would remain of my concept of substance but the logical representation of a subject which i think i can realise by imagining something which is a subject only without     being a predicate of anything but in this case we should not only be ignorant of all conditions under which this logical distinction could belong to anything but we should be unable to make any use of it or draw any conclusions from it because no object is thus determined for the use of this concept and no one can tell whether such a concept has any meaning at all of the concept of cause also if i leave out time in which something follows on something else by rule i should find no more in the pure category than that it is something which enables us to conclude the existence of something else so that it would not only be impossible to distinguish cause and effect from each other but the concept of cause would possess no indication as to how it can be applied to any object because in order to form any such conclusion certain conditions require to be known of which the concept itself tells us nothing the socalled principle that everything contingent has a cause comes no doubt before us with great solemnity and selfassumed dignity but if i ask what you understand by contingent and you answer something of which the nonexistence is possible i should be     glad to know how you can recognise this possibility of nonexistence if you do not represent to yourselves in the series of phenomena some kind of succession and in it an existence that follows upon nonexistence or vice versa and consequently a change to say that the nonexistence of a thing is not selfcontradictory     is but a lame appeal to a logical condition which though it is necessary for the concept yet is by no means sufficient for its real possibility i can perfectly well remove in thought every existing substance without contradicting myself but i can by no means conclude from this as to its objective contingency in its existence that is the possibility of its nonexistence in itself as regards the concept of community it is easy to see that as the pure categories of substance and causality admit of no explanation that would determine their object neither could such an explanation apply to the reciprocal causality in the relation of substances to each other commercium as to possibility existence and necessity no one has yet been able to explain them except by a manifest tautology so long as their definition is to be exclusively drawn from the pure understanding to substitute the transcendental possibility of things when an object corresponds to a concept for the logical possibility of the concept when the concept does not contradict itself is a quibble such as could deceive and satisfy the inexperienced only it seems to be something strange and even illogical   00 that there should be a concept which must have a meaning and yet is incapable of any explanation but the case of these categories is peculiar because it is only by means of the general sensuous condition that they can acquire a definite meaning and a reference to any objects that condition being     left out in the pure category it follows that it can contain nothing but the logical function by which the manifold is brought into a concept by means of this function that is the pure form of the concept nothing can be known nor distinguished as to the object belonging to it because the sensuous condition under which alone objects can belong to it has been removed thus we see that the categories require besides the pure concept of the understanding certain determinations of their application to sensibility in general schemata without them they would not be concepts by which an object can be known and distinguished from other objects but only so many ways of thinking an object for possible intuitions and giving to it according to one of the functions of the understanding its meaning certain requisite conditions being given they are needed to define an object and cannot therefore be defined themselves the logical functions of judgments in general namely unity and plurality assertion and negation subject and predicate cannot be defined without arguing in a circle because the definition would itself be a judgment and contain these very functions the pure categories are nothing but representations of things in general so far as the manifold in intuition must be thought by one or the other of these functions thus magnitude is the determination which can  0  only be thought by a judgment possessing     quantity judicium commune reality the determination which can only be thought by an affirmative judgment while substance is that which in regard to intuition must be the last subject of all other determinations with all this it remains perfectly undetermined what kind of things they may be with regard to which we have to use one rather than another of these functions so that without the condition of sensuous intuition for which they supply the synthesis the categories have no relation to any definite object cannot define any object and consequently have not in themselves the validity of objective concepts from this it follows incontestably that the pure concepts of the understanding never admit of a transcendental but only of an empirical use and that the principles of the pure understanding can only be referred as general conditions of a possible experience to objects of the senses never to things by themselves without regard to the manner in which we have to look at them transcendental analytic has therefore yielded us this important result that the understanding a priori can never do more than anticipate the form of a possible experience and as nothing can be an object of experience except the phenomenon it follows that the understanding can never go beyond the limits of sensibility within which alone objects are given to us its principles are principles     for the exhibition of phenomena only and the proud name of ontology which presumes to supply in a systematic form different kinds of synthetical knowledge a priori of things by themselves for instance the principle  0  of causality must be replaced by the more modest name of a mere analytic of the pure understanding thought is the act of referring a given intuition to an object if the mode of such intuition is not given the object is called transcendental and the concept of the understanding admits then of a transcendental use only in producing a unity in the thought of the manifold in general a pure category therefore in which every condition of sensuous intuition the only one that is possible for us is left out cannot determine an object but only the thought of an object in general according to different modes now if we want to use a concept we require in addition some function of the faculty of judgment by which an object is subsumed under a concept consequently the at least formal condition under which something can be given in intuition if this condition of the faculty of judgment schema is wanting all subsumption is impossible because nothing is given that could be subsumed under the concept the purely transcendental use of categories therefore is in reality of no use at all and has no definite or even with regard to its form only definable object hence it follows that a pure category is not fit for any     synthetical a priori principle and that the principles of the pure understanding admit of empirical only never of transcendental application nay that no synthetical principles a priori are possible beyond the field of possible experience it might therefore be advisable to express ourselves in the following way the pure categories without the formal conditions of sensibility have a transcendental character only but do not admit of any transcendental use because such use in itself is impossible as the categories are  0  deprived of all the conditions of being used in judgments that is of the formal conditions of the subsumption of any possible object under these concepts as therefore as pure categories they are not meant to be used empirically and cannot be used transcendentally they admit if separated from sensibility of no use at all that is they cannot be applied to any possible object and are nothing but the pure form of the use of the understanding with reference to objects in general and of thought without ever enabling us to think or determine any object by their means alone appearances  so far as they are thought as objects under the unity of the categories are called phenomena but if i admit things which are objects of the     understanding only and nevertheless can be given as objects of an intuition though not of sensuous intuition as coram intuitu intellectuali such things would be called noumena intelligibilia one might feel inclined to think that the concept of phenomena as limited by the transcendental æsthetic suggested by itself the objective reality of the noumena and justified a division of objects into phenomena and noumena and consequently of the world into a sensible and intelligible world mundus sensibilis et intelligibilis and this in such a way that the distinction between the two should not refer to the logical form only of a more or less clear knowledge of one and the same object but to a difference in their original presentation to our knowledge which makes them to differ in themselves from each other in kind for if the senses only represent to us something  0  as it appears that something must by itself also be a thing and an object of a nonsensuous intuition ie of the understanding that is there must be a kind of knowledge in which there is no sensibility and which alone possesses absolute objective reality representing objects as they are while through the empirical use of our understanding we know things only as they appear hence it would seem to follow that beside the empirical   0 use of the categories limited by sensuous conditions there was another one pure and yet objectively valid and that we could not say as we have hitherto done that our knowledge of the pure understanding contained nothing but principles for the exhibition of phenomena which even a priori could not apply to anything but the formal possibility of experience here in fact quite a new field would seem to be open a world as it were realised in thought nay according to some even in intuition which would be a more and not a less worthy object for the pure understanding all our representations are no doubt referred by the understanding to some sort of object and as phenomena are nothing but representations the understanding refers them to a something as the object of our sensuous intuition this something being however the transcendental object only this means a something equal to x of which we do not nay with the present constitution of our understanding cannot know anything but which  can only serve as a correlatum of the unity of apperception for the unity of the manifold in sensuous intuition by means of which the understanding unites the manifold into the  0  concept of an object this transcendental object cannot be separated from the sensuous data because in that case nothing would remain by which it could be     thought it is not therefore an object of knowledge in itself but only the representation of phenomena under the concept of an object in general which can be defined by the manifold of sensuous intuition for this very reason the categories do not represent a peculiar object given to the understanding only but serve only to define the transcendental object the concept of something in general by that which is given us through the senses in order thus to know empirically phenomena under the concepts of objects what then is the cause why people not satisfied with the substratum of sensibility have added to the phenomena the noumena which the understanding only is supposed to be able to realise it is this that sensibility and its sphere that is the sphere of phenomena is so limited by the understanding itself that it should not refer to things by themselves but only to the mode in which things appear to us in accordance with our own subjective qualification this was the result of the whole transcendental æsthetic and it really follows quite naturally from the concept of a phenomenon in general that something must correspond to it which in itself is not a phenomenon because a phenomenon cannot be anything by itself apart from our mode of representation     unless therefore we are to move in a constant circle we must admit that the very word phenomenon indicates a relation to something the immediate representation of which is no doubt sensuous but which nevertheless even without this qualification of our sensibility on which the  0  form of our intuition is founded must be something by itself that is an object independent of our sensibility hence arises the concept of a noumenon which however is not positive nor a definite knowledge of anything but which implies only the thinking of something without taking any account of the form of sensuous intuition but in order that a noumenon may signify a real object that can be distinguished from all phenomena it is not enough that i should free my thought of all conditions of sensuous intuition but i must besides have some reason for admitting another kind of intuition besides the sensuous in which such an object can be given otherwise my thought would be empty however free it may be from contradictions it is true that we were not able to prove that the sensuous is the only possible intuition though it is so for us but neither could we prove that another kind of intuition was possible and although our thought may take no account of any sensibility the question always remains whether after that it is not a mere     form of a concept and whether any real object would thus be left the object to which i refer the phenomenon in general is the transcendental object that is the entirely indefinite thought of something in general this cannot be called the noumenon for i know nothing of what it is by itself and have no conception of it except as the object of sensuous intuition in general which is therefore the same for all phenomena i cannot lay hold of it by any of the categories for these are valid for empirical intuitions only in order to bring them under the concept of an object in general a pure use of the categories is no doubt possible that is not selfcontradictory but it has no kind of  0  objective validity because it refers to no intuition to which it is meant to impart the unity of an object the categories remain for ever mere functions of thought by which no object can be given to me but by which i can only think whatever may be given to me in intuition if all thought by means of categories is taken away from empirical knowledge no knowledge of any object remains because nothing can be thought by mere intuition and the mere fact that there is within me an affection of my sensibility establishes in no way any relation of such a representation to any object if on the contrary all intuition is taken away there always remains     the form of thought that is the mode of determining an object for the manifold of a possible intuition in this sense the categories may be said to extend further than sensuous intuition because they can think objects in general without any regard to the special mode of sensibility in which they may be given but they do not thus prove a larger sphere of objects because we cannot admit that such objects can be given without admitting the possibility of some other but sensuous intuition for which we have no right whatever i call a concept problematic if it is not selfcontradictory and if as limiting other concepts it is connected with other kinds of knowledge while its objective reality cannot be known in any way now the concept of a noumenon that is of a thing which can never be thought as an object of the senses but only as a thing by itself by the pure understanding is not selfcontradictory because we cannot maintain that sensibility is the only form of intuition that concept is also necessary to prevent sensuous intuition from extending to things by  0  themselves that is in order to limit the objective validity of sensuous knowledge for all the rest to which sensuous intuition does not extend is called noumenon for     the very purpose of showing that sensuous knowledge cannot extend its domain over everything that can be thought by the understanding but after all we cannot understand the possibility of such noumena and whatever lies beyond the sphere of phenomena is to us empty that is we have an understanding which problematically extends beyond that sphere but no intuition nay not even the conception of a possible intuition by which outside the field of sensibility objects could be given to us and our understanding could extend beyond that sensibility in its assertory use the concept of a noumenon is therefore merely limitative and intended to keep the claims of sensibility within proper bounds therefore of negative use only but it is not a mere arbitrary fiction but closely connected with the limitation of sensibility though incapable of adding anything positive to the sphere of the senses a real division of objects into phenomena and noumena and of the world into a sensible and intelligible world in a positive sense  is therefore quite inadmissible although concepts may very well be divided into sensuous and intellectual for no objects can be assigned to these intellectual concepts nor can they be represented as objectively valid if we drop the senses how are we to make it     conceivable that our categories which would be the only remaining concepts for noumena have any meaning at all considering that in order to refer them to any object something more must be given than the mere unity of  0  thought namely a possible intuition to which the categories could be applied with all this the concept of a noumenon if taken as problematical only remains not only admissible but as a concept to limit the sphere of sensibility indispensable in this case however it is not a particular intelligible object for our understanding but an understanding to which it could belong is itself a problem if we ask how it could know an object not discursively by means of categories but intuitively and yet in a nonsensuous intuition — a process of which we could not understand even the bare possibility our understanding thus acquires a kind of negative extension that is it does not become itself limited by sensibility but on the contrary limits it by calling things by themselves not considered as phenomena noumena in doing this it immediately proceeds to prescribe limits to itself by admitting that it cannot know these noumena by means of the categories but can only think of them under the name of something unknown in the writings of modern philosophers however i meet with a totally different use of the terms of mundus sensibilis and intelligibilis  totally different from the meaning assigned to these terms by the ancients     here all difficulty seems to disappear but the fact is that there remains nothing but mere wordmongery in accordance with this some people have been pleased to call the whole of phenomena so far as they are seen the world of sense but so far as their connection according to general laws of the understanding is taken into account the world of the understanding theoretical astronomy   0 which only teaches the actual observation of the starry heavens would represent the former contemplative astronomy on the contrary taught according to the copernican system or it may be according to newtons laws of gravitation the latter namely a purely intelligible world but this twisting of words is a mere sophistical excuse in order to avoid a troublesome question by changing its meaning according to ones own convenience understanding and reason may be applied to phenomena but it is very questionable whether they can be applied at all to an object which is not a phenomenon but a noumenon and it is this when the object is represented as purely intelligible that is as given to the understanding only and not to the senses the question therefore is whether besides the empirical use of the understanding even in the newtonian view of the world a transcendental use is possible referring to the noumenon as its object and that question we have answered decidedly in the negative when we therefore say that the senses represent     objects to us as they appear and the understanding as they are the latter is not to be taken in a transcendental but in a purely empirical meaning namely as to how they as objects of experience must be represented according to the regular connection of phenomena and not according to what they may be as objects of the pure understanding apart from their relation to possible experience and therefore to our senses this will always remain unknown to us nay we shall never know whether such a transcendental and exceptional knowledge is possible at all at least as comprehended under our ordinary categories with us understanding and sensibility cannot     determine objects unless they are joined together if we separate them we have intuitions without concepts or concepts without intuitions in both cases representations which we cannot refer to any definite object if after all these arguments anybody should still hesitate to abandon the purely transcendental use of the categories let him try an experiment with them for framing any synthetical proposition an analytical proposition does not in the least advance the understanding which as in such a proposition it is only concerned with what is already thought in the concept does not ask whether the concept in itself has any reference to objects or expresses only the unity of thought in general     this completely ignoring the manner in which an object may be given the understanding in fact is satisfied if it knows what it contained in the concept of an object it is indifferent as to the object to which the concept may refer but let him try the experiment with any synthetical and socalled transcendental proposition as for instance everything that exists exists as a substance or as a determination inherent in it or everything contingent exists as an effect of some other thing namely its cause etc now i ask whence can the understanding take these synthetical propositions as the concepts are to apply not to some possible experience but to things by themselves noumena where is that third term to be found which is always required for a synthetical proposition in order thus to join concepts which have no logical analytical relation with each other it will be impossible to prove such a proposition nay even to justify the possibility of any such pure assertion without appealing to the empirical use of the understanding     and thus renouncing entirely the socalled pure and nonsensuous judgment there are no principles therefore according to which the concepts of pure and merely intelligible objects could ever be applied because we cannot imagine any way in which they could be given and the problematic thought which leaves a place open to them serves only like empty space to limit the sphere of empirical principles without containing or indicating   0 any other object of knowledge lying beyond that sphere appendix of the amphiboly of reflective concepts owing to the confusion of the empirical with the transcendental use of the understanding reflection reflexio is not concerned with objects themselves in order to obtain directly concepts of them but is a state of the mind in which we set ourselves to discover the subjective conditions under which we may arrive at concepts it is the consciousness of the relation of given representations to the various sources of our knowledge by which alone their mutual relation can be rightly determined before saying any more of our representations the first question is to which faculty of knowledge they may all belong whether it is the understanding or the senses by which they are connected and compared many a judgment is accepted from mere habit or made from inclination and as no reflection precedes or even follows it critically the judgment is supposed     to have had its origin in the understanding it is not all judgments that require an investigation that is a     careful attention with regard to the grounds of their truth for if they are immediately certain as for instance that between two points there can be only one straight line no more immediately certain marks of their truth than that which they themselves convey could be discovered but all judgments nay all comparisons require reflection that is a discrimination of the respective faculty of knowledge to which any given concepts belong the act by which i place in general the comparison of representations by the side of the faculty of knowledge to which that comparison belongs and by which i determine whether these representations are compared with each other as belonging to the pure understanding or to sensuous intuition i call transcendental reflection the relation in which the two concepts may stand to each other in one state of the mind is that of identity and difference of agreement and opposition of the internal and external and finally of the determinable and the determination matter and form the right determination of that relation depends on the question in which faculty of knowledge they subjectively belong to each other whether in sensibility or in the understanding for the proper distinction of the latter is of great importance with regard to the manner in which the former must be considered     before proceeding to form any objective judgments we have to compare the concepts with regard to the identity of many representations under one concept as the foundation of general judgments or with regard to their difference as the foundation of particular judgments or with regard to their agreement and opposition serving as the foundations of affirmative and negative judgments etc     for this reason it might seem that we ought to call these concepts concepts of comparison conceptus comparationis but as when the contents of concepts and not their logical form must be considered that is whether the things themselves are identical or different in agreement or in opposition etc all things may have a twofold relation to our faculty of knowledge namely either to sensibility or to the understanding and as the manner in which they belong to one another depends on the place to which they belong it follows that the transcendental reflection that is the power of determining the relation of given representations to one or the other class of knowledge can alone determine their mutual relation whether the things are identical or different in agreement or opposition etc cannot be established at once by the concepts themselves by means of a mere comparison comparatio but first of all by a proper discrimination of that class of knowledge to which they belong that is by transcendental reflection it might therefore be said that logical reflection is a mere comparison because it takes no account of the faculty of knowledge to which any given representations belong and treats     them so far as they are all found in the mind as homogeneous while transcendental reflection which refers to the objects themselves supplies the possibility of an objective comparison of representations among themselves and is therefore very different from the other the faculty of knowledge to which they belong not being the same this transcendental reflection is a duty from which no one can escape who wishes to form judgments a priori we shall now take it in hand and may hope thus to throw not a little light on the real business of the understanding     i identity and difference when an object is presented to us several times but each time with the same internal determinations qualitas et quantitas it is so long as it is considered as an object of the pure understanding always one and the same one thing not many numerica identitas but if it is a phenomenon a comparison of the concepts is of no consequence and though everything may be identical with regard to the concepts yet the difference of the places of this phenomenon at the same time is a sufficient ground for admitting the numerical difference of the object of the senses thus though there may be no internal difference whatever either in quality or quantity between two drops of water yet the fact that they may be seen     at the same time in different places is sufficient to establish their numerical difference leibniz took phenomena to be things by themselves intelligibilia that is objects of the pure understanding though on account of the confused nature of their representations he assigned to them the name of phenomena and from that point of view his principle of their indiscernibility principium identitas indiscernibilium could not be contested as however they are objects of sensibility and the use of the understanding with regard to them is not pure but only empirical their plurality and numerical diversity are indicated by space itself as the condition of external phenomena for one part of space though it may be perfectly similar and equal to another is still outside it and for this very reason a part of space different from the first which added to it makes a larger space and this applies to all things which exist at the same time in     different parts of space however similar or equal they may be in other respects ii agreement and opposition when reality is represented by the pure understanding only realitas noumenon no opposition can be conceived between realities that is no such relation that if connected in one subject they should annihilate the effects one of the other as for instance       0 the real in     the phenomena on the contrary realitas phenomenon may very well be in mutual opposition and if connected in one subject one may annihilate completely or in part the effect of the other as in the case of two forces moving in the same straight line either drawing or impelling a point in opposite directions or in the case of pleasure counterbalancing a certain amount of pain iii the internal and the external in an object of the pure understanding that only is internal which has no relation whatever as regards its existence to anything different from itself the inner relations on the contrary of a substantia phenomenon in space are nothing but relations and the substance itself a complex of mere relations we only know substances in space through the forces which are active in a certain space by either drawing others near to it attraction or by preventing others from penetrating into it repulsion and impenetrability other properties constituting the concept of a substance appearing in space and which we call matter are unknown to us as an object of the pure understanding on the contrary every substance must have     internal determinations and forces bearing on the internal reality but what other internal accidents can i think except those which my own internal sense presents     to me namely something which is either itself thought or something analogous to it hence leibniz represented all substances as he conceived them as noumena even the component parts of matter after having in thought removed from them everything implying external relation and therefore composition also as simple subjects endowed with powers of representation in one word as monads iv matter and form these are two concepts which are treated as the foundation of all other reflection so inseparably are they connected with every act of the understanding the former denotes the determinable in general the latter its determination both in a purely transcendental meaning all differences in that which is given and the mode in which it is determined being left out of consideration logicians formerly called the universal matter the specific difference form in every judgment the given concepts may be called the logical matter for a judgment their relation by means of the copula the form of a judgment in every being its component parts essentialia are the matter the mode in which they are connected in it the essential form with respect to things in general unlimited reality was regarded as the matter of all possibility and the limitation thereof negation as that form by which one     thing is distinguished from another according to transcendental concepts the understanding demands first that something should be given at least in concept in order to     be able afterwards to determine it in a certain manner in the concept of the pure understanding therefore matter comes before form and leibniz in consequence first assumed things monads and within them an internal power of representation in order afterwards to found thereon their external relation and the community of their states that is of their representations in this way space and time were possible only the former through the relation of substances the latter through the connection of their determinations among themselves as causes and effects and so it would be indeed if the pure understanding could be applied immediately to objects and if space and time were determinations of things by themselves but if they are sensuous intuitions only in which we determine all objects merely as phenomena then it follows that the form of intuition as a subjective quality of sensibility comes before all matter sensations that space and time therefore come before all phenomena and before all data of experience and render in fact all experience possible as an intellectual philosopher leibniz could not endure that this form should come before things and determine their possibility a criticism quite just when he assumed that we see things as they are though in a confused representation but as sensuous intuition is a peculiar     subjective condition on which all perception a priori depends and the form of which is original and independent the form must be given by itself and so far from matter or the things themselves which appear forming the true foundation as we might think if we judged according to mere concepts the very possibility of matter presupposes a formal intuition space and time as given     note on the amphiboly of reflective concepts i beg to be allowed to call the place which we assign to a concept either in sensibility or in the pure understanding its transcendental place if so then the determination of this position which belongs to every concept according to the difference of its use and the directions for determining according to rules that place for all concepts would be called transcendental topic a doctrine which would thoroughly protect us against the subreptitious claims of the pure understanding and the errors arising from it by always distinguishing to what faculty of knowledge each concept truly belongs every concept or every title to which many kinds of knowledge belong may be called a logical place upon this is based the logical topic of aristotle of which orators and schoolmasters avail themselves in order to find under certain titles of thought     what would best suit the matter they have in hand and thus to be able with a certain appearance of thoroughness to argue and wrangle to any extent transcendental topic on the contrary contains no more than the abovementioned four titles of all comparison and distinction which differ from the categories because they do not serve to represent the object according to what constitutes its concept quantity reality etc but only the comparison of representations in all its variety which precedes the concept of things this comparison however requires first a reflection that is a determination of the place to which the representations of things which are to be compared belong namely whether they are thought by the pure understanding or given as phenomena by sensibility   0 concepts may be logically compared without our asking any questions as to what place their objects belong whether as noumena to the understanding or to sensibility as phenomena but if with these concepts we wish to proceed to the objects themselves a transcendental reflection is necessary first of all in order to determine whether they are meant to be objects for the pure understanding or for sensibility without this reflection our use of these concepts would be very uncertain and   0 synthetical propositions would spring up which critical reason cannot acknowledge and which are simply founded on transcendental amphiboly that is on our confounding an object of the pure understanding with a phenomenon for want of such a transcendental topic and deceived by the amphiboly of reflective concepts the celebrated leibniz erected an intellectual system of the world or believed at least that he knew the internal nature of things by comparing all objects with the understanding only and with the abstract formal concepts of his thought our table of reflective concepts gives us the unexpected advantage of being able to exhibit clearly the distinctive features of his system in all its parts and at the same time the leading principle of this peculiar view which rested on a simple misunderstanding he compared all things with each other by means of concepts only and naturally found no other differences but those by which the understanding distinguishes its pure concepts from each other the conditions of sensuous intuition which carry their own differences are not considered by him as original and independent for sensibility was with him a confused mode of representation only and not a separate source of representations according to him a phenomenon was     the representation of a thing by itself though different in its logical form from knowledge by means of the     understanding because the phenomenon in the ordinary absence of analysis brings a certain admixture of collateral representations into the concept of a thing which the understanding is able to separate in one word leibniz intellectualised phenomena just as locke according to his system of noogony if i may use such an expression sensualised all concepts of the understanding that is represented them as nothing but empirical though abstract reflective concepts instead of regarding the understanding and sensibility as two totally distinct sources of representations which however can supply objectively valid judgments of things only in conjunction with each other each of these great men recognised but one of them which in their opinion applied immediately to things by themselves while the other did nothing but to produce either disorder or order in the representations of the former leibniz accordingly compared the objects of the senses with each other as things in general and in the understanding only he did this first so far as they are judged by the understanding to be either identical or different as he considers their concepts only and not their place in intuition in which alone objects can be given and takes no account of the transcendental place of these concepts whether the object is to be counted among phenomena or among things by themselves it could not happen otherwise than     that he should extend his principle of indiscernibility which is valid with regard to concepts of things in general only to objects of the senses also mundus phaenomenon     and imagine that he thus added no inconsiderable extension to our knowledge of nature no doubt if i know a drop of water as a thing by itself in all its internal determinations i cannot allow that one is different from the other when their whole concepts are identical but if the drop of water is a phenomenon in space it has its place not only in the understanding among concepts but in the sensuous external intuition in space and in this case the physical place is quite indifferent with regard to the inner determinations of things so that a place b can receive a thing which is perfectly similar or identical with another in place a quite as well as if it were totally different from it in its internal determinations difference of place by itself and without any further conditions renders the plurality and distinction of objects as phenomena not only possible but also necessary that socalled law of leibniz therefore is no law of nature but only an analytical rule or a comparison of things by means of concepts only secondly the principle that realities as mere assertions never logically contradict each other is perfectly true with regard to the relation of concepts but     has no meaning whatever either as regards nature or as regards anything by itself of which we can have no concept whatever  the real opposition as when a  b  0 takes place everywhere wherever one reality is united with another in the same subject and one annihilates the effect of the other this is constantly brought before our eyes in nature by all impediments and reactions which as depending on forces must be called realitates phaenomena     general mechanics can even give us the empirical condition of that opposition in an a priori rule by attending to the opposition of directions a condition of which the transcendental concept of reality knows nothing although leibniz himself did not announce this proposition with all the pomp of a new principle he yet made use of it for new assertions and his followers expressly inserted it in their system of the leibnizwolfian philosophy according to this principle all evils for example are nothing but the consequences of the limitations of created beings that is they are negations because these can be the only opposites of reality which is perfectly true in the mere concept of the thing in general but not in things as phenomena in like manner the followers of leibniz consider it not only possible but even natural to unite all reality without fearing any opposition in one being because the only opposition they know is that     of contradiction by which the concept of a thing itself is annihilated while they ignore that of reciprocal action and reaction when one real cause destroys the effect of another a process which we can only represent to ourselves when the conditions are given in sensibility thirdly the leibnizian monadology has really no other foundation than that leibniz represented the difference of the internal and the external in relation to the understanding only substances must have something internal which is free from all external relations and therefore from composition also the simple therefore or uncompounded is the foundation of the internal of things by themselves this internal in the state of substances cannot consist in space form contact or motion all these determinations being external relations and we cannot therefore ascribe     to substances any other internal state but that which belongs to our own internal sense namely the state of representations this is the history of the monads which were to form the elements of the whole universe and the energy of which consists in representations only so that properly they can be active within themselves only for this reason his principle of a possible community of substances could only be a preestablished harmony and not a physical influence for as everything     is actively occupied internally only that is with its own representations the state of representations in one substance could not be in active connection with that of another but it became necessary to admit a third cause exercising its influence on all substances and making their states to correspond with each other not indeed by occasional assistance rendered in each particular case systema assistentiae but through the unity of the idea of a cause valid for all and in which all together must receive their existence and permanence and therefore also their reciprocal correspondence according to universal laws fourthly leibnizs celebrated doctrine of space and time in which he intellectualised these forms of sensibility arose entirely from the same delusion of transcendental reflection if by means of the pure understanding alone i want to represent the external relations of things i can do this only by means of the concept of their reciprocal action and if i want to connect one state with another state of the same thing this is possible only in the order of cause and effect thus it happened that leibniz conceived space as a certain order in the community of substances and time as the dynamical sequence of their states that which space and time seem to possess     as proper to themselves and independent     of things he ascribed to the confusion of these concepts which made us mistake what is a mere form of dynamical relations for a peculiar and independent intuition antecedent to things themselves thus space and time became with him the intelligible form of the connection of things substances and their states by themselves and things were intelligible substances substantiae noumena nevertheless he tried to make these concepts valid for phenomena because he would not concede to sensibility any independent kind of intuition but ascribed all even the empirical representation of objects to the understanding leaving to the senses nothing but the contemptible work of confusing and mutilating the representations of the understanding but even if we could predicate anything synthetically by means of the pure understanding of things by themselves which however is simply impossible this could never be referred to phenomena because these do not represent things by themselves we should therefore in such a case have to compare our concepts in a transcendental reflection under the conditions of sensibility only and thus space and time would never be determinations of things by themselves but of phenomena what things may be by themselves we know not nor need     we care to know because after all a thing can never come before me otherwise than as a phenomenon the remaining reflective conceptions have to be treated in the same manner matter is substantia phenomenon what may belong to it internally i seek for in all parts of space occupied by it and in all effects produced by it all of which however can be phenomena of the external     senses only i have therefore nothing that is absolutely but only what is relatively internal and this consists itself of external relations nay what according to the pure understanding should be the absolutely internal of matter is a mere phantom for matter is never an object of the pure understanding while the transcendental object which may be the ground of the phenomenon which we call matter is a mere something of which we could not even understand what it is though somebody should tell us we cannot understand anything except what carries with it in intuition something corresponding to our words if the complaint that we do not understand the internal of things means that we do not comprehend by means of the pure understanding what the things which appear to us may be of themselves it seems totally unjust and unreasonable for it means that without senses we should be able to know and therefore to see things that is that we should possess a faculty of knowledge totally different from the human not only in degree but in kind     and in intuition in fact that we should not be men but beings of whom we ourselves could not say whether they are even possible much less what they would be like observation and analysis of phenomena enter into the internal of nature and no one can say how far this may go in time those transcendental questions however which go beyond nature would nevertheless remain unanswerable even if the whole of nature were revealed to us for it is not given to us to observe even our own mind with any intuition but that of our internal sense in it lies the mystery of the origin of our sensibility its relation to an object and the transcendental ground of that unity are no doubt far too deeply hidden for us who can know     even ourselves by means of the internal sense only that is as phenomena and we shall never be able to use the same imperfect instrument of investigation in order to find anything but again and again phenomena the nonsensuous and nonphenomenal cause of which we are seeking in vain what renders this criticism of the conclusions by means of the acts of mere reflection extremely useful is that it shows clearly the nullity of all conclusions with regard to objects compared with each other in the understanding only and that it confirms at the same time what     we have so strongly insisted on namely that phenomena though they cannot be comprehended as things by themselves among the objects of the pure understanding are nevertheless the only objects in which our knowledge can possess objective reality ie where intuition corresponds to concepts when we reflect logically only we only compare in our understanding concepts among themselves trying to find out whether both have exactly the same contents whether they contradict themselves or not whether something belongs to a concept or is added to it and which of the two may be given while the other may be a mode only of thinking the given concept but if i refer these concepts to an object in general in a transcendental sense without determining whether it be an object of sensuous or intellectual intuition certain limitations appear at once warning us not to go beyond the concept and upsetting all empirical use of it thus proving that a representation of an object as of a thing in general is not only insufficient but if without sensuous determination and independent of empirical conditions selfcontradictory it is necessary therefore either to take no account at all of the     object as we do in logic or if not then to think it under the conditions of sensuous intuition because the intelligible would require a quite peculiar intuition which we do not possess and without it would be nothing to us while on the other side phenomena also could never   0 be things by themselves for if i represent to myself things in general only the difference of external relations cannot it is true constitute a difference of the things themselves but rather presupposes it and if the concept of one thing does not differ at all internally from that of another i only have one and the same thing placed in different relations furthermore by adding a mere affirmation reality to another the positive in it is indeed augmented and nothing is taken away or removed so that we see that the real in things can never be in contradiction with itself etc                                     a certain misunderstanding of these reflective concepts has as we showed exercised so great an influence on the use of the understanding as to mislead even one of the most acute philosophers to the adoption of a socalled system of intellectual knowledge which undertakes to determine objects without the intervention of the senses for this reason the exposition of the cause of the misunderstanding which lies in the amphiboly of these concepts as the origin of false principles is of great utility in determining and securing the true limits of the understanding it is no doubt true that what can be affirmed or denied of a concept in general can also be affirmed or denied of any part of it dictum de omni et nullo but it     would be wrong so to change this logical proposition as to make it say that whatever is not contained in a general     concept is not contained either in the particular concepts comprehended under it for these are particular concepts for the very reason that they contain more than is conceived in the general concept nevertheless the whole intellectual system of leibniz is built up on this fallacy and with it falls necessarily to the ground together with all equivocation in the use of the understanding that had its origin in it leibnizs principle of discernibility is really based on the supposition that if a certain distinction is not to be found in the general concept of a thing it could not be met with either in the things themselves and that therefore all things were perfectly the same numero eadem which are not distinguished from each other in their concept also as to quality or quantity and because in the mere concept of a thing no account has been taken of many a necessary condition of its intuition it has rashly been concluded that that which in forming an abstraction has been intentionally left out of account did really not exist anywhere and nothing has been allowed to a thing except what is contained in its concept     the concept of a cubic foot of space wherever and how many times soever i may think it is in itself perfectly the same but two cubic feet are nevertheless distinguished in space by their places alone numero diversa and these places are conditions of the intuition in which the object of our concept is given and which though they do not belong to the concept belong nevertheless to the whole of sensibility in a similar manner there is no contradiction in the concept of a thing unless something negative has been connected with something affirmative and simply affirmative concepts if joined together cannot   0 neutralise each other but in sensuous intuition where we have to deal with reality for instance motion there exist conditions opposite directions of which in the concept of motion in general no account was taken and which render possible an opposition not however a logical one and from mere positives produce zero0 so that it would be wrong to say that all reality must be in perfect agreement if there is no opposition between its concepts  if we keep to concepts only that which we call internal is the substratum of all relations or     external determinations if therefore i take no account of any of the conditions of intuition and confine myself solely to the concept of a thing then i may drop no doubt all external relations and yet there must remain the concept of something which implies no relation but internal determinations only from this it might seem to follow that there exists in everything something substance which is absolutely internal preceding all external determinations nay rendering them possible it might likewise seem to follow that this substratum as no longer containing any external relations must be simple for corporeal things are always relations only at least of their parts existing side by side and as we know of no entirely internal determinations beyond those of our own internal sense that substratum might be taken not only as simple but likewise     according to the analogy of our own internal sense as determined by representations so that all things would be really monads or simple beings endowed with representations all this would be perfectly true unless something more than the concept of a thing in general     were required in order to give us objects of external intuition although the pure concept need take no account of it but we see on the contrary that a permanent phenomenon in space impenetrable extension may contain mere relations without anything that is absolutely internal and yet be the first substratum of all external perception it is true that if we think by concepts only we cannot think something external without something internal because conceptions of relations presuppose things given and are impossible without them but as in intuition something is contained which does not exist at all in the mere concept of a thing and as it is this which supplies the substratum that could never be known by mere concepts namely a space which with all that is contained in it consists of purely formal or real relations also i am not allowed to say that because nothing can be represented by mere concepts without something absolutely internal there could not be in the real things themselves comprehended under those concepts and in their intuition anything external without a foundation of something absolutely internal for if we take no account of all conditions of intuition then no doubt nothing remains in the mere concept but the internal in general with its mutual relations through which alone the external is possible this necessity however which depends on abstraction alone does not apply to things if     they are given in intuition with determinations expressive     of mere relations and without having for their foundation anything internal for the simple reason that they are phenomena only and not things in themselves whatever we may know of matter are nothing but relations what we call internal determinations are but relatively internal but there are among these relations some which are independent and permanent and by which a certain object is given us that i when abstraction is made of these relations have nothing more to think does not do away with the concept of a thing as a phenomenon nor with the concept of an object in abstracto it only shows the impossibility of such an object as could be determined by mere concepts that is of a noumenon it is no doubt startling to hear that a thing should consist entirely of relations but such a thing as we speak of is merely a phenomenon and can never be thought by means of the categories only nay it consists itself of the mere relation of something in general to our senses in the same manner it is impossible for us to represent the relations of things in abstracto as long as we deal with concepts only in any other way than that one should be the cause of determinations in the other this being the very concept of our understanding with regard to relations but as in this case we make abstraction of all intuition a whole class of determinations by which the manifold determines its place to each of its component parts that is the form of sensibility space disappears though in truth     it precedes all empirical casuality if by purely intelligible objects we understand things which without all schemata of sensibility are thought by mere categories such objects are simply impossible it is our sensuous intuition by which objects are given to us that     forms the condition of the objective application of all the concepts of our understanding and without that intuition the categories have no relation whatever to any object nay even if we admitted a kind of intuition different from the sensuous our functions of thought would have no meaning with regard to it if we only mean objects of a nonsensuous intuition to which our categories do not apply and of which we can have no knowledge whatever either intuitional or conceptual there is no reason why noumena in this merely negative meaning should not be admitted because in this case we mean no more than this that our intuition does not embrace all things but objects of our senses only that consequently its objective validity is limited and space left for some other kind of intuition and consequently for things as objects of it but in that sense the concept of a noumenon is problematical that is the representation of a thing of which we can neither say that it is possible or that it is impossible because we have no conception of any kind of intuition but that of our senses or of any kind of concepts but of our categories     neither of them being applicable to any extrasensuous object we cannot therefore extend in a positive sense the field of the objects of our thought beyond the conditions of our sensibility or admit besides phenomena objects of pure thought that is noumena simply because they do not possess any positive meaning that could be pointed out for it must be admitted that the categories by themselves are not sufficient for a knowledge of things and that without the data of sensibility they would be nothing but subjective forms of unity of the understanding and without an object we do not say that thought is a mere product of the senses and therefore limited by them but it does     not follow that therefore thought without sensibility has its own pure use because it would really be without an object nor would it be right to call the noumenon such an object of the pure understanding for the noumenon means the problematical concept of an object intended for an intuition and understanding totally different from our own and therefore themselves mere problems the concept of the noumenon is not therefore the concept of an object but only a problem inseparable from the limitation of our sensibility whether there may not be objects independent of its intuition this is a question that     can only be answered in an uncertain way by saying that as sensuous intuition does not embrace all things without exception there remains a place for other objects that cannot therefore be absolutely denied but cannot be asserted either as objects of our understanding because there is no definite concept for them our categories being unfit for that purpose the understanding therefore limits the sensibility without enlarging thereby its own field and by warning the latter that it can never apply to things by themselves but to phenomena only it forms the thought of an object by itself but as transcendental only which is the cause of phenomena and therefore never itself a phenomenon which cannot be thought as quantity nor as reality nor as substance because these concepts require sensuous forms in which to determine an object and of which therefore it must always remain unknown whether it is to be found within us only or also without us and whether if sensibility were removed it would vanish or remain if we like to call this object noumenon because the representation of it is not sensuous we are at liberty to do so but as we     cannot apply to it any of the concepts of our understanding such a representation remains to us empty serving no purpose but that of indicating the limits of our sensuous knowledge and leaving at the same time an     empty space which we cannot fill either by possible experience or by the pure understanding the critique of the pure understanding does not therefore allow us to create a new sphere of objects beyond those which can come before it as phenomena or to stray into intelligible worlds or even into the concept of such the mistake which leads to this in the most plausible manner and which though excusable can never be justified consists in making the use of the understanding contrary to its very intention transcendental so that objects that is possible intuitions are made to conform to concepts not concepts to possible intuitions on which alone their objective validity can rest the cause of this is again that apperception and with it thought precedes every possible determinate arrangement of representations we are thinking something in general and determine it on one side sensuously but distinguish at the same time the general object represented in abstraction from this particular mode of sensuous intuition thus there remains to us a mode of determining the object by thought only which though it is a mere logical form without any contents seems to us nevertheless a mode in which the object by itself exists noumenon without regard to the intuition which is restricted to our senses   0                                     before leaving this transcendental analytic we have to add something which though in itself of no particular     importance may yet seem to be requisite for the completeness of the system the highest concept of which all transcendental philosophy generally begins is the division into the possible and the impossible but as all division presupposes a divisible concept a higher concept is required and this is the concept of an object in general taken as problematical it being left uncertain whether it be something or nothing as the categories are the only concepts which apply to objects in general the distinction whether an object is something or nothing must proceed according to the order and direction of the categories i opposed to the concepts of all many and one is the concept which annihilates everything that is none and thus the object of a concept to which no intuition can be found to correspond is  0 that is a concept without an object like the noumena which cannot be counted as possibilities though not as impossibilities either ens nationis or like certain fundamental forces     which have been newly invented and have been conceived without contradiction but at the same time without any example from experience and must not therefore be counted among possibilities ii reality is something negation is nothing that is it is the concept of the absence of an object as shadow or cold nihil privativum iii the mere form of intuition without substance is in itself no object but the merely formal condition of it as a phenomenon as pure space and pure time ens imaginarium which though they are something as forms of intuition are not themselves objects of intuition iv the object of a concept which contradicts itself is nothing because the concept is nothing it is simply     the impossible as a figure composed of two straight lines nihil negativum a table showing this division of the concept of nothing the corresponding division of the concept of something follows by itself would have to be arranged as follows  nothingp       as   i empty concept without an object   ens rationis  ii empty object of a concept  iii empty intuition without an object nil privativum  ens imaginarium  iv empty object without a concept   nihil negativum  we see that the ens rationis no   differs from the ens negativum no   because the former cannot be counted among the possibilities being the result of fancy though not selfcontradictory while the latter is opposed to possibility the concept annihilating itself both however are empty concepts the nihil privativum no   and the ens imaginarium no   are on the contrary empty data for concepts it would be impossible to represent to ourselves darkness unless light had been given to the senses or space unless extended beings had been perceived the negation as well as the pure form of intuition are without something real no objects     division ii transcendental dialectic in two books with their chapters and sections     introduction   of transcendental appearance illusion we call dialectic in general a logic of illusion eine logik des scheins this does not mean that it is a doctrine of probability wahrscheinlichkeit for probability is a kind of truth known through insufficient causes the knowledge of which is therefore deficient but not deceitful and cannot properly be separated from the analytical part of logic still less can phenomenon erscheinung and illusion schein be taken as identical for truth or illusion is not to be found in the objects of intuition but in the judgments upon them so far as they are thought it is therefore quite right to say that the senses never err not because they always judge rightly but because they do not judge at all truth therefore and error and consequently illusory appearance also as the cause of error exist in our judgments only that is in the relation of an object to our understanding no error exists in our knowledge if it completely agrees with the laws of our understanding nor can there be     an error in a representation of the senses because they     involve no judgment and no power of nature can of its own accord deviate from its own laws therefore neither the understanding by itself without the influence of another cause nor the senses by themselves could ever err the understanding could not err because as long as it acts according to its own laws the effect the judgment must necessarily agree with those laws and the formal test of all truth consists in this agreement with the laws of the understanding the senses cannot err because there is in them no judgment at all whether true or false now as we have no other sources of knowledge but these two it follows that error can only arise through the unperceived influence of the sensibility on the understanding whereby it happens that subjective grounds of judgment are mixed up with the objective and cause them to deviate from their destination  just as a body in motion would if left to itself always follow a straight line in the same direction which is changed however into a curvilinear motion as soon as another force influences it at the same time in a different direction in order to distinguish the proper action     of the understanding from that other force which is mixed up with it it will be necessary to look on an erroneous judgment as the diagonal between two forces which determine the judgment in two different directions forming as it were an angle and to dissolve that composite effect into the simple ones of the understanding and of the sensibility which must be effected in pure judgments a priori   0 by transcendental reflection whereby as we tried to show the right place is assigned to each representation in the faculty of knowledge corresponding to it and the influence of either faculty upon such representation is determined it is not at present our business to treat of empirical for instance optical appearance or illusion which occurs in the empirical use of the otherwise correct rules of the understanding and by which owing to the influence of imagination the faculty of judgment is misled we have to deal here with nothing but the transcendental illusion which touches principles never even intended to be applied to experience which might give us a test of their correctness — an illusion which in spite of all the warnings of criticism tempts us far beyond the empirical use of the categories and deludes us with the mere dream of an extension of the pure understanding all principles the application of which is entirely confined within the limits of possible experience we     shall call immanent those on the contrary which tend to transgress those limits transcendent i do not mean by this the transcendental use or abuse of the categories which is a mere fault of the faculty of the judgment not being as yet sufficiently subdued by criticism nor sufficiently attentive to the limits of the sphere within which alone the pure understanding has full play but real principles which call upon us to break down all those barriers and to claim a perfectly new territory which nowhere recognises any demarcation at all here transcendental and transcendent do not mean the same thing the principles of the pure understanding which we explained before are meant to be only of empirical and not of transcendental application that is they cannot     transcend the limits of experience a principle on the contrary which removes these landmarks nay insists on our transcending them is called transcendent if our critique succeeds in laying bare the illusion of those pretended principles the other principles of a purely empirical use may in opposition to the former be called immanent logical illusion which consists in a mere imitation of the forms of reason the illusion of sophistic syllogisms arises entirely from want of attention to logical rules it disappears at once when our attention     is roused transcendental illusion on the contrary does not disappear although it has been shown up and its worthlessness rendered clear by means of transcendental criticism as for instance the illusion inherent in the proposition that the world must have a beginning in time the cause of this is that there exists in our reason considered subjectively as a faculty of human knowledge principles and maxims of its use which have the appearance of objective principles and lead us to mistake the subjective necessity of a certain connection of our concepts in favour of the understanding for an objective necessity in the determination of things by themselves this illusion is as impossible to avoid as it is to prevent the sea from appearing to us higher at a distance than on the shore because we see it by higher rays of light or to prevent the moon from appearing even to an astronomer larger at its rising although he is not deceived by that illusion transcendental dialectic must therefore be content to lay bare the illusion of transcendental judgments and guarding against its deceptions — but it will never succeed     in removing the transcendental illusion like the logical and putting an end to it altogether     for we have here to deal with a natural and inevitable illusion which itself rests on subjective principles representing them to us as objective while logical dialectic in removing sophisms has to deal merely with a mistake in applying the principles or with an artificial illusion produced by an imitation of them there exists therefore a natural and inevitable dialectic of pure reason not one in which a mere bungler might get entangled from want of knowledge or which a sophist might artificially devise to confuse rational people but one that is inherent in and inseparable from human reason and which even after its illusion has been exposed will never cease to fascinate our reason and to precipitate it into momentary errors such as require to be removed again and again   of pure reason as the seat of transcendental illusion a of reason in general all our knowledge begins with the senses proceeds thence to the understanding and ends with reason there is nothing higher than reason for working up the material of intuition and comprehending it under the highest unity of thought as it here becomes     necessary to give a definition of that highest faculty of knowledge i begin to feel considerable misgivings there is of reason as there is of the understanding a purely formal that is logical use in which no account is taken of the contents of knowledge but there is also a real use in so far as reason itself contains the origin of certain     concepts and principles which it has not borrowed either from the senses or from the understanding the former faculty has been long defined by logicians as the faculty of mediate conclusions in contradistinction to immediate ones consequentiae immediatae but this does not help us to understand the latter which itself produces concepts as this brings us face to face with the division of reason into a logical and a transcendental faculty we must look for a higher concept for this source of knowledge to comprehend both concepts though according to the analogy of the concepts of the understanding we may expect that the logical concept will give us the key to the transcendental and that the table of the functions of the former will give us the genealogical outline of the concepts of reason in the first part of our transcendental logic we defined the understanding as the faculty of rules and we now distinguish reason from it by calling it the faculty of principles  00 the term principle is ambiguous and signifies commonly some kind of knowledge only that may be used as a principle though in itself and according to its origin it is no principle at all every general proposition even though it may have been derived from experience by induction may serve as a major in a syllogism of reason but it is not on that account a principle mathematical axioms as for instance that between two points there can be only one straight line constitute even general knowledge a priori and may therefore with reference to the cases which can be brought under them rightly be called principles nevertheless it would be wrong to say that this property of a straight line in general and by itself     is known to us from principles for it is known from pure intuition only i shall therefore call it knowledge from principles whenever we know the particular in the general by means of concepts thus every syllogism of reason is a form of deducing some kind of knowledge from a principle because the major always contains a concept which enables us to know according to a principle everything that can be comprehended under the conditions of that concept as every general knowledge may serve as a major in such a syllogism and as the understanding supplies such general propositions a priori these no doubt may with reference to their possible use be called principles  0  but if we consider these principles of the pure understanding in themselves and according to their origin we find that they are anything rather than knowledge from concepts they would not even be possible a priori unless we relied on pure intuition in mathematics or on conditions of a possible experience in general that everything which happens has a cause can by no means be concluded from the concept of that which happens on the contrary that very principle shows in what manner alone we can form a definite empirical concept of that which happens it is impossible therefore for the understanding to supply us with synthetical knowledge from concepts and it is really that kind of knowledge which i call principles absolutely while all general propositions may be called principles relatively it is an old desideratum which at some time however distant may be realised that instead of the endless     variety of civil laws their principles might be discovered for thus alone the secret might be found of what is called simplifying legislation such laws however are only limitations of our freedom under conditions by which it always agrees with itself they refer to something which is entirely our own work and of which we ourselves can be the cause by means of these concepts but that objects in themselves as for instance material nature should be subject to principles and be determined according  0  to mere concepts is something if not impossible at all events extremely contradictory but be that as it may for on this point we have still all investigations before us so much at least is clear that knowledge from principles by itself is something totally different from mere knowledge of the understanding which in the form of a principle may no doubt precede other knowledge but which by itself in so far as it is synthetical is not based on mere thought nor contains anything general according to concepts if the understanding is a faculty for producing unity among phenomena according to rules reason is the faculty for producing unity among the rules of the understanding according to principles reason therefore never looks directly to experience or to any object but to the understanding in order to impart a priori through concepts to its manifold kinds of knowledge a unity that may be called the unity of reason and is very different from the unity which can be produced by the understanding this is a general definition of the faculty of reason so far as it was possible to make it intelligible without the help of illustrations which are to be given hereafter     b of the logical use of reason  0  a distinction is commonly made between what is immediately known and what is only inferred that in a figure bounded by three straight lines there are three angles is known immediately but that these angles together are equal to two right angles is only inferred as we are constantly obliged to infer we grow so accustomed to it that in the end we no longer perceive this difference and as in the case of the socalled deceptions of the senses often mistake what we have only inferred for something perceived immediately in every syllogism there is first a fundamental proposition secondly another deduced from it and lastly the conclusion consequence according to which the truth of the latter is indissolubly connected with the truth of the former if the judgment or the conclusion is so clearly contained in the first that it can be inferred from it without the mediation or intervention of a third representation the conclusion is called immediate consequentia immediata though i should prefer to call it a conclusion of the understanding but if besides the fundamental knowledge another judgment is required to bring out the consequence then the conclusion is called a conclusion of reason in the proposition all men are mortal the following propositions are contained some men are mortal or some mortals are men or nothing that is immortal is a man these are therefore immediate  0  inferences from the first the proposition on the contrary all the learned are mortal is not contained in the fundamental judgment because the concept of learned does not occur in it and can only be deduced from it by means of an intervening judgment     in every syllogism i first think a rule the major by means of the understanding i then bring some special knowledge under the condition of the rule the minor by means of the faculty of judgment and i finally determine my knowledge through the predicate of the rule conclusio that is a priori by means of reason it is therefore the relation represented by the major proposition as the rule between knowledge and its condition that constitutes the different kinds of syllogism syllogisms are therefore threefold like all judgments differing from each other in the manner in which they express the relation of knowledge in the understanding namely categorical hypothetical and disjunctive if as often happens the conclusion is put forward as a judgment in order to see whether it does not follow from other judgments by which a perfectly different object is conceived i try to find in the understanding the assertion of that conclusion in order to see whether it does not exist in it under certain conditions according to a general rule if i find such a condition and if the object of the conclusion can be brought under the given  0  condition then that conclusion follows from the rule which is valid for other objects of knowledge also thus we see that reason in forming conclusions tries to reduce the great variety of the knowledge of the understanding to the smallest number of principles general conditions and thereby to produce in it the highest unity c of the pure use of reason the question to which we have at present to give an answer though a preliminary one only is this whether reason can be isolated and thus constitute by itself an     independent source of concepts and judgments which spring from it alone and through which it has reference to objects or whether it is only a subordinate faculty for imparting a certain form to any given knowledge namely a logical form a faculty whereby the cognitions of the understanding are arranged among themselves only and lower rules placed under higher ones the condition of the latter comprehending in its sphere the condition of the former so far as all this can be done by their comparison variety of rules with unity of principles is a requirement of reason for the purpose of bringing the understanding into perfect agreement with itself just as the understanding brings the variety of intuition under concepts and thus imparts to intuition a connected form such a principle however prescribes no law to the objects  0  themselves nor does it contain the ground on which the possibility of knowing and determining objects depends it is merely a subjective law of economy applied to the stores of our understanding having for its purpose by means of a comparison of concepts to reduce the general use of them to the smallest possible number but without giving us a right to demand of the objects themselves such a uniformity as might conduce to the comfort and the extension of our understanding or to ascribe to that maxim any objective validity in one word the question is whether reason in itself that is pure reason contains synthetical principles and rules a priori and what those principles are the merely formal and logical procedure of reason in syllogisms gives us sufficient hints as to the ground on which the transcendental principle of synthetical knowledge by means of pure reason is likely to rest     first a syllogism as a function of reason does not refer to intuitions in order to bring them under rules as the understanding does with its categories but to concepts and judgments although pure reason refers in the end to objects it has no immediate relation to them and their intuition but only to the understanding and its judgments these having a direct relation to the  0  senses and their intuition and determining their objects unity of reason is therefore never the unity of a possible experience but essentially different from it as the unity of the understanding that everything which happens has a cause is not a principle discovered or prescribed by reason it only makes the unity of experience possible and borrows nothing from reason which without this relation to possible experience could never from mere concepts have prescribed such a synthetical unity secondly reason in its logical employment looks for the general condition of its judgment the conclusion and the syllogism produced by reason is itself nothing but a judgment by means of bringing its condition under a general rule the major but as this rule is again liable to the same experiment reason having to seek as long as possible the condition of a condition by means of a prosyllogism it is easy to see that it is the peculiar principle of reason in its logical use to find for every conditioned knowledge of the understanding the unconditioned whereby the unity of that knowledge may be completed this logical maxim however cannot become a principle of pure reason unless we admit that whenever the condition is given the whole series of conditions subordinated to one another a series which consequently is  0  itself unconditioned is likewise given that is is contained in the object and its connection   0 such a principle of pure reason however is evidently synthetical for analytically the conditioned refers no doubt to some condition but not to the unconditioned from this principle several other synthetical propositions also must arise of which the pure understanding knows nothing because it has to deal with objects of a possible experience only the knowledge and synthesis of which are always conditioned the unconditioned if it is really to be admitted has to be especially considered with regard to all the determinations which distinguish it from whatever is conditioned and will thus supply material for many a synthetical proposition a priori the principles resulting from this highest principle of pure reason will however be transcendent with regard to all phenomena that is to say it will be impossible ever to make any adequate empirical use of such a principle it will thus be completely different from all principles of the understanding the use of which is entirely immanent and directed to the possibility of experience only the task that is now before us in the transcendental dialectic which has to be developed from sources deeply hidden in the human reason is this to discover the correctness or otherwise the falsehood of the principle that the series of conditions in the synthesis of phenomena or of objective thought in general extends to the unconditioned and what consequences result therefrom with regard to the empirical use of the understanding — to find  0  out whether there is really such an objectively valid principle of reason and not only in place of it a logical rule which requires us by ascending to ever higher conditions to approach their completeness and thus to bring the highest unity of reason which is possible to us into our     knowledge to find out i say whether by some misconception a mere tendency of reason has not been mistaken for a transcendental principle of pure reason postulating without sufficient reflection absolute completeness in the series of conditions in the objects themselves and what kind of misconceptions and illusions may in that case have crept into the syllogisms of reason the major proposition of which has been taken over from pure reason being perhaps a petitio rather than a postulatum and which ascend from experience to its conditions we shall divide it into two parts of which the first will treat of the transcendent concepts of pure reason the second of transcendent and dialectical syllogisms     book i of the concepts of pure reason   0 whatever may be thought of the possibility of concepts of pure reason it is certain that they are not simply obtained by reflection but by inference concepts of the understanding exist a priori before experience and for the sake of it but they contain nothing but the unity of reflection applied to phenomena so far as they are necessarily intended for a possible empirical consciousness it is through them alone that knowledge and determination of an object become possible they are the first to give material for conclusions and they are not preceded by any concepts a priori of objects from which they could themselves be deduced their objective reality however depends on this that because they constitute the intellectual form of all experience it is necessary that their application should always admit of being exhibited in experience the very name however of a concept of reason gives a kind of intimation that it is not intended to be limited to experience because it refers to a kind of knowledge of which every empirical knowledge is a part only it may be     the whole of possible experience or of its empirical     synthesis and to which all real experience belongs though it can never fully attain to it concepts of reason serve for conceiving or comprehending concepts of the understanding for understanding perceptions if they contain the unconditioned they refer to something to which all experience may belong but which itself can never become an object of experience — something to which reason in its conclusions from experience leads up and by which it estimates and measures the degree of its own empirical use but which never forms part of empirical synthesis if such concepts possess notwithstanding objective validity they may be called conceptus ratiocinati concepts legitimately formed if they have only been surreptitiously obtained by a kind of illusory conclusion they may be called conceptus ratiocinantes sophistical concepts but as this subject can only be fully treated in the chapter on the dialectical conclusions of pure reason we shall say no more of it now but shall only as we gave the name of categories to the pure concepts of the understanding give a new name to the concepts of pure reason and call them transcendental ideas a name that has now to be explained and justified         first section of ideas in general in spite of the great wealth of our languages a thoughtful mind is often at a loss for an expression that should square exactly with its concept and for want of which he cannot make himself altogether intelligible either to others or to himself to coin new words is to arrogate to oneself legislative power in matters of language a proceeding which seldom succeeds so that before taking so desperate a step it is always advisable to look about in dead and learned languages whether they do not contain such a concept and its adequate expression even if it should happen that the original meaning of the word had become somewhat uncertain through carelessness on the part of its authors it is better nevertheless to determine and fix the meaning which principally belonged to it even if it should remain doubtful whether it was originally used exactly in that meaning than to spoil our labour by becoming unintelligible whenever therefore there exists one single word only for a certain concept which in its received meaning exactly covers that concept and when it is of     great consequence to keep that concept distinct from other related concepts we ought not to be lavish in using it nor     employ it for the sake of variety only as a synonyme in the place of others but carefully preserve its own peculiar meaning as otherwise it may easily happen that the expression ceases to attract special attention and loses itself in a crowd of other words of very different import so that the thought which that expression alone could have preserved is lost with it from the way in which plato uses the term idea it is easy to see that he meant by it something which not only was never borrowed from the senses but which even far transcends the concepts of the understanding with which aristotle occupied himself there being nothing in experience corresponding to the ideas with him the ideas are archetypes of things themselves not only like the categories keys to possible experiences according to his opinion they flowed out from the highest reason which however exists no longer in its original state but has to recall with difficulty the old but now very obscure ideas which it does by means of reminiscence commonly called philosophy i shall not enter here on any literary discussions in order to determine the exact meaning which the sublime philosopher himself connected with that expression i shall only remark that it is by no     means unusual in ordinary conversations as well as in written works that by carefully comparing the thoughts uttered by an author on his own subject we succeed in understanding him better than he understood himself because he did not sufficiently define his concept and thus not only spoke but sometimes even thought in opposition to his own intentions plato knew very well that our faculty of knowledge was filled with a much higher craving than merely to     spell out phenomena according to a synthetical unity and thus to read and understand them as experience he knew that our reason if left to itself tries to soar up to knowledge to which no object that experience may give can ever correspond but which nevertheless is real and by no means a mere cobweb of the brain plato discovered his ideas principally in what is practical  that is in what depends on freedom which again belongs to a class of knowledge which is a     peculiar product of reason he who would derive the concept of virtue from experience and would change what at best could only serve as an example or an imperfect illustration into a type and a source of knowledge as many have really done would indeed transform virtue into an equivocal phantom changing according to times and circumstances and utterly useless to serve as a rule everybody can surely perceive that when a person is held up to us as a model of virtue we have always in our own mind the true original with which we compare this socalled model and estimate it accordingly the true original is the idea of virtue in regard to which all possible objects of experience may serve as examples proofs of the practicability in a certain degree of that which is required by the concept of reason but never as archetypes that no man can ever act up to     the pure idea of virtue does not in the least prove the chimerical nature of that concept for every judgment as to the moral worth or unworth of actions is possible by means of that idea only which forms therefore the necessary foundation for every approach to moral perfection however far the impediments inherent in human nature the extent of which it is difficult to determine may keep us removed from it the platonic republic has been supposed to     be a striking example of purely imaginary perfection it has become a byword as something that could exist in the brain of an idle thinker only and brucker thinks it ridiculous that plato could have said that no prince could ever govern well unless he participated in the ideas we should do better however to follow up this thought and endeavour where that excellent philosopher leaves us without his guidance to place it in a clearer light by our own efforts rather than to throw it aside as useless under the miserable and very dangerous pretext of its impracticability a constitution founded on the greatest possible human freedom according to laws which enable the freedom of each individual to exist by the side of the freedom of others without any regard to the highest possible human happiness because that must necessarily follow by itself is to say the least a necessary idea on which not only the first plan of a constitution or a state but all laws must be based it being by no means necessary to take account from the beginning of existing impediments which may owe their origin not so much to human nature itself as to the actual neglect of true ideas in legislation for nothing can be more mischievous and more unworthy a philosopher     than the vulgar appeal to what is called adverse experience which possibly might never have existed if at the proper time institutions had been framed according to those ideas and not according to crude     concepts which because they were derived from experience only have marred all good intentions the more legislation and government are in harmony with that idea the rarer no doubt punishments would become and it is therefore quite rational to say as plato did that in a perfect state no punishments would be necessary and though this can never be realised yet the idea is quite correct which sets up this maximum as an archetype in order thus to bring our legislative constitutions nearer and nearer to the greatest possible perfection which may be the highest degree where human nature must stop and how wide the chasm may be between the idea and its realisation no one can or ought to determine because it is this very freedom that may be able to transcend any limits hitherto assigned to it it is not only however where human reason asserts its free causality and ideas become operative agents with regard to actions and their objects that is to say in the sphere of ethics but also in nature itself that plato rightly discovered clear proofs of its origin from ideas a plant an animal the regular plan of the cosmos most likely therefore the whole order of nature show clearly that they are possible according to ideas only     and that though no single creature under the singular conditions of its existence can fully correspond with the idea of what is most perfect of its kind as little as any individual man with the idea of humanity which for all that he carries in his mind as the archetype of all his     actions those ideas are nevertheless determined throughout in the highest understanding each by itself as unchangeable and are in fact the original causes of things although it can only be said of the whole of them connected together in the universe that it is perfectly adequate to the idea if we make allowance for the exaggerated expression the effort of the philosopher to ascend from the mere observing and copying of the physical side of nature to an architectonic system of it teleologically that is according to ideas deserves respect and imitation while with regard to the principles of morality legislation and religion where it is the ideas themselves that make experience of the good possible though they can never be fully realised in experience such efforts are of very eminent merit which those only fail to recognise who attempt to judge it according to empirical rules the very validity of which as principles was meant to be denied by plato with regard to nature it is experience no doubt which supplies us with rules and is the foundation of all truth with regard to moral laws on the contrary experience is alas but the source of illusion and it is altogether reprehensible to derive or limit the laws of what we     ought to do according to our experience of what has been done instead of considering these subjects the full development of which constitutes in reality the peculiar character and dignity of philosophy we have to occupy ourselves at present with a task less brilliant though not less useful of building and strengthening the foundation of that majestic edifice of morality which at present is undermined by all sorts of moletracks the work of our reason   0 which thus vainly but always with the same confidence is searching for buried treasures it is our duty at present to acquire an accurate knowledge of the transcendental use of the pure reason its principles and ideas in order to be able to determine and estimate correctly their influence and value but before i leave this preliminary introduction i beg those who really care for philosophy which means more than is commonly supposed if they are convinced by what i have said and shall still have to say to take the term idea in its original meaning under their special protection so that it should no longer be lost among other expressions by which all sorts of representations are loosely designated to the great detriment of philosophy there is no lack of names adequate to express every kind of representation without our having to encroach on the property of others i shall   0 give a graduated list of them the whole class may be called representation repraesentatio under it stands conscious representation perception perceptio a perception referring to the subject only as a modification of his state is sensation sensatio while an objective sensation is called knowledge cognition cognitio cognition is either intuition or concept intuitus vel conceptus the former refers immediately to an object and is singular the latter refers to it mediately that is by means of a characteristic mark that can be shared by several things in common a concept is either empirical or pure and the pure concept so far as it has its origin in the understanding only not in the pure image of sensibility is called notion notio a concept formed of notions and transcending all possible experience is an idea or a concept of reason to any one who has once accustomed himself to these distinctions it     must be extremely irksome to hear the representation of red colour called an idea though it could not even be rightly called a notion a concept of the understanding second section of transcendental ideas    we had an instance in our transcendental analytic how the mere logical form of our knowledge could contain the origin of pure concepts a priori which represent objects antecedently to all experience or rather indicate a synthetical unity by which alone an empirical knowledge of objects becomes possible the form of judgments changed into a concept of the synthesis of intuitions gave us the categories that guide and determine the use of the understanding in every experience we may expect therefore that the form of the syllogisms if referred to the synthetical unity of intuitions according to the manner of the categories will contain the origin of certain concepts a priori to be called concepts of pure reason or transcendental ideas which ought to determine the use of the understanding within the whole realm of experience according to principles the function of reason in its syllogisms consists in the universality of cognition according to concepts and the syllogism itself is in reality a judgment determined     a priori in the whole extent of its condition the     proposition caius is mortal might be taken from experience by means of the understanding only but what we want is a concept containing the condition under which the predicate assertion in general of that judgment is given here the concept of man and after i have arranged it under this condition taken in its whole extent all men are mortal i proceed to determine accordingly the knowledge of my object caius is mortal what we are doing therefore in the conclusion of a syllogism is to restrict the predicate to a certain object after we have used it first in the major in its whole extent under a certain condition this completeness of its extent in reference to such a condition is called universality universalitas and to this corresponds in the synthesis of intuitions the totality universitas of conditions the transcendental concept of reason is therefore nothing but the concept of the totality of the conditions of anything given as conditioned as therefore the unconditioned alone renders a totality of conditions possible and as conversely the totality of conditions must always be unconditioned it follows that a pure concept of reason in general may be explained as a concept of the unconditioned so far as it contains a basis for the synthesis of the conditioned as many kinds of relations as there are which     the understanding represents to itself by means of the categories so many pure concepts of the reason we shall find that is first the unconditioned of the categorical synthesis in a subject secondly the unconditioned of the hypothetical synthesis of the members of a series thirdly the unconditioned of the disjunctive synthesis of the parts of a system     there are exactly as many kinds of syllogisms each of which tries to advance by means of prosyllogisms to the unconditioned the first to the subject which itself is no longer a predicate the second to the presupposition which presupposes nothing else and the third to an aggregate of the members of a division which requires nothing else in order to render the division of the concept complete hence the pure concepts of reason implying totality in the synthesis of the conditions are necessary at least as problems in order to carry the unity of the understanding to the unconditioned if that is possible and they are founded in the nature of human reason even though these transcendental concepts may be without any proper application in concreto and thus have no utility beyond bringing the understanding into a direction where its application being extended as far as possible is brought throughout in harmony with itself whilst speaking here of the totality of conditions     and of the unconditioned as the common title of all the concepts of reason we again meet with a term which we cannot do without but which by long abuse has become so equivocal that we cannot employ it with safety the term absolute is one of those few words which in their original meaning were fitted to a concept which afterwards could not be exactly fitted with any other word of the same language and the loss of which or what is the same the loose employment of which entails the loss of the concept itself and that of a concept with which reason is constantly occupied and cannot dispense with without real damage to all transcendental investigations at present the term absolute is frequently used simply in order to indicate that something applies     to an object considered in itself and thus as it were internally in this way absolutely possible would mean that something is possible in itself interné which in reality is the least that could be said of it it is sometimes used also to indicate that something is valid in all respects without limitation as people speak of absolute sovereignty in this way absolutely possible would mean that which is possible in all respects and this is again the utmost that could be said of the possibility of a thing it is true that these two significations     sometimes coincide because something that is internally impossible is impossible also in every respect and therefore absolutely impossible but in most cases they are far apart and i am by no means justified in concluding that because something is possible in itself it is possible also in every respect that is absolutely possible nay with regard to absolute necessity i shall be able to show hereafter that it by no means always depends on internal necessity and that the two cannot therefore be considered synonymous no doubt if the opposite of a thing is intrinsically impossible that opposite is also impossible in every respect and the thing itself therefore absolutely necessary but i cannot conclude conversely that the opposite of what is absolutely necessary is internally impossible or that the absolute necessity of things is the same as an internal necessity for in certain cases that internal necessity is an entirely empty expression with which we cannot connect the least concept while that of the necessity of a thing in every respect with regard to all that is possible implies very peculiar determinations as therefore the loss of a concept which has acted a great part in speculative philosophy can never     be indifferent to philosophers i hope they will also take some interest in the definition and careful preservation of the term with which that concept is connected i shall therefore use the term absolute in this     enlarged meaning only in opposition to that which is valid relatively and in particular respects only the latter being restricted to conditions the former free from any restrictions whatsoever it is then the absolute totality in the synthesis of conditions at which the transcendental concept of reason aims nor does it rest satisfied till it has reached that which is unconditioned absolutely and in every respect pure reason leaves everything to the understanding which has primarily to do with the objects of intuition or rather their synthesis in imagination it is only the absolute totality in the use of the concepts of the understanding which reason reserves for itself while trying to carry the synthetical unity which is realised in the category to the absolutely unconditioned we might therefore call the latter the unity of the phenomena in reason the former which is expressed by the category the unity in the understanding hence reason is only concerned with the use of the understanding not so far as it contains the basis of possible experience for the absolute totality of conditions is not a concept that can be used in experience because no experience is unconditioned but in order to impart to it a direction towards a certain unity of which the understanding knows nothing and which is meant to comprehend all acts of the understanding with regard to any object into an     absolute whole on this account the objective use of the pure concepts of reason must always be transcendent     while that of the pure concepts of the understanding must always be immanent being by its very nature restricted to possible experience by idea i understand the necessary concept of reason to which the senses can supply no corresponding object the concepts of reason therefore of which we have been speaking are transcendental ideas they are concepts of pure reason so far as they regard all empirical knowledge as determined by an absolute totality of conditions they are not mere fancies but supplied to us by the very nature of reason and referring by necessity to the whole use of the understanding they are lastly transcendent as overstepping the limits of all experience which can never supply an object adequate to the transcendental idea if we speak of an idea we say a great deal with respect to the object as the object of the pure understanding but very little with respect to the subject that is with respect to its reality under empirical conditions because an idea being the concept of a maximum can never be adequately given in concreto as the latter is really the whole aim in the merely speculative use of reason and as     the mere approaching a concept which in reality can never be reached is the same as if the concept were missed altogether people when speaking of such a concept are wont to say it is an idea only thus one might say that the absolute whole of all phenomena is an idea only for as we can never form a representation of such a whole it remains a problem without a solution in the practical use of the understanding on the contrary where we are only concerned with practice according to rules the idea of practical reason can always be realised in concreto although partially only nay it is the indispensable     condition of all practical use of reason the practical realisation of the idea is here always limited and deficient but these limits cannot be defined and it always remains under the influence of a concept implying absolute completeness and perfection the practical idea is therefore in this case truly fruitful and with regard to practical conduct indispensable and necessary in it pure reason becomes a cause and active power capable of realising what is contained in its concept hence we cannot say of wisdom as if contemptuously that it is an idea only but for the very reason that it contains the idea of the necessary unity of all possible aims it must determine all practical acts as an original and at least limitative condition although we must say that all transcendental     concepts of reason are ideas only they are not therefore to be considered as superfluous and useless for although we cannot by them determine any object they may nevertheless even unobserved supply the understanding with a canon or rule of its extended and consistent use by which though no object can be better known than it is according to its concepts yet the understanding may be better guided onwards in its knowledge not to mention that they may possibly render practicable a transition from physical to practical concepts and thus impart to moral ideas a certain strength and connection with the speculative knowledge of reason on all this more light will be thrown in the sequel for our present purposes we are obliged to set aside a consideration of these practical ideas and to treat of reason in its speculative or rather in a still more limited sense its purely transcendental use here we must follow     the same road which we took before in the deduction of the categories that is we must consider the logical form of all knowledge of reason and see whether perhaps by this logical form reason may become a source of concepts also which enable us to regard objects in themselves as determined synthetically a priori in relation to one or other of the functions of reason reason if considered as a faculty of a certain   0 logical form of knowledge is the faculty of concluding that is of judging mediately by bringing the condition of a possible under the condition of a given judgment the given judgment is the general rule major bringing the condition of another possible judgment under the condition of the rule which may be called subsumption is the minor and the actual judgment which contains the assertion of the rule in the subsumed case is the conclusion we know that the rule asserts something as general under a certain condition the condition of the rule is then found to exist in a given case then that which under that condition was asserted as generally valid has to be considered as valid in that given case also which complies with that condition it is easy to see therefore that reason arrives at knowledge by acts of the understanding which constitute a series of conditions if i arrive at the proposition that all bodies are changeable only by starting from a more remote knowledge which does not yet contain the concept of body but a condition of such a concept only namely that all which is composite is changeable and then proceed to something less remotely known and depending on the former namely that bodies are composite and lastly only advance to a third proposition connecting the more remote knowledge     changeable with the given case and conclude that bodies therefore are changeable we see that we have     passed through a series of conditions premisses before we arrived at knowledge conclusion every series the exponent of which whether of a categorical or hypothetical judgment is given can be continued so that this procedure of reason leads to ratiocinatio polysyllogistica a series of conclusions which either on the side of the conditions per prosyllogismos or of the conditioned per episyllogismos may be continued indefinitely it is soon perceived however that the chain or series of prosyllogisms that is of knowledge deduced on the side of reasons or conditions of a given knowledge in other words the ascending series of syllogisms must stand in a very different relation to the faculty of reason from that of the descending series that is of the progress of reason on the side of the conditioned by means of episyllogisms for as in the former case the knowledge embodied in the conclusion is given as conditioned only it is impossible to arrive at it by means of reason in any other way except under the supposition at least that all the members of the series on the side of the conditions are given totality in the series of premisses because it is under that supposition only that the contemplated judgment a priori is possible while on the side of the conditioned or of the inferences we can only think     of a growing series not of one presupposed as complete or given that is of a potential progression only hence when our knowledge is considered as conditioned reason is constrained to look upon the series of conditions in the ascending line as complete and given in their totality but if the same knowledge is looked upon at the same   0 time as a condition of other kinds of knowledge which constitute among themselves a series of inferences in a descending line it is indifferent to reason how far that progression may go a parte posteriori or whether a totality of the series is possible at all because such a series is not required for the conclusion in hand which is sufficiently determined and secured on grounds a parte priori whether the series of premisses on the side of the conditions have a something that stands first as the highest condition or whether it be without limits a parte priori it must at all events contain a totality of conditions even though we should never succeed in comprehending it and the whole series must be unconditionally true if the conditioned which is considered as a consequence resulting from it is to be accepted as true this is a demand of reason which pronounces its knowledge as determined a priori and as necessary either in itself and in that case it requires no reasons or if derivative as a member of a series of reasons which itself is unconditionally true third section system of transcendental ideas    we are not at present concerned with logical dialectic which takes no account of the contents of knowledge and has only to lay bare the illusions in the form of syllogisms     but with transcendental dialectic which is supposed to contain entirely a priori the origin of certain kinds of knowledge arising from pure reason and of certain deduced concepts the object of which can never be given empirically and which therefore lie entirely outside the domain of the pure understanding we gathered from the natural relation which must exist between the transcendental and the logical use of our knowledge in syllogisms as well as in judgments that there must be three kinds of dialectic syllogisms and no more corresponding to the three kinds of conclusion by which reason may from principles arrive at knowledge and that in all of these it is the object of reason to ascend from the conditioned synthesis to which the understanding is always restricted to an unconditioned synthesis which the understanding can never reach the relations which all our representations share in common are  st relation to the subject  ndly the relation to objects either as phenomena or as objects     of thought in general if we connect this subdivision with the former division we see that the relation of the representations of which we can form a concept or an idea can only be threefold  st the relation to the subject  ndly the relation to the manifold of the phenomenal object  rdly the relation to all things in general all pure concepts in general aim at a synthetical unity of representations while concepts of pure reason transcendental ideas aim at unconditioned synthetical unity of all conditions all transcendental ideas therefore can be arranged in three classes the first containing the absolute unconditioned unity of the thinking subject the second the absolute unity of the series of conditions of     phenomena the third the absolute unity of the condition of all objects of thought in general the thinking subject is the objectmatter of psychology the system of all phenomena the world the objectmatter of cosmology and the being which contains the highest condition of the possibility of all that can be thought the being of all beings the objectmatter of theology thus it is pure reason which supplies the idea of a transcendental science of the soul psychologia rationalis of a transcendental science of the world cosmologia rationalis and lastly of a transcendental science of god theologia transcendentalis even the mere plan of any     one of these three sciences does not come from the understanding even if connected with the highest logical use of reason that is with all possible conclusions leading from one of its objects phenomenon to all others and on to the most remote parts of any possible empirical synthesis — but is altogether a pure and genuine product or rather problem of pure reason what kinds of pure concepts of reason are comprehended under these three titles of all transcendental ideas will be fully explained in the following chapter they follow the thread of the categories for pure reason never refers direct to objects but to the concepts of objects framed by the understanding nor can it be rendered clear except hereafter in a detailed explanation how first reason simply by the synthetical use of the same function which it employs for categorical syllogisms is necessarily led on to the concept of the absolute unity of the thinking subject secondly how the logical procedure in hypothetical syllogisms leads to the idea of something absolutely unconditioned in a series of given conditions and how thirdly     the mere form of the disjunctive syllogism produces necessarily the highest concept of reason that of a being of all beings a thought which at first sight seems extremely paradoxical     no objective deduction like that given of the categories is possible with regard to these transcendental ideas they are ideas only and for that very reason they have no relation to any object corresponding to them in experience what we could undertake to give was a subjective deduction  of them from the nature of reason and this has been given in the present chapter we can easily perceive that pure reason has no other aim but the absolute totality of synthesis on the side of conditions whether of inherence dependence or concurrence and that it has nothing to do with the absolute completeness on the part of the conditioned it is the former only which is required for presupposing the whole series of conditions and thus presenting it a priori to the understanding if once we have a given condition complete and unconditioned itself no concept of reason is required to continue the series because the understanding takes by itself every step downward from the condition to the conditioned the transcendental ideas therefore serve only for ascending in the series of conditions till they reach the unconditioned that is the principles with regard to descending to the conditioned there is no doubt a widely extended logical use which our reason     may make of the rules of the understanding but no transcendental one and if we form an idea of the absolute totality of such a synthesis by progressus as for     instance of the whole series of all future changes in the world this is only a thought ens rationis that may be thought if we like but is not presupposed as necessary by reason for the possibility of the conditioned the totality of its conditions only but not of its consequences is presupposed such a concept therefore is not one of the transcendental ideas with which alone we have to deal finally we can perceive that there is among the transcendental ideas themselves a certain connection and unity by which pure reason brings all its knowledge into one system there is in the progression from our knowledge of ourselves the soul to a knowledge of the world and through it to a knowledge of the supreme being something so natural that it looks like the logical progression of reason from premisses to a conclusion  whether there exists here a real though hidden relationship such as we saw before between the logical and transcendental use of reason is also one of the questions the answer to which can only be given in the progress of these investigations for the present we have achieved what we wished to achieve by removing the transcendental     concepts of reason which in the systems of other philosophers are generally mixed up with other concepts without being distinguished even from the concepts of the understanding out of so equivocal a position by being able to determine their origin and thereby at the same time their number which can never be exceeded and by thus bringing them into a systematic connection marking out and enclosing thereby a separate field for pure reason     book ii of the dialectical conclusions of pure reason one may say that the object of a purely transcendental idea is something of which we have no concept although the idea is produced with necessity according to the original laws of reason nor is it possible indeed to form of an object that should be adequate to the demands of reason a concept of the understanding that is a concept which could be shown in any possible experience and rendered intuitive it would be better however and less     liable to misunderstandings to say that we can have no knowledge of an object corresponding to an idea but a problematic concept only the transcendental subjective reality at least of pure concepts of reason depends on our being led to such ideas by a necessary syllogism of reason there will be syllogisms therefore which have no empirical premisses and by means of which we conclude from something which we know to something else of which we have no concept and to which constrained by an inevitable illusion we nevertheless attribute objective reality as regards their result     such syllogisms are rather to be called sophistical than rational although as regards their origin they may claim the latter name because they are not purely fictitious or accidental but products of the very nature of reason they are sophistications not of men but of pure reason itself from which even the wisest of men cannot escape all he can do is with great effort to guard against error though never able to rid himself completely of an illusion which constantly torments and mocks him of these dialectical syllogisms of reason there are therefore three classes only that is as many as the ideas to which their conclusions lead in the syllogism   0 of the first class i conclude from the transcendental concept of the subject which contains nothing manifold the absolute unity of the subject itself of which however i have no concept in this regard this dialectical syllogism i shall call the transcendental paralogism the second class of the socalled sophistical syllogisms aims at the transcendental concept of an absolute totality in the series of conditions to any given phenomenon and i conclude from the fact that my concept of the unconditioned synthetical unity of the series is always selfcontradictory on one side the correctness of the opposite unity of which nevertheless i have no concept either the state of reason in this class of dialectical syllogisms i shall call the antinomy of pure reason lastly according to the third class of sophistical syllogisms i conclude from the totality of conditions under which objects in general so far as they can be given to me must be thought the absolute synthetical unity of all conditions of the possibility of things in general that is to say i conclude from things which i do not know according     to their mere transcendental  concept a being of all beings which i know still less through a transcendental concept and of the unconditioned necessity of which i can form no concept whatever this dialectical syllogism of reason i shall call the ideal of pure reason     chapter i of the paralogisms of pure reason     the logical paralogism consists in the formal faultiness of a conclusion without any reference to its contents but a transcendental paralogism arises from a transcendental cause which drives us to a formally false conclusion such a paralogism therefore depends most likely on the very nature of human reason and produces an illusion which is inevitable though not insoluble we now come to a concept which was not inserted in our general list of transcendental concepts and yet must be reckoned with them without however changing that table in the least or proving it to be deficient this is the concept or if the term is preferred the judgment i think it is easily seen however that this concept is the vehicle of all concepts in general therefore of transcendental concepts also being always comprehended among them and being itself transcendental also though without any claim to a special title inasmuch as it serves only to introduce all thought as belonging to consciousness     however free that concept may be from all that is empirical impressions of the senses it serves     nevertheless to distinguish two objects within the nature of our faculty of representation i as thinking am an object of the internal sense and am called soul that which is an object of the external senses is called body the term i as a thinking being signifies the object of psychology which may be called the rational science of the soul supposing that we want to know nothing about the soul except what independent of all experience which determines the i more especially and in concreto can be deduced from the concept of i so far as it is present in every act of thought now the rational science of the soul is really such an undertaking for if the smallest empirical element of my thought or any particular perception of my internal state were mixed up with the sources from which that science derives its materials it would be an empirical and no longer a purely rational science of the soul there is therefore a pretended science founded on the single proposition of i think and the soundness or unsoundness of which may well be examined in this place according to the principles of transcendental philosophy it should not be objected that even in that proposition which expresses the perception of oneself i have an internal experience and that therefore the rational science of the soul which is founded on it can never be quite     pure but rests to a certain extent on an empirical principle for this inner perception is nothing more than the mere apperception i think without which even all transcendental concepts would be impossible in which we really say i think the substance i think the cause   0 etc this internal experience in general and its possibility or perception in general and its relation to other perceptions there being no special distinction or empirical determination of it cannot be regarded as empirical knowledge but must be regarded as knowledge of the empirical in general and falls therefore under the investigation of the possibility of all experience which investigation is certainly transcendental the smallest object of perception even pleasure and pain if added to the general representation of selfconsciousness would at once change rational into empirical psychology i think is therefore the only text of rational psychology out of which it must evolve all its wisdom it is easily seen that this thought if it is to be applied to any object my self cannot contain any but transcendental predicates because the smallest empirical predicate would spoil the rational purity of the science and its independence of all experience we shall therefore follow the thread of the     categories with this difference however that as here the first thing which is given is a thing the i a thinking being we must begin with the category of substance by which a thing in itself is represented and then proceed backwards though without changing the respective order of the categories as given before in our table the topic of the rational science of the soul from which has to be derived whatever else that science may contain is therefore the following      i   the soul is substance  ii  iii as regards its quality simple  as regards the different times in which it exists numerically identical that is unity not plurality  iv   it is in relation to possible objects in space    the reader who may not guess at once the psychological purport of these transcendental and abstract terms or understand why the latter attribute of the soul belongs to the category of existence will find their full explanation and justification in the sequel moreover i have to apologise for the many latin expressions which contrary to good taste have crept in instead of their native equivalents not only here but throughout the whole of the work my only excuse is that i thought it better to sacrifice something of the elegance of language rather than to throw any impediments in the way of real students by the use of inaccurate and obscure expressions all concepts of pure psychology arise from     these elements simply by way of combination and without the admixture of any other principle this substance taken simply as the object of the internal sense gives us the concept of immateriality and as simple substance that of incorruptibility its identity as that of an intellectual substance gives us personality and all these three together spirituality its relation to objects in space gives us the concept of commercium intercourse with bodies the pure psychology thus representing the thinking substance as the principle of life in matter that is as soul anima and as the ground of animality which again as restricted by spirituality gives us the concept of immortality to these concepts refer four paralogisms of a transcendental     psychology which is falsely supposed to be a science of pure reason concerning the nature of our thinking being we can however use as the foundation of such a science nothing but the single and in itself perfectly empty representation of the i of which     we cannot even say that it is a concept but merely a consciousness that accompanies all concepts by this i or he or it the thing which thinks nothing is represented beyond a transcendental subject of thoughts  x which is known only through the thoughts that are its predicates and of which apart from them we can never have the slightest concept so that we are really turning round it in a perpetual circle having already to use its representation before we can form any judgment about it and this inconvenience is really inevitable because consciousness in itself is not so much a representation distinguishing a particular object but really a form of representation in general in so far as it is to be called knowledge of which alone i can say that i think something by it it must seem strange however from the very beginning that the condition under which i think and which therefore is a property of my own subject only should be valid at the same time for everything which thinks and that depending on a proposition which seems to be empirical we should venture to found the apodictical and general judgment namely that everything which thinks is such as the voice of my own consciousness declares it to be within me the reason of it is that we are constrained to attribute a priori to things all the qualities which form the conditions under which alone     we are able to think them now it is impossible for me     to form the smallest representation of a thinking being by any external experience but i can do it through selfconsciousness only such objects therefore are nothing but a transference of my own consciousness to other things which thus and thus only can be represented as thinking beings the proposition i think is used in this case however as problematical only not so far as it may contain the perception of an existence the cartesian cogito ergo sum but with regard to its mere possibility in order to see what properties may be deduced from such a simple proposition with regard to its subject whether such subject exists or not if our knowledge of thinking beings in general so far as it is derived from pure reason were founded on more than the cogito and if we made use at the same time of observations on the play of our thoughts and the natural laws of the thinking self derived from them we should have before us an empirical psychology which would form a kind of physiology of the internal sense and perhaps explain its manifestations but would never help us to understand such properties as do not fall under any possible experience as for instance simplicity or to teach apodictically anything touching the nature of thinking beings in general it would not therefore be a rational psychology as the proposition i think taken problematically     contains the form of every possible judgment of the understanding and accompanies all categories as their vehicle it must be clear that the conclusions to be drawn from it can only contain a transcendental use of the understanding which declines all admixture of experience and of the achievements of which after what has been said before we cannot form any very favourable anticipations     we shall therefore follow it with a critical eye through all the predicaments of pure psychology  the first paralogism of substantiality that the representation of which is the absolute subject of our judgments and cannot be used therefore as the determination of any other thing is the substance i as a thinking being am the absolute subject of all my possible judgments and this representation of myself can never be used as the predicate of any other thing therefore i as a thinking being soul am substance criticism of the first paralogism of pure  psychology we showed in the analytical portion of transcendental logic that pure categories and among them that of substance have in themselves no objective meaning unless they rest on some intuition and are applied to     the manifold of such intuitions as functions of synthetical unity without this they are merely functions of a judgment without contents i may say of everything that it is a substance so far as i distinguish it from what are mere predicates and determinations now in all our thinking the i is the subject in which thoughts are inherent as determinations only nor can that i ever be used as a determination of any other thing thus everybody is constrained to look upon himself as the substance and on thinking as the accidents only of his being and determinations of his state     but what use are we to make of such a concept of a substance that i as a thinking being continue for myself and naturally neither arise nor perish is no legitimate deduction from it and yet this conclusion would be the only advantage that could be gained from the concept of the substantiality of my own thinking subject and but for that i could do very well without it so far from being able to deduce these properties from the pure category of substance we have on the contrary to observe the permanency of an object in our experience and then lay hold of this permanency if we wish to apply to it the empirically useful concept of substance in this case however we had no experience to lay hold of but have only formed a deduction from the concept   0 of the relation which all thinking has to the i as the common subject to which it belongs nor should we whatever we did succeed by any certain observation in proving such permanency for though the i exists in all thoughts not the slightest intuition is connected with that representation by which it might be distinguished from other objects of intuition we may very well perceive therefore that this representation appears again and again in every act of thought but not that it is a constant and permanent intuition in which thoughts as being changeable come and go hence it follows that in the first syllogism of transcendental psychology reason imposes upon us an apparent knowledge only by representing the constant logical subject of thought as the knowledge of the real subject in which that knowledge inheres of that subject however we have not and cannot have the slightest knowledge because consciousness is that which alone changes representations     into thoughts and in which therefore as the transcendental subject all our perceptions must be found beside this logical meaning of the i we have no knowledge of the subject in itself which forms the substratum and foundation of it and of all our thoughts in spite of this the proposition that the soul is a substance may well be allowed to stand if only we see that this concept cannot help us on in the least or teach us any of the ordinary conclusions of rationalising psychology as for     instance the everlasting continuance of the soul amid all changes and even in death and that it therefore signifies a substance in idea only and not in reality the second paralogism of simplicity everything the action of which can never be considered as the concurrence of several acting things is simple now the soul or the thinking i is such a thing — therefore etc criticism of the second paralogism of transcendental psychology this is the strong yet not invulnerable syllogism among all dialectical syllogisms of pure psychology not a mere sophism contrived by a dogmatist in order to impart a certain plausibility to his assertions but a syllogism which seems able to stand the sharpest examination and the gravest doubts of the philosopher it is this — every composite substance is an aggregate of many substances and the action of something composite or that which is inherent in it as such is an aggregate of many actions or accidents distributed among many substances     an effect due to the concurrence of many acting substances is no doubt possible if that effect is     external only as for instance the motion of a body is the combined motion of all its parts the case is different however with thoughts if considered as accidents belonging to a thinking being within for suppose it is the composite which thinks then every part of it would contain a part of the thought and all together only the whole of it this however is selfcontradictory for as representations distributed among different beings like the single words of a verse never make a whole thought a verse it is impossible that a thought should be inherent in something composite as such thought therefore is possible only in a substance which is not an aggregate of many and therefore absolutely simple  what is called the nervus probandi in this argument lies in the proposition that in order to constitute a thought the many representations must be comprehended under the absolute unity of the thinking subject nobody however can prove this proposition from concepts for how would he undertake to do it the proposition     that a thought can only be the effect of the absolute unity of a thinking being cannot be considered as analytical for the unity of thought consisting of many representations is collective and may so far as mere concepts are concerned refer to the collective unity of all cooperating substances as the movement of a body is the compound movement of all its parts quite as well as to the absolute unity of the subject according to the rule of identity     it would be impossible therefore to establish the necessity of the presupposition of a simple substance the thought being composite that on the other hand such a proposition might be established synthetically and entirely a priori from mere concepts no one will venture to affirm who has once understood the grounds on which the possibility of synthetical propositions a priori rests as explained by us before it is likewise impossible however to derive this necessary unity of the subject as the condition of the possibility of the unity of every thought from experience for experience never supplies any necessity of thought much less the concept of absolute unity whence then do we take that proposition on which the whole psychological syllogism of reason rests it is manifest that if we wish to represent to ourselves a thinking being we must put ourselves in its place and supplant as it were the object which has to be considered by our own subject which never happens in any     other kind of investigation the reason why we postulate for every thought absolute unity of the subject is because otherwise we could not say of it i think the manifold in one representation for although the whole of a thought may be divided and distributed under many subjects the subjective i can never thus be divided and distributed and it is this i which we presuppose in every thought as in the former paralogism therefore so here also the formal proposition of apperception i think remains the sole ground on which rational psychology ventures to undertake the extension of its knowledge that proposition however is no experience but only the form of     apperception inherent in and antecedent to every experience that is a purely subjective condition having reference to a possible experience only but by no means the condition of the possibility of the knowledge of objects and by no means necessary to the concept of a thinking being in general although it must be admitted that we cannot represent to ourselves another intelligent being without putting ourselves in its place with that formula of our consciousness nor is it true that the simplicity of my self as a soul is really deduced from the proposition i think for it is already involved in every thought itself the proposition i am simple must be considered as the immediate     expression of apperception and the socalled syllogism of cartesius cogito ergo sum is in reality tautological because cogito sum cogitans predicates reality immediately i am simple means no more than that this representation of i does not contain the smallest trace of manifoldness but is absolute although merely logical unity thus we see that the famous psychological argument is founded merely on the indivisible unity of a representation which only determines the verb with reference to a person and it is clear that the subject of inherence is designated transcendentally only by the i which accompanies the thought without our perceiving the smallest quality of it in fact without our knowing anything about it it signifies a something in general a transcendental subject the representation of which must no doubt be simple because nothing is determined in it and nothing can be represented more simple than by the concept of a mere something the simplicity however of the representation of a subject is not therefore a knowledge of the   0 simplicity of the subject because no account whatever is taken of its qualities when it is designated by the entirely empty expression i an expression that can be applied to every thinking subject so much is certain therefore that though i     always represent by the i an absolute but only logical unity of the subject simplicity i never know thereby the real simplicity of my subject we saw that the proposition i am a substance signified nothing but the mere category of which i must not make any use empirically in concreto in the same manner i may well say i am a simple substance that is a substance the representation of which contains no synthesis of the manifold but that concept or that proposition also teaches us nothing at all with reference to myself as an object of experience because the concept of substance itself is used as a function of synthesis only without any intuition to rest on and therefore without any object valid with reference to the condition of our knowledge only but not with reference to any object of it we shall test the usefulness of this proposition by an experiment everybody must admit that the assertion of the simple nature of the soul can only be of any value in so far as it enables me to distinguish the soul from all matter and thus to except it from that decay to which matter is at all times subject it is for that use that our proposition is really intended and it is therefore often expressed by the soul is not corporeal if then i can show that     although we allow to this cardinal proposition of rational psychology as a mere judgment of reason from pure categories all objective validity everything that thinks is simple substance we cannot make the least use of it     in order to establish the homogeneousness or nonhomogeneousness of soul and matter this will be the same as if i had relegated this supposed psychological truth to the field of mere ideas without any real or objective use we have irrefutably proved in the transcendental æsthetic that bodies are mere phenomena of our external sense not things by themselves we are justified therefore in saying that our thinking subject is not a body ie that because it is represented by us as an object of the internal sense it is so far as it thinks no object of our external senses and no phenomenon in space this means the same as that among external phenomena we can never have thinking beings as such or ever see their thoughts their consciousness their desires etc externally all this belongs to the internal sense this argument seems indeed so natural and popular that even the commonest understanding has always been led     to it the distinction between souls and bodies being of very early date but although extension impermeability cohesion and motion in fact everything that the external senses can give us cannot be thoughts feeling inclination and determination or contain anything like them being never objects of external intuition it might be possible nevertheless that that something which forms the foundation of external phenomena and which so affects our sense as to produce in it the representations of space matter form etc if considered as a noumenon or better as a transcendental object might be at the same time the subject of thinking although by the manner in which it affects our external sense it produces in us no intuitions of representations will etc but only of space and     its determinations this something however is not extended not impermeable not composite because such predicates concern sensibility only and its intuition whenever we are affected by these to us otherwise unknown objects these expressions however do not give us any information what kind of object it is but only that if considered by itself without reference to the external senses it has no right to these predicates peculiar to external appearance the predicates of the internal sense on the contrary such as representation thinking     etc are by no means contradictory to it so that really even if we admit the simplicity of its nature the human soul is by no means sufficiently distinguished from matter so far as its substratum is concerned if as it ought to be matter is considered as a phenomenon only if matter were a thing by itself it would as a composite being be totally different from the soul as a simple being but what we call matter is an external phenomenon only the substratum of which cannot possibly be known by any possible predicates i can therefore very well suppose that that substratum is simple although in the manner in which it affects our senses it produces in us the intuition of something extended and therefore composite so that the substance which with reference to our external sense possesses extension might very well by itself possess thoughts which can be represented consciously by its own internal sense in such wise the same thing which in one respect is called corporeal would in another respect be at the same time a thinking being of which though we cannot see its thoughts we can yet see the signs of them phenomenally thus the expression that souls only as a particular class of substances     think would have to be dropt and we should return to the common expression that men think that is   0 that the same thing which as an external phenomenon is extended is internally by itself a subject not composite but simple and intelligent but without indulging in such hypotheses we may make this general remark that if i understand by soul a being by itself the very question would be absurd whether the soul be homogeneous or not with matter which is not a thing by itself but only a class of representations within us for so much at all events must be clear that a thing by itself is of a different nature from the determinations which constitute its state only if on the contrary we compare the thinking i not with matter but with that object of the intellect that forms the foundation of the external phenomena which we call matter then it follows as we know nothing whatever of the matter that we have no right to say that the soul by itself is different from it in any respect the simple consciousness is not therefore a knowledge of the simple nature of our subject so that we might thus distinguish the soul from matter as a composite being if therefore in the only case where that concept might be useful namely in comparing myself with objects of external experience it is impossible to determine the peculiar and distinguishing characteristics of its nature what is the use if we pretend to know that the     thinking i or the soul a name for the transcendental object of the internal sense is simple such a proposition admits of no application to any real object and cannot therefore enlarge our knowledge in the least thus collapses the whole of rational psychology with     its fundamental support and neither here nor elsewhere can we hope by means of mere concepts still less through the mere subjective form of all our concepts that is through our consciousness and without referring these concepts to a possible experience to extend our knowledge particularly as even the fundamental concept of a simple nature is such that it can never be met with in experience so that no chance remains of arriving at it as a concept of objective validity the third paralogism of personality whatever is conscious of the numerical identity of its own self at different times is in so far a person now the soul etc therefore the soul is a person criticism of the third paralogism of transcendental psychology whenever i want to know by experience the numerical identity of an external object i shall have to     attend to what is permanent in that phenomenon to which as the subject everything else refers as determination and observe the identity of the former during the time that the latter is changing i myself however am an object of the internal sense and all time is but the form of the internal sense i therefore refer each and all of my successive determinations to the numerically identical self and this in all time that is in the form of the inner intuition of myself from this point of view the personality of the soul should not even be considered as inferred but     as an entirely identical proposition of selfconsciousness in time and that is indeed the reason why it is valid a priori for it really says no more than this that during the whole time while i am conscious of myself i am conscious of that time as belonging to the unity of myself and it comes to the same thing whether i say that this whole time is within me as an individual unity or that i with numerical identity am present in all that time in my own consciousness therefore the identity of person is inevitably present but if i consider myself from the point of view of another person as an object of his external intuition then that external observer considers me first of all in time for in the apperception time is really represented in me only though he admits therefore the i which at all times accompanies all representations in my consciousness and with     entire identity he will not yet infer from it the objective permanence of myself for as in that case the time in which the observer places me is not the time of my own but of his sensibility it follows that the identity which is connected with my consciousness is not therefore connected with his that is with the external intuition of my subject the identity of my consciousness at different times is therefore a formal condition only of my thoughts and their coherence and proves in no way the numerical identity of my subject in which in spite of the logical identity of the i such a change may have passed as to make it impossible to retain its identity though we may still attribute to it the same name of i which in every other state and even in the change of the subject might yet retain the thought     of the preceding and hand it over to the subsequent subject  although the teaching of some old schools     that everything is in a flux and nothing in the world permanent cannot be admitted if we admit substances yet it must not be supposed that it can be refuted by the unity of selfconsciousness for we ourselves cannot judge from our own consciousness whether as souls we are permanent or not because we reckon as belonging to our own identical self that only of which we are conscious and therefore are constrained to admit that during the whole time of which we are conscious we are one and the same from the point of view of a stranger however such a judgment would not be valid because perceiving in the soul no permanent phenomena except the representation of the i which accompanies and connects them all we cannot determine whether that i being a mere thought be not in the same state of flux as the other thoughts which are chained together by the i     it is curious however that the personality and what is presupposed by it namely the permanence and substantiality of the soul has now to be proved first for     if we could presuppose these there would follow if not the permanence of consciousness yet the possibility of a permanent consciousness in one and the same subject and this is sufficient to establish personality which does not cease at once because its effect is interrupted at the time this permanence however is by no means given us before the numerical identity of ourself which we infer from identical apperception but is itself inferred from it so that according to rule the concept of substance which alone is empirically useful would have to follow first upon it but as the identity of person follows by no means from the identity of the i in the consciousness of all time in which i perceive myself it follows that we could not have founded upon it the substantiality of the soul like the concept of substance and of the simple however the concept of personality also may remain so long as it is used as transcendental only that is as a concept of the unity of the subject which is otherwise unknown to us but in the determinations of which there is an uninterrupted connection by apperception in this sense such a concept is necessary for practical purposes and sufficient but we can never pride ourselves on it as helping to expand our knowledge of our self by means of     pure reason which only deceives us if we imagine that we can concluse an uninterrupted continuance of the subject from the mere concept of the identical self that concept is only constantly turning round itself in a circle and does not help us as with respect to any question which aims at synthetical knowledge what matter may be as a thing by itself a transcendental object is entirely unknown to us though we may observe its permanence as a phenomenon since it is represented as something external when     however i wish to observe the mere i during the change of all representations i have no other correlative for my comparisons but again the i itself with the general conditions of my consciousness i cannot therefore give any but tautological answers to all questions because i put my concept and its unity in the place of the qualities that belong to me as an object and thus really take for granted what was wished to be known the fourth paralogism of ideality with regard to external relations that the existence of which can only be inferred as a cause of given perceptions has a doubtful existence only —     all external phenomena are such that their existence cannot be perceived immediately but that we can only infer them as the cause of given perceptions — therefore the existence of all objects of the external senses is doubtful this uncertainty i call the ideality of external phenomena and the doctrine of that ideality is called idealism in comparison with which the other doctrine which maintains a possible certainty of the objects of the external senses is called dualism criticism of the fourth paralogism of transcendental psychology we shall first have to examine the premisses we are perfectly justified in maintaining that that only which is within ourselves can be perceived immediately and that my own existence only can be the object of a mere perception the existence of a real object therefore outside me     taking this word in its intellectual meaning can never be given directly in perception but can only be added in thought to the perception which is a modification of the internal sense and thus inferred as its external cause hence cartesius was quite right in limiting all perception in the narrowest sense to the proposition i as a thinking being am for it must be clear that as what     is without is not within me i cannot find it in my apperception nor hence in any perception which is in reality a determination of apperception only in the true sense of the word therefore i can never perceive external things but only from my own internal perception infer their existence taking the perception as an effect of which something external must be the proximate cause an inference however from a given effect to a definite cause is always uncertain because the effect may be due to more than one cause therefore in referring a perception to its cause it always remains doubtful whether that cause be internal or external whether in fact all socalled external perceptions are not a mere play of our external sense or point to real external objects as their cause at all events the existence of the latter is inferential only and liable to all the dangers of inferences while the object of the internal sense i myself with all my representations is perceived immediately and its existence cannot be questioned it must not be supposed therefore that an idealist is he who denies the existence of external objects of the senses all he does is to deny that it is known by immediate perception and to infer that we can never     become perfectly certain of their reality by any experience whatsoever  00 before i expose the deceptive illusion of our paralogism let me remark that we must necessarily distinguish two kinds of idealism the transcendental and the empirical transcendental idealism teaches that all phenomena are representations only not things by themselves and that space and time therefore are only sensuous forms of our intuition not determinations given independently by themselves or conditions of objects as things by themselves opposed to this transcendental idealism is a transcendental realism which considers space and time as something in itself independent of our sensibility thus the transcendental realist represents all external phenomena admitting their reality as things by themselves existing independently of us and our sensibility and therefore existing outside us also if regarded according to pure concepts of the understanding it is this transcendental realist who afterwards acts the empirical idealist and who after wrongly supposing that the objects of the senses if they are to be external must have an existence by themselves and without our senses yet from this point of view considers all our sensuous representations insufficient to render certain the reality of their objects the transcendental idealist on the contrary   0 may well be an empirical realist or as he is called a dualist that is he may admit the existence of matter without taking a step beyond mere selfconsciousness or admitting more than the certainty of representations within me that is the cogito ergo sum for as he considers matter and even its internal possibility as a phenomenon only which if separated from our sensibility is nothing matter with him is only a class of representations intuition which are called external not as if they  0  referred to objects external by themselves but because they refer perceptions to space in which everything is outside everything else while space itself is inside us we have declared ourselves from the very beginning in favour of this transcendental idealism in our system therefore we need not hesitate to admit the existence of matter on the testimony of mere selfconsciousness and to consider it as established by it ie the testimony in the same manner as the existence of myself as a thinking being i am conscious of my representations and hence they exist as well as i myself who has these representations external objects however bodies are phenomena only therefore nothing but a class of my representations the objects of which are something by means of these representations only and apart from them nothing     external things therefore exist by the same right as i myself both on the immediate testimony of my selfconsciousness with this difference only that the representation of myself as a thinking subject is referred to the internal sense only while the representations which indicate extended beings are referred to the external sense also with reference to the reality of external objects i need as little trust to inference as with reference to the reality of the object of my internal sense my thoughts both being nothing but representations the immediate perception consciousness of which is at the same time a sufficient proof of their reality the transcendental idealist is therefore an empirical realist and allows to matter as a phenomenon a reality which need not be inferred but may be immediately perceived the transcendental realism on the contrary is necessarily left in doubt and obliged to give way to  0  empirical idealism because it considers the objects of the external senses as something different from the senses themselves taking mere phenomena as independent beings existing outside us and while with the very best consciousness of our representation of these things it is far from certain that if a representation exists its corresponding object must exist also it is clear that in our system external things that is matter in all its shapes and changes are nothing but mere phenomena     that is representations within us of the reality of which we are immediately conscious as so far as i know all psychologists who believe in empirical idealism are transcendental realists they have acted no doubt quite consistently in ascribing great importance to empirical idealism as one of the problems from which human reason could hardly extricate itself for indeed if we consider external phenomena as representations produced inside us by their objects as existing as things by themselves outside us it is difficult to see how their existence could be known otherwise but through a syllogism from effect to cause where it must always remain doubtful whether the cause be within or without us now we may well admit that something which taken transcendentally is outside us may be the cause of our external intuitions but this can never be the object which we mean by the representations of matter and material things for these are phenomena only that is certain kinds of representations existing always within us and the reality of which depends on our immediate consciousness quite as much as the consciousness of my own thoughts the transcendental object is unknown equally in regard to internal and external intuition  0  of this however we are not speaking at     present but only of the empirical object which is called external if represented in space and internal when represented in temporal relations only both space and time being to be met with nowhere except in ourselves the expression outside us involves however an inevitable ambiguity because it may signify either something which as a thing by itself exists apart from us or what belongs to outward appearance only in order therefore to remove all uncertainty from that concept taken in the latter meaning which alone affects the psychological question as to the reality of our external intuition we shall distinguish empirically external objects from those that may be called so in a transcendental sense by calling the former simply things occurring in space space and time are no doubt representations a priori which dwell in us as forms of our sensuous intuition before any real object has determined our senses by means of sensation enabling them to represent the object under those sensuous conditions but this something material or real that is to be seen in space presupposes necessarily perception and cannot be fancied or produced by means of imagination without that perception which indicates the reality of something in space it is sensation therefore that indicates reality     in space and time according as it is related to the one or the other mode of sensuous intuition if sensation is once given which if referring to an object in general and not specialising it is called perception many an object may be put together in imagination from the manifold materials of perception which has no empirical place in space or time but in imagination only this admits of no doubt  0  whether we take the sensations of pain and pleasure or the external ones of colour heat etc it is always perception by which the material for thinking of any objects of external intuition must be first supplied this perception therefore to speak at present of external intuitions only represents something real in space for first perception is the representation of a reality while space is the representation of a mere possibility of coexistence secondly this reality is represented before the external sense that is in space thirdly space itself is nothing but mere representation so that nothing in it can be taken as real except what is represented in it  or vice versa whatever is given in it that is whatever     is represented in it by perception is also real in it because if it were not real in it that is given immediately by empirical intuition it could not be created by fancy the real of intuition being unimaginable a priori thus we see that all external perception proves immediately something real in space or rather is that real itself empirical realism is therefore perfectly true that is something real in space always corresponds to our external intuitions space itself it is true with all its phenomena as representations exists within me only but the real or the material of all objects of intuition is nevertheless given in that space independent of all fancy or  0  imagination nay it is impossible that in that space anything outside us in a transcendental sense could be given because space itself is nothing outside our sensibility the strictest idealist therefore can never require that we should prove that the object without us     in its true meaning corresponds to our perception for granted there are such objects they could never be represented and seen as outside us because this presupposes space and the reality in space as a mere representation is nothing but the perception itself it thus follows that what is real in external phenomena is real in perception only and cannot be given in any other way from such perceptions whether by mere play of fancy or by experience knowledge of objects can be produced and here no doubt deceptive representations may arise without truly corresponding objects the deception being due either to illusions of imagination in dreams or to a fault of judgment the socalled deceptions of the senses in order to escape from these false appearances one has to follow the rule that whatever is connected according to empirical laws with a perception is real this kind of illusion however and its prevention concerns idealism as well as dualism since it affects the form of experience only in order to refute empirical idealism and its unfounded misgivings as to the objective reality of our external perceptions it is sufficient to consider   that external perception proves immediately a reality in space which space though in itself a mere form of     representations possesses nevertheless objective reality with respect to all external phenomena which themselves are mere representations only   that without perception even the creations of fancy and dreams would not be possible  0  so that our external senses with reference to the data from which experience can spring must have real objects corresponding to them in space there are two kinds of idealists the dogmatic who denies the existence of matter and the sceptical who doubts it because he thinks it impossible to prove it at present we have nothing to do with the former who is an idealist because he imagines he finds contradictions in the possibility of matter in general this is a difficulty which we shall have to deal with in the following section on dialectical syllogisms treating of reason in its internal struggle with reference to the concepts of the possibility of all that belongs to the connection of experience the sceptical idealist on the contrary who attacks only the ground of our assertion and declares our conviction of the existence of matter which we founded on immediate perception as insufficient is in reality a benefactor of human reason because he obliges us even in the smallest matter of common experience to keep our eyes well     open and not to consider as a wellearned possession what may have come to us by mistake only we now shall learn to understand the great advantage of these idealistic objections they drive us by main force unless we mean to contradict ourselves in our most ordinary propositions to consider all perceptions whether we call them internal or external as a consciousness only of what affects our sensibility and to look on the external objects of them not as things by themselves but only as representations of which as of every other representation we can become immediately conscious and which are called external because they depend on what we call the external sense with its intuition of space space being itself nothing but  0  an internal kind of representation in which certain perceptions become associated if we were to admit external objects to be things by themselves it would be simply impossible to understand how we can arrive at a knowledge of their reality outside us considering that we always depend on representations which are inside us it is surely impossible that we should feel outside us and not inside us and the whole of our selfconsciousness cannot give us anything but our own determinations thus sceptical idealism forces us to take refuge in the only place that is left to us namely in the ideality of all phenomena the very ideality which though as yet unprepared for its consequences we established in our own transcendental æsthetic if     then we ask whether consequently dualism only must be admitted in psychology we answer certainly but only in its empirical acceptation in the connection of experience matter as the substance of phenomena is really given to the external sense in the same manner as the thinking i likewise as the substance of phenomena is given to the internal sense and it is according to the rules which this category introduces into the empirical connection of our external as well as internal perceptions that phenomena on both sides must be connected among themselves if on the contrary as often happens we were to extend the concept of dualism and take it in its transcendental acceptation then neither it nor on one side the pneumatism or on the other side the materialism which are opposed to dualism would have the smallest foundation we should have missed the determination of our concepts and have mistaken the difference in our mode of representing objects which with regard to what  0  they are in themselves remain always unknown to us for a difference of the things themselves no doubt i as represented by the internal sense in time and objects in space outside me are two specifically different phenomena but they are not therefore conceived as different things the transcendental object which forms the foundation of external phenomena and the other which forms the foundation of our internal intuition is therefore   0 neither matter nor a thinking being by itself but simply an unknown cause of phenomena which supply to us the empirical concept of both if therefore as evidently forced to do by this very criticism we remain faithful to the old rule never to push questions beyond where possible experience can supply us with an object we shall never dream of going beyond the objects of our senses and asking what they may be by themselves that is without any reference to our senses but if the psychologist likes to take phenomena for things by themselves then whether he admit into his system as a materialist matter only or as a spiritualist thinking beings only according to the form of our own internal sense or as a dualist both as things existing in themselves he will always be driven by his mistake to invent theories as to how that which is not a thing by itself but a phenomenon only could exist by itself consideration on the whole of pure psychology as affected by these paralogisms    if we compare the science of the soul as the physiology of the internal sense with the science of the body as a physiology of the objects of external senses we find  0  besides many things which in both must be known empirically this important difference that in the latter many things can be known a priori from the mere concept of an extended and impermeable being while in the former nothing can be known a priori and synthetically from the concept of a thinking being the cause is this though both are phenomena yet the phenomena of the external sense have something permanent which suggests a substratum of varying determinations and consequently a synthetical concept namely that of space and of a phenomenon in space while time the only form of our internal intuition has nothing permanent and makes us to know the change of determinations only but not the determinable object for in what we call soul there is a continuous flux and nothing permanent except it may be if people will so have it the simple i so simple because this representation has no contents consequently nothing manifold so that it seems to represent or more accurately to indicate a simple     object this i or ego would have to be an intuition which being presupposed in all thought before all experience might as an intuition a priori supply synthetical propositions if it should be possible to get any knowledge by pure reason of the nature of a thinking being in general but this i is neither an intuition nor a concept of any object but the mere form of consciousness which can accompany both classes of representations and impart to them the character of knowledge provided something else be given in intuition which supplies matter for a representation of an object thus we see that the whole of rational psychology is impossible as transcending the powers of human reason and   0 nothing remains to us but to study our soul under the guidance of experience and to keep ourselves within the limits of questions which do not go beyond the line where the material can be supplied by possible internal experience but although rational psychology is of no use in extending our knowledge but as such is made up of paralogisms only we cannot deny to it an important negative utility if it does not pretend to be more than a critical investigation of our dialectical syllogisms as framed by our common and natural reason what purpose can be served by psychology     founded on pure principles of reason its chief purpose is meant to be to guard our thinking self against the danger of materialism this purpose however is answered as we have shown by the concept which reason gives of our thinking self for so far from there being any fear lest if matter be taken away all thought and even the existence of thinking beings might vanish it has been on the contrary clearly shown that if we take away the thinking subject the whole material world would vanish because it is nothing but a phenomenon in the sensibility of our own subject and a certain class of its representations it is true that i do not know thus this thinking self any better according to its qualities nor can i perceive its permanence or even the independence of its existence from the problematical transcendental substratum of external phenomena both being necessarily unknown to us but as it is nevertheless possible that i may find reason from other than purely speculative causes to hope for an independent and during every possible     change of my states permanently abiding existence of my thinking nature much is gained if though i freely confess my own ignorance i can nevertheless repel the dogmatical attacks of a speculative opponent     showing to him that he can never know more of the nature of the subject in order to deny the possibility of my expectations than i can know in order to cling to them three dialectical questions which form the real object of all rational psychology are founded on this transcendental illusion of our psychological concepts and cannot be answered except by means of the considerations in which we have just been engaged namely   the question of the possibility of the association of the soul with an organic body that is of animality and the state of the soul in the life of man   the question of the beginning of that association of the soul at the time and before the time of our birth   the question of the end of that association of the soul at and after the time of death immortality what i maintain is that all the difficulties which we imagine to exist in these questions and with which as dogmatical objections people wish to give themselves an air of deeper insight into the nature of things than the common understanding can ever claim rest on a mere illusion which leads us to hypostasise what exists in thought only and to accept it in the same quality in which it is thought as a real object outside the thinking subject taking in fact extension which is phenomenal only for a quality of external things existing     without our sensibility also and movement as their effect taking place by itself also and independently of our     senses for matter the association of which with the soul causes so much misgiving is nothing but a mere orm or a certain mode of representing an unknown object by that intuition which we call the external sense there may therefore well be something outside us to which the phenomenon which we call matter corresponds though in its quality of phenomenon it cannot be outside us but merely as a thought within us although that thought represents it through the external sense as existing outside us matter therefore does not signify a class of substances totally heterogeneous and different from the object of the internal sense the soul but only the different nature of the phenomenal appearance of objects in themselves unknown to us the representations of which we call external as compared with those which we assign to the internal sense although like other thoughts those external representations also belong to the thinking subject only they possess however this illusion that as they represent objects in space they seem to separate themselves from the soul and to move outside it although even the space in which they are seen is nothing but a representation of which no homogeneous original can ever be found outside the soul the question therefore is no longer as to the possibility of an association of the soul with other known and foreign     substances outside us but only as to the connection of the representations of the internal sense with the modifications of our external sensibility and how these can be connected with each other according to constant laws and acquire cohesion in experience so long as we connect internal and external phenomena with each other as mere representations in our experience     there is nothing irrational nor anything to make the association of both senses to appear strange as soon however as we hypostatise the external phenomena looking upon them no longer as representations but as things existing by themselves and outside us with the same quality in which they exist inside us and referring to our own thinking subject their acts which they as phenomena show in their mutual relation the effective causes outside us assume a character which will not harmonise with their effects within us because that character refers to the external senses only but the effects to the internal sense both being entirely unhomogeneous though united in the same subject we then have no other external effects but changes of place and no forces but tendencies which have for their effects relations in space only within us on the contrary those effects are mere thoughts without any relations of space movement shape or local     determination between them and we entirely lose the thread of the causes in the effects which ought to show themselves in the internal sense we ought to consider therefore that bodies are not objects by themselves which are present to us but a mere appearance of we do not know what unknown object and that movement likewise is not the effect of that unknown cause but only the appearance of its influence on our senses both are not something outside us but only representation within us and consequently it is not the movement of matter which produces representations within us but that motion itself and matter also which makes itself known through it is representation only our whole selfcreated difficulty turns on this how and why the representations of our sensibility are so connected with each other that those     which we call external intuitions can according to empirical laws be represented as objects outside us a question which is entirely free from the imagined difficulty of explaining the origin of our representations from totally heterogeneous efficient causes existing outside us the confusion arising from our mistaking the phenomenal appearance of an unknown cause for the very cause outside us in judgments in which there is a misapprehension confirmed by long habit it is impossible to bring its correction at once to that clearness which can be     produced in other cases where no inevitable illusion confuses our concept our attempt therefore at freeing reason from these sophistical theories can hardly claim as yet that perspicuity which would render it perfectly satisfactory i hope however to arrive at greater lucidity in the following manner all objections may be divided into dogmatical critical and sceptical the dogmatical attacks the proposition the critical the proof of a proposition the former presupposes an insight into the peculiar nature of the object in order to be able to assert the contrary of what the proposition asserts it is therefore itself dogmatical and pretends to know the peculiar nature of the object in question better than the opponent the critical objection as it says nothing about the worth or worthlessness of the proposition and attacks the proof only need not know the object itself better or claim a better knowledge of it all it wants to show is that a proposition is not well grounded not that it is false the sceptical objection lastly places assertion and denial side by side as of equal value taking one or the other now as dogma and now as denial and being thus in appearance dogmatical     on both sides it renders every judgment     on the object impossible both the dogmatical and sceptical objections must pretend to so much knowledge of their object as is necessary in order to assert or deny anything about it the critical objection on the contrary wishes only to show that something purely futile and fanciful has been used in support of a proposition and thus upsets a theory by depriving it of its pretended foundation without wishing to establish itself anything else about the nature of the object according to the ordinary concepts of our reason with regard to the association between our thinking subject and the things outside us we are dogmatical and look upon them as real objects existing independently of ourselves in accordance with a certain transcendental dualism which does not reckon external phenomena as representations belonging to the subject but places them as they are given us in sensuous intuition as objects outside us and entirely separated from the thinking subject this mere assumption is the foundation of all theories on the association between soul and body it is never asked whether this objective reality of phenomena is absolutely true but it is taken for granted and the only question seems to be how it is to be explained and understood the three systems which are commonly suggested   0 and which in fact are alone possible are those  st of physical influence  nd of preestablished harmony and  rd of supernatural assistance the second and third explanations of the association between soul and matter arise from objections to the first which is that of the ordinary understanding the objection being that what appears as matter cannot by its immediate     influence be the cause of representations these being a totally heterogeneous class of effects those who start this objection cannot understand by the objects of the external senses matter conceived as phenomenon only and therefore itself a mere representation produced by whatever external objects for in that case they would really say that the representations of external objects phenomena cannot be the external causes of the representations in our mind which would be a meaningless objection because nobody would think of taking for an external cause what he knows to be a mere representation according to our principles the object of their theory can only be that that which is the true transcendental object of our external senses cannot be the cause of those representations phenomena which we mean by the name of matter as no one has any right to say that he     knows anything of the transcendental cause of the representations of our external senses their assertion is entirely groundless and if the pretended reformers of the doctrine of physical influence represent according to the ordinary views of transcendental dualism matter as such as a thing by itself not simply as a mere phenomenal appearance of an unknown thing and then proceed in their objections to show that such an external object which shows no causality but that of movements can never be the efficient cause of representations but that a third being must intervene in order to produce if not reciprocal action at least correspondence and harmony between the two they would really begin their refutation by admitting in their dualism the πρωˆτον ψενˆδος of a physical influence and thus refute by their objection not so much the physical influence as their own dualistic     premisses for all the difficulties with regard to a possible connection between a thinking nature and matter arise without exception from that too readily admitted dualistic representation namely that matter as such is not phenomenal that is a mere representation of the mind to which an unknown object corresponds but the object itself such as it exists outside us and independent of all sensibility     it is impossible therefore to start a dogmatical objection against the commonly received theory of a physical influence for if the opponent were to say that matter and its movements are purely phenomenal and therefore mere representations the only difficulty remaining to him would be that the unknown object of our senses could not be the cause of our representations and this he has no right to say because no one is able to determine what an unknown object may or may not be able to effect and according to our former arguments he must necessarily admit this transcendental idealism unless he wishes to hypostasise mere representations and place them outside himself as real things what is quite possible however is to raise a wellfounded critical objection to the commonly received opinion of a physical influence for the pretended association between two kinds of substances the one thinking the other extended rests on a coarse dualism and changes the latter though they are nothing but representations of the thinking subject into things existing by themselves thus the misunderstood physical influence may be entirely upset by showing that the proof which was to establish it was surreptitiously obtained and therefore valueless the notorious problem therefore as to a possible association     between the thinking and the extended would when all that is purely imaginative is deducted     come to this how external intuition namely that of space or what fills space namely form and movement is possible in any thinking subject to this question however no human being can return an answer and instead of attempting to fill this gap in our knowledge all we can do is to indicate it by ascribing external phenomena to a transcendental object as the cause of this class of representations but which we shall never know nor be able to form any concept of in all practical questions we treat phenomena as objects by themselves without troubling ourselves about the first cause of their possibility as phenomena but as soon as we go beyond the concept of a transcendental object becomes inevitable the decision of all the discussions on the state of a thinking being before this association with matter life or after the ceasing of such association death depends on the remarks which we have just made on the association between the thinking and the extended the opinion that the thinking subject was able to think before any association with bodies would assume the following form that before the beginning of that kind of sensibility     through which something appears to us in space the same transcendental objects which in our present state appear as bodies could have been seen in a totally different way the other opinion that after the cessation of its association with the material world the soul could continue to think would be expressed as follows that if that kind of sensibility through which transcendental and for the present entirely unknown objects appear to us as a material world should cease it would not follow that     thereby all intuition of them would be removed it being quite possible that the same unknown objects should continue to be known by the thinking subject although no longer in the quality of bodies now it is quite true that no one can produce from speculative principles the smallest ground for such an assertion or do more than presuppose its possibility but neither can any valid dogmatical objection be raised against it for whoever would attempt to do so would know neither more nor less than i myself or anybody else about the absolute and internal cause of external and material phenomena as he cannot pretend to know on what the reality of external phenomena in our present state in life really rests neither can he know that the condition of all external intuition or the thinking subject itself will cease after this state in death     we thus see that all the wrangling about the nature of a thinking being and its association with the material world arises simply from our filling the gap due to our ignorance with paralogisms of reason and by changing thoughts into things and hypostasising them on this an imaginary science is built up both by those who assert and by those who deny some pretending to know about objects of which no human being has any conception while others make their own representations to be objects all turning round in a constant circle of ambiguities and contradictions nothing but a sober strict and just criticism can free us of this dogmatical illusion which through theories and systems deceives so many by an imaginary happiness it alone can limit our speculative pretensions to the sphere of possible experience and this not by a shallow scoffing at repeated failures or by   0 pious sighs over the limits of our reason but by a demarcation made according to wellestablished principles writing the nihil ulterius with perfect assurance on those herculean columns which nature herself has erected in order that the voyage of our reason should be continued so far only as the continuous shores of experience extend — shores which we can never forsake without     being driven upon a boundless ocean which after deceiving us again and again makes us in the end cease all our laborious and tedious endeavours as perfectly hopeless                                     we have yet to give a general and clear investigation of the transcendental and yet natural illusion produced by the paralogisms of pure reason and the justification of our systematical arrangement of them which ran parallel with the table of the categories we could not have done this at the beginning of this section without running the risk of becoming obscure or inconveniently anticipating our arguments we shall now try to fulfil our duty all illusion may be explained as mistaking the subjective condition of thought for the knowledge of the object in the introduction to the transcendental dialectic we showed that pure reason is occupied exclusively with the totality of the synthesis of conditions belonging to anything conditioned now as the dialectical illusion of pure reason cannot be an empirical illusion such as occurs in certain empirical kinds of knowledge it can refer only to the conditions of thought in general so that there can     only be three cases of the dialectical use of pure reason—   the synthesis of the conditions of a thought in general   the synthesis of the conditions of empirical thought       the synthesis of the conditions of pure thought in every one of these three cases pure reason is occupied only with the absolute totality of that synthesis that is with that condition which is itself unconditioned it is on this division also that the threefold transcendental illusion is founded which leads to three subdivisions of the dialectic and to as many pretended sciences flowing from pure reason namely transcendental psychology cosmology and theology we are at present concerned with the first only as in thinking in general we take no account of the relation of our thoughts to any object whether of the senses or of the pure understanding what is called   the synthesis of the conditions of a thought in general is not objective at all but only a synthesis of thought with the subject which synthesis is wrongly taken for the synthetical representation of an object it follows from this that the dialectical conclusion as to the condition of all thought in general which condition itself is unconditioned does not involve a fault in its contents for it ignores all contents or objects but only a fault in form and must therefore be called a     paralogism as moreover the only condition which accompanies all thought is the i in the general proposition i think reason has really to deal with this condition so far as that condition is itself unconditioned it is however a formal condition only namely the logical unity of every thought no account being taken of any object but it is represented nevertheless as an object which i think namely as the i itself and its unconditioned unity if i were asked what is the nature of a thing which     thinks i could not give any answer a priori for the answer ought to be synthetical as an analytical answer might explain perhaps the meaning of the term thought but could never add any real knowledge of that on which the possibility of thought depends for a synthetical solution however we should require intuition and this has been entirely left out of account in the general form given to our problem it is equally impossible to answer the general question what is the nature of a thing which is moveable because in that case the impermeable extension matter is not given but although i have no answer to return to that question in general it might seem that i could answer it in a special case namely in the proposition which expresses the selfconsciousness i think for this i is the first subject ie substance     it is simple etc these however ought then to be propositions of experience which nevertheless without a general rule containing the conditions of the possibility of thought in general and a priori could not contain such predicates which are not empirical this consideration makes our knowledge of the nature of a thinking being derived from pure concepts which seemed at first so plausible extremely suspicious though we have not yet discovered the place where the fault really lies a further investigation however of the origin of the attributes which i predicate of myself as a thinking being in general may help us to discover the fault they are no more than pure categories by which i can never think a definite object but only the unity of the representations which is requisite in order to determine an object without a previous intuition no category by itself can give me a concept of an object for by intuition alone the object is     given which afterwards is thought in accordance with a category in order to declare a thing to be a substance in phenomenal appearance predicates of its intuition must first be given to me in which i may distinguish the permanent from the changeable and the substratum the thing in itself from that which is merely inherent  00 in it if i call a thing simple as a phenomenon what i mean is that its intuition is a part of phenomenal appearance but cannot itself be divided into parts etc but if i know something to be simple by a concept only and not by phenomenal appearance i have really no knowledge whatever of the object but only of my concept which i make to myself of something in general that is incapable of any real intuition i only say that i think something as perfectly simple because i have really nothing to say of it except that it is something now the mere apperception the i is substance in concept simple in concept etc and so far all the psychological propositions of which we spoke before are incontestably true nevertheless what we really wish to know of the soul becomes by no means known to us in that way because all those predicates are with regard to intuition nonvalid entailing no consequences with regard to objects of experience and therefore entirely empty for that concept of substance does not teach me that the soul continues by itself or that it is a part of external intuitions which itself cannot be resolved into parts and cannot therefore arise or perish by any changes of nature these are qualities which would make the soul known to us in its connection with experience and might give us an insight into its origin and future state but  0  if i say by means of the category only that the soul is     a simple substance it is clear that the bare rational concept of substance contains nothing beyond the thought that a thing should be represented as a subject in itself without becoming in turn a predicate of anything else nothing can be deduced from this with regard to the permanence of the i nor can the attribute of simplicity add that of permanence nor can we thus learn anything whatsoever as to the fate of the soul in the revolutions of the world if anybody could tell us that the soul is a simple part of matter we might with the help of experience deduce from this the permanence and on account of its simple nature the indestructibility of the soul but of all this the concept of the i in the psychological proposition of i think tells us nothing the reason why that being which thinks within us imagines that it knows itself by means of pure categories and especially by that which expresses absolute unity under each head is this the apperception itself is the ground of the possibility of the categories and these represent nothing but the synthesis of the manifold in intuition so far as it has unity in apperception selfconsciousness therefore is the representation of that which forms the condition of all unity and is itself unconditioned one may therefore say of the thinking  0  i the soul which represents itself as substance simple numerically identical in all time and as the correlative of all existence from which in fact all other existence must be concluded that it does not know itself through the categories but knows the categories only and through them all objects in the absolute unity of apperception that is through itself it may seem no doubt selfevident that i cannot know as an object that which is presupposed in     order to enable me to know an object and that the determining self thought differs from the self that is to be determined the thinking subject like knowledge from its object nevertheless nothing is more natural or at least more tempting than the illusion which makes us look upon the unity in the synthesis of thoughts as a perceived unity in the subject of thoughts one might call it the surreptitious admission of an hypostasised consciousness apperceptionis substantiatae if we want to have a logical term for the paralogism in the dialectical syllogisms of rational psychology based on perfectly correct premisses it might be called a sophisma figurae dictionis in the major we use the category with reference to its condition transcendentally only in the minor and in the conclusion we use the same category with reference to the soul which is to be comprehended  0  under that condition empirically thus in the paralogism of substantiality  the concept of substance is a purely intellectual concept which without the conditions of sensuous intuition admits of a transcendental use only that is of no use at all in the minor however we refer the same concept to the object of all internal experience though without having previously established the condition of its application in concreto namely its permanence we thus are making an empirical and therefore entirely inadmissible use of it lastly in order to show the systematical connection of all these dialectical propositions of a rationalising psychology according to their connection in pure reason and thus to establish their completeness it should be     remarked that the apperception is carried through all the classes of the categories but only with reference to those concepts of the understanding which in each of them formed a foundation of unity for the others in a possible perception namely subsistence reality unity not plurality and existence all of which are here represented by reason as conditions themselves unconditioned of the possibility of a thinking being thus the soul knows in itself —  ip  0    the unconditioned unity of the relation that is itself not as inherent but as subsisting  ii  iii the unconditioned unity of quality that is not as a real whole but as simple   the unconditioned unity in the manifoldness of time that is not as at different times numerically different but as one and the same subject  iv   the unconditioned unity of existence in space that is not as the consciousness of many things outside it but as the consciousness of the existence of itself only and of other things merely as its representations   how the simple can again correspond to the category of reality cannot yet be explained here but will be shown in the following chapter when another use has to be discussed which reason makes of the same concept     reason is the faculty of principles the statements  0  of pure psychology do not contain empirical predicates of the soul but such as if they exist are meant to determine the object by itself independent of all experience and therefore by a pure reason only they ought therefore to rest on principles and on general concepts of thinking beings instead of this we find that a single representation i think  governs them all a representation which for the very reason that it expresses the pure formula of all my experience indefinitely claims to be a general proposition applicable to all thinking beings and though single in all respects has the appearance of an absolute unity of the conditions of thought in general thus stretching far beyond the limits of possible experience     chapter ii the antinomy of pure reason in the introduction to this part of our work we showed that all the transcendental illusion of pure reason depended on three dialectical syllogisms the outline of which is supplied to us by logic in the three formal kinds of the ordinary syllogism in about the same way in which the logical outline of the categories was derived from the  0  four functions of all judgments the first class of these rationalising syllogisms aimed at the unconditioned unity of the subjective conditions of all representations of the subject or the soul as corresponding to the categorical syllogisms of reason the major of which as the principle asserts the relation of a predicate to a subject the second class of the dialectical arguments will therefore in analogy with the hypothetical syllogisms take for its object the unconditioned unity of the objective conditions in phenomenal appearance while the third class which has to be treated in the following chapter will be concerned with the unconditioned unity of the objective conditions of the possibility of objects in general     it is strange however that a transcendental paralogism caused a onesided illusion only with regard to our idea of the subject of our thought and that it is impossible to find in mere concepts of reason the slightest excuse for maintaining the contrary all the advantage is on the side of pneumatism although it cannot hide the hereditary taint by which it evaporates into nought when subjected to the ordeal of our critique the case is totally different when we apply reason to the objective synthesis of phenomena here reason tries at first with great plausibility to establish its principle  0  of unconditioned unity but becomes soon entangled in so many contradictions that it must give up its pretensions with regard to cosmology also for here we are met by a new phenomenon in human reason namely a perfectly natural antithetic which is not produced by any artificial efforts but into which reason falls by itself and inevitably reason is no doubt preserved thereby from the slumber of an imaginary conviction which is often produced by a purely onesided illusion but it is tempted at the same time either to abandon itself to sceptical despair or to assume a dogmatical obstinacy taking its stand on certain assertions without granting a hearing and doing justice to the arguments of the opponent in both cases a deathblow is dealt to sound philosophy although in the former we might speak of the euthanasia of pure reason before showing the scenes of discord and confusion produced by the conflict of the laws antinomy of pure reason we shall have to make a few remarks in order to explain and justify the method which we mean to follow in the treatment of this subject i shall call all transcendental   0 ideas so far as they relate to the absolute totality in the synthesis of phenomena cosmical concepts  0  partly because of even this unconditioned totality on which the concept of the cosmical universe also rests which is itself an idea only partly because they refer to the synthesis of phenomena only which is empirical while the absolute totality in the synthesis of the conditions of all possible things must produce an ideal of pure reason totally different from the cosmical concept although in a certain sense related to it as therefore the paralogisms of pure reason formed the foundation for a dialectical psychology the antinomy of pure reason will place before our eyes the transcendental principles of a pretended pure rational cosmology not in order to show that it is valid and can be accepted but as may be guessed from the very name of the antinomy of reason in order to expose it as an idea surrounded by deceptive and false appearances and utterly irreconcileable with phenomena section i system of cosmological ideas before we are able to enumerate these ideas according to a principle and with systematic precision we must bear in mind  st that pure and transcendental concepts arise from the understanding only and that reason does not  0  in reality produce any concept but only frees it may be the concept of the understanding of the inevitable limitation     of a possible experience and thus tries to enlarge it beyond the limits of experience yet in connection with it reason does this by demanding for something that is given as conditioned absolute totality on the side of the conditions under which the understanding subjects all phenomena to the synthetical unity it thus changes the category into a transcendental idea in order to give absolute completeness to the empirical synthesis by continuing it up to the unconditioned which can never be met with in experience but in the idea only in doing this reason follows the principle that if the conditioned is given the whole sum of conditions and therefore the absolutely unconditioned must be given likewise the former being impossible without the latter hence the transcendental ideas are in reality nothing but categories enlarged till they reach the unconditioned and those ideas must admit of being arranged in a table according to the titles of the categories  ndly not all categories will lend themselves to this but those only in which the synthesis constitutes a series and a series of subordinated not of coordinated conditions absolute totality is demanded by reason   0 with regard to an ascending series of conditions only not therefore when we have to deal with a descending line of consequences or with an aggregate of coordinated conditions for with reference to something given as conditioned conditions are presupposed and considered as given with it while on the other hand as consequences do not render their conditions possible but rather presuppose them we need not in proceeding to the consequences or in descending from any given condition to the conditioned trouble ourselves whether the series comes to an     end or not the question as to their totality being in fact no presupposition of reason whatever thus we necessarily conceive time past up to a given moment as given even if not determinable by us but with regard to time future which is not a condition of arriving at time present it is entirely indifferent if we want to conceive the latter what we may think about the former whether we take it as coming to an end somewhere or as going on to infinity let us take the series m n o where n is given as conditioned by m and at the same time as a condition of o let that series ascend from the conditioned n to its condition m l k i etc and descend from the condition n to the conditioned o p q r etc i must then presuppose the former series in order to take n as given and according to reason the totality of conditions n is possible only by means of that series while its possibility depends in no way on the     subsequent series o p q r which therefore cannot be considered as given but only as dabilis capable of being given i shall call the synthesis of a series on the side of the conditions beginning with the one nearest to a given phenomenon and advancing to the more remote conditions regressive the other which on the side of the conditioned advances from the nearest effect to the more remote ones progressive the former proceeds in antecedentia the second in consequentia cosmological ideas therefore being occupied with the totality of regressive synthesis proceed in antecedentia not in consequentia if the latter should take place it would be a gratuitous not a necessary problem of pure reason because for a complete comprehension of what is given us in experience we want to know the causes but not the effects     in order to arrange a table of ideas in accordance with the table of the categories we must take first the two original quanta of all our intuition time and space time is in itself a series and the formal condition of all series and in it therefore with reference to any given present we have to distinguish a priori the antecedentia as conditions the past from the consequentia the future hence the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of     the series of conditions of anything conditioned refers to time past only the whole of time past is looked upon according to the idea of reason as a necessary condition of the given moment with regard to space there is in it no difference between progressus and regressus because all its parts exist together and form an aggregate but no series we can look upon the present moment with reference to time past as conditioned only but never as condition because this moment arises only through time past or rather through the passing of antecedent time but as the parts of space are not subordinate to one another but coordinate no part of it is in the condition of the possibility of another nor does it like time constitute a series in itself nevertheless the synthesis by which we apprehend the many parts of space is successive takes place in time and contains a series and as in that series of aggregated spaces as for instance of feet in a rood the spaces added to a given space are always the condition of the limit of the preceding spaces we ought to consider the measuring of a space also as a synthesis of a series of conditions of something given as conditioned with this difference only that the side of the     conditions is by itself not different from the other side which comprehends the conditioned so that regressus and     progressus seem to be the same in space as however every part of space is limited only and not given by another we must look upon every limited space as conditioned also so far as it presupposes another space as the condition of its limit and so on with reference to limitation therefore progressus in space is also regressus and the transcendental idea of the absolute totality of the synthesis in the series of conditions applies to space also i may ask then for the absolute totality of phenomena in space quite as well as in time past though we must wait to see whether an answer is ever possible secondly reality in space that is matter is something conditioned the parts of which are its internal conditions and the parts of its parts its remoter conditions we have therefore here a regressive synthesis the absolute totality of which is demanded by reason but which cannot take place except by a complete division whereby the reality of matter dwindles away into nothing or into that at least which is no longer matter namely the simple consequently we have here also a series of conditions and a progress to the unconditioned thirdly when we come to the categories of the real relation between phenomena we find that the     category of substance with its accidents does not lend itself to a transcendental idea that is reason has here no inducement to proceed regressively to conditions we know that accidents so far as they inhere in one and the same substance are coordinated with each other and do not constitute a series and with reference to the substance they are not properly subordinate to it but are the mode of existence of the substance itself the concept of the substantial might seem to be here an idea of trancendental     reason this however signifies nothing but the concept of the object in general which subsists so far as we think in it the transcendental subject only without any predicates and as we are here speaking only of the unconditioned in the series of phenomena it is clear that the substantial cannot be a part of it the same applies to substances in community which are aggregates only without having an exponent of a series since they are not subordinate to each other as conditions of their possibility in the same way as spaces were the limits of which can never be determined by itself but always through another space there remains therefore only the category of causality which offers a series of causes to a given effect enabling us to ascend from the latter as the conditioned to the former as the conditions and thus to answer the question of reason     fourthly the concepts of the possible the real and the necessary do not lead to any series except so far as the accidental in existence must always be considered as conditioned and point according to a rule of the understanding to a condition which makes it necessary to ascend to a higher condition till reason finds at last only in the totality of that series the unconditioned necessity which it requires if therefore we select those categories which necessarily imply a series in the synthesis of the manifold we shall have no more than four cosmological ideas accordto the four titles of the categories  i   absolute completeness of the composition of the given whole of all phenomena      ii  iii absolute completeness of the division of a given whole in phenomenal appearance  absolute completeness of the origination of a phenomenon in general  iv   absolute completeness of the dependence of the existence of the changeable in phenomenal appearancep      it should be remarked first that the idea of absolute totality refers to nothing else but the exhibition of phenomena and not therefore to the pure concept formed by the understanding of a totality of things in general phenomena therefore are considered here as given and reason postulates the absolute completeness of the conditions of their possibility so far as these conditions constitute a series that is an absolutely in every respect complete synthesis whereby phenomena could be exhibited according to the laws of the understanding secondly it is in reality the unconditioned alone which reason is looking for in the synthesis of conditions continued regressively and serially as it were a completeness in the series of premisses which taken together require no further premisses this unconditioned is always contained in the absolute totality of a series as represented in imagination but this absolutely complete synthesis is again an idea only for it is impossible to know beforehand whether such a synthesis be possible in phenomena if we represent everything by means of pure concepts of the understanding only and without the conditions of sensuous intuition we might really say that of everything given as conditioned the whole series also of conditions subordinated     to each other is given for the conditioned is given through the conditions only when we come to phenomena however we find a particular limitation of the mode in which conditions are given namely     through the successive synthesis of the manifold of intuition which should become complete by the regressus whether this completeness however is possible with regard to sensuous phenomena is still a question but the idea of that completeness is no doubt contained in reason without reference to the possibility or impossibility of connecting with it adequate empirical concepts as therefore in the absolute totality of the regressive synthesis of the manifold in intuition according to the categories which represent that totality as a series of conditions of something given as conditioned the unconditioned is necessarily contained without attempting to determine whether and how such a totality be possible reason here takes the road to start from the idea of totality though her final aim is the unconditioned whether of the whole series or of a part thereof this unconditioned may be either conceived as existing in the whole series only in which all members without exception are conditioned and the whole of them only absolutely unconditioned — and in this case the regressus is called infinite — or the absolutely unconditioned is only a part of the series the other members being subordinate to it while it is itself conditioned by nothing else  in the     former case the series is without limits a parte     priori without a beginning that is infinite given however as a whole in which the regressus is never complete and can therefore be called infinite potentially only in the latter case there is something that stands first in the series which with reference to time past is called the beginning of the world with reference to space the limit of the world with reference to the parts of a limited given whole the simple with reference to causes absolute spontaneity liberty with reference to the existence of changeable things the absolute necessity of nature we have two expressions world and nature which frequently run into each other the first denotes the mathematical total of all phenomena and the totality of their synthesis of large and small in its progress whether by composition or division that world however is called nature  if we look upon it as a dynamical     whole and consider not the aggregation in space and time in order to produce a quantity but the unity in the existence of phenomena in this case the condition of that which happens is called cause the unconditioned causality of the cause as phenomenal liberty while the conditioned causality in its narrower meaning is called natural cause that of which the existence is conditioned     is called contingent that of which it is unconditioned necessary the unconditioned necessity of phenomena may be called natural necessity i have called the ideas which we are at present discussing cosmological partly because we understand by world the totality of all phenomena our ideas being directed to that only which is unconditioned among the phenomena partly because world in its transcendental meaning denotes the totality of all existing things and we are concerned only with the completeness of the synthesis although properly only in the regressus to the   0 conditions considering therefore that all these ideas are transcendent because though not transcending in kind their object namely phenomena but restricted to the world of sense and excluded from all noumena they nevertheless carry synthesis to a degree which transcends all possible experience they may according to my opinion very properly be called cosmical concepts with reference to the distinction however between the mathematically or the dynamically unconditioned at which the regressus aims i might call the two former in a narrower sense cosmical concepts macrocosmically or microcosmically and the remaining two transcendent concepts of nature this distinction though for the present of no great consequence may become important hereafter section ii antithetic of pure reason if every collection of dogmatical doctrines is called thetic i may denote by antithetic not indeed dogmatical   0 assertions of the opposite but the conflict between different kinds of apparently dogmatical knowledge thesis cum antithesi to none of which we can ascribe     a superior claim to our assent this antithetic therefore has nothing to do with onesided assertions but considers general knowledge of reason with reference to the conflict only that goes on in it and its causes the transcendental antithetic is in fact an investigation of the antinomy of pure reason its causes and its results if we apply our reason not only to objects of experience in order to make use of the principles of the understanding but venture to extend it beyond the limit of experience there arise rationalising or sophistical propositions which can neither hope for confirmation nor need fear refutation from experience every one of them is not only in itself free from contradiction but can point to conditions of its necessity in the nature of reason itself only that unfortunately its opposite can produce equally valid and necessary grounds for its support the questions which naturally arise in such a dialectic of pure reason are the following   in what propositions is pure reason inevitably subject to an antinomy   on what causes does this antinomy depend   whether and in what way reason may in spite of this contradiction find a way to certainty a dialectical proposition of pure reason must have this characteristic to distinguish it from all purely sophistical propositions first that it does not refer to a     gratuitous question but to one which human reason in its natural progress must necessarily encounter and secondly that it as well as its opposite carries with itself not a merely artificial illusion which when once seen through     disappears but a natural and inevitable illusion which even when it deceives us no longer always remains and though rendered harmless cannot be annihilated this dialectical doctrine will not refer to the unity of the understanding in concepts of experience but to the unity of reason in mere ideas the condition of which as it is meant to agree as a synthesis according to rules with the understanding and yet at the same time as the absolute unity of that synthesis with reason must either if it is adequate to the unity of reason be too great for the understanding or if adequate to the understanding too small for reason hence a conflict must arise which cannot be avoided do what we will these apparently rational but really sophistical assertions open a dialectical battlefield where that side always obtains the victory which is allowed to make the attack and where those must certainly succumb who     are obliged to keep on the defensive hence doughty knights whether fighting for the good or the bad cause are sure to win their laurels if only they take care that they have the right to make the last attack and are not obliged to stand a new onslaught of the enemy we can easily imagine that this arena has often been entered and many victories have been won on both sides the last decisive victory being always guarded by the defender of the good cause maintaining his place his opponent being forbidden ever to carry arms again as impartial judges we must take no account of whether it be the good or the bad cause which the two champions defend it is best to let them fight it out between themselves in the hope that after they have rather tired out than injured each     other they may themselves perceive the uselessness of their quarrel and part as good friends this method of watching or even provoking such a conflict of assertions not in order to decide in favour of one or the other side but in order to find out whether the object of the struggle be not a mere illusion which everybody tries to grasp in vain and which never can be of any use to any one even if no resistance were     made to him this method i say may be called the sceptical method it is totally different from scepticism or that artificial and scientific agnosticism which undermines the foundations of all knowledge in order if possible to leave nothing trustworthy and certain anywhere the sceptical method on the contrary aims at certainty because while watching a contest which on both sides is carried on honestly and intelligently it tries to discover the point where the misunderstanding arises in order to do what is done by wise legislators namely to derive from the embarrassments of judges in lawsuits information as to what is imperfectly or not quite accurately determined in their laws the antinomy which shows itself in the application of laws is considering our limited wisdom the best criterion of the original legislation nomothetic and helps to attract the attention of reason which in abstract speculations does not easily become aware of its errors to the important points in the determination of its principles this sceptical method is essential in transcendental philosophy only while it may be dispensed with in other fields of investigation it would be absurd in mathematics for no false assertions can there be hidden or rendered invisible because the demonstrations         must always be guided by pure intuition and proceed by evident synthesis in experimental philosophy a doubt which causes delay may be useful but at least no misunderstanding is possible that could not be easily removed and the final means for deciding a question whether found sooner or later must always be supplied by experience moral philosophy too can always produce its principles and their practical consequences in the concrete also or at least in possible experience and thus avoid the misunderstandings inherent in abstraction transcendental assertions on the contrary pretending to knowledge far beyond the field of possible experience can never produce their abstract synthesis in any intuition a priori nor can their flaws be discovered by means of any experience transcendental reason therefore admits of no other criterion but an attempt to combine its conflicting assertions and therefore previous to this unrestrained conflict between them this is what we shall now attempt to do      first conflict of the transcendental ideas     thesis the world has a beginning in time and is limited also with regard to space proof for if we assumed that the world had no beginning in time then an eternity must have elapsed up to every given point of time and therefore an infinite series of successive states of things must have passed in the world the infinity of a series however consists in this that it never can be completed by means of a successive synthesis hence an infinite past series of worlds is impossible and the beginning of the world a necessary condition of its existence this was what had to be proved first with regard to the second let us assume again the opposite in that case the world would be given as an infinite whole of coexisting things now we cannot conceive in any way the extension of a quantum which is not given within certain limits to every intuition  except through the synthesis of its parts nor     the totality of such a quantum in any way except through a completed synthesis or by the repeated addition of unity to itself  in order therefore to conceive the world which fills all space as a whole the successive synthesis of the parts of an infinite world would have to be looked upon as completed that is an infinite time would have to be looked upon as elapsed during the enumeration of all coexisting things this is impossible hence an infinite aggregate of real things cannot be regarded as a given whole nor therefore as given at the same time hence it follows that the world is not infinite as regards extension in space but enclosed in limits this was the second that had to be proved     antithesis     the world has no beginning and no limits in space but is infinite in respect both to time and space proof for let us assume that it has a beginning then as beginning is an existence which is preceded by a time in which the thing is not it would follow that antecedently there was a time in which the world was not that is an empty time in an empty time however it is impossible that anything should take its beginning because of such a time no part possesses any condition as to existence rather than nonexistence which condition could distinguish that part from any other whether produced by itself or through another cause hence though many a series of things may take its beginning in the world the world itself can have no beginning and in reference to time past is infinite with regard to the second let us assume again the opposite namely that the world is finite and limited in space in that case the world would exist in an empty space without limits we should therefore have not only a relation of things in space but also of things to space as however the world is an absolute whole outside of     which no object of intuition and therefore no correlate of the world can be found the relation of the world to empty space would be a relation to no object such a relation and with it the limitation of the world by empty space is nothing and therefore the world is not limited with regard to space that is it is infinite in extension      observations on the first antinomy   0 i on the thesis in exhibiting these conflicting arguments i have not tried to avail myself of mere sophisms for the sake of what is called special pleading which takes advantage of the want of caution of the opponent and gladly allows his appeal to a misunderstood law in order to establish his own illegitimate claims on its refutation every one of our proofs has been deduced from the nature of the case and no advantage has been taken of the wrong conclusions of dogmatists on either side i might have apparently proved my thesis too by putting forward as is the habit of dogmatists a wrong definition of the infinity of a given quantity i might have said that the quantity is infinite if no greater quantity that is greater than the number of given units contained in it is possible as no number is the greatest because one or more units can always be added to it i might have argued that an infinite given quantity and therefore also an infinite world infinite as regards both the past series of time and extension in space is impossible and therefore the world limited in space and time i might have done this but in that case my definition would not have agreed with the true concept of an infinite whole we do not represent by it how large it is and the concept of it is not therefore the concept of a maximum but we conceive by it its relation only     to any possible unit in regard to which it is greater than any number according as this unit is either greater or smaller the infinite would be greater or smaller while infinity consisting in the relation only to this given unit would always remain the same although the absolute quantity of the whole would not be known by it this however does not concern us at present the true transcendental concept of infinity is that the successive synthesis of units in measuring a quantum can never be completed  hence it follows with perfect certainty that an eternity of real and successive states cannot have elapsed up to any given the present moment and that the world therefore must have a beginning with regard to the second part of the thesis the difficulty of an endless and yet past series does not exist for the manifold of a world infinite in extension is given at one and the same time but in order to conceive the totality of such a multitude of things as we cannot appeal to those limits which in intuition produce that totality by themselves we must render an account of our concept which in our case cannot proceed from the whole to the determined multitude of the parts but has to demonstrate the possibility of a whole by the successive synthesis of the parts as such a synthesis would constitute a series that would never be completed it is impossible to conceive a totality either before it or through it for the concept of totality itself is in this case the representation of a completed synthesis of parts and such a completion and therefore its concept also is impossible     ii on the antithesis     the proof of the infinity of the given series of world and of the totality of the world rests on this that in the opposite case an empty time and likewise an empty space would form the limits of the world now i am quite aware that people have tried to escape from this conclusion by saying that a limit of the world both in time and space is quite possible without our having to admit an absolute time before the beginning of the world or an absolute space outside the real world which is impossible i have nothing to say against the latter part of this opinion held by the philosophers of the school of leibniz space is only the form of external intuition and not a real object that could be perceived externally nor is it a correlate of phenomena but the form of phenomena themselves space therefore cannot exist absolutely by itself as something determining the existence of things because it is no object but only the form of possible objects things therefore as phenomenal may indeed determine space that is impart reality to one or other of its predicates quantity and relation but space on the other side as something existing by itself cannot determine the reality of things in regard to quantity or form because it is nothing real in itself space therefore whether full or empty  may be limited by phenomena but phenomena cannot be limited by empty space outside them the same     applies to time but granting all this it cannot be denied that we should be driven to admit these two monsters empty space outside and empty time before the world if we assumed the limit of the world whether in space or time for as to the plea by which people try to escape from the conclusion that if the world has limits in time or space the infinite void would determine the existence of real things so far as their dimensions are concerned it is really no more than a covered attempt at putting some unknown intelligible world in the place of our sensuous world and an existence in general which presupposes no other condition in the world in the place of a first beginning an existence preceded by a time of nonexistence and boundaries of the universe in place of the limits of extension — thus getting rid of time and space but we have to deal here with the mundus phaenomenon and its quantity and we could not ignore the conditions of sensibility without destroying its very essence the world of sense if it is limited lies necessarily within the infinite void if we ignore this and with it space in general as an a priori condition of the possibility of phenomena the whole world of sense vanishes which alone forms the object of our enquiry the mundus intelligibilis is nothing but the general concept of any world which takes no account of any of the conditions of intuition and which therefore admits of no synthetical proposition whether affirmative or negative           0         second conflict of the transcendental ideas     thesis every compound substance in the world consists of simple parts and nothing exists anywhere but the simple or what is composed of it proof for let us assume that compound substances did not consist of simple parts then if all composition is removed in thought there would be no compound part and as no simple parts are admitted no simple part either that is there would remain nothing and there would therefore be no substance at all either therefore it is impossible to remove all composition in thought or after its removal there must remain something that exists without composition that is the simple in the former case the compound could not itself consist of substances because with them composition is only an accidental relation of substances which substances as permanent beings must subsist without it as this contradicts the     supposition there remains only the second view namely that the substantial compounds in the world consist of simple parts it follows as an immediate consequence that all the things in the world are simple beings that their composition is only an external condition and that though we are unable to remove these elementary substances from their state of composition and isolate them reason must conceive them as the first subjects of all composition and therefore antecedently to it as simple beings     antithesis     no compound thing in the world consists of simple parts and there exists nowhere in the world anything simple proof assume that a compound thing a substance consists of simple parts then as all external relation and therefore all composition of substances also is possible in space only it follows that space must consist of as many parts as the parts of the compound that occupies the space space however does not consist of simple parts but of spaces every part of a compound therefore must occupy a space now the absolutely primary parts of every compound are simple it follows therefore that the simple occupies a space but as everything real which occupies a space contains a manifold the parts of which are by the side of each other and which therefore is compounded and as a real compound compounded not of accidents for these could not exist by the side of each other without a substance but of substances it would follow that the simple is a substantial compound which is selfcontradictory the second proposition of the antithesis that there exists nowhere in the world anything simple is not intended to mean more than that the existence     of the absolutely simple cannot be proved from any experience or perception whether external or internal and that the absolutely simple is a mere idea the objective reality of which can never be shown in any possible experience so that in the explanation of phenomena it is without any application or object for if we assumed that an object of this transcendental idea might be found in experience the empirical intuition of some one object would have to be such as to contain absolutely nothing manifold by the side of each other and combined to a unity but as from our not being conscious of such a manifold we cannot form any valid conclusion as to the entire impossibility of it in any objective intuition and as without this no absolute simplicity can be established it follows that such simplicity cannot be inferred from any perception whatsoever as therefore an absolutely simple object can never be given in any possible experience while the world of sense must be looked upon as the sum total of all possible experience it follows that nothing simple exists in it this second part of the antithesis goes far beyond the first which only banished the simple from the intuition of the composite while the second drives it out of the whole of nature hence we could not attempt to prove it out of the concept of any given object of external intuition of the compound but from its relation to a possible experience in general             observations on the second antinomy     i on the thesis if i speak of a whole as necessarily consisting of separate parts i understand by it a substantial whole only as a real compound that is that contingent unity of the manifold which given as separate at least in thought is brought into a mutual connection and thus constitutes one whole we ought not to call space a compositum but a totum because in it its parts are possible only in the whole and not the whole by its parts it might therefore be called a compositum ideale but not reale but this is an unnecessary distinction as space is no compound of substances not even of real accidents nothing remains of it if i remove all composition in it not even the point for a point is possible only as the limit of a space and therefore of a compound space and time do not   0 therefore consist of simple parts what belongs only to the condition of a substance even though it possesses quantity as for instance change does not consist of the simple that is to say a certain degree of change does not arise through the accumulation of many simple changes we can infer the simple from the compound in selfsubsisting objects only accidents of a state however are not selfsubsisting the proof of the necessity of the simple as the component parts of all that is substantially composite can therefore easily be injured if it is extended too far and applied to all compounds without distinction as has often been the case i am however speaking here of the simple only so far as it is necessarily given in the composite which can be dissolved into the former as its component parts the true meaning of the word monas as used by     leibniz should refer to that simple only which is given immediately as simple substance for example in selfconsciousness and not as an element of the composite in which case it is better called an atomus  as i wish to prove the existence of simple substances as the elements of the composite only i might call the thesis  of the second antinomy transcendental atomistic but as this word has long been used as the name of a particular explanation of material phenomena moleculae and presupposes therefore empirical concepts it will be better to call it the dialectic principle of monadology     ii on the antithesis     against the theory of the infinite divisibility of matter the proof of which is mathematical only objections have been raised by the monadists which become suspicious by their declining to admit the clearest mathematical proofs as founded on a true insight into the quality of space so far as space is indeed the formal condition of the possibility of all matter but treating them only as conclusions derived from abstract but arbitrary concepts which ought not to be applied to real things but how is it possible to conceive a different kind of intuition from that given in the original intuition of space and how can its determinations a priori not apply to everything since it becomes possible only by its filling that space if we were to listen to them we should have to admit beside the mathematical point which is simple but no part but only the limit of a space other physical points simple likewise but possessing this privilege that as parts of space they are able by mere aggregation to fill space without repeating here the many clear refutations of this absurdity it being quite futile to attempt to reason away by purely discursive concepts the evidence of mathematics i only remark that if philosophy in this case seems to play tricks with mathematics it does so because it     forgets that in this discussion we are concerned with phenomena only and their conditions here however it is not enough to find for the pure concept produced by the understanding of the composite the concept of the simple but we must find for the intuition of the composite matter the intuition of the simple and this according to the laws of sensibility and therefore with reference to the objects of the senses is totally impossible though it may be true therefore with regard to a whole consisting of substances which is conceived by the pure understanding only that before its composition there must be the simple this does not apply to the totum substantiale phaenomenon which as an empirical intuition in space carries with it the necessary condition that no part of it is simple because no part of space is simple the monadists however have been clever enough to try to escape from this difficulty by not admitting space as a condition of the possibility of the objects of external intuition bodies but by presupposing these and the dynamical relation of substances in general as the condition of the possibility of space but we have no concept of bodies except as phenomena and as such they presuppose space as the necessary condition of the possibility of all external phenomena the argument of the monadists therefore is futile and has been sufficiently answered in the transcendental æsthetic if the bodies were things by themselves then and then only the argument of the monadists would be valid the second dialectical assertion possesses this     peculiarity that it is opposed by dogmatical assertion which among all sophistical assertions is the only one which undertakes to prove palpably in an object of experience the reality of that which we counted before as belonging only to transcendental ideas namely the absolute simplicity of a substance — i mean the assertion that the object of the internal sense or the thinking i is an absolutely simple substance without entering upon this question as it has been fully discussed before i only remark that if something is conceived as an object only without adding any synthetical determination of its intuition and this is the case in the bare representation of the i it would no doubt be impossible that anything manifold or composite could be perceived in such a representation besides as the predicates through which i conceive this object are only intuitions of the internal sense nothing can occur in them to prove a manifold one by the side of another and therefore a real composition it follows therefore from the nature of selfconsciousness that as the thinking subject is at the same time its own object it cannot divide itself though it might divide its inherent determinations for in regard to itself every object is absolute unity nevertheless when this subject is looked upon externally as an object of intuition it would most likely exhibit some kind of composition as a phenomenon and it must always be looked upon in this light if we wish to know whether its manifold constituent elements are by the side of each other or not           0         third conflict of the transcendental ideas     thesis causality according to the laws of nature is not the only causality from which all the phenomena of the world can be deduced in order to account for these phenomena it is necessary also to admit another causality that of freedom proof let us assume that there is no other causality but that according to the laws of nature in that case everything that takes place presupposes an anterior state on which it follows inevitably according to a rule but that anterior state must itself be something which has taken place which has come to be in time and did not exist before because if it had always existed its effect too would not have only just arisen but have existed always the causality therefore of a cause through which something takes place is itself an event which again according to the law of nature presupposes an anterior state and its causality and this again an anterior state and so on if therefore everything takes place according to mere laws of nature there will always be a secondary     only but never a primary beginning and therefore no completeness of the series on the side of successive causes but the law of nature consists in this that nothing takes place without a cause sufficiently determined a priori therefore the proposition that all causality is possible according to the laws of nature only contradicts itself if taken in unlimited generality and it is impossible therefore to admit that causality as the only one we must therefore admit another causality through which something takes place without its cause being further determined according to necessary laws by a preceding cause that is an absolute spontaneity of causes by which a series of phenomena proceeding according to natural laws begins by itself we must consequently admit transcendental freedom without which even in the course of nature the series of phenomena on the side of causes can never be perfect     antithesis     there is no freedom but everything in the world takes place entirely according to the laws of nature proof if we admit that there is freedom in the transcendental sense as a particular kind of causality according to which the events in the world could take place that is a faculty of absolutely originating a state and with it a series of consequences it would follow that not only a series would have its absolute beginning through this spontaneity but the determination of that spontaneity itself to produce the series that is the causality would have an absolute beginning nothing preceding it by which this act is determined according to permanent laws every beginning of an act however presupposes a state in which the cause is not yet active and a dynamically primary beginning of an act presupposes a state which has no causal connection with the preceding state of that cause that is in no wise follows from it transcendental freedom is therefore opposed to the law of causality and represents such a     connection of successive states of effective causes that no unity of experience is possible with it it is therefore an empty fiction of the mind and not to be met with in any experience we have therefore nothing but nature in which we must try to find the connection and order of cosmical events freedom independence from the laws of nature is no doubt a deliverance from restraint but also from the guidance of all rules for we cannot say that instead of the laws of nature laws of freedom may enter into the causality of the course of the world because if determined by laws it would not be freedom but nothing else but nature nature therefore and transcendental freedom differ from each other like legality and lawlessness the former no doubt imposes upon the understanding the difficult task of looking higher and higher for the origin of events in the series of causes because their causality is always conditioned in return for this however it promises a complete and wellordered unity of experience while on the other side the fiction of freedom promises no doubt to the enquiring mind rest in the chain of causes leading him up to an unconditioned causality which begins to act by itself but which as it is blind itself tears the thread of rules by which alone a complete and coherent experience is possible     observations on the third antinomy     i on the thesis the transcendental idea of freedom is far from forming the whole content of the psychological concept of that name which is chiefly empirical but only that of the absolute spontaneity of action as the real ground of imputability it is however the real stone of offence in the eyes of philosophy which finds its unsurmountable difficulties in admitting this kind of unconditioned causality that element in the question of the freedom of the will which has always so much embarrassed speculative reason is therefore in reality transcendental only and refers merely to the question whether we must admit a faculty of spontaneously originating a series of successive things or states how such a faculty is possible need not be answered because with regard to the causality according to the laws of nature also we must be satisfied to know a priori that such a causality has to be admitted though we can in no wise understand the possibility how through one existence the existence of another is given but must for that purpose appeal to experience alone the necessity of a first beginning of a series of phenomena from freedom has been proved so far only as it is necessary in order to comprehend an origin of the world while all successive states may be regarded as a result in succession according to mere laws of nature but as thus   0 the faculty of originating a series in time by itself has been proved though by no means understood it is now permitted also to admit within the course of the world different series beginning by themselves with regard to their causality and to attribute to their substances a faculty of acting with freedom but we must not allow ourselves to be troubled by a misapprehension namely that as every successive series in the world can have only a relatively primary beginning some other state of things always preceding in the world therefore no absolutely primary beginning of different series is possible in the course of the world for we are speaking here of the absolutely first beginning not according to time but according to causality if for instance at this moment i rise from my chair with perfect freedom without the necessary determining influence of natural causes a new series has its absolute beginning in this event with all its natural consequences ad infinitum although with regard to time this event is only the continuation of a preceding series for this determination and this act do not belong to the succession of merely natural effects nor are they a mere continuation of them but the determining natural causes completely stop before it so far as this event is concerned which no doubt follows them and does not result from them and may therefore be called an absolutely first beginning in a series of phenomena not with reference to time but with reference to causality this requirement of reason to appeal in the series of natural causes to a first and free beginning is fully confirmed if we see that with the exception of the epicurean school all philosophers of antiquity have felt themselves obliged to admit for the sake of explaining all cosmical movements a prime mover that is a freely acting cause which first and by itself started this series of states they did not attempt to make a first beginning comprehensible by an appeal to nature only     ii on the antithesis     he who stands up for the omnipotence of nature transcendental physiocracy in opposition to the doctrine of freedom would defend his position against the sophistical conclusions of that doctrine in the following manner if you do not admit something mathematically the first in the world with reference to time there is no necessity why you should look for something dynamically the first with reference to causality who has told you to invent an absolutely first state of the world and with it an absolute beginning of the gradually progressing series of phenomena and to set limits to unlimited nature in order to give to your imagination something to rest on as substances have always existed in the world or as the unity of experience renders at least such a supposition necessary there is no difficulty in assuming that a change of their states that is a series of their changes has always existed also so that there is no necessity for looking for a first beginning either mathematically or dynamically it is true we cannot render the possibility of such an infinite descent comprehensible without the first member to which everything else is subsequent but if for this reason you reject this riddle of nature you will feel yourselves constrained to reject many synthetical fundamental properties natural forces which you cannot comprehend any more nay the very possibility of change in general would be     full of difficulties for if you did not know from experience that change exists you would never be able to conceive a priori how such a constant succession of being and not being is possible and even if the transcendental faculty of freedom might somehow be conceded to start the changes of the world such faculty would at all events have to be outside the world though it would always remain a bold assumption to admit outside the sum total of all possible intuitions an object that cannot be given in any possible experience but to attribute in the world itself a faculty to substances can never be allowed because in that case the connection of phenomena determining each other by necessity and according to general laws which we call nature and with it the test of empirical truth which distinguishes experience from dreams would almost entirely disappear for by the side of such a lawless faculty of freedom nature could hardly be conceived any longer because the laws of the latter would be constantly changed through the influence of the former and the play of phenomena which according to nature is regular and uniform would become confused and incoherent                   0 fourth conflict of the transcendental ideas     thesis there exists an absolutely necessary being belonging to the world either as a part or as a cause of it proof the world of sense as the sum total of all phenomena contains a series of changes without which even the representation of a series of time which forms the condition of the possibility of the world of sense would not be given us  but every change has its condition which precedes it in time and renders it necessary now everything that is given as conditional presupposes with regard to its existence a complete series of conditions leading up to that which is entirely unconditioned and alone absolutely necessary something absolutely necessary therefore must exist if there exists a change as its consequence and this absolutely necessary belongs itself to the world of sense for if we supposed that it existed outside that world then the series of changes in the world would derive its origin from it while the necessary cause itself would not belong     to the world of sense but this is impossible for as the beginning of a temporal series can be determined only by that which precedes it in time it follows that the highest condition of the beginning of a series of changes must exist in the time when that series was not yet because the beginning is an existence preceded by a time in which the thing which begins was not yet hence the causality of the necessary cause of changes and that cause itself belong to time and therefore to phenomena in which alone time as their form is possible and it cannot therefore be conceived as separated from the world of sense as the sum total of all phenomena it follows therefore that something absolutely necessary is contained in the world whether it be the whole cosmical series itself or only a part of it     antithesis there nowhere exists an absolutely necessary being either within or without the world as the cause of it proof if we supposed that the world itself is a necessary being or that a necessary being exists in it there would then be in the series of changes either a beginning unconditionally necessary and therefore without a cause which contradicts the dynamical law of the determination of all phenomena in time or the series itself would be without any beginning and though contingent and conditioned in all its parts yet entirely necessary and unconditioned as a whole this would be selfcontradictory because the existence of a multitude cannot be necessary if no single part of it possesses necessary existence if we supposed on the contrary that there exists an absolutely necessary cause of the world outside the world then that cause as the highest member     in the series of causes of cosmical changes would begin the existence of the latter and their series  in that case however that cause would have to begin to act and its causality would belong to time and therefore to the sum total of phenomena it would belong to the world and would therefore not be outside the world which is contrary to our supposition therefore neither in the world nor outside the world yet in causal connection with it does there exist anywhere an absolutely necessary being     observations on the fourth antinomy     i on the thesis in order to prove the existence of a necessary being i ought not in this place to use any but the cosmological argument which ascends from what is conditioned in the phenomena to what is unconditioned in concept that being considered as the necessary condition of the absolute totality of the series to undertake that proof from the mere idea of a supreme being belongs to another principle of reason and will have to be treated separately the pure cosmological proof cannot establish the existence of a necessary being without leaving it open whether that being be the world itself or a being distinct from it in order to settle this question principles are required which are no longer cosmological and do not proceed in the series of phenomena we should have to introduce concepts of contingent beings in general so far as they are considered as objects of the understanding only and also a principle according to which we might connect them by means of concepts only with a necessary being all this belongs to a transcendent     philosophy for which this is not yet the place if however we once begin our proof cosmologically taking for our foundation the series of phenomena and the regressus in it according to the empirical laws of causality we cannot afterwards suddenly leave this line of argument and pass over to something which does not belong as a member to this series for the condition must be taken in the same meaning in which the relation of the condition to that condition was taken in the series which by continuous progress was to lead to that highest condition if therefore that relation is sensuous and intended for a possible empirical use of the understanding the highest condition or cause can close the regressus according to the laws of sensibility only and therefore as belonging to that temporal series itself the necessary being must therefore be regarded as the highest member of the cosmical series nevertheless certain philosophers have taken the liberty of making such a salto μετάβασις εἰς ἄλλο γένος from the changes in the world they concluded their empirical contingency that is their dependence on empirically determining causes and they thus arrived at an ascending series of empirical conditions this was quite right as however in this way they could not find a first beginning or any highest member they suddenly left the empirical concept of contingency and took to the pure category this led to a purely intelligible series the completeness of which depended on the existence of an absolutely necessary cause which cause as no longer subject to any sensuous conditions was freed also from the temporal condition of itself beginning its causality such a proceeding is entirely illegitimate as may be seen from what follows in the pure sense of the category we call contingent that the contradictory opposite of which is possible now we cannot conclude that intelligible contingency from empirical contingency of what is being   0 changed we may say that the opposite of its state is real and therefore possible also at another time but this is not the contradictory opposite of the preceding state in order to establish that it is necessary that at the same time when the previous state existed its opposite could have existed in its place and this can never be concluded from change a body for instance which when in motion was a comes to be when at rest  non a from the fact that the state opposite to the state a follows upon it we can in no wise conclude that the contradictory opposite of a is possible and therefore a contingent only in order to establish this it would be necessary to prove that at the same time when there was motion there might have been instead of it rest but we know no more than that at a subsequent time such rest was real and therefore possible also motion at one time and rest at another are not contradictory opposites therefore the succession of opposite determinations that is change in no way proves contingency according to the concepts of the pure understanding and can therefore never lead us on to the existence of a necessary being according to the pure concepts of the understanding change proves empirical contingency only it proves that the new state could not have taken place according to the law of causality by itself and without a cause belonging to a previous time this cause even if it is considered as absolutely necessary must as we see exist in time and belong to the series of phenomena     ii on the antithesis     if in ascending the series of phenomena we imagine we meet with difficulties militating against the existence of an absolutely necessary supreme cause such difficulties ought not to be derived from mere concepts of the necessary existence of a thing in general they ought not to be ontological but ought to arise from the causal connection with a series of phenomena for which a condition is required which is itself unconditioned that is they ought to be cosmological and dependent on empirical laws it must be shown that our ascending in the series of causes in the world of sense can never end with a condition empirically unconditioned and that the cosmological argument based on the contingency of cosmical states as proved by their changes ends in a verdict against the admission of a first cause absolutely originating the whole series a curious contrast however meets us in this     antinomy from the same ground on which in the thesis the existence of an original being was proved its nonexistence is proved in the antithesis with equal stringency we were first told that a necessary being exists because the whole of time past comprehends the series of all conditions and with it also the unconditioned the necessary we are now told there is no necessary being for the very reason that the whole of past time comprehends the series of all conditions which therefore altogether are themselves conditioned the explanation is this the first argument regards only the absolute totality of the series of conditions determining each other in time and thus arrives at something unconditioned and necessary the second on the contrary regards the contingency of all that is determined in the temporal series everything being preceded by a time in which the condition itself must again be determined as conditioned in which case everything unconditioned and every absolute necessity     must absolutely vanish in both the manner of concluding is quite in conformity with ordinary human reason which frequently comes into conflict with itself from considering its object from two different points of view herr von mairan considered the controversy between two famous astronomers which arose from a similar difficulty as to the choice of the true standpoint as something sufficiently important to write a separate treatise on it the one reasoned thus the moon revolves on its own axis because it always turns the same side towards the earth the other concluded the moon does not revolve on its own axis because it always turns the same side towards the earth both conclusions were correct according to the point of view from which one chose to consider the motion of the moon                         section iii of the interest of reason in these conflicts     we have thus watched the whole dialectical play of the cosmological ideas and have seen that they do not even admit of any adequate object being supplied to them in any possible experience nay not even of reason treating them in accordance with the general laws of experience nevertheless these ideas are not arbitrary fictions but reason in the continuous progress of empirical synthesis is necessarily led on to them whenever it wants to free what according to the rules of experience can be determined as conditioned only from all conditions and comprehend it in its unconditioned totality these rationalising or dialectical assertions are so many attempts at solving four perfectly natural and inevitable problems of reason there cannot be either more or less of them because there are neither more nor less series of synthetical hypotheses which limit empirical synthesis a priori we have represented the brilliant pretensions of reason extending its domain beyond all the limits of experience in dry formulas only containing nothing but the grounds of its claims and as it befits transcendental     philosophy divested them of everything empirical although it is only in connection with this that the whole splendour of the assertions of reason can be fully seen in their application and in the progressive extension of the employment of reason beginning from the field of experience and gradually soaring up to those sublime   0 ideas philosophy displays a grandeur which if it could only establish its pretensions would leave all other kinds of human knowledge far behind promising to us a safe foundation for our highest expectations and hopes for the attainment of the highest aims towards which all the exertions of reason must finally converge the questions whether the world has a beginning and any limit of its extension in space whether there is anywhere and it may be in my own thinking self an indivisible and indestructible unity or whether there exists nothing but what is divisible and perishable whether in my acts i am free or like other beings led by the hand of nature and of fate whether finally there exists a supreme cause of the world or whether the objects of nature and their order form the last object which we can reach in all our speculations — these are questions for the solution of which the mathematician would gladly sacrifice the whole of his science which cannot give him any satisfaction with regard to the highest and dearest aspirations of mankind even the true dignity and worth of mathematics that pride of human reason rest     on this that they teach reason how to understand nature in what is great and what is small in her in her order and regularity and likewise in the admirable unity of her moving powers far above all expectations of a philosophy restricted to common experience and thus encourage reason to extend its use far beyond experience nay supply philosophy with the best materials intended to support its investigations so far as their nature admits of it by adequate intuitions unfortunately for mere speculation but fortunately perhaps for the practical destinies of men reason in the     very midst of her highest expectations finds herself so hemmed in by a press of reasons and counter reasons that as neither her honour nor her safety admit of her retreating and becoming an indifferent spectator of what might be called a mere passage of arms still less of her commanding peace in a strife in which she is herself deeply interested nothing remains to her but to reflect on the origin of this conflict in order to find out whether it may not have arisen from a mere misunderstanding after such an enquiry proud claims would no     doubt have to be surrendered on both sides but a permanent and tranquil rule of reason over the understanding and the senses might then be inaugurated for the present we shall defer this thorough enquiry in order to consider which side we should like to take if it should become necessary to take sides at all as in this case we do not consult the logical test of truth but only our own interest such an enquiry though settling nothing as to the contested rights of both parties will have this advantage that it makes us understand why those who take part in this contest embrace one rather than the other side without being guided by any special insight into the subject it may also explain some other things as for instance the zelotic heat of the one and the calm assurance of the other party and why the world greets one party with rapturous applause and entertains towards the other an irreconcileable prejudice there is something which in this preliminary enquiry determines the right point of view from which alone it can be carried on with proper completeness and this is the comparison of the principles from which both parties start if we look at the propositions of the antithesis     we shall find in it a perfect uniformity in the mode of thought and a complete unity of principle     namely the principle of pure empiricism not only in the explanation of the phenomena of the world but also in the solution of the transcendental ideas of the cosmical universe itself the propositions of the thesis on the contrary rest not only on the empirical explanation within the series of phenomena but likewise on intelligible beginnings and its maxim is therefore not simple with regard to its essential and distinguishing characteristic i shall call it the dogmatism of pure reason on the side of dogmatism we find in the determination of the cosmological ideas or in the thesis — first a certain practical interest which every rightthinking man if he knows his true interests will heartily share that the world has a beginning that my thinking self is of a simple and therefore indestructible nature that the same self is free in all his voluntary actions and raised above the compulsion of nature that finally the whole order of things or the world derives its origin from an original being whence everything receives both unity and purposeful connection — these are so many foundation stones on which morals and religion are built up the antithesis robs us or seems to rob us of all these supports secondly reason has a certain speculative interest on the same side for if we take and employ the transcendental ideas as they are in the thesis one may quite a priori grasp the whole chain of conditions and     comprehend the derivation of the conditioned by beginning with the unconditioned this cannot be done by the antithesis which presents itself in a very unfavourable     light because it cannot return to the question as to the conditions of its synthesis any answer which does not lead to constantly new questions according to it one has always to ascend from a given beginning to a higher one every part leads always to a still smaller part every event has always before it another event as its cause and the conditions of existence in general always rest on others without ever receiving unconditioned strength and support from a selfsubsisting thing as the original being thirdly this side has also the advantage of popularity which is by no means its smallest recommendation the common understanding does not see the smallest difficulty in the idea of the unconditioned beginning of all synthesis being accustomed rather to descend to consequences than to ascend to causes it finds comfort in the ideas of the absolutely first the possibility of which does not trouble it and at the same time a firm point to which the leading strings of its life may be attached while there is no pleasure in a restless ascent from condition to condition and keeping one foot always in the air on the side of empiricism so far as it determines     the cosmological ideas or the antithesis there is — first no such practical interest arising from the pure principles of reason as morality and religion possess on the contrary empiricism seems to deprive both of their power and influence if there is no original being different from the world if the world is without a beginning and therefore without a creator if our will is not free and our soul shares the same divisibility and perishableness with matter moral ideas also and principles     lose all validity and fall with the transcendental ideas which formed their theoretic support but on the other side empiricism offers advantages to the speculative interests of reason which are very tempting and far exceed those which the dogmatical teacher can promise with the empiricist the understanding is always on its own proper ground namely the field of all possible experience the laws of which may be investigated and serve to enlarge certain and intelligible knowledge without end here every object can and ought to be represented to intuition both in itself and in its relations or at least in concepts the images of which can be clearly and distinctly represented in given similar intuitions not only is there no necessity for leaving the chain of the order of nature in order to lay hold of ideas the objects of which are not known     because as mere products of thought they can never be given but the understanding is not even allowed to leave its proper business and under pretence of its being finished to cross into the domain of idealising reason and transcendental concepts where it need no longer observe and investigate according to the laws of nature but only think and dream without any risk of being contradicted by the facts of nature not being bound by their evidence but justified in passing them by or in even subordinating them to a higher authority namely that of pure reason hence the empiricist will never allow that any epoch of nature should be considered as the absolutely first or any limit of his vision into the extent of nature should be considered as the last he will not approve of a transition from the objects of nature which he can analyse by observation and mathematics and determine synthetically     in intuition the extended to those which neither sense nor imagination can ever represent in concreto the simple nor will he concede that a faculty be presupposed even in nature to act independent of the laws of nature freedom thus narrowing the operations of the understanding in investigating according to the necessary rules the origin of phenomena lastly he will never tolerate that the cause of anything should be   0 looked for anywhere outside of nature in the original being because we know nothing but nature which alone can offer us objects and instruct us as to their laws if the empirical philosopher had no other purpose with his antithesis but to put down the rashness and presumption of reason in mistaking her true purpose while boasting of insight and knowledge where insight and knowledge come to an end nay while representing what might have been allowed to pass on account of practical interests as a real advancement of speculative enquiry in order when it is so disposed either to tear the thread of physical enquiry or to fasten it under the pretence of enlarging our knowledge to those transcendental ideas which really teach us only that we know nothing if i say the empiricist were satisfied with this then his principle would only serve to teach moderation in claims modesty in assertions and encourage the greatest possible enlargement of our understanding through the true teacher given to us namely experience for in such a case we should not be deprived of our own intellectual presumptions or of our faith in their influence on our practical interests they would only have lost the pompous titles of science and rational insight because true     speculative knowledge can never have any other object     but experience and if we transcend its limits our synthesis which attempts new kinds of knowledge independent of experience lacks that substratum of intuition to which alone it could be applied as it is empiricism becomes often itself dogmatical with regard to ideas and boldly denies what goes beyond the sphere of its intuitive knowledge and thus becomes guilty itself of a want of modesty which here is all the more reprehensible because an irreparable injury is thereby inflicted on the practical interests of reason this constitutes the opposition of epicureanism  to platonism either party says more than it knows but     while the former encourages and advances knowledge although at the expense of practical interests the latter supplies excellent practical principles but with regard to everything of which speculative knowledge is open to us it allows reason to indulge in ideal explanations of natural phenomena and to neglect physical investigation with regard to the third point which has to be considered     in a preliminary choice between the two opposite parties it is very strange that empiricism should be so unpopular though it might be supposed that the common understanding would readily accept a theory which promises to satisfy it by experimental knowledge and its rational connection while transcendental dogmatism forces it to ascend to concepts which far surpass the insight and rational faculties of the most practised thinkers but here is the real motive — the man of ordinary     understanding is so placed thereby that even the most learned can claim no advantage over him if he knows little or nothing no one can boast of knowing much more and though he may not be able to employ such scholastic terms as others he can argue and subtilise infinitely more because he moves about among mere ideas about which it is easy to be eloquent because no one knows anything about them the same person would have to be entirely silent or would have to confess his ignorance with regard to scientific enquiries into nature indolence therefore and vanity are strongly in favour of those principles besides although a true philosopher finds it extremely hard to accept the principle of which he can give no reasonable account still more to introduce concepts the objective reality of which cannot be established nothing comes more natural to the common understanding that wants something with which it can operate securely the difficulty of comprehending such a supposition does not disquiet a person of common understanding because not knowing what comprehending really means it never enters into his mind and he takes everything for known that has become familiar to him by frequent use at last all speculative interest disappears before the practical and he     imagines that he understands and knows what his fears and hopes impel him to accept or to believe thus the empiricism of a transcendentally idealising reason     loses all popularity and however prejudicial it may be to the highest practical principles there is no reason to fear that it will ever pass the limits of the school and obtain in the commonwealth any considerable authority or any favour with the multitude human reason is by its nature architectonic and looks upon all knowledge as belonging to a possible system it therefore allows such principles only which do not render existing knowledge incapable of being associated with other knowledge in some kind of system the propositions of the antithesis however are of such a character that they render the completion of any system of knowledge quite impossible according to them there is always beyond every state of the world an older state in every part other and again divisible parts before every event another event which again is produced from elsewhere and everything in existence is conditioned without an unconditioned and first existence anywhere as therefore the antithesis allows of nothing that is first and of no beginning which could serve as the foundation of an edifice such an edifice of knowledge is entirely impossible with such premisses hence the architectonic interest of reason which demands not empirical but pure     rational unity a priori serves as a natural recommendation of the propositions of the thesis but if men could free themselves from all such interests and consider the assertions of reason unconcerned about their consequences according to the value of their arguments only they would find themselves if they knew of     no escape from the press except adhesion to one or the other of the opposite doctrines in a state of constant oscillation today they would be convinced that the human will is free tomorrow when considering the indissoluble chain of nature they would think that freedom is nothing but selfdeception and nature all in all when afterwards they come to act this play of purely speculative reason would vanish like the shadows of a dream and they would choose their principles according to practical interests only but as it well befits a reflecting and enquiring being to devote a certain time entirely to the examination of his own reason divesting himself of all partiality and then to publish his observations for the judgment of others no one ought to be blamed still less be prevented if he wishes to produce the thesis     as well as the antithesis so that they may defend themselves terrified by no menace before a jury of his peers that is before a jury of weak mortals section iv of the transcendental problems of pure reason and the absolute necessity of their solution to attempt to solve all problems and answer all questions would be impudent boasting and so extravagant a selfconceit that it would forfeit all confidence nevertheless there are sciences the very nature of which requires that every question which can occur in them should be answerable at once from what is known because the answer must arise from the same sources from which the   0 question springs here it is not allowed to plead inevitable ignorance but a solution can be demanded we must be able for instance to know according to a rule what in every possible case is right or wrong because this touches our obligation and we cannot have any obligation to that which we cannot know in the explanation     however of the phenomena of nature many things must remain uncertain and many a question insoluble because what we know of nature is by no means sufficient in all cases to explain what has to be explained it has now to be considered whether there exists in transcendental philosophy any question relating to any object of reason which by that pure reason is unanswerable and whether we have a right to decline its decisive answer by treating the object as absolutely uncertain from all that we are able to know and as belonging to that class of objects of which we may form a sufficient conception for starting a question without having the power or means of ever answering it now i maintain that transcendental philosophy has this peculiarity among all speculative knowledge that no question referring to an object of pure reason can be insoluble for the same human reason and that no excuse of inevitable ignorance on our side or of unfathomable depth on the side of the problem can release us from the obligation to answer it thoroughly and completely because the same concept which enables us to ask the question must qualify us to answer it considering that as in the case of right and wrong the object itself does not exist except in the concept there are however in transcendental philosophy     no other questions but the cosmological with regard     to which we have a right to demand a satisfactory answer touching the quality of the object nor is the philosopher allowed here to decline an answer by pleading impenetrable obscurity these questions can refer to cosmological ideas only because the object must be given empirically and the question only refers to the adequateness of it to an idea if the object is transcendental and therefore itself unknown as for instance whether that something the phenomenal appearance of which within ourselves is the thinking soul be in itself a simple being whether there be an absolutely necessary cause of all things etc we are asked to find an object for our idea of which we may well confess that it is unknown to us though not therefore impossible  the cosmological ideas alone possess this peculiarity that they may presuppose     their object and the empirical synthesis required for the object as given and the question which they suggest refers only to the progress of that synthesis so far as it is to contain absolute totality such absolute totality being no longer empirical because it cannot be given in any experience as we are here concerned solely with a thing as an object of possible experience not as a thing     by itself it is impossible that the answer of the transcendent cosmological question can be anywhere but in the idea because it refers to no object by itself and in respect to possible experience we do not ask for that which can be given in concreto in any experience but for that which lies in the idea to which the empirical synthesis can no more than approach hence that question can be solved from the idea only and being a mere creation of reason reason cannot decline her responsibility and put it on the unknown object it is in reality not so strange as it may seem   0 at first that a science should demand and expect definite answers to all the questions belonging to it quaestiones domesticae although at present these answers have not yet been discovered there are in addition to transcendental philosophy two other sciences of pure reason the one speculative the other practical pure mathematics and pure ethics has it ever been alleged that it may be on account of our necessary ignorance of the conditions it must remain uncertain what exact relation the diameter bears to a circle in rational or irrational numbers as by the former the relation cannot be expressed adequately and by the latter has not yet been discovered it was judged rightly that the impossibility at least of the solution of such a problem can be known with certainty and lambert gave even a demonstration of this in the general principles of morality there can be nothing uncertain because its maxims are either entirely null and void or derived from our own rational concepts only in natural science on the contrary we have an infinity of conjectures with regard to which certainty can never be expected because natural phenomena are objects given     to us independent of our concepts and the key to them cannot be found within our own mind but in the world outside us for that reason it cannot in many cases be found at all and a satisfactory answer must not be expected the questions of the transcendental     analytic referring to the deduction of our pure knowledge do not belong to this class because we are treating at present of the certainty of judgments with reference to their objects only and not with reference to the origin of our concepts themselves we shall not therefore be justified in evading the obligation of a critical solution at least of the questions of reason by complaints on the narrow limits of our reason and by confessing under the veil of humble selfknowledge that it goes beyond the powers of our reason to determine whether the world has existed from eternity or has had a beginning whether cosmical space is filled with beings ad infinitum or enclosed within certain limits whether anything in the world is simple or everything can be infinitely divided lastly whether there is a being entirely unconditioned and necessary in itself or whether the existence of everything is conditioned and therefore externally dependent and in itself contingent for all these questions refer to an object which can be found nowhere except in our own thoughts namely the absolutely unconditioned totality of the synthesis of phenomena if we are not able to say and establish anything certain about this from our own concepts we must not throw the blame on the     object itself as obscure because such an object being nowhere to be found except in our ideas can never be given to us but we must look for the real cause of     obscurity in our idea itself which is a problem admitting of no solution though we insist obstinately that a real object must correspond to it a clear explanation of the dialectic within our own concept would soon show us with perfect certainty how we ought to judge with reference to such a question if people put forward a pretext of being unable to arrive at certainty with regard to these problems the first question which we ought to address to them and which they ought to answer clearly is this whence do you get those ideas the solution of which involves you in such difficulty are they phenomena of which you require an explanation and of which you have only to find in accordance with those ideas the principles or the rule of their explanation suppose the whole of nature were spread out before you and nothing were hid to your senses and to the consciousness of all that is presented to your intuition yet you would never be able to know by one single experience the object of your ideas in concreto because in addition to that complete intuition what is required is a completed synthesis and the consciousness of its absolute totality which     is impossible by any empirical knowledge hence your question can never be provoked for the sake of explaining any given phenomenon and as it were suggested by the object itself such an object can never come before you because it can never be given by any possible experience in all possible perceptions you always remain under the sway of conditions whether in space or in time you never come face to face with anything unconditioned in order thus to determine whether the unconditioned exists in an absolute beginning of the synthesis     or in an absolute totality of the series without any beginning the whole in its empirical meaning is always relative only the absolute whole of quantity the universe of division of origination and of the condition of existence in general with all the attendant questions as to whether it can be realised by a finite synthesis or by a synthesis to be carried on ad infinitum has nothing to do with any possible experience you would for instance never be able to explain the phenomena of a body in the least better or even differently whether you assume that it consists of simple or throughout of composite parts for neither a simple phenomenon nor an infinite composition can ever meet your senses phenomena require to be explained so far only as the conditions of their explanation are given in perception but whatever may exist in them if comprehended     as an absolute whole can  never be a perception yet it is this very whole the explanation of which is required in the transcendental problems of reason as therefore the solution of these problems can never be supplied by experience you cannot say that it is uncertain what ought to be predicated of the object for your object is in your brain only and cannot possibly exist outside it so that you have only to take care to be at one with yourselves and to avoid the amphiboly which changes your idea into a pretended representation of an object empirically given and therefore to be known according to the laws of experience the dogmatical solution is therefore not only uncertain but impossible while the critical solution which may become perfectly     certain does not consider the question objectively but only with reference to the foundation of the knowledge on which it is based section v sceptical representation of the cosmological questions in the four transcendental ideas     we should no doubt gladly desist from wishing to have our questions answered dogmatically if we understood beforehand that whatever the answer might be it would only increase our ignorance and throw us from one incomprehensibility into another from one obscurity into a still greater obscurity or it may be even into contradictions if our question can only be answered by yes or no it would seem to be prudent to take no account at first of the probable grounds of the answer but to consider before what we should gain if the answer was yes and what if the answer was no if we should find that in either case nothing comes of it but mere nonsense we are surely called upon to examine our question critically and to see whether it does not rest on a groundless supposition playing only with an idea which betrays its falsity in its application and its consequences better than when represented by itself this is the great advantage of the sceptical treatment of questions which     pure reason puts to pure reason we get rid by it with a little effort of a great amount of dogmatical rubbish in order to put in its place sober criticism which as a true cathartic removes successfully all illusion with its train of omniscience     if therefore i could know beforehand that a cosmological idea in whatever way it might try to realise the unconditioned of the regressive synthesis of phenomena whether in the manner of the thesis or in that of the antithesis that i say the cosmological idea would always be either too large or too small for any concept of the understanding i should understand that as that cosmological idea refers only to an object of experience which is to correspond to a possible concept of the understanding it must be empty and without meaning because the object does not fit into it whatever i may do to adapt it and this must really be the case with all cosmical concepts which on that very account involve reason so long as it remains attached to them in inevitable antinomy for suppose — first that the world has no beginning and you will find that it is too large for your concept which as it consists in a successive regressus can never reach the whole of past eternity or suppose that the world has a beginning then it is again too small for the concept of your understanding engaged in the necessary empirical regressus for as a beginning always presupposes     a time preceding it is not yet unconditioned and the law of the empirical use of the understanding obliges you to look for a higher condition of time so that with reference to such a law the world as limited in time is clearly too small the same applies to the twofold answer to the question regarding the extent of the world in space for if it is infinite and unlimited it is too large for every possible empirical concept if it is finite and limited you have a perfect right to ask what determines that limit empty     space is not an independent correlate of things and cannot be a final condition still less an empirical condition forming a part of a possible experience — for how can there be experience of what is absolutely void but in order to produce an absolute totality in an empirical synthesis it is always requisite that the unconditioned should be an empirical concept thus it follows that a limited world would be too small for your concept secondly if every phenomenon in space matter consists of an infinite number of parts the regressus of a division will always be too large for your concept while if the division of space is to stop at any member the simple it would be too small for the idea of the unconditioned because that member always admits of a regresus to more parts contained in it     thirdly if you suppose that everything that happens in the world is nothing but the result of the laws of nature the causality of the cause will always be something that happens and that necessitates a regressus to a still higher cause and therefore a continuation of the series of conditions a parte priori without end mere active nature therefore is too large for any concept in the synthesis of cosmical events if you admit on the contrary spontaneously produced events therefore generation from freedom you have still according to an inevitable law of nature to ask why and you are forced by the empirical law of causality beyond that point so that you find that any such totality of connection is too small for your necessary empirical concept fourthly if you admit an absolutely necessary being whether it be the world itself or something in the world or the cause of the world you place it at a time infinitely     remote from any given point of time because otherwise it would be dependent on another and antecedent existence in that case however such an existence would be unapproachable by your empirical concept and too large even to be reached by any continued regressus but if according to your opinion everything     which belongs to the world whether as conditioned or as condition is contingent then every given existence is too small for your concept because compelling you to look still for another existence on which it depends we have said that in all these cases the cosmical idea is either too large or too small for the empirical regressus and therefore for every possible concept of the understanding but why did we not take the opposite view and say that in the former case the empirical concept is always too small for the idea and in the latter too large so that blame should attach to the empirical regressus and not to the cosmological idea which we accused of deviating from its object namely possible experience either by its toomuch or its toolittle the reason was this it is possible experience alone that can impart reality to our concepts without this a concept is only an idea without truth and without any reference to an object hence the possible empirical concept was the standard by which to judge the idea whether it be an idea and fiction only or whether it has an object in the world for we then only say that anything is relatively to something else either too large or too small if it is required for the sake of the other and ought to be adapted to it one of the playthings of the old dialectical school was the question whether we   0 should say that the ball is too large or the hole too small  00 if a ball cannot pass through a hole in this case it is indifferent what expression we use because we do not know which of the two exists for the sake of the other but you would never say that the man is too large for his coat but that the coat is too small for the man we have thus been led at least to a wellfounded suspicion that the cosmological ideas and with them all the conflicting sophistical assertions may rest on an empty and merely imaginary conception of the manner in which the object of those ideas can be given and this suspicion may lead us on the right track to discover the illusion which has so long led us astray section vi transcendental idealism as the key to the solution of cosmological dialectic it has been sufficiently proved in the transcendental æsthetic that everything which is perceived in space and time therefore all objects of an experience possible to us are nothing but phenomena that is mere representations which such as they are represented namely as     extended beings or series of changes have no independent existence outside our thoughts this system i call transcendental idealism  transcendental realism changes these modifications of our sensibility into selfsubsistent things that is it changes mere representations into things by themselves  0  it would be unfair to ask us to adopt that longdecried empirical idealism which while it admits the independent reality of space denies the existence of extended beings in it or at all events considers it as doubtful and does not admit that there is in this respect a sufficiently established difference between dream and reality it sees no difficulty with regard to the phenomena of the internal sense in time being real things nay it even maintains that this internal experience alone sufficiently proves the real existence of its object by itself with all the determinations in time our own transcendental idealism on the contrary allows that the objects of external intuition may be real as they are perceived in space and likewise all changes in time as they are represented by the internal sense for as space itself is a form of that intuition which we call external and as there would be no empirical representation     at all unless there were objects in space we can and must admit the extended beings in it as real and the same applies to time space itself however as well as time and with them all phenomena are not things by themselves but representations and cannot exist outside our mind and even the internal sensuous intuition of our mind as an object of consciousness which is represented as determined by the succession of different states in time is not a real self as it exists by itself or what is called the transcendental subject but a phenomenon only given to the sensibility of this to us unknown being it cannot be admitted that this internal phenomenon exists as a thing by itself because it is under the condition of time which can never be the determination of anything by itself in space and time however the empirical truth of phenomena  0  is sufficiently established and kept quite distinct from a dream if both are properly and completely connected together in experience according to empirical laws the objects of experience are therefore never given by themselves but in our experience only and do not exist outside it that there may be inhabitants in     the moon though no man has ever seen them must be admitted but it means no more than that in the possible progress of our experience we may meet with them for everything is real that hangs together with a perception according to the laws of empirical progress they are therefore real if they are empirically connected with any real consciousness although they are not therefore real by themselves that is apart from that progress of experience nothing is really given to us but perception and the empirical progress from this to other possible perceptions for by themselves phenomena as mere representations are real in perception only which itself is nothing but the reality of an empirical representation that is phenomenal appearance to call a phenomenon a real thing before it is perceived means either that in the progress of experience we must meet with such a perception or it means nothing for that it existed by itself without any reference to our senses and possible experience might no doubt be said when we speak of a thing by itself we here are speaking however of a phenomenon only in space and time which are not determinations of things by themselves but only of our sensibility hence that which exists in them phenomena is not something by itself but consists in representations only     which unless they are given in us in perception exist nowhere  0  the faculty of sensuous intuition is really some kind of receptivity only according to which we are affected in a certain way by representations the mutual relation of which is a pure intuition of space and time mere forms of our sensibility and which if they are connected and determined in that relation of space and time according to the laws of the unity of experience are called objects the nonsensuous cause of these representations is entirely unknown to us and we can never perceive it as an object for such a cause would have to be represented neither in space nor in time which are conditions of sensuous representations only and without which we cannot conceive any intuition we may however call that purely intelligible cause of phenomena in general the transcendental object in order that we may have something which corresponds to sensibility as a kind of receptivity we may ascribe to that transcendental object the whole extent and connection of all our possible perceptions and we may say that it is given by itself antecedently to all experience phenomena however are given accordingly not by themselves but in experience only because they are mere representations which as perceptions     only signify a real object provided that the perception is connected with all others according to the rules of unity in experience thus we may say that the real things of time past are given in the transcendental object of experience but they only are objects to me and real in time past on the supposition that i conceive that a regressive series of possible perceptions whether by the light of history or by the vestiges of causes and effects in one word the course of the world leads according to empirical laws to a past series of time as a condition of  0  the present time it is therefore represented as real not by itself but in connection with a possible experience so that all past events from time immemorial and before my own existence mean after all nothing but the possibility of an extension of the chain of experience beginning with present perception and leading upwards to the conditions which determine it in time if therefore i represent to myself all existing objects of the senses at all times and in all spaces i do not place them before experience into space and time but the whole representation is nothing but the idea of a possible experience in its absolute completeness in that alone those objects which are nothing but mere representations are given and if we say that they exist before     my whole experience this only means that they exist in that part of experience to which starting from perception i have first to advance the cause of empirical conditions of that progress and consequently with what members or how far i may meet with certain members in that regressus is transcendental and therefore entirely unknown to me but that cause does not concern us but only the rule of the progress of experience in which objects namely phenomena are given to me in the end it is just the same whether i say that in the empirical progress in space i may meet with stars a hundred times more distant than the most distant which i see or whether i say that such stars are perhaps to be met with in space though no human being did ever or will ever see them for though as things by themselves they might be given without any relation to possible experience they are nothing to me and therefore no objects unless they can be comprehended in the series of the empirical regressus  0  only in another relation when namely these phenomena are meant to be used for the cosmological idea of an absolute whole and when we have to deal with a question that goes beyond the limits of possible experience the distinction of the mode in which the reality of those objects of the senses is taken becomes of importance in order     to guard against a deceptive error that would inevitably arise from a misinterpretation of our own empirical concepts section vii critical decision of the cosmological conflict of reason with itself the whole antinomy of pure reason rests on the dialectical argument that if the conditioned is given the whole series of conditions also is given as therefore the objects of the senses are given us as conditioned it follows etc through this argument the major of which seems so natural and selfevident cosmological ideas have been introduced corresponding in number to the difference of conditions in the synthesis of phenomena which constitute a series these cosmological ideas postulate the absolute totality of those series and thus place reason in inevitable contradiction with itself before however we show what is deceptive in this sophistical argument we must prepare ourselves for it by correcting and defining certain concepts occurring in it first the following proposition is clear and admits of no doubt that if the conditioned is given it imposes on us the regressus in the series of all conditions of     it for it follows from the very concept of the conditioned  0  that through it something is referred to a condition and if that condition is again conditioned to a more distant condition and so on through all the members of the series this proposition is really analytical and need not fear any transcendental criticism it is a logical postulate of reason to follow up through the understanding as far as possible that connection of a concept with its conditions which is inherent in the concept itself further if the conditioned as well as its conditions are things by themselves then if the former be given the regressus to the latter is not only required but is really given and as this applies to all the members of the series the complete series of conditions and with it the unconditioned also is given or rather it is presupposed that the conditioned which was possible through that series only is given here the synthesis of the conditioned with its condition is a synthesis of the understanding only which represents things as they are without asking whether and how we can arrive at the knowledge of them but if i have to deal with phenomena which as mere representations are not given at all unless i attain to a knowledge of them that is to the     phenomena themselves for they are nothing but empirical knowledge then i cannot say in the same sense that if the conditioned is given all its conditions as phenomena are also given and can therefore by no means conclude the absolute totality of the series for phenomena in their apprehension are themselves nothing but an empirical synthesis in space and time and are given therefore in that synthesis only now it follows by no means that if the conditioned as phenomenal is given the synthesis also that constitutes its empirical condition should thereby be  0  given at the same time and presupposed for this takes place in the regressus only and never without it what we may say in such a case is this that a regressus to the conditions that is a continued empirical synthesis in that direction is required and that conditions cannot be wanting that are given through that regressus hence we see that the major of the cosmological argument takes the conditioned in the transcendental sense of a pure category while the minor takes it in the empirical sense of a concept of the understanding referring to mere phenomena so that it contains that dialectical deceit which is called sophisma figurae dictionis that deceit  00 however is not artificial but a perfectly natural illusion of our common reason it is owing to it that in the major we presuppose the conditions and their series as it were on trust if anything is given as conditioned because this is no more than the logical postulate to assume complete premisses for any given conclusion nor does there exist in the connection of the conditioned with its condition any order of time but they are presupposed in themselves as given together it is equally natural also in the minor to look on phenomena as things by themselves and as objects given to the understanding only in the same manner as in the major as no account was taken of all the conditions of intuition under which alone objects can be given but there is an important distinction between these concepts which has been overlooked the synthesis of the conditioned with its condition and the whole series of conditions in the major was in no way limited by time and was free from any concept of succession the empirical synthesis on the contrary and the series of conditions in phenomena which was subsumed in the minor is necessarily  0  successive and given as such in time only therefore i had no right to assume the absolute totality of the synthesis and of the series represented by it in this case as well as in the former for in the former all the members of the series are given by themselves without determination in time while here they are possible through the successive regressus only which cannot exist  0  unless it is actually carried out after convicting them of such a mistake in the argument adopted by both parties as the foundation of their cosmological assertions both might justly be dismissed as not being able to produce any good title in support of their claims but even thus their quarrel is not yet ended as if it had been proved that both parties or one of them were wrong in the matter contended for in the conclusion though they had failed to support it by valid proof nothing seems clearer than that if one maintains that the world has a beginning and the other that it has no beginning but exists from all eternity one or the other must be right but if this were so as the arguments on both sides are equally clear it would still remain impossible ever to find out on which side the truth lies and the suit continues although both parties have been ordered to keep the peace before the tribunal of reason nothing remains therefore in order to settle the quarrel once for all and to the satisfaction of both parties but to convince them that though they can refute each other so eloquently they are really quarrelling about nothing and that a certain transcendental illusion has mocked them with a reality where no  0  reality exists we shall now enter upon this way of adjusting a dispute which cannot be adjudicated                                      0  the eleatic philosopher zeno a subtle dialectician was severely reprimanded by plato as a heedless sophist who in order to display his skill would prove a proposition by plausible arguments and subvert the same immediately afterwards by arguments equally strong he maintained for instance that god which to him was probably nothing more than the universe is neither finite nor infinite neither in motion nor at rest neither similar nor dissimilar to any other thing it seemed to his critics as if he had intended to deny completely both of the two selfcontradictory proposition which would be absurd but i do not think that he can be rightly charged with this we shall presently consider the first of these propositions more carefully with regard to the others if by the word god he meant the universe he could not but say that it is neither permanently present in its place at rest nor that it changes it in motion because all places exist in the universe only while the universe exists in no place if the universe comprehends in itself everything that exists it follows that it cannot be similar or dissimilar to any other thing because there is no other thing besides it with which it could be compared if two opposite  0  judgments presuppose an inadmissible condition they both in spite of their contradiction which however is no real contradiction fall to the ground because the condition fails under which alone either of the propositions was meant to be valid if somebody were to say that everybody has either a good or a bad smell a third case is possible namely that it has no smell at all in which case both contradictory propositions would be false if i say that it is either good smelling or not good smelling vel suaveolens vel non   0 suaveolens in that case the two judgments are contradictory and the former only is wrong while its contradictory opposite namely that some bodies are not good smelling comprehends those bodies also which have no smell at all in the former opposition per disparata the contingent condition of the concept of a body smell still remained in the contradictory judgment and was not eliminated by it so that the latter could not be called the contradictory opposite of the former if i say therefore that the world is either infinite in space or is not infinite non est infinitus then if the former proposition is wrong its contradictory opposite that the world is not infinite must be true i should thus only eliminate an infinite world without affirming another namely the finite but if i had said the world  0  is either infinite or finite notinfinite both statements may be false for i then look upon the world as by itself determined in regard to its extent and i do not only eliminate in the opposite statement the infinity and with it it may be its whole independent existence but i add a determination to the world as a thing existing by itself which may be false because the world may not be a thing by itself and therefore with regard to extension neither infinite nor finite this kind of opposition i may be allowed to call dialectical that the real contradiction the analytical opposition thus then of two judgments opposed to each other dialectically both may be false because the one does not only contradict the other but says something more than is requisite for a contradiction if we regard the two statements that the world is infinite in extension and that the world is finite in extension     as contradictory opposites we assume that the world the whole series of phenomena is a thing by itself for it remains whether i remove the infinite or the finite regressus in the series of its phenomena but if we remove this supposition or this transcendental illusion and deny that it is a thing by itself then the contradictory opposition of the two statements becomes  0  purely dialectical and as the world does not exist by itself independently of the regressive series of my representations it exists neither as a whole by itself infinite nor as a whole by itself finite it exists only in the empirical regressus in the series of phenomena and nowhere by itself hence if that series is always conditioned it can never exist as complete and the world is therefore not an inconditioned whole and does not exist as such either with infinite or finite extension what has here been said of the first cosmological idea namely that of the absolute totality of extension in phenomena applies to the others also the series of conditions is to be found only in the regressive synthesis never by itself as complete in phenomenon as an independent thing existing prior to every regressus hence i shall have to say that the number of parts in any given phenomenon is by itself neither finite nor infinite because a phenomenon does not exist by itself and its parts are only found through the regressus of the decomposing synthesis through and in the regressus and that regressus can never be given as absolutely complete whether as finite or as infinite the same applies to the series of causes one being prior to the other and to the series leading from conditioned to unconditioned necessary existence which can never be regarded either by  0      itself finite in its totality or infinite because as a series of subordinated representations it forms a dynamical regressus only and cannot exist prior to it by itself as a selfsubsistent series of things the antinomy of pure reason with regard to its cosmological ideas is therefore removed by showing that it is dialectical only and a conflict of an illusion produced by our applying the idea of absolute totality which exists only as a condition of things by themselves to phenomena which exist in our representation only and if they form a series in the successive regressus but nowhere else we may however on the other side derive from that antinomy a true if not dogmatical at least critical and doctrinal advantage namely by proving through it indirectly the transcendental ideality of phenomena in case anybody should not have been satisfied by the direct proof given in the transcendental æsthetic the proof would consist in the following dilemma if the world is a whole existing by itself it is either finite or infinite now the former as well as the latter proposition is false as has been shown by the proofs given in the antithesis on one and in the thesis on the other side it is false therefore that the world the sum total of all phenomena is a whole existing  0  by itself hence it follows that phenomena in general are nothing outside our representations which was what we meant by their transcendental ideality this remark is of some importance because it shows that our proofs of the fourfold antinomy were not mere sophistry but honest and correct always under the wrong supposition that phenomena or a world of sense which comprehends them all are things by themselves     the conflict of the conclusions drawn from this shows however that there is a flaw in the supposition and thus leads us to the discovery of the true nature of things as objects of the senses this transcendental dialectic therefore does not favour scepticism but only the sceptical method which can point to it as an example of its great utility if we allow the arguments of reason to fight against each other with perfect freedom from which something useful and serviceable for the correction of our judgments will always result though it may not be always that which we were looking for section viii the regulative principle of pure reason with regard to the cosmological ideas  0  as through the cosmological principle of totality no real maximum is given of the series of conditions in the world of sense as a thing by itself but can only be required in the regressus of that series that principle of pure reason if thus amended still retains its validity not indeed as an axiom requiring us to think the totality in the object as real but as a problem for the understanding and therefore for the subject encouraging us to undertake and to continue according to the completeness in the idea the regressus in the series of conditions of anything given as conditioned in our sensibility that is in space and time every condition which we can reach in examining given phenomena is again conditioned because these phenomena are not objects by themselves in which something     absolutely unconditioned might possibly exist but empirical representations only which always must have their condition in intuition whereby they are determined in space and time the principle of reason is therefore properly a rule only which in the series of conditions  0  of given phenomena postulates a regressus which is never allowed to stop at anything absolutely unconditioned it is therefore no principle of the possibility of experience and of the empirical knowledge of the objects of the senses and not therefore a principle of the understanding because every experience is according to a given intuition within its limits nor is it a constitutive principle of reason enabling us to extend the concept of the world of sense beyond all possible experience but it is merely a principle of the greatest possible continuation and extension of our experience allowing no empirical limit to be taken as an absolute limit it is therefore a principle of reason which as a rule postulates what we ought to do in the regressus but does not anticipate what may be given in the object before such regressus i therefore call it a regulative principle of reason while on the contrary the principle of the absolute totality of the series of conditions as given in the object the phenomena by itself would be a constitutive cosmological principle the hollowness of which i have tried to indicate by this very distinction thus preventing what otherwise would have inevitably happened through a transcendental surreptitious proceeding namely an idea which is to serve as a rule only being invested with objective reality in order properly to determine the meaning of this rule of pure reason it should be remarked first of all that it cannot tell us what the object is but only how   0     the empirical regressus is to be carried out in order to arrive at the complete concept of the object if we attempted the first it would become a constitutive principle such as pure reason can never supply it cannot therefore be our intention to say through this principle that a series of conditions of something given as conditioned is by itself either finite or infinite for in that case a mere idea of absolute totality produced in itself only would represent in thought an object such as can never be given in experience and an objective reality independent of empirical synthesis would have been attributed to a series of phenomena this idea of reason can therefore do no more than prescribe a rule to the regressive synthesis in the series of conditions according to which that synthesis is to advance from the conditioned through all subordinate conditions towards the unconditioned though it can never reach it for the absolutely unconditioned can never be met with in experience to this end it is necessary first of all to define accurately the synthesis of a series so far as it never is complete people are in the habit of using for this purpose two expressions which are meant to establish a difference though they are unable clearly to define the ground of the distinction mathematicians speak only of a progressus in infinitum those who enquire into concepts philosophers will admit instead the expression of a     progressus in indefinitum only without losing any time in the examination of the reasons which may have suggested such a distinction and of its useful or useless application i shall at once endeavour to define these concepts accurately for my own purpose of a straight line it can be said correctly that it may be     produced to infinity and here the distinction between an infinite and an indefinite progress progressus in indefinitum would be mere subtilty no doubt if we are told to carry on a line it would be more correct to add in indefinitum than in infinitum because the former means no more than produce it as far as you wish but the second you shall never cease producing it which can never be intended nevertheless if we speak only of what is possible the former expression is quite correct because we can always make it longer if we like without end the same applies in all cases where we speak only of the progressus that is of our proceeding from the condition to the conditioned for such progress proceeds in the series of phenomena without end from a given pair of parents we may in the descending line of generation proceed without end and conceive quite well that that line should so continue in the world for here reason never requires an absolute totality of the series     because it is not presupposed as a condition and as it were given datum but only as something conditioned that is capable only of being given dabile and can be added to without end the case is totally different with the problem how far the regressus from something given as conditioned may ascend in a series to its conditions whether i may call it a regressus into the infinite or only into the indefinite in indefinitum and whether i may ascend for instance from the men now living through the series of their ancestors in infinitum or whether i may only say that so far as i have gone back i have never met with an empirical ground for considering the series limited anywhere so that i feel justified and at the same time obliged     to search for an ancestor of every one of these ancestors though not to presuppose them i say therefore that where the whole is given in empirical intuition the regressus in the series of its internal conditions proceeds in infinitum while if a member only of a series is given from which the regressus to the absolute totality has first to be carried out the regressus is only in indefinitum thus we must     say that the division of matter as given between its limits a body goes on in infinitum because that matter is complete and therefore with all its possible parts given in empirical intuition as the condition of that whole consists in its part and the condition of that part in the part of that part and so on and as in this regressus of decomposition we never meet with an unconditioned indivisible member of that series of conditions there is nowhere an empirical ground for stopping the division nay the further members of that continued division are themselves empirically given before the continuation of the division and therefore the division goes on in infinitum the series of ancestors on the contrary of any given man exists nowhere in its absolute totality in any possible experience while the regressus goes on from every link in the generation to a higher one so that no empirical limit can be found which should represent a link as absolutely unconditioned as however the links too which might supply the condition do not exist in the empirical intuition of the whole prior to the regressus that regressus does not proceed in infinitum by a division of what is given but to an indefinite distance in its search for more links in addition to those which are given and which themselves are again always conditioned only     in neither case — the regressus in infinitum     nor the regressus in indefinitum — is the series of conditions to be considered as given as infinite in the object they are not things by themselves but phenomena only which as conditions of each other are given only in the regressus itself therefore the question is no longer how great this series of conditions may be by itself whether finite or infinite for it is nothing by itself but only how we are to carry out the empirical regressus and how far we may continue it and here we see a very important difference with regard to the rule of that progress if the whole is given empirically it is possible to go back in the series of its conditions in infinitum but if the whole is not given but has first to be given through an empirical regressus i can only say that it is possible to proceed to still higher conditions of the series in the former case i could say that more members exist and are empirically given than i can reach through the regressus of decomposition in the latter i can only say that i may advance still further in the regressus because no member is empirically given as absolutely unconditioned and a higher member therefore always possible and therefore the enquiry for it necessary in the former case it was necessary to find more members of the series in the latter it is necessary to enquire for more because no experience is absolutely limiting for     either you have no perception which absolutely limits your empirical regressus and in that case you cannot consider that regressus as complete or you have a perception which limits your series and in that case it cannot be a part of your finished series because what limits must be different from that which is limited by it and you must therefore continue your regressus to that condition also and so on for ever     the following section by showing their application will place these observations in their proper light section ix of the empirical use of the regulative principle of reason with regard to all cosmological ideas no transcendental use as we have shown on several occasions can be made of the concepts either of the understanding or of reason and the absolute totality of the series of conditions in the world of sense is due entirely to a transcendental use of reason which demands this unconditioned completeness from what presupposes as a thing by itself as no such thing is contained in the world of sense we can never speak again     of the absolute quantity of different series in it whether they be limited or in themselves unlimited but the question can only be how far in the empirical regressus we may go back in tracing experience to its conditions in order to stop according to the rule of reason at no other answer of its questions but such as is in accordance with the object what therefore remains to us is only the validity of the principle of reason as a rule for the continuation and for the extent of a possible experience after its invalidity as a constitutive principle of things by themselves has been sufficiently established if we have clearly established that invalidity the conflict of reason with itself will be entirely finished because not only has the illusion which led to that conflict been removed through critical analysis but in its place the sense in which reason agrees with   0 itself and the misapprehension of which was the only cause of conflict has been clearly exhibited and a principle formerly dialectical changed into a doctrinal one in fact if that principle according to its subjective meaning can be proved fit to determine the greatest possible use of the understanding in experience as adequate to its objects this would be the same as if it determined as an axiom which is impossible from pure reason the     objects themselves a priori for this also could not with reference to the objects of experience exercise a greater influence on the extension and correction of our knowledge than proving itself efficient in the most extensive use of our understanding as applied to experience i solution of the cosmological idea of the totality of the composition of phenomena in an universe here as well as in the other cosmological problems the regulative principle of reason is founded on the proposition that in the empirical regressus no experience of an absolute limit that is of any condition as such which empirically is absolutely unconditioned can exist the ground of this is that such an experience would contain a limitation of phenomena by nothing or by the void on which the continued regressus by means of experience must abut and this is impossible this proposition which says that in an empirical regressus i can only arrive at the condition which itself must be considered empirically conditioned     contains the rule in terminis that however far i may     have reached in the ascending series i must always enquire for a still higher member of that series whether it be known to me by experience or not for the solution therefore of the first cosmological problem nothing more is wanted than to determine whether in the regressus to the unconditioned extension of the universe in time and in space this nowhere limited ascent is to be called a regressus in infinitum or a regressus in indefinitum the mere general representation of the series of all past states of the world and of the things which exist together in space is itself nothing but a possible empirical regressus which i represent to myself though as yet as indefinite and through which alone the concept of such a series of conditions of the perception given to me can arise  now the universe exists for me as a concept only and never as a whole as an intuition hence     i cannot from its quantity conclude the quantity of the regressus and determine the one by the other but i must first frame to myself a concept of the quantity of the world through the quantity of the empirical regressus of this however i never know anything more than that empirically i must go on from every given member of the series of conditions to a higher and more distant member hence the quantity of the whole of phenomena is not absolutely determined and we cannot say therefore that it is     a regressus in infinitum because this would anticipate the members which the regressus has not yet reached and represent its number as so large that no empirical synthesis could ever reach it it would therefore though negatively only determine the quantity of the world prior to the regressus which is impossible because it is not given to me by any intuition in its totality so that its quantity cannot be given prior to the regressus hence we cannot say anything of the quantity or extension of the world by itself not even that there is in it a regressus in infinitum but we must look for the concept of its quantity according to the rule that determines the empirical regressus in it this rule however says no more than that however far we may have got in the series of empirical conditions we ought never to assume an absolute limit but subordinate every phenomenon as conditioned to another   0 as its condition and that we must proceed further to that condition this is the regressus in indefinitum which as it fixes no quantity in the object can clearly enough be distinguished from the regressus in infinitum i cannot say therefore that as to time past or as to space the world is infinite for such a concept of quantity as a given infinity is empirical and therefore with reference to the world as an object of the senses absolutely impossible nor shall i say that the regressus beginning with a given perception and going on to everything that limits it in a series both in space and in time past goes on in infinitum because this would presuppose an infinite quantity of the world nor can i say again that it is finite for the absolute limit is likewise empirically impossible hence it follows that i shall not be able to say anything of the whole object of experience the     world of sense but only of the rule according to which experience can take place and be continued in accordance with its object to the cosmological question therefore respecting the quantity of the world the first and negative answer is that the world has no first beginning in time and no extreme limit in space for in the contrary case the world would be limited by empty time and empty space as however     as a phenomenon it cannot by itself be either — a phenomenon not being a thing by itself — we should have to admit the perception of a limitation by means of absolute empty time or empty space by which these limits of the world could be given in a possible experience such an experience however would be perfectly void of contents and therefore impossible consequently an absolute limit of the world is impossible empirically and therefore absolutely also  from this follows at the same time the affirmative answer that the regressus in the series of the phenomena of the world intended as a determination of the quantity of the world goes on in indefinitum which is the same as if we say that the world of sense has no absolute quantity but that the empirical regressus through which alone it can be given on the side of its conditions has its own rule     namely to advance from every member of the series as conditioned to a more distant member whether by our own experience or by the guidance of history     or through the chain of causes and their effects and never to dispense with the extension of the possible empirical use of the understanding this being the proper and really only task of reason and its principles we do not prescribe by this a definite empirical regressus advancing without end in a certain class of phenomena as for instance that from a living person one ought always to ascend in a series of ancestors without ever expecting a first pair or in the series of cosmical bodies without admitting in the end an extremest sun all that is demanded is a progressus from phenomena to phenomena even if they should not furnish us with a real perception if it is too weak in degree to become experience in our consciousness because even thus they belong to a possible experience every beginning is in time and every limit of extension in space space and time however exist in the world of sense only hence phenomena only are limited in the world conditionally the world itself however is limited neither conditionally nor unconditionally for the same reason and because the world can never be given complete and even the series of conditions of something given as conditioned cannot as a cosmical series be given as complete the concept of the quantity of the world can be given through the regressus only and not before it in any collective intuition     that regressus however consists only in the determining of the quantity and does not give therefore any definite concept nor the concept of any quantity which     with regard to a certain measure could be called infinite it does not therefore proceed to the infinite as if given but only into an indefinite distance in order to give a quantity of experience which has first to be realised by that very regressus ii solution of the cosmological idea of the totality of the division of a whole given in intuition if i divide a whole given in intuition i proceed from the conditioned to the conditions of its possibility the division of the parts subdivisio or decompositio is a regressus in the series of those conditions the absolute totality of this series could only be given if the regressus could reach the simple parts but if all parts in a continuously progressing decomposition are always divisible again then the division that is the regressus from the conditioned to its conditions goes on in infinitum because the conditions the parts are contained in the conditioned itself and as that is given as complete in an     intuition enclosed within limits are all given with it the regressus must therefore not be called a regressus in indefinitum such as was alone allowed by the former cosmological idea where from the conditioned we had to proceed to conditions outside it and therefore not given at the same time through it but first to be added in the empirical regressus it is not allowed however even in the case of a whole that is divisible in infinitum to say that it consists of infinitely many parts for although all parts are contained in the intuition of the whole yet the whole division is not contained in it because it consists     in the continuous decomposition or in the regressus itself which first makes that series real as this regressus is infinite all members parts at which it arrives are contained no doubt in the given whole as aggregates but not so the whole series of the division which is successively infinite and never complete and cannot therefore represent an infinite number or any comprehension of it as a whole it is easy to apply this remark to space every space perceived within its limits is such a whole the parts of which in spite of all decomposition are always spaces again and therefore divisible in infinitum     from this follows quite naturally the second application to an external phenomenon enclosed within its limits body the divisibility of this is founded on the divisibility of space which constitutes the possibility of the body as an extended whole this is therefore divisible in infinitum without consisting however of an infinite number of parts it might seem indeed as a body must be represented as a substance in space that with regard to the law of the divisibility of space it might differ from it for we might possibly concede that in the latter case decomposition could never do away with all composition because in that case all space which besides has nothing independent of its own would cease to be which is impossible while even if all composition of matter should be done away with in thought it would not seem compatible with the concept of a substance that nothing should remain of it because substance is meant to be the subject of all composition and ought to remain in its     elements although their connection in space by which they become a body should have been removed but what applies to a thing by itself represented by a pure concept of the understanding does not apply to what is called substance as a phenomenon this is not an absolute subject but only a permanent image of sensibility nothing in fact but intuition     in which nothing unconditioned can ever be met with but although this rule of the progress in infinitum applies without any doubt to the subdivision of a phenomenon as a mere occupant of space it does not apply to the number of the parts separated already in a certain way in a given whole which thus constitute a quantum discretum to suppose that in every organised whole every part is again organised and that by thus dissecting the parts in infinitum we should meet again and again with new organised parts in fact that the whole is organised in infinitum is a thought difficult to think though it is possible to think that the parts of matter decomposed in infinitum might become organised for the infinity of the division of a given phenomenon in space is founded simply on this that by it divisibility only that is an entirely indefinite number of parts is given while the parts themselves can only be given and determined through the subdivision in short that the whole is not itself already divided thus the division can determine a number in it which goes so far as we like to go in the regressus of a division in an organic body on the contrary organised in infinitum the whole is by that very concept represented as     divided and a number of parts definite in itself and yet infinite is found in it before every regressus of division     this would be selfcontradictory because we should have to consider this infinite convolute as a nevertobecompleted series infinite and yet as complete in its organised comprehension infinite division takes the phenomenon only as a quantum continuum and is inseparable from the occupation of space because in this very occupation lies the ground of endless divisibility but as soon as anything is taken as a quantum discretum the number of units in it is determined and therefore at all times equal to a certain number how far the organisation in an organised body may go experience alone can show us but though it never arrived with certainty at any unorganised part they would still have to be admitted as lying within possible experience it is different with the transcendental division of a phenomenon how far that may extend is not a matter of experience but a principle of reason which never allows us to consider the empirical regressus in the decomposition of extended bodies according to the nature of these phenomena as at any time absolutely completed                                     concluding remarks on the solution of the transcendentalmathematical ideas and preliminary remark for the solution of the transcendentaldynamical ideas     when exhibiting in a tabular form the antinomy of pure reason through all the transcendental ideas and indicating the ground of the conflict and the only means of removing it by declaring both contradictory statements as false we always represented the conditions as belonging to that which they conditioned according to relations     of space and time this being the ordinary supposition of the common understanding and in fact the source from which that conflict arose in that respect all dialectical representations of the totality in a series of conditions of something given as conditioned were always of the same character it was always a series in which the condition was connected with the conditioned as members of the same series both being thus homogeneous in such a series the regressus was never conceived as completed or if that had to be done one of the members being in itself conditioned had wrongly to be accepted as the first and therefore as unconditioned if not always the object that is the conditioned yet the series of its conditions was always considered according     to quantity only and then the difficulty arose which could not be removed by any compromise but only by cutting the knot that reason made it either too long or too short for the understanding which could in neither case come up to the idea but in this we have overlooked an essential distinction between the objects that is the concepts of the understanding which reason tries to raise into ideas two of them according to the above table of the categories imply a mathematical the remaining two a dynamical synthesis of phenomena hitherto this overlooking was of no great importance because in the general representation of all transcendental ideas we always remained under phenomenal conditions and with regard to the two transcendentalmathematical ideas also we had to do with no object but the phenomenal only now however as we have come to consider the dynamical concepts of the understanding so far as they should be rendered adequate to the idea of   0 reason that distinction becomes important and opens to us an entirely new insight into the character of the suit in which reason is implicated that suit had before been dismissed as resting on both sides on wrong presuppositions now however as there seems to be in the dynamical   0 antinomy such a presupposition as may be compatible with the pretensions of reason and as the judge himself supplies perhaps the deficiency of legal grounds which had been misunderstood on both sides the suit may possibly be adjusted from this point of view to the satisfaction of both parties which was impossible in the conflict of the mathematical antinomy if we merely look to the extension of the series of conditions and whether they are adequate to the idea or whether the idea is too large or too small for them the series are no doubt all homogeneous but the concept of the understanding on which these ideas are founded contains either a synthesis of the homogeneous only which is presupposed in the composition as well as the decomposition of every quantity or of the heterogeneous also which must at least be admitted as possible in the dynamical synthesis both in a causal connection and in the connection of the necessary with the contingent thus it happens that none but sensuous conditions can enter into the mathematical connection of the series of phenomena that is conditions which themselves are part of the series while the dynamical series of sensuous conditions admits also of a heterogeneous condition which is not a part of the series but as merely intelligible outside it so that a certain satisfaction is given to reason     by the unconditioned being placed before the phenomena without disturbing the series of the phenomena which     must always be conditioned or breaking it off contrary to the principles of the understanding owing to the dynamical ideas admitting of a condition of the phenomena outside their series that is a condition which itself is not a phenomenon something arises which is totally different from the result of the mathematical  antinomy the result of that antinomy was that both the contradictory dialectical statements had to be declared false the throughout conditioned character however of the dynamical series which is inseparable from them as phenomena if connected with the empirically unconditioned but at the same time not sensuous condition may give satisfaction to the understanding on one and the reason on the other side  because the dialectical arguments which in some way or other required unconditioned totality in mere phenomena vanish while the     propositions of reason if thus amended may both be true this cannot be the case with the cosmological ideas which refer only to a mathematically unconditioned unity because with them no condition can be found in the series of phenomena which is not itself a phenomenon and as such constitutes one of the links of the series     iii solution of the cosmological ideas with regard to the totality of the derivation of cosmical events from their causes we can conceive two kinds of causality only with reference to events causality either of nature or of freedom the former is the connection of one state in the world of sense with a preceding state on which it follows according to a rule as the causality of phenomena depends on conditions of time and as the preceding state if it had always existed could not have produced an effect which first takes place in time it follows that the causality of the cause of that which happens or arises must according to the principle of the understanding have itself arisen and require a cause by freedom on the contrary in its cosmological     meaning i understand the faculty of beginning a state spontaneously its causality therefore does not depend according to the law of nature on another cause by which it is determined in time in this sense freedom is a purely transcendental idea which first contains nothing derived from experience and secondly the object of which cannot be determined in any experience because it is a general rule even of the possibility of all experience that everything which happens has a cause and that therefore the causality also of the cause which itself has happened or arisen must again have a cause in this manner the whole field of experience however far it may extend has been changed into one great whole of nature as however it is impossible in this way to arrive at an absolute     totality of the conditions in causal relations reason creates for itself the idea of spontaneity or the power of beginning by itself without an antecedent cause determining it to action according to the law of causal connection it is extremely remarkable that the practical concept of freedom is founded on the transcendental idea of freedom which constitutes indeed the real difficulty which at all times has surrounded the question of the possibility of freedom freedom in its practical sense is the     independence of our arbitrary will from the coercion through sensuous impulses our arbitrary will is sensuous so far as it is affected pathologically by sensuous impulses it is called animal arbitrium brutum if necessitated pathologically the human will is certainly sensuous an arbitrium sensitivum but not brutum but liberum because sensuous impulses do not necessitate its action but there is in man a faculty of determination independent of the necessitation through sensuous impulses it can easily be seen that if all causality in the world of sense belonged to nature every event would be determined in time through another according to necessary laws as therefore the phenomena in determining the will would render every act necessary as their natural effect the annihilation of transcendental freedom would at the same time destroy all practical freedom practical freedom presupposes that although something has not happened it ought to have happened and that its cause therefore had not that determining force among phenomena which could prevent the causality of our will from producing independently of those natural causes and even contrary to their force and influence something determined     in the order of time according to empirical laws and from originating entirely by itself a series of events what happens here is what happens generally     in the conflict of reason venturing beyond the limits of possible experience namely that the problem is not physiological but transcendental hence the question of the possibility of freedom concerns no doubt psychology but its solution as it depends on dialectical arguments of pure reason belongs entirely to transcendental philosophy in order to enable that philosophy to give a satisfactory answer which it cannot decline to do i must first try to determine more accurately its proper procedure in this task if phenomena were things by themselves and therefore space and time forms of the existence of things by themselves the conditions together with the conditioned would always belong as members to one and the same series and thus in our case also the antinomy which is common to all transcendental ideas would arise namely that that series is inevitably too large or too small for the understanding the dynamical concepts of reason however which we have to discuss in this and the following section have this peculiarity that as they are not concerned with an object considered as a quantity but only with its existence we need take no account of the quantity of the series of conditions all depends here only on     the dynamical relation of conditions to the conditioned so that in the question on nature and freedom we at once meet with the difficulty whether freedom is indeed possible and whether if it is possible it can exist together with the universality of the natural law of causality the question in fact arises whether it is a proper disjunctive proposition to say that every effect in the world must arise     either from nature or from freedom or whether both cannot coexist in the same event in different relations the correctness of the principle of the unbroken connection of all events in the world of sense according to unchangeable natural laws is firmly established by the transcendental analytic and admits of no limitation the question therefore can only be whether in spite of it freedom also can be found in the same effect which is determined by nature or whether freedom is entirely excluded by that inviolable rule here the common but fallacious supposition of the absolute reality of phenomena shows at once its pernicious influence in embarrassing reason for if phenomena are things by themselves freedom cannot be saved nature in that case is the complete and sufficient cause determining every event and its condition is always contained in that series of phenomena only which together with their effect are necessary under the law of nature if on the contrary phenomena are taken for     nothing except what they are in reality namely not things by themselves but representations only which are connected with each other according to empirical laws they must themselves have causes which are not phenomenal such an intelligible cause however is not determined with reference to its causality by phenomena although its effects become phenomenal and can thus be determined by other phenomena that intelligible cause therefore with its causality is outside the series though its effects are to be found in the series of empirical conditions the effect therefore can with reference to its intelligible cause be considered as free and yet at the same time with reference to phenomena as resulting from them according to the necessity of nature a distinction which if thus represented     in a general and entirely abstract form may seem extremely subtle and obscure but will become clear in its practical application here i only wished to remark that as the unbroken connection of all phenomena in the context woof of nature is an unalterable law it would necessarily destroy all freedom if we were to defend obstinately the reality of phenomena those therefore who follow the common opinion on this subject have never been able to reconcile nature and freedom possibility of a causality through freedom in harmony with the universal law of natural necessity     whatever in an object of the senses is not itself phenomenal i call intelligible if therefore what in the world of sense must be considered as phenomenal possesses in itself a faculty which is not the object of sensuous intuition but through which it can become the cause of phenomena the causality of that being may be considered from two sides as intelligible in its action as the causality of a thing by itself and as sensible in the effects of the action as the causality of a phenomenon in the world of sense of the faculty of such a being we should have to form both an empirical and an intellectual concept of its causality both of which consist together in one and the same effect this twofold way of conceiving the faculty of an object of the senses does not contradict any of the concepts which we have to form of phenomena and of a possible experience for as all phenomena not being things by themselves must have for their foundation a transcendental object determining them as mere representations there is nothing to prevent us from attributing     to that transcendental object besides the     quality through which it becomes phenomenal a causality also which is not phenomenal although its effect appears in the phenomenon every efficient cause however must have a character that is a rule according to which it manifests its causality and without which it would not be a cause according to this we should have in every subject of the world of sense first an empirical character through which its acts as phenomena stand with other phenomena in an unbroken connection according to permanent laws of nature and could be derived from them as their conditions and in connection with them form the links of one and the same series in the order of nature secondly we should have to allow to it an intelligible character also by which it is true it becomes the cause of the same acts as phenomena but which itself is not subject to any conditions of sensibility and never phenomenal we might call the former the character of such a thing as a phenomenon in the latter the character of the thing by itself according to its intelligible character this active subject would not depend on conditions of time for time is only the condition of phenomena and not of things by themselves in it no act would arise or perish   0 neither would it be subject therefore to the law of determination in time and of all that is changeable namely that everything which happens must have its cause in the phenomena of the previous state in one word its causality so far as it is intelligible would not have a place in the series of empirical conditions by which the event is rendered necessary in the world of sense it is true that that intelligible character could never be known immediately     because we cannot perceive anything except so far as it appears but it would nevertheless have to be conceived according to the empirical character as we must always admit in thought a transcendental object as the foundation of phenomena though we know nothing of what it is by itself in its empirical character therefore that subject as a phenomenon would submit according to all determining laws to a causal nexus and in that respect it would be nothing but a part of the world of sense the effects of which like every other phenomenon would arise from nature without fail as soon as external phenomena began to influence it and as soon as its empirical character that is the law of its causality had been known through experience all its actions ought to admit of explanation according to the laws of nature and all that is requisite for its complete and necessary determination would be found in a possible experience in its intelligible character however though     we could only have a general concept of it the same subject would have to be considered free from all influence of sensibility and from all determination through phenomena and as in it so far as it is a noumenon nothing happens and no change which requires dynamical determination of time and therefore no connection with phenomena as causes can exist that active being would so far be quite independent and free in its acts from all natural necessity which can exist in the world of sense only one might say of it with perfect truth that it originates its effects in the world of sense by itself though the act does not begin in itself and this would be perfectly true though the effects in the world of sense need not     therefore originate by themselves because in it they are always determined previously through empirical conditions in the previous time though only by means of the empirical character which is the phenomenal appearance of the intelligible character and therefore impossible except as a continuation of the series of natural causes in this way freedom and nature each in its complete signification might exist together and without any conflict in the same action according as we refer it to its intelligible or to its sensible cause explanation of the cosmological idea of freedom in connection with the general necessity of nature     i thought it best to give first this sketch of the solution of our transcendental problem so that the course which reason has to adopt in its solution might be more clearly surveyed we shall now proceed to explain more fully the points on which the decision properly rests and examine each by itself the law of nature that everything which happens has a cause — that the causality of that cause that is its activity as it is anterior in time and with regard to an effect which has arisen cannot itself have always existed but must have happened at some time must have its cause among the phenomena by which it is determined and that therefore all events in the order of nature are empirically determined this law i say through which alone phenomena become nature and objects of experience is a law of the understanding which can on no account be surrendered and from which no single phenomenon can be exempted because in doing this we should place it outside all possible experience separate from all objects of possible       0 experience and change it into a mere fiction of the mind or a cobweb of the brain but although this looks merely like a chain of causes which in the regressus to its conditions admits of no absolute totality this difficulty does not detain us in the least because it has already been removed in the general criticism of the antinomy of reason when starting from the series of phenomena it aims at the unconditioned were we to yield to the illusion of transcendental realism we should have neither nature nor freedom the question therefore is whether if we recognise in the whole series of events nothing but natural necessity we may yet regard the same event which on one side is an effect of nature only on the other side as an effect of freedom or whether there is a direct contradiction between these two kinds of causality there can certainly be nothing among phenomenal causes that could originate a series absolutely and by itself every action as a phenomenon so far as it produces an event is itself an event presupposing another state in which its cause can be discovered and thus everything that happens is only a continuation of the series and no beginning happening by itself is possible in it actions of natural causes in the succession of time are therefore themselves effects which likewise     presuppose causes in the series of time a spontaneous and original action by which something takes place which did not exist before cannot be expected from the causal nexus of phenomena but is it really necessary that if effects are phenomena the causality of their cause which cause itself is phenomenal could be nothing but empirical or is it not possible although for every phenomenal effect a connection with its     cause according to the laws of empirical causality is certainly required that empirical causality itself could nevertheless without breaking in the least its connection with the natural causes represent an effect of a nonempirical and intelligible causality that is of a caused action original in respect to phenomena and in so far not phenomenal but with respect to this faculty intelligible although as a link in the chain of nature to be regarded as entirely belonging to the world of sense we require the principle of the causality of phenomena among themselves in order to be able to look for and to produce natural conditions that is phenomenal causes of natural events if this is admitted and not weakened by any exceptions the understanding which in its empirical employment recognises in all events nothing but nature and is quite justified in doing so has really all     that it can demand and the explanations of physical phenomena may proceed without let or hindrance the understanding would not be wronged in the least if we assumed though it be a mere fiction that some among the natural causes have a faculty which is intelligible only and whose determination to activity does not rest on empirical conditions but on mere grounds of the intellect if only the phenomenal activity of that cause is in accordance with all the laws of empirical causality for in this way the active subject as causa phaenomenon would be joined with nature through the indissoluble dependence of all its actions and the noumenon  only of that subject with all its phenomenal causality would contain certain conditions which if we want to ascend from the empirical to the transcendental     object would have to be considered as intelligible only for if only we follow the rule of nature in that which may be the cause among phenomena it is indifferent to us what kind of ground of those phenomena and of their connection may be conceived to exist in the transcendental subject which is empirically unknown to us this intelligible ground does not touch the empirical questions but concerns only as it would seem the thought in the pure understanding and although the effects of that thought and action of the pure understanding may be discovered     in the phenomena these have nevertheless to be completely explained from their phenomenal cause according to the laws of nature by taking their empirical character as the highest ground of explanation and passing by the intelligible character which is the transcendental cause of the other as entirely unknown except so far as it is indicated by the empirical as its sensuous sign let us apply this to experience man is one among the phenomena of the world of sense and in so far one of the natural causes the causality of which must be subject to empirical laws as such he must therefore have an empirical character like all other objects of nature we perceive it through the forces and faculties which he shows in his actions and effects in the lifeless or merely animal nature we see no ground for admitting any faculty except as sensuously conditioned man however who knows all the rest of nature through his senses only knows himself through mere apperception also and this in actions and internal determinations which he cannot ascribe to the impressions of the senses man is thus to himself partly a phenomenon partly however namely with reference to certain faculties a purely intelligible     object because the actions of these faculties cannot be ascribed to the receptivity of sensibility we     call these faculties understanding and reason it is the latter in particular which is entirely distinguished from all empirically conditioned forces or faculties because it weighs its objects according to ideas and determines the understanding accordingly which then makes an empirical use of its by themselves however pure concepts that our reason possesses causality or that we at least represent to ourselves such a causality in it is clear from the imperatives which in all practical matters we impose as rules on our executive powers the ought expresses a kind of necessity and connection with causes which we do not find elsewhere in the whole of nature the understanding can know in nature only what is present past or future it is impossible that anything in it ought to be different from what it is in reality in all these relations of time nay if we only look at the course of nature the ought has no meaning whatever we cannot ask what ought to be in nature as little as we can ask what qualities a circle ought to possess we can only ask what happens in it and what qualities that which happens has this ought expresses a possible action the ground of which cannot be anything but a mere concept while in every merely natural action the ground must     always be a phenomenon now it is quite true that the action to which the ought applies must be possible under natural conditions but these natural conditions do not affect the determination of the will itself but only its effects and results among phenomena there may be ever so many natural grounds which impel me to will and     ever so many sensuous temptations but they can never produce the ought but only a willing which is always conditioned but by no means necessary and to which the ought pronounced by reason opposes measure ay prohibition and authority whether it be an object of the senses merely pleasure or of pure reason the good reason does not yield to the impulse that is given empirically and does not follow the order of things as they present themselves as phenomena but frames for itself with perfect spontaneity a new order according to ideas to which it adapts the empirical conditions and according to which it declares actions to be necessary even though they have not taken place and maybe never will take place yet it is presupposed that reason may have causality with respect to them for otherwise no effects in experience could be expected to result from these ideas now let us take our stand here and admit it at least as possible that reason really possesses causality     with reference to phenomena in that case reason though it be it must show nevertheless an empirical character because every cause presupposes a rule according to which certain phenomena follow as effects and every rule requires in the effects a homogeneousness on which the concept of cause as a faculty is founded this so far as it is derived from mere phenomena may be called the empirical character which is permanent while the effects according to a diversity of concomitant and in part restraining conditions appear in changeable forms every man therefore has an empirical character of his arbitrary will which is nothing but a certain causality of his reason exhibiting in its phenomenal actions and effects a rule according to which one may infer the motives of     reason and its actions both in kind and in degree and judge of the subjective principles of his will as that empirical character itself must be derived from phenomena as an effect and from their rule which is supplied by experience all the acts of a man so far as they are phenomena are determined from his empirical character and from the other concomitant causes according to the order of nature and if we could investigate all the manifestations of his will to the very bottom there would be not a single human action which we could not predict   0 with certainty and recognise from its preceding conditions as necessary there is no freedom therefore with reference to this empirical character and yet it is only with reference to it that we can consider man when we are merely observing and as is the case in anthropology trying to investigate the motive causes of his actions physiologically if however we consider the same actions with reference to reason not with reference to speculative reason in order to explain their origin but solely so far as reason is the cause which produces them in one word if we compare actions with reason with reference to practical purposes we find a rule and order totally different from the order of nature for from this point of view everything it may be ought not to have happened which according to the course of nature has happened and according to its empirical grounds was inevitable and sometimes we find or believe at least that we find that the ideas of reason have really proved their causality with reference to human actions as phenomena and that these actions have taken place not because they were determined by empirical causes but by the causes of reason     now supposing one could say that reason     possesses causality in reference to phenomena could the action of reason be called free in that case as it is accurately determined by the empirical character the disposition and rendered necessary by it that character again is determined in the intelligible character way of thinking the latter however we do not know but signify only through phenomena which in reality give us immediately a knowledge of the disposition empirical character only  an action so far as it is to be attributed to the way of thinking as its cause does nevertheless not result from it according to empirical laws that is it is not preceded by the conditions of pure reason but only by its effects in the phenomenal form of the internal sense pure reason as a simple intelligible faculty is not subject to the form of time or to the conditions of the succession of time the causality of reason in its intelligible character does not arise or begin at a certain time in order to produce an effect for in that case it would be subject to the natural law of phenomena which determines     all causal series in time and its causality would then be nature and not freedom what therefore we can say is that if reason can possess causality with reference to phenomena it is a faculty through which the sensuous condition of an empirical series of effects first begins for the condition that lies in reason is not sensuous and     therefore does itself not begin thus we get what we missed in all empirical series namely that the condition of a successive series of events should itself be empirically unconditioned for here the condition is really outside the series of phenomena in the intelligible and therefore not subject to any sensuous condition nor to any temporal determination through preceding causes nevertheless the same cause belongs also in another respect to the series of phenomena man himself is a phenomenon his will has an empirical character which is the empirical cause of all his actions there is no condition determining man according to this character that is not contained in the series of natural effects and subject to their law according to which there can be no empirically unconditioned causality of anything that happens in time no given action therefore as it can be perceived as a phenomenon only can begin absolutely by itself of pure reason however we cannot     say that the state in which it determines the will is preceded by another in which that state itself is determined for as reason itself is not a phenomenon and not subject to any of the conditions of sensibility there exists in it even in reference to its causality no succession of time and the dynamical law of nature which determines the succession of time according to rules cannot be applied to it reason is therefore the constant condition of all free actions by which man takes his place in the phenomenal world every one of them is determined beforehand in his empirical character before it becomes actual with regard to the intelligible character however of which the empirical is only the sensuous schema there is neither     before nor after and every action without regard to the temporal relation which connects it with other phenomena is the immediate effect of the intelligible character of pure reason that reason therefore acts freely without being determined dynamically in the chain of natural causes by external or internal conditions anterior in time that freedom must then not only be regarded negatively as independence of empirical conditions for in that case the faculty of reason would cease to be a cause of phenomena but should be determined positively also as the faculty of beginning spontaneously a series of events hence nothing begins in reason itself     and being itself the unconditioned condition of every free action reason admits of no condition antecedent in time above itself while nevertheless its effect takes its beginning in the series of phenomena though it can never constitute in that series an absolutely first beginning in order to illustrate the regulative principle of reason by an example of its empirical application not in order to confirm it for such arguments are useless for transcendental propositions let us take a voluntary action for example a malicious lie by which a man has produced a certain confusion in society and of which we first try to find out the motives and afterwards try to determine how far it and its consequences may be imputed to the offender with regard to the first point one has first to follow up his empirical character to its very sources which are to be found in wrong education bad society in part also in the viciousness of a natural disposition and a nature insensible to shame or ascribed to frivolity and heedlessness not omitting the occasioning causes at the time in all this the procedure is exactly the same as     in the investigation of a series of determining causes of a given natural effect but although one believes that the act was thus determined one nevertheless     blames the offender and not on account of his unhappy natural disposition not on account of influencing circumstances not even on acconnt of his former course of life because one supposes one might leave entirely out of account what that course of life may have been and consider the past series of conditions as having never existed and the act itself as totally unconditioned by previous states as if the offender had begun with it a new series of effects quite by himself this blame is founded on a law of reason reason being considered as a cause which independent of all the beforementioned empirical conditions would and should have determined the behaviour of the man otherwise nay we do not regard the causality of reason as a concurrent agency only but as complete in itself even though the sensuous motives did not favour but even oppose it the action is imputed to a mans intelligible character at the moment when he tells the lie the guilt is entirely his that is we regard reason in spite of all empirical conditions of the act as completely free and the act has to be imputed entirely to a fault of reason such an imputation clearly shows that we imagine that reason is not affected at all by the influences of the senses and that it does not change although its manifestations that is the mode in which it shows itself by its     effects do change that in it no state precedes as determining a following state in fact that reason does not belong to the series of sensuous conditions which render phenomena necessary according to laws of nature reason   0 it is supposed is present in all the actions of man in all circumstances of time and always the same but it is itself never in time never in a new state in which it was not before it is determining never determined we cannot ask therefore why reason has not determined itself differently but only why it has not differently determined the phenomena by its causality and here no answer is really possible for a different intelligible character would have given a different empirical character and if we say that in spite of the whole of his previous course of life the offender could have avoided the lie this only means that it was in the power of reason and that reason in its causality is subject to no phenomenal and temporal conditions and lastly that the difference of time though it makes a great difference in phenomena and their relation to each other can as these are neither things nor causes by themselves produce no difference of action in reference to reason we thus see that in judging of voluntary     actions we can so far as their causality is concerned get only so far as the intelligible cause but not beyond we can see that that cause is free that it determines as independent of sensibility and therefore is capable of being the sensuously unconditioned condition of phenomena to explain why that intelligible character should under present circumstances give these phenomena and this empirical character and no other transcends all the powers of our reason nay all its rights of questioning as if we were to ask why the transcendental object of our external sensuous intuition gives us intuition in space only and no other but the problem which we have to solve does not require us to ask or to answer such questions our     problem was whether freedom is contradictory to natural necessity in one and the same action and this we have sufficiently answered by showing that freedom may have relation to a very different kind of conditions from those of nature so that the law of the latter does not affect the former and both may exist independent of and undisturbed by each other                                     it should be clearly understood that in what we have said we had no intention of establishing the reality of freedom as one of the faculties which contain     the cause of the phenomenal appearances in our world of sense for not only would this have been no transcendental consideration at all which is concerned with concepts only but it could never have succeeded because from experience we can never infer anything but what must be represented in thought according to the laws of experience it was not even our intention to prove the possibility of freedom for in this also we should not have succeeded because from mere concepts a priori we can never know the possibility of any real ground or any causality we have here treated freedom as a transcendental idea only which makes reason imagine that it can absolutely begin the series of phenomenal conditions through what is sensuously unconditioned but by which reason becomes involved in an antinomy with its own laws which it had prescribed to the empirical use of the understanding that this antinomy rests on a mere illusion and that nature does not contradict the causality of freedom that was the only thing which we could prove and cared to prove     iv solution of the cosmological idea of the totality of the dependence of phenomena with regard to their existence in general     in the preceding article we considered the changes in the world of sense in their dynamical succession every one being subordinate to another as its cause now however the succession of states is to serve only as our guide in order to arrive at an existence that might be the highest condition of all that is subject to change namely the necessary being we are concerned here not with the unconditioned causality but with the unconditioned existence of the substance itself therefore the succession which we have before us is properly one of concepts and not of intuitions so far as the one is the condition of the other it is easy to see however that as everything comprehended under phenomena is changeable and therefore conditioned in its existence there cannot be in the whole series of dependent existence any unconditioned link the existence of which might be considered as absolutely necessary and that therefore if phenomena were things by themselves and their condition accordingly belonged with the conditioned always to one and the same series of intuitions a necessary being as the condition of   0 the existence of the phenomena of the world of sense could never exist the dynamical regressus has this peculiar distinction as compared with the mathematical that as the latter is only concerned with the composition of parts in forming a whole or the division of a whole into its parts the conditions of     that series must always be considered as parts of it and therefore as homogeneous and as phenomena while in the dynamical regressus where we are concerned not with the possibility of an unconditioned whole consisting of a number of given parts or of an unconditioned part belonging to a given whole but with the derivation of a state from its cause or of the contingent existence of the substance itself from the necessary substance it is not required that the condition should form one and the same empirical series with the conditioned there remains therefore to us another escape from this apparent antinomy because both conflicting propositions might under different aspects be true at the same time that is all things of the world of sense might be entirely contingent and have therefore an empirically conditioned existence only though there might nevertheless be a nonempirical condition of the whole series that is an unconditionally necessary being for this as an intelligible condition would not belong to the series as a link of it not even as the highest link nor would it render any link of that series empirically unconditioned     but would leave the whole world of sense in all its members in its empirically conditioned existence this manner of admitting an unconditioned existence as the ground of phenomena would differ from the empirically unconditioned causality freedom treated of in the preceding article because with respect to freedom the thing itself as cause substantia phaenomenon belonged to the series of conditions and its causality only was represented as intelligible while here on the contrary the necessary being has to be conceived as lying outside the series of the world of sense as ens extramundanum and as purely     intelligible by which alone it could be guarded against itself becoming subject to the law of contingency and dependence applying to all phenomena the regulative principle of reason with regard to our present problem is therefore this that everything in the world of sense has an empirically conditioned existence and that in it there is never any unconditioned necessity with reference to any quality that there is no member in the series of conditions of which one ought not to expect and as far as possible to seek the empirical condition in some possible experience and that we are never justified in deriving any existence from a condition outside the empirical series or in considering it as independent and selfsubsistent in the series itself without however denying in the least that the whole     series may depend on some intelligible being which is free therefore from all empirical conditions and itself contains rather the ground of the possibility of all those phenomena by this we by no means intend to prove the unconditionally necessary existence of such a being or even to demonstrate the possibility of a purely intelligible condition of the existence of the phenomena of the world of sense but as on the one side we limit reason lest it should lose the thread of the empirical condition and lose itself in transcendent explanations incapable of being represented in concreto thus on the other side we want to limit the law of the purely empirical use of the understanding lest it should venture to decide on the possibility of things in general and declare the intelligible to be impossible because it has been shown to be useless for the explanation of phenomena what is shown by this     is simply this that the complete contingency of all things in nature and of all their empirical conditions may well coexist with the arbitrary presupposition of a necessary though purely intelligible condition and that as there is no real contradiction between these two views they may well both be true granted even that such an absolutely necessary being as postulated by the understanding     is impossible in itself we still maintain that this cannot be concluded from the general contingency and dependence of all that belongs to the world of sense nor from the principle that we ought not to stop at any single member so far as it is contingent and appeal to a cause outside the world reason follows its own course in its empirical and again a peculiar course in its transcendental use the world of sense contains nothing but phenomena and these are mere representations which are always sensuously conditioned as our objects are never things by themselves we need not be surprised that we are never justified in making a jump from any member of the several empirical series beyond the connection of sensibility as if they were things by themselves existing apart from their transcendental ground and which we might leave behind in order to seek for the cause of their existence outside them this no doubt would have to be done in the end with contingent things but not with mere representations of things the contingency of which is itself a phenomenon and cannot lead to any other regressus but that which determines the phenomena that is which is empirical to conceive however an intelligible ground of phenomena that is of the world of sense and to conceive it as freed from the contingency of the latter does     not run counter either to the unlimited empirical regressus in the series of phenomena nor to their general contingency and this is really the only thing which     we had to do in order to remove this apparent antinomy and which could be done in this wise only for if every condition of everything conditioned according to its existence is sensuous and therefore belongs to the series that series is again conditioned as shown in the antithesis of the fourth antinomy either therefore there would remain a conflict with reason which postulates the unconditioned or this would have to be placed outside the series ie in the intelligible the necessity of which neither requires nor admits of any empirical condition and is therefore as regards phenomena unconditionally necessary the empirical use of reason with regard to the conditions of existence in the world of sense is not affected by the admission of a purely intelligible being but ascends according to the principle of a general contingency from empirical conditions to higher ones which again are empirical this regulative principle however does not exclude the admission of an intelligible cause not comprehended in the series when we come to the pure use of reason with reference to ends or aims for in this case an intelligible cause only means the transcendental and to us unknown ground of the possibility of the sensuous series in general and the existence of this independent of all conditions of the sensuous series and in reference to it unconditionally necessary is by     no means opposed to the unlimited contingency of the former nor to the neverending regressus in the series of empirical conditions     concluding remark on the whole antinomy of pure reason so long as it is only the totality of the conditions in the world of sense and the interest it can have to reason that form the object of the concepts of our reason our ideas are no doubt transcendental but yet cosmological if however we place the unconditioned with which we are chiefly concerned in that which is entirely outside the world of sense therefore beyond all possible experience our ideas become transcendent for they serve not only for the completion of the empirical use of the understanding which always remains an idea that must be obeyed though it can never be fully carried out but they separate themselves entirely from it and create to themselves objects the material of which is not taken from experience and the objective reality of which does not rest on the completion of the empirical series but on pure concepts a priori such transcendent ideas have a merely intelligible object which may indeed be admitted as a transcendental object of which for the rest we know nothing but for which if we wish to conceive it as a thing determined by its internal distinguishing predicates we have neither     grounds of possibility as independent of all concepts of experience nor the slightest justification on our side in admitting it as an object and which therefore is a mere creation of our thoughts nevertheless that cosmological idea which owes its origin to the fourth antinomy urges us on to take that step for the conditioned existence of all phenomena not being founded in itself requires us to look out for something different from all phenomena that is for an intelligible object in which there should be no     more contingency as however if we have once allowed ourselves to admit outside the field of the whole of sensibility a reality existing by itself phenomena can only be considered as contingent modes of representing intelligible objects on the part of beings which themselves are intelligences  nothing remains to us in order to form some kind of concept of intelligible things of which in themselves we have not the slightest knowledge but analogy applied to the concepts of experience as we know the contingent by experience only but have here to deal with things which are not meant to be objects of experience we shall have to derive our knowledge of them from what is necessary in itself that is from pure concepts of things in general thus the first step which we take     outside the world of sense obliges us to begin our new knowledge with the investigation of the absolutely necessary being and to derive from its concepts the concepts of all things so far as they are intelligible only and this we shall attempt to do in the next chapter     chapter iii the ideal of pure reason section i of the ideal in general we have seen that without the conditions of sensibility it is impossible to represent objects by means of the pure concepts of the understanding because the conditions of their objective reality are absent and they contain the mere form of thought only if however we apply these concepts to phenomena they can be represented in concreto because in the phenomena they have the material for forming concepts of experience which are nothing but concepts of the understanding in concreto ideas however are still further removed from objective reality than the categories because they can meet with no phenomenon in which they could be represented in concreto they contain a certain completeness unattainable by any     possible empirical knowledge and reason aims in them at a systematical unity only to which the empirically possible unity is to approximate without ever fully reaching it still further removed from objective reality than the idea would seem to be what i call the ideal by which i mean the idea not only in concreto but in individuo that   0 is an individual thing determinable or even determined by the idea alone humanity as an idea in its complete perfection implies not only all essential qualities belonging to human nature which constitute our concept of it enlarged to a degree of complete agreement with the highest aims that would represent our idea of perfect humanity but everything also which beside this concept is required for the complete determination of the idea for of all contradictory predicates one only can agree with the idea of the most perfect man what to us is an ideal was in platos language an idea of a divine mind an individual object present to its pure intuition the most perfect of every kind of possible beings and the archetype of all phenomenal copies without soaring so high we have to admit     that human reason contains not only ideas but ideals also which though they have not like those of plato creative yet have certainly practical power as regulative principles and form the basis of the possible perfection of certain acts moral concepts are not entirely pure concepts of reason because they rest on something empirical pleasure or pain nevertheless with regard to the principle by which reason imposes limits on freedom which in itself is without laws these moral concepts with regard to their form at least may well serve as examples of pure concepts of reason virtue and human wisdom in its perfect purity are ideas while the wise man of the stoics is an ideal that is a man existing in thought only but in complete agreement with the idea of wisdom while the idea gives rules the ideal serves as the archetype for the permanent determination of the copy and we have no     other rule of our actions but the conduct of that divine man within us with which we compare ourselves and by which we judge and better ourselves though we can never reach it these ideals though they cannot claim objective reality existence are not therefore to be considered as mere chimeras but supply reason with an indispensable standard because it requires the concept of that which is perfect of its kind in order to estimate and   0 measure by it the degree and the number of the defects in the imperfect to attempt to realise the ideal in an example that is as a real phenomenon as we might represent a perfectly wise man in a novel is impossible nay absurd and but little encouraging because the natural limits which are constantly interfering with the perfection in the idea make all illusion in such an experiment impossible and thus render the good itself in the idea suspicious and unreal this is the case with the ideal of reason which must always rest on definite concepts and serve as rule and model whether for imitation or for criticism the case is totally different with those creations of our imagination of which it is impossible to give an intelligible concept or say anything — which are in fact a kind of monogram consisting of single lines without any apparent rule a vague outline rather of different experiences than a definite image such as painters and physiognomists pretend to carry in their heads and of which they speak as a kind of vague shadow only of their creations and criticisms that can never be communicated to others they may be termed though improperly ideals of sensibility because they are meant to be the neverattainable model of possible empirical intuitions and yet furnish     no rule capable of being explained or examined     in its ideal on the contrary reason aims at a perfect determination according to rules a priori and it conceives an object throughout determinable according to principles though without the sufficient conditions of experience so that the concept itself is transcendent section ii of the transcendental ideal prototypon transcendentale every concept is with regard to that which is not contained in it undetermined and subject to the principle of determinability according to which of every two contradictorily opposite predicates one only can belong to it this rests on the principle of contradiction and is therefore a purely logical principle taking no account of any of the contents of our knowledge and looking only to its logical form besides this everything is subject in its possibility to the principle of complete determination according to which one of all the possible predicates of things as compared with their opposites must be applicable     to it this does not rest only on the principle of contradiction for it regards everything not only in relation to two contradictory predicates but in relation to the whole possibility that is to the whole of all predicates of things and presupposing these as a condition a priori it represents everything as deriving its own possibility from the     share which it possesses in that whole possibility  this principle of complete determination relates therefore to the content and not only to the logical form it is the principle of the synthesis of all predicates which are meant to form the complete concept of a thing and not the principle of analytical representation only by means of one of two contradictory predicates and it contains a transcendental presupposition namely that of the material for all possibility which is supposed to contain     a priori the data for the particular possibility of everything the proposition that everything which exists is completely determined does not signify only that one of every pair of given contradictory predicates but that one of all possible predicates must always belong to a thing so that by this proposition predicates are not only compared with each other logically but the thing itself is compared transcendentally with the sum total of all possible predicates the proposition really means that in order to know a thing completely we must know everything that is possible and thereby determine it either affirmatively or negatively this complete determination is therefore a concept which in concreto can never be represented in its totality and is founded therefore on an idea which belongs to reason only reason prescribing to the understanding the rule of its complete application     now although this idea of the sum total of all possibility so far as it forms the condition of the complete determination of everything is itself still undetermined with regard to its predicates and is conceived by us merely as a sum total of all possible predicates we find nevertheless on closer examination that this idea as a fundamental concept excludes a number of predicates which being derivative are given by others or cannot stand one     by the side of the other and that it is raised to a completely a priori determined concept thus becoming the concept of an individual object which is completely determined by the mere idea and must therefore be called an ideal of pure reason if we consider all possible predicates not only logically but transcendentally that is according to their content which may be thought in them a priori we find that through some we represent being through others a mere notbeing the logical negation which is merely indicated through the small word not does in reality never apply to a concept but only to its relation to another in a judgment and is very far therefore from being sufficient to determine a concept with regard to its content the expression notmortal can in no wise indicate that mere notbeing if thereby represented in an object but leaves the content entirely untouched a transcendental negation on the contrary signifies notbeing by itself and is opposed to transcendental affirmation or a something the concept of which in itself expresses being it is called therefore reality from res a thing because through it alone and so far only as it reaches are objects something while the opposite negation indicates a mere want and if     it stands by itself represents the absence of everything     no one can definitely think a negation unless he founds it on the opposite affirmation a man born blind cannot frame the smallest conception of darkness because he has none of light the savage knows nothing of poverty because he does not know ease and the ignorant has no conception of his ignorance  because he has none of knowledge etc all negative concepts are therefore derivative and it is the realities which contain the data and so to speak the material or the transcendental content by which a complete determination of all things becomes possible if therefore our reason postulates a transcendental substratum for all determinations a substratum which contains as it were the whole store of material whence all possible predicates of things may be taken we shall find that such a substratum is nothing but the idea of the sum total of reality omnitudo realitatis in     that case all true negations are nothing but limitations which they could not be unless there were the substratum of the unlimited the all by this complete possession of all reality we represent the concept of a thing by itself as completely determined and the concept of an ens realissimum is the concept of individual being because of all possible opposite predicates one namely that which absolutely belongs to being is found in its determination it is therefore a transcendental ideal which forms the foundations of the complete     determination which is necessary for all that exists and which constitutes at the same time the highest and complete condition of its possibility to which all thought of objects with regard to their content must be traced back it is at the same time the only true ideal of which human reason is capable because it is in this case alone that a concept of a thing which in itself is general is completely determined by itself and recognised as the representation of an individual the logical determination of a concept by reason is based upon a disjunctive syllogism in which the major contains a logical division the division of the sphere of a general concept while the minor limits that sphere to a certain part and the conclusion determines the concept by that part the general concept of a reality     in general cannot be divided a priori because without experience we know no definite kinds of reality contained under that genus hence the transcendental major of the complete determination of all things is nothing but a representation of the sum total of all reality and not only a concept which comprehends all predicates according to their transcendental content under itself but within itself and the complete determination of everything depends on the limitation of this total of reality of which some part is ascribed to the thing while the rest is excluded from it a procedure which agrees with the aut aut of a disjunctive major and with the determination of the object through one of the members of that division in the minor thus the procedure of reason by which the transcendental ideal becomes the basis of the determination of all possible things is analogous to that which reason follows in disjunctive syllogisms a proposition on which i tried before     to base the systematical division of all transcendental ideas and according to which they are produced as corresponding to the three kinds of the syllogisms of reason it is selfevident that for that purpose namely in order simply to represent the necessary and complete determination of things reason does not presuppose     the existence of a being that should correspond to the ideal but its idea only in order to derive from an unconditioned totality of complete determination the conditioned one that is the totality of something limited reason therefore sees in the ideal the prototypon of all things which as imperfect copies ectypa derive the material of their possibility from it approaching more or less nearly to it yet remaining always far from reaching it thus all the possibility of things or of the synthesis of the manifold according to their content is considered as derivative and the possibility of that only which includes in itself all reality as original for all negations which really are the only predicates by which everything else is distinguished from the truly real being are limitations only of a greater and in the last instance of the highest reality presupposing it and according to their content derived from it all the manifoldness of things consist only of so many modes of limiting the concept of the highest reality that forms their common substratum in the same way as all figures are only different modes of limiting endless space hence the object of its ideal which exists in reason only is called the original being ens originarium and so far as it has nothing above it the highest being ens summum and so far     as everything as conditioned is subject to it the being of all beings ens entium all this however does not mean the objective relation of any real thing to other     things but of the idea to concepts and leaves us in perfect ignorance as to the existence of a being of such superlative excellence again as we cannot say that an original being consists of so many derivative beings because these in reality presuppose the former and cannot therefore constitute it it follows that the ideal of the original being must be conceived as simple the derivation of all other possibility from that original being cannot therefore if we speak accurately be considered as a limitation of its highest reality and as it were a division of it — for in that case the original being would become to us a mere aggregate of derivative beings which according to what we have just explained is impossible though we represented it so in our first rough sketch on the contrary the highest reality would form the basis of the possibility of all things as a cause and not as a sum total the manifoldness of things would not depend on the limitation of the original being but on its complete effect and to this also would belong all our sensibility together with all reality in phenomenal appearance which could not as an ingredient belong to the idea of a supreme being if we follow up this idea of ours and hypostasise   0 it we shall be able to determine the original being by means of the concept of the highest reality as one simple all sufficient eternal etc in one word determine it in its unconditioned completeness through all predicaments the concept of such a being is the concept of     god in its transcendental sense and thus as i indicated above the ideal of pure reason is the object of a transcendental theology by such an employment of the transcendental idea however we should be overstepping the limits of its purpose and admissibility reason used it only as being the concept of all reality for a foundation of the complete determination of things in general without requiring that all this reality should be given objectively and constitute itself a thing this is a mere fiction by which we comprehend and realise the manifold of our idea in one ideal as a particular being we have no right to do this not even to assume the possibility of such an hypothesis nor do all the consequences which flow from such an ideal concern the complete determination of things in general for the sake of which alone the idea was necessary or influence it in the least it is not enough to describe the procedure     of our reason and its dialectic we must try also to discover its sources in order to be able to explain that illusion itself as a phenomenon of the understanding the ideal of which we are speaking is founded on a natural not on a purely arbitrary idea i ask therefore how does it happen that reason considers all the possibility of things as derived from one fundamental possibility namely that of the highest reality and then presupposes it as contained in a particular original being the answer is easily found in the discussions of the transcendental analytic the possibility of the objects of our senses is their relation to our thought by which something namely the empirical form can be thought a priori while what constitutes the matter the reality   0 in the phenomena all that corresponds to sensation must be given because without it it could not even be thought nor its possibility be represented an object of the senses can be completely determined only when it is compared with all phenomenal predicates and represented by them either affirmatively or negatively as however that which constitutes the thing itself as a phenomenon namely the real must be given and as without this the thing could not be conceived at all and as that in which the real of all phenomena is given is what we     call the one and all comprehending experience it is necessary that the material for the possibility of all objects of our senses should be presupposed as given in one whole on the limitation of which alone the possibility of all empirical objects their difference from each other and their complete determination can be founded and since no other objects can be given us but those of the senses and nowhere but in the context of a possible experience nothing can be an object to us if it does not presuppose that whole of all empirical reality as the condition of its possibility owing to a natural illusion we are led to consider a principle which applies only to the objects of our senses as a principle valid for all things and thus to take the empirical principle of our concepts of the possibility of things as phenomena by omitting this limitation as a transcendental principle of the possibility of things in general if afterwards we hypostasise this idea of the whole of all reality this is owing to our changing dialectically the distributive unity of the empirical use of our understanding into the collective unity of an empirical whole and then represent to ourselves this whole of phenomena as     an individual thing containing in itself all empirical reality afterwards by means of the aforementioned transcendental     subreption this is taken for the concept of a thing standing at the head of the possibility of all things and supplying the real conditions for their complete determination  section iii of the arguments of speculative reason in proof of the existence of a supreme being notwithstanding this urgent want of reason to presuppose something as a foundation for the complete determination of the concepts of the understanding reason nevertheless becomes too soon aware of the purely ideal and factitious character of such a supposition to allow itself to be persuaded by it alone to admit a     mere creation of thought as a real being unless it were forced by something else to seek for some rest in its regressus from the conditioned which is given to the unconditioned which though in itself and according to its mere concept not given as real can alone complete the series of conditions followed up to their causes this is     the natural course taken by the reason of every even the most ordinary human being although not every one can hold out in it it does not begin with concepts but with common experience and thus has something really existing for its foundation that foundation however sinks unless it rests upon the immoveable rock of that which is absolutely necessary and this itself hangs without a support if without and beneath it there be empty space and everything be not filled by it so that no room be left for a why — in fact if it be not infinite in reality if we admit the existence of something whatever it may be we must also admit that something exists by necessity for the contingent exists only under the condition of something else as its cause and from this the same conclusion leads us on till we reach a cause which is not contingent and therefore unconditionally necessary this is the argument on which reason founds its progress towards an original being now reason looks out for the concept of a     being worthy of such a distinction as the unconditioned necessity of its existence not in order to conclude a priori its existence from its concept for if it ventured to do this it might confine itself altogether to mere concepts without looking for a given existence as their foundation but only in order to find among all concepts of possible things one which has nothing incompatible with absolute necessity for that something absolutely necessary must exist is regarded as certain after the first conclusion and after discarding everything else as incompatible with that necessity reason takes the one being that remains for the absolutely necessary being whether its necessity can be comprehended that is derived from its concept alone or     not now the being the concept of which contains a therefore for every wherefore which is in no point and no respect defective and is sufficient as a condition everywhere seems on that account to be most compatible with absolute necessity because being in possession of all conditions of all that is possible it does not require nay is not capable of any condition and satisfies at least in this one respect the concept of unconditioned necessity more than any other concept which because it is deficient and in need of completion does not exhibit any such     characteristic of independence from all further conditions it is true that we ought not to conclude that what does not contain the highest and in every respect complete condition must therefore be conditioned even in its existence yet it does not exhibit the only characteristic of unconditioned existence by which reason is able to know any being as unconditioned by means of a concept a priori the concept of a being of the highest reality ens realissimum would therefore seem of all concepts of all possible things to be the most compatible with the concept of an unconditionally necessary being and though it may not satisfy that concept altogether yet no choice is left to us and we are forced to keep to it because we must not risk the existence of a necessary being and if we admit it can in the whole field of possibility find nothing that could produce better founded claims on such a distinction in existence this therefore is the natural course of human reason it begins by persuading itself of the existence of some necessary being in this being it recognises unconditioned existence it then seeks for the concept of that which is     independent of all condition and finds it in that     which is itself the sufficient condition of all other things that is in that which contains all reality now as the unlimited all is absolute unity and implies the concept of a being one and supreme reason concludes that the supreme being as the original cause of all things must exist by absolute necessity we cannot deny that this argument possesses a certain foundation when we must come to a decision that is when after having once admitted the existence of some one necessary being we agree that we must decide where to place it for in that case we could not make a better choice or we have really no choice but are forced to vote for the absolute unity of complete reality as the source of all possibility if however we are not forced to come to a decision but prefer to leave the question open till our consent has been forced by the full weight of arguments that is if we only have to form a judgment of what we really do know and what we only seem to know then our former conclusion does by no means appear in so favourable a light and must appeal to favour in order to make up for the defects of its legal claims for if we accept everything as here stated namely first that we may infer rightly from any given existence     perhaps even my own only the existence of an unconditionally necessary being secondly that i must consider a being which contains all reality and therefore also all condition as absolutely unconditioned and that therefore the concept of the thing which is compatible with absolute necessity has thus been found it follows by no means from this that a concept of a limited being which does not possess the highest reality is therefore contradictory     to absolute necessity for though i do not find in its concept the unconditioned which carries the whole of conditions with it this does not prove that for the same reason its existence must be conditioned for i cannot say in a hypothetical argument that if a certain condition is absent here the completeness according to concepts the conditioned also is absent on the contrary it will be open to us to consider all the rest of limited beings as equally unconditioned although we cannot from the general concept which we have of them deduce their necessity thus this argument would not have given us the least concept of the qualities of a necessary being in fact it would not have helped us in the least nevertheless this argument retains a certain importance and authority of which it cannot be at once deprived on account of this objective insufficiency for suppose     that there existed certain obligations quite correct in the idea of reason but without any reality in their application to ourselves that is without any motives unless we admitted a supreme being to give effect to practical laws we should then be bound to follow the concepts which though not objectively sufficient are yet according to the standard of our reason preponderant and more convincing than any others the duty of deciding would here turn the balance against the hesitation of speculation by an additional practical weight nay reason would not be justified even before the most indulgent judge if under such urgent pleas though with deficient insight it had not followed its judgment of which we can say at least that we know no better this argument though it is no doubt transcendental as based on the internal insufficiency of the contingent is     nevertheless so simple and natural that the commonest understanding accepts it if once led up to it we see things change arise and perish and these or at least their state must therefore have a cause of   0 every cause however that is given in experience the same question must be asked where therefore could we more fairly place the last causality except where there exists also the supreme causality that is in that being which originally contains in itself the sufficient cause for every possible effect and the concept of which can easily be realised by the one trait of an allcomprehending perfection that supreme cause we afterwards consider as absolutely necessary because we find it absolutely necessary to ascend to it while there is no ground for going beyond it thus among all nations even when still in a state of blind polytheism we always see some sparks of monotheism to which they have been led not by meditation and profound speculation but by the natural bent of the common understanding which they gradually followed and comprehended there are only three kinds of proofs of the existence of god from speculative reason all the paths that can be followed to this end begin either from definite experience and the peculiar nature of the world of sense known to us through experience and ascend from it according to the laws of causality to the highest cause existing outside the world or they rest on indefinite experience only that is on any existence which is empirically given or lastly they leave all experience out of account and conclude entirely a priori from mere concepts the existence of a supreme     cause the first proof is the physicotheological the second     the cosmological the third the ontological proof there are no more and there can be no more i shall show that neither on the one path the empirical nor on the other the transcendental can reason achieve anything and that it stretches its wings in vain if it tries to soar beyond the world of sense by the mere power of speculation with regard to the order in which these three arguments should be examined it will be the opposite of that followed by reason in its gradual development in which we placed them also at first ourselves for we shall be able to show that although experience gives the first impulse it is the transcendental concept only which guides reason in its endeavours and fixes the last goal which reason wishes to retain i shall therefore begin with the examination of the transcendental proof and see afterwards how far it may be strengthened by the addition of empirical elements section iv of the impossibility of an ontological proof of the existence of god     it is easily perceived from what has been said before that the concept of an absolutely necessary being is a concept of pure reason that is a mere idea the objective reality of which is by no means proved by the fact that reason requires it that idea does no more than point to a certain but unattainable completeness and serves rather to limit the understanding than to extend its sphere it seems strange and absurd however that a conclusion of     an absolutely necessary existence from a given existence in general should seem urgent and correct and that yet all the conditions under which the understanding can form a concept of such a necessity should be entirely against us people have at all times been talking of an absolutely necessary being but they have tried not so much to understand whether and how a thing of that kind could even be conceived as rather to prove its existence no doubt a verbal definition of that concept is quite easy if we say that it is something the nonexistence of which is impossible this however does not make us much     wiser with reference to the conditions that make it necessary  to consider the nonexistence of a thing as absolutely inconceivable it is these conditions which we want to know and whether by that concept we are thinking anything or not for to use the word unconditioned in order to get rid of all the conditions which the understanding always requires when wishing to conceive something as necessary does not render it clear to us in the least whether after that we are still thinking anything or perhaps nothing by the concept of the unconditionally necessary nay more than this people have imagined that by a number of examples they had explained this concept at first risked at haphazard and afterwards become quite familiar and that therefore all further inquiry regarding its intelligibility were unnecessary it was said that every proposition of geometry such as for instance that a triangle has three angles is absolutely necessary and     people began to talk of an object entirely outside the sphere of our understanding as if they understood perfectly well what by that concept they wished to predicate of it but all these pretended examples are taken without exception from judgments only not from things and their existence now the unconditioned necessity of judgments is not the same thing as an absolute necessity of things the absolute necessity of a judgment is only a conditioned necessity of the thing or of the predicate in the     judgment the above proposition did not say that three angles were absolutely necessary but that under the condition of the existence of a triangle three angles are given in it by necessity nevertheless this pure logical necessity has exerted so powerful an illusion that after having formed of a thing a concept a priori so constituted that it seemed to include existence in its sphere people thought they could conclude with certainty that because existence necessarily belongs to the object of that concept provided always that i accept the thing as given existing its existence also must necessarily be accepted according to the rule of identity and that the being therefore must itself be absolutely necessary because its existence is implied in a concept which is accepted voluntarily only and always under the condition that i accept the object of it as given if in an identical judgment i reject the predicate and retain the subject there arises a contradiction and hence i say that the former belongs to the latter necessarily but if i reject the subject as well as the predicate there is no contradiction because there is nothing left that can be contradicted to accept a triangle and yet to reject   0 its three angles is contradictory but there is no contradiction at all in admitting the nonexistence of the triangle and of its three angles the same applies to the concept of an absolutely necessary being remove its     existence and you remove the thing itself with all its predicates so that a contradiction becomes impossible there is nothing external to which the contradiction could apply because the thing is not meant to be externally necessary nor is there anything internal that could be contradicted for in removing the thing out of existence you have removed at the same time all its internal qualities if you say god is almighty that is a necessary judgment because almightiness cannot be removed if you accept a deity that is an infinite being with the concept of which that other concept is identical but if you say god is not then neither his almightiness nor any other of his predicates is given they are all together with the subject removed out of existence and therefore there is not the slightest contradiction in that sentence we have seen therefore that if i remove the predicate of a judgment together with its subject there can never be an internal contradiction whatever the predicate may be the only way of evading this conclusion would be to say that there are subjects which cannot be removed out of existence but must always remain but this would be the same as to say that there exist absolutely necessary subjects an assumption the correctness of which i have called in question and the possibility of which you had undertaken to prove for i cannot form to myself the smallest concept of a thing which if it had been removed together with all its predicates should leave behind     a contradiction and except contradiction i have     no other test of impossibility by pure concepts a priori against all these general arguments which no one can object to you challenge me with a case which you represent as a proof by a fact namely that there is one and this one concept only in which the nonexistence or the removal of its object would be selfcontradictory namely the concept of the most real being ens realissimum you say that it possesses all reality and you are no doubt justified in accepting such a being as possible this for the present i may admit though the absence of selfcontradictoriness in a concept is far from proving the possibility of its object  now reality comprehends existence and therefore existence is contained in the concept of a thing possible if that thing is removed the     internal possibility of the thing would be removed and this is selfcontradictory i answer — even in introducing into the concept of a thing which you wish to think in its possibility only the concept of its existence under whatever disguise it may be you have been guilty of a contradiction if you were allowed to do this you would apparently have carried your point but in reality you have achieved nothing but have only committed a tautology i simply ask you whether the proposition that this or that thing which     whatever it may be i grant you as possible exists is an analytical or a synthetical proposition if the former then by its existence you add nothing to your thought of the thing but in that case either the thought within you would be the thing itself or you have presupposed existence as belonging to possibility and have according to your own showing deduced existence from internal possibility which is nothing but a miserable tautology the mere word reality which in the concept of a thing sounds different from existence in the concept of the predicate can make no difference for if you call all accepting or positing without determining what it is reality you have placed a thing with all its predicates within the concept of the subject and accepted it as real and you do nothing but repeat it in the predicate if on the     contrary you admit as every sensible man must do that every proposition involving existence is synthetical how can you say that the predicate of existence does not admit of removal without contradiction a distinguishing property which is peculiar to analytical propositions only the very character of which depends on it i might have hoped to put an end to this subtle argumentation without many words and simply by an accurate definition of the concept of existence if i had not seen that the illusion in mistaking a logical predicate for a real one that is the predicate which determines a thing resists all correction everything can become a logical predicate even the subject itself may be predicated of itself because logic takes no account of any contents of concepts determination however is a predicate added to the concept of the subject and enlarging it and it must not therefore be contained in it     being is evidently not a real predicate or a concept of something that can be added to the concept of a thing it is merely the admission of a thing and of certain determinations in it logically it is merely the copula of a judgment the proposition god is almighty contains two concepts each having its object namely god and almightiness the small word is is not an additional     predicate but only serves to put the predicate in relation to the subject if then i take the subject god with all its predicates including that of almightiness and say god is or there is a god i do not put a new predicate to the concept of god but i only put the subject by itself with all its predicates in relation to my concept as its object both must contain exactly the same kind of thing and nothing can have been added to the concept which expresses possibility only by my thinking its object as simply given and saying it is and thus the real does not contain more than the possible a hundred real dollars do not contain a penny more than a hundred possible dollars for as the latter signify the concept the former the object and its position by itself it is clear that in case the former contained more than the latter my concept would not express the whole object and would not therefore be its adequate concept in my financial position no doubt there exists more by one hundred real dollars than by their concept only that is their possibility because in reality the object is not only contained analytically in my concept but is added to my concept which is a determination of my state synthetically but the conceived hundred dollars are not in the least increased through the existence which is outside my concept by whatever and by however many predicates  00     i may think a thing even in completely determining it nothing is really added to it if i add that the thing exists otherwise it would not be the same that exists but something more than was contained in the concept and i could not say that the exact object of my concept existed nay even if i were to think in a thing all reality except one that one missing reality would not be supplied by my saying that so defective a thing exists but it would exist with the same defect with which i thought it or what exists would be different from what i thought if then i try to conceive a being as the highest reality without any defect the question still remains whether it exists or not for though in my concept there may be wanting nothing of the possible real content of a thing in general something is wanting in its relation to my whole state of thinking namely that the knowledge of that object should be possible a posteriori also and here we perceive the cause of our difficulty if we were concerned with an object of our senses i could not mistake the existence of a thing for the mere concept of it for by the concept the object is thought as only in harmony with the general conditions of a possible empirical knowledge while by its existence it is thought as contained in the whole content of experience through this connection with the content of the whole experience the concept of an object  0  is not in the least increased our thought has only received through it one more possible perception if however we are thinking existence through the pure category alone we need not wonder that we cannot find any characteristic to distinguish it from mere possibility whatever therefore our concept of an object may contain we must always step outside it in order to attribute     to it existence with objects of the senses this takes place through their connection with any one of my perceptions according to empirical laws with objects of pure thought however there is no means of knowing their existence because it would have to be known entirely a priori while our consciousness of every kind of existence whether immediately by perception or by conclusions which connect something with perception belongs entirely to the unity of experience and any existence outside that field though it cannot be declared to be absolutely impossible is a presupposition that cannot be justified by anything the concept of a supreme being is in many respects a very useful idea but being an idea only it is quite incapable of increasing by itself alone our knowledge  0  with regard to what exists it cannot even do so much as to inform us any further as to its possibility the analytical characteristic of possibility which consists in the absence of contradiction in mere positions realities cannot be denied to it but the connection of all real properties in one and the same thing is a synthesis the possibility of which we cannot judge a priori because these realities are not given to us as such and because even if this were so no judgment whatever takes place it being necessary to look for the characteristic of the possibility of synthetical knowledge in experience only to which the object of an idea can never belong thus we see that the celebrated leibniz is far from having achieved what he thought he had namely to understand a priori the possibility of so sublime an ideal being time and labour therefore are lost on the famous ontological cartesian proof of the existence of a supreme     being from mere concepts and a man might as well imagine that he could become richer in knowledge by mere ideas as a merchant in capital if in order to improve his position he were to add a few noughts to his cash account section v of the impossibility of a cosmological proof of the existence of god  0  it was something quite unnatural and a mere innovation of scholastic wisdom to attempt to pick out of an entirely arbitrary idea the existence of the object corresponding to it such an attempt would never have been made if there had not existed beforehand a need of our reason of admitting for existence in general something necessary to which we may ascend and in which we may rest and if as that necessity must be unconditioned and a priori certain reason had not been forced to seek a concept which if possible should satisfy such a demand and give us a knowledge of an existence entirely a priori such a concept was supposed to exist in the idea of an ens realissimum and that idea was therefore used for a more definite knowledge of that the existence of which one had admitted or been persuaded of independently namely of the necessary being this very natural procedure of reason was carefully concealed and instead of ending with that concept an attempt was made to begin with it and thus to derive from it the necessity of existence which it was only meant to supplement hence arose  0  that unfortunate ontological proof which satisfies neither     the demands of our natural and healthy understanding nor the requirements of the schools the cosmological proof which we have now to examine retains the connection of absolute necessity with the highest reality but instead of concluding like the former from the highest reality necessity in existence it concludes from the given unconditioned necessity of any being its unlimited reality it thus brings everything at least into the groove of a natural though i know not whether of a really or only apparently rational syllogism which carries the greatest conviction not only for the common but also for the speculative understanding and has evidently drawn the first outline of all proofs of natural theology which have been followed at all times and will be followed in future also however much they may be hidden and disguised we shall now proceed to exhibit and to examine this cosmological proof which leibniz calls also the proof a contingentia mundi it runs as follows if there exists anything there must exist an absolutely necessary being also now i at least exist therefore there exists an absolutely necessary being the minor contains an experience the major the conclusion from experience in general to the existence of  0  the necessary  this proof therefore begins with experience and is not entirely a priori or ontological and as the object of all possible experience is called the world this proof is called the cosmological proof as it takes     no account of any peculiar property of the objects of experience by which this world of ours may differ from any other possible world it is distinguished in its name also from the physicotheological proof which employs as arguments observations of the peculiar property of this our world of sense the proof then proceeds as follows the necessary being can be determined in one way only that is by one only of all possible opposite predicates it must therefore be determined completely by its own concept now there is only one concept of a thing possible which a priori completely determines it namely that of the ens realissimum it follows therefore that the concept of the ens realissimum is the only one by which a necessary being can be thought and therefore it is concluded  0  that a highest being exists by necessity there are so many sophistical propositions in this cosmological argument that it really seems as if speculative reason had spent all her dialectical skill in order to produce the greatest possible transcendental illusion before examining it we shall draw up a list of them by which reason has put forward an old argument disguised as a new one in order to appeal to the agreement of two witnesses one supplied by pure reason the other by experience while in reality there is only one namely the first who changes his dress and voice in order to be taken for a second in order to have a secure foundation this proof takes its stand on experience and pretends to be different from the ontological proof which places its whole confidence in pure concepts a priori only the cosmological proof however uses that experience only in order to make one step namely to the existence of a necessary being in     general what properties that being may have can never be learnt from the empirical argument and for that purpose reason takes leave of it altogether and tries to find out from among concepts only what properties an absolutely necessary being ought to possess ie which among all possible things contains in itself the requisite  0  conditions requisita of absolute necessity this requisite is believed by reason to exist in the concept of an ens realissimum only and reason concludes at once that this must be the absolutely necessary being in this conclusion it is simply assumed that the concept of a being of the highest reality is perfectly adequate to the concept of absolute necessity in existence so that the latter might be concluded from the former this is the same proposition as that maintained in the ontological argument and is simply taken over into the cosmological proof nay made its foundation although the intention was to avoid it for it is clear that absolute necessity is an existence from mere concepts if then i say that the concept of the ens realissimum is such a concept and is the only concept adequate to necessary existence i am bound to admit that the latter may be deduced from the former the whole conclusive strength of the socalled cosmological proof rests therefore in reality on the ontological proof from mere concepts while the appeal to experience is quite superfluous and though it may lead us on to the concept of absolute necessity it cannot demonstrate it with any definite object for as soon as we intend to do this we must at once abandon all experience and try to find out which among the pure concepts may contain the conditions of the possibility of an absolutely  0  necessary being but if in this way the possibility of   0 such a being has been perceived its existence also has been proved for what we are really saying is this that under all possible things there is one which carries with it absolute necessity or that this being exists with absolute necessity sophisms in arguments are most easily discovered if they are put forward in a correct scholastic form this we shall now proceed to do if the proposition is right that every absolutely necessary being is at the same time the most real being and this is the nervus probandi of the cosmological proof it must like all affirmative judgments be capable of conversion at least per accidens this would give us the proposition that some entia realissima are at the same time absolutely necessary beings one ens realissimum however does not differ from any other on any point and what applies to one applies also to all in this case therefore i may employ absolute conversion and say that every ens realissimum is a necessary being as this proposition is determined by its concepts a priori only it follows that the mere concept of the ens realissimum must carry with it its absolute necessity and this which was maintained by the ontological proof and not recognised by the cosmological forms really the foundation of the conclusions of the latter though in a disguised form  0  we thus see that the second road taken by speculative reason in order to prove the existence of the highest being is not only as illusory as the first but commits in in addition an ignoratio elenchi promising to lead us by a new path but after a short circuit bringing us back to the old one which we had abandoned for its sake i said before that a whole nest of dialectical assumptions     was hidden in that cosmological proof and that transcendental criticism might easily detect and destroy it i shall here enumerate them only leaving it to the experience of the reader to follow up the fallacies and remove them we find first the transcendental principle of inferring a cause from the accidental this principle that everything contingent must have a cause is valid in the world of sense only and has not even a meaning outside it for the purely intellectual concept of the contingent cannot produce a synthetical proposition like that of causality and the principle of causality has no meaning and no criterion of its use except in the world of sense while here it is meant to help us beyond the world of sense secondly the inference of a first cause   0 based on the impossibility of an infinite ascending series of given causes in this world of sense — an inference which the principles of the use of reason do not allow us to draw even in experience while here we extend that principle beyond experience whither that series can never be prolonged thirdly the false selfsatisfaction of reason with regard to the completion of that series brought about by removing in the end every kind of condition without which nevertheless no concept of necessity is possible and by then when any definite concepts have become impossible accepting this as a completion of our concept fourthly the mistaking the logical possibility of a concept of all united reality without any internal contradiction for the transcendental which requires a principle for the practicability of such a synthesis such principle however being applicable to the field of possible experience only etc     the trick of the cosmological proof consists only in trying to avoid the proof of the existence of a necessary being a priori by mere concepts such a proof would have to be ontological and of this we feel ourselves quite incapable for this reason we take a real existence of any experience whatever and conclude from it as well as may be some absolutely necessary condition of it in that case there is no necessity for explaining its possibility because if it has been proved that it     exists the question as to its possibility is unnecessary if then we want to determine that necessary being more accurately according to its nature we do not seek what is sufficient to make us understand from its concept the necessity of its existence if we could do this no empirical presupposition would be necessary no we only seek the negative condition conditio sine qua non without which a being would not be absolutely necessary now in every other kind of syllogisms leading from a given effect to its cause this might well be feasible in our case however it happens unfortunately that the condition which is required for absolute necessity exists in one single being only which therefore would have to contain in its concept all that is required for absolute necessity and that renders a conclusion a priori with regard to such necessity possible i ought therefore to be able to reason conversely namely that everything is absolutely necessary if that concept of the highest reality belongs to it if i cannot do this and i must confess that i cannot if i wish to avoid the ontological proof i have suffered shipwreck on my new course and have come back again from where i started the concept of the highest being may satisfy all questions a priori which can be asked     regarding the internal determinations of a thing and it is therefore an ideal without an equal because the general concept distinguishes it at the same time as an     individual being among all possible things but it does not satisfy the really important question regarding its own existence and if some one who admitted the existence of a necessary being were to ask us which of all things in the world could be regarded as such we could not answer this here is the necessary being it may be allowable to admit the existence of a being entirely sufficient to serve as the cause of all possible effects simply in order to assist reason in her search for unity of causes but to go so far as to say that such a being exists necessarily is no longer the modest language of an admissible hypothesis but the bold assurance of apodictic certainty for the knowledge of that which is absolutely necessary must itself possess absolute necessity the whole problem of the transcendental ideal is this either to find a concept compatible with absolute necessity or to find the absolute necessity compatible with the concept of anything if the one is possible the other must be so also for reason recognises that only as absolutely necessary which is necessary according to its concept both these tasks baffle our attempts at satisfying our understanding on this point and likewise our     endeavours to comfort it with regard to its impotence that unconditioned necessity which we require as the last support of all things is the true abyss of human reason eternity itself however terrible and sublime it may have been depicted by haller is far from producing the same giddy impression for it only measures the duration of things but does not support them we cannot     put off the thought nor can we support it that a being which we represent to ourselves as the highest among all possible beings should say to himself i am from eternity to eternity there is nothing beside me except that which is something through my will — but whence am i here all sinks away from under us and the highest perfection like the smallest passes without support before the eyes of speculative reason which finds no difficulty in making the one as well as the other to disappear without the slightest impediment many powers of nature which manifest their existence by certain effects remain perfectly inscrutable to us because we cannot follow them up far enough by observation the transcendental object which forms the foundation of all phenomena and with it the ground of our sensibility having this rather than any other supreme conditions is and always will be inscrutable the thing no doubt is given but it is incomprehensible     an ideal of pure reason however cannot be called inscrutable because it cannot produce any credentials of its reality beyond the requirement of reason to perfect all synthetical unity by means of it as therefore it is not even given as an object that can be thought it cannot be said to be as such inscrutable but being a mere idea it must find in the nature of reason its place and its solution and in that sense be capable of scrutiny for it is the very essence of reason that we are able to give an account of all our concepts opinions and assertions either on objective or if they are a mere illusion on subjective grounds     discovery and explanation of the dialectical illusion in all transcendental proofs of the existence of a necessary being both proofs hitherto attempted were transcendental that is independent of empirical principles for although the cosmological proof assumes for its foundation an experience in general it does not rest on any particular quality of it but on pure principles of reason with reference to an existence given by the empirical consciousness in general and abandons even that guidance in order to derive its support from pure concepts only     what then in these transcendental proofs is the cause of the dialectical but natural illusion which connects the concepts of necessity and of the highest reality and realises and hypostasises that which can only be an idea what is the cause that renders it inevitable to admit something as necessary in itself among existing things and yet makes us shrink back from the existence of such a being as from an abyss what is to be done that reason should understand itself on this point and escaping from the wavering state of hesitatingly approving or disapproving acquire a calm insight into the matter it is surely extremely strange that as soon as we suppose that something exists we cannot avoid the conclusion that something exists necessarily on this quite natural though by no means therefore certain conclusion rests the whole cosmological argument on the other side i may take any concept of anything and i find that its existence has never to be represented by me as absolutely necessary nay that nothing prevents me whatever may exist from thinking its nonexistence i may therefore have to admit something necessary as the     condition of existing things in general but i need not think any single thing as necessary in itself in other words i can never complete the regressus to the     conditions of existence without admitting a necessary being but i can never begin with such a being if therefore i am obliged to think something necessary for all existing things and at the same time am not justified in thinking of anything as in itself necessary the conclusion is inevitable that necessity and contingency do not concern things themselves for otherwise there would be a contradiction and that therefore neither of the two principles can be objective but that they may possibly be subjective principles of reason only according to which on one side we have to find for all that is given as existing something that is necessary and thus never to stop except when we have reached an a priori complete explanation while on the other we must never hope for that completion that is never admit anything empirical as unconditioned and thus dispense with its further derivation in that sense both principles as purely heuristic and regulative and affecting the formal interests of reason only may well stand side by side for the one tells us that we ought to philosophise on nature as if there was a necessary first cause for everything that exists if only in order to introduce systematical unity into our knowledge by always looking for such an idea as an imagined highest cause the other     warns us against mistaking any single determination concerning the existence of things for such a highest cause ie for something absolutely necessary and bids us to keep the way always open for further derivation and to treat it always as conditioned if then everything     that is perceived in things has to be considered by us as only conditionally necessary nothing that is empirically given can ever be considered as absolutely necessary it follows from this that the absolutely necessary must be accepted as outside the world because it is only meant to serve as a principle of the greatest possible unity of phenomena of which it is the highest cause and that it can never be reached in the world because the second rule bids you always to consider all empirical causes of that unity as derived the philosophers of antiquity considered all form in nature as contingent but matter according to the judgment of common reason as primitive and necessary if however they had considered matter not relatively as the substratum of phenomena but as existing by itself the idea of absolute necessity would have vanished at once for there is nothing that binds reason absolutely to that existence but reason can at any time and without contradiction remove it in thought and it was in     thought only that it could claim absolute necessity the ground of this persuasion must therefore have been a certain regulative principle and so it is for extension and impermeability which together constitute the concept of matter furnish the highest empirical principle of the unity of phenomena and possess so far as this principle is empirically unconditioned the character of a regulative principle nevertheless as every determination of matter which constitutes its reality and hence the impermeability of matter also is an effect action which must have a cause and therefore be itself derived matter is not adequate to the idea of a necessary being as a principle of all derived     unity because every one of its real qualities is derived and therefore conditionally necessary only so that it could be removed and with it would be removed the whole existence of matter if this were not so we should have reached the highest cause of unity empirically which is forbidden by the second regulative principle it follows from all this that matter and everything in general that belongs to the world are not fit for the idea of a necessary original being as a mere principle of the greatest empirical unity but that we must place it outside the world in that case there is no reason why we should not simply derive the phenomena of the world and their existence from other phenomena as if there were no necessary being at all while at the same time we might always strive towards the completeness of that derivation just as if such a being as the     highest cause were presupposed the ideal of the supreme being is therefore according to these remarks nothing but a regulative principle of reason which obliges us to consider all connection in the world as if it arose from an allsufficient necessary cause in order to found on it the rule of a systematical unity necessary according to general laws for the explanation of the world it does not involve the assertion of an existence necessary by itself it is impossible however at the same time to escape from a transcendental subreptio which leads us to represent that formal principle as constitutive and to think that unity as hypostasised it is the same with space space though it is only a principle of sensibility yet serves originally to make all forms possible these being only limitations of it for that very reason however it is mistaken for something absolutely     necessary and independent nay for an object a priori existing in itself it is the same here and as this systematical unity of nature can in no wise become the principle of the empirical use of our reason unless we base it on the idea of an ens realissimum as the highest cause it happens quite naturally that we thus represent that idea as a real object and that object again as it is the highest condition as necessary thus a regulative principle has been changed into a constitutive   0 principle which substitution becomes evident at once because as soon as i consider that highest being which with regard to the world was absolutely unconditionally necessary as a thing by itself that necessity cannot be conceived and can therefore have existed in my reason as a formal condition of thought only and not as a material and substantial condition of existence section vi of the impossibility of the physicotheological proof if then neither the concept of things in general nor the experience of any existence in general can satisfy our demands there still remains one way open namely to try whether any definite experience and consequently that of things in the world as it is their constitution and disposition may not supply a proof which could give us the certain conviction of the existence of a supreme being such a proof we should call physicotheological if that however should prove impossible too then it is clear that no satisfactory proof whatever from merely speculative  00 reason is possible in support of the existence of a being corresponding to our transcendental idea after what has been said already it will be     easily understood that we may expect an easy and complete answer to this question for how could there ever be an experience that should be adequate to an idea it is the very nature of an idea that no experience can ever be adequate to it the transcendental idea of a necessary and allsufficient original being is so overwhelming so high above everything empirical which is always conditioned that we can never find in experience enough material to fill such a concept and can only grope about among things conditioned looking in vain for the unconditioned of which no rule of any empirical synthesis can ever give us an example or even show the way towards it if the highest being should stand itself in that chain of conditions it would be a link in the series and would exactly like the lower links above which it is placed require further investigation with regard to its own still higher cause if on the contrary we mean to separate it from that chain and as a purely intelligible being not comprehend it in the series of natural causes what bridge is then open for reason to reach it considering that all rules determining the transition from effect to cause nay all synthesis and extension of our knowledge in general refer to nothing but possible experience and therefore to the objects of the world of sense only and are     valid nowhere else this present world presents to us so immeasurable a stage of variety order fitness and beauty whether we follow it up in the infinity of space or in its unlimited division that even with the little knowledge which our  0  poor understanding has been able to gather all language with regard to so many and inconceivable wonders loses its vigour all numbers their power of measuring and all our thoughts their necessary determination so that our judgment of the whole is lost in a speechless but all the more eloquent astonishment everywhere we see a chain of causes and effects of means and ends of order in birth and death and as nothing has entered by itself into the state in which we find it all points to another thing as its cause as that cause necessitates the same further enquiry the whole universe would thus be lost in the abyss of nothing unless we admitted something which existing by itself original and independent outside the chain of infinite contingencies should support it and as the cause of its origin secure to it at the same time its permanence looking at all the things in the world what greatness shall we attribute to that highest cause we do not know the whole contents of the world still less can we measure its magnitude by a comparison     with all that is possible but as with regard to causality we cannot do without a last and highest being why should we not fix the degree of its perfection beyond everything else that is possible this we can easily do though only in the faint outline of an abstract concept if we represent to ourselves all possible perfections united in it as in one substance such a concept would agree with the demand of our reason which requires parsimony in the number of principles it would have no contradictions in itself would be favourable to the extension of the employment of reason in the midst of experience by guiding it towards order and system and lastly would never be decidedly opposed to any experience  0  this proof will always deserve to be treated with respect it is the oldest the clearest and most in conformity with human reason it gives life to the study of nature deriving its own existence from it and thus constantly acquiring new vigour it reveals aims and intention where our own observation would not by itself have discovered them and enlarges our knowledge of nature by leading us towards that peculiar unity the principle of which exists outside nature this knowledge reacts again on its cause namely the transcendental idea and thus increases the     belief in a supreme author to an irresistible conviction it would therefore be not only extremely sad but utterly vain to attempt to diminish the authority of that proof reason constantly strengthened by the powerful arguments that come to hand by themselves though they are no doubt empirical only cannot be discouraged by any doubts of subtle and abstract speculation roused from every inquisitive indecision as from a dream by one glance at the wonders of nature and the majesty of the cosmos reason soars from height to height till it reaches the highest from the conditioned to conditions till it reaches the supreme and unconditioned author of all but although we have nothing to say against the reasonableness and utility of this line of argument but wish on the contrary to commend and encourage it we cannot approve of the claims which this proof advances to apodictic certainty and to an approval on its own merits requiring no favour and no help from any other quarter it cannot injure the good cause if the dogmatical language of the overweening sophist is toned down to the moderate and modest statements of  0  a faith which does not require unconditioned submission yet is sufficient to give rest and comfort i therefore maintain that the physicotheological proof can never establish by itself alone the existence of a     supreme being but must always leave it to the ontological proof to which it serves only as an introduction to supply its deficiency so that after all it is the ontological proof which contains the only possible argument supposing always that any speculative proof is possible and human reason can never do without it the principal points of the physicotheological proof are the following  st there are everywhere in the world clear indications of an intentional arrangement carried out with great wisdom and forming a whole indescribably varied in its contents and infinite in extent  ndly the fitness of this arrangement is entirely foreign to the things existing in the world and belongs to them contingently only that is the nature of different things could never spontaneously by the combination of so many means cooperate towards definite aims if these means had not been selected and arranged on purpose by a rational disposing principle according to certain fundamental ideas  rdly there exists therefore a sublime and wise cause or many which must be the cause of the world not only as a blind and allpowerful nature by means of unconscious fecundity but as an intelligence by freedom  thly the unity of that cause may be inferred with certainty from the unity of the reciprocal relation     of the parts of the world as portions of a skilful edifice so far as our experience reaches and beyond it with plausibility according to the principles of analogy  0  without wishing to argue for the sake of argument only with natural reason as to its conclusion in inferring from the analogy of certain products of nature with the works of human art in which man does violence to nature and forces it not to follow its own aims but to adapt itself to ours that is from the similarity of certain products of nature with houses ships and watches in inferring from this i say that a similar causality namely understanding and will must be at the bottom of nature and in deriving the internal possibility of a freely acting nature which it may be renders all human art and even human reason possible from another though superhuman art — a kind of reasoning which probably could not stand the severest test of transcendental criticism we are willing to admit nevertheless that if we have to name such a cause we cannot do better than to follow the analogy of such products of human design which are the only ones of which we know completely both cause and effect there would be no excuse if reason were to surrender a causality which it knows and have recourse to obscure and indemonstrable principles of explanation which it does not know according to this argument the fitness and harmony existing in so many works of nature might prove     the contingency of the form but not of the matter that is the substance in the world because for the latter purpose it would be necessary to prove in addition that the things of the world were in themselves incapable of such order and harmony according to general laws unless there existed even in their substance the product of a supreme wisdom for this purpose very different arguments would be required from those derived from the  0  analogy of human art the utmost therefore that could be established by such a proof would be an architect of the world always very much hampered by the quality of the material with which he has to work not a creator to whose idea everything is subject this would by no means suffice for the purposed aim of proving an allsufficient original being if we wished to prove the contingency of matter itself we must have recourse to a transcendental argument and this is the very thing which was to be avoided the inference therefore really proceeds from the order and design that can everywhere be observed in the world as an entirely contingent arrangement to the existence of a cause proportionate to it the concept of that cause must therefore teach us something quite definite about it and can therefore be no other concept but that of a being which possesses all might wisdom etc in one word all perfection of an allsufficient being the     predicates of a very great of an astounding of an immeasurable might and virtue give us no definite concept and never tell us really what the thing is by itself they are only relative representations of the magnitude of an object which the observer of the world compares with himself and his own power of comprehension and which would be equally grand whether we magnify the object or reduce the observing subject to smaller proportions in reference to it where we are concerned with the magnitude of the perfection of a thing in general there exists no definite concept except that which comprehends all possible perfection and only the all omnitudo of reality is thoroughly determined in the concept now i hope that no one would dare to comprehend the  0  relation of that part of the world which he has observed in its extent as well as in its contents to omnipotence the relation of the order of the world to the highest wisdom and the relation of the unity of the world to the absolute unity of its author etc physicotheology therefore can never give a definite concept of the highest cause of the world and is insufficient therefore as a principle of theology which is itself to form the basis of religion the step leading to absolute totality is entirely impossible on the empirical road nevertheless that step is taken in the physicotheological proof how then has this broad abyss been bridged over     the fact is that after having reached the stage of admiration of the greatness the wisdom the power etc of the author of the world and seeing no further advance possible one suddenly leaves the argument carried on by empirical proofs and lays hold of that contingency which from the very first was inferred from the order and design of the world the next step from that contingency leads by means of transcendental concepts only to the existence of something absolutely necessary and another step from the absolute necessity of the first cause to its completely determined or determining concept namely that of an allembracing reality thus we see that the physicotheological proof baffled in its own undertaking takes suddenly refuge in the cosmological proof and as this is only the ontological proof in disguise it really carries out its original intention by means of pure reason only though it so strongly disclaimed in the beginning all connection with it and professed to base everything on clear proofs from experience those who adopt the physicotheological argument have  0  no reason to be so very coy towards the transcendental mode of argument and with the conceit of enlightened observers of nature to look down upon them as the cobwebs of dark speculators if they would only examine themselves they would find that after they had advanced a good way on the soil of nature and experience and found themselves nevertheless as much removed   0 as ever from the object revealed to their reason they suddenly leave that soil to enter into the realm of pure possibilities where on the wings of ideas they hope to reach that which had withdrawn itself from all their empirical investigations imagining themselves to be on firm ground after that desperate leap they now proceed to expand the definite concept which they have acquired they do not know how over the whole field of creation and they explain the ideal which was merely a product of pure reason by experience though in a very poor way and totally beneath the dignity of the object refusing all the while to admit that they have arrived at that knowledge or supposition by a very different road from that of experience thus we have seen that the physicotheological proof rests on the cosmological and the cosmological on the ontological proof of the existence of one original being as the supreme being and as besides these three there is no other path open to speculative reason the ontological proof based exclusively on pure concepts of reason is the only possible one always supposing that any proof of a proposition so far transcending the empirical use of the understanding is possible at all  0  section vii criticism of all theology based on speculative principles of reason     if by theology we understand the knowledge of the original being it is derived either from reason only theologia rationalis or from revelation revelata the former thinks its object either by pure reason and through transcendental concepts only ens originarium realissimum ens entium and is then called transcendental theology or by a concept borrowed from the nature of our soul as the highest intelligence and ought then to be called natural theology those who admit a transcendental theology only are called deists those who admit also a natural theology theists the former admit that we may know the existence of an original being by mere reason but that our concept of it is transcendental only as of a being which possesses all reality but a reality that cannot be further determined the latter maintain that reason is capable of determining that object more accurately in analogy with nature namely as a being which through understanding and freedom contains within itself the original ground of all other things the former admits a cause of the     world only whether through the necessity of its nature or through freedom remains undecided the latter an author of the world transcendental theology again either derives the existence of the original being from an experience in general without saying anything about the world to which it belongs and is then called cosmotheology or it believes  0  that it can know its existence without the help of any experience whatsoever and by mere concepts and is then called ontotheology natural theology infers the qualities and the existence of an author of the world from the constitution the order and the unity which are seen in this world in which two kinds of causality with their rules must be admitted namely nature and freedom it ascends from this world to the highest intelligence as the principle either of all natural or of all moral order and perfection in the former case it is called physicotheology in the other ethicotheology  as we are accustomed to understand by the concept of god not only a blindly working eternal nature as the root of all things but a supreme being which through understanding and freedom is supposed to be the     author of all things and as it is this concept alone in which we really take an interest one might strictly deny to the deist all belief in god and allow him only the maintaining of an original being or a supreme cause but as no one simply because he does not dare to assert ought to be accused of denying a thing it is kinder and juster to say that the deist believes in a god but the theist in a living god summa intelligentia we shall now try to discover the possible sources of all these attempts of reason i shall not do more at present than define theoretical knowledge as one by which i know what there is practical knowledge as one by which i represent to myself what ought to be hence the theoretical use of reason is that   0 by which i know a priori as necessary that something is while the practical use of reason is that by which i know a priori what ought to be if then it is certain beyond the possibility of doubt that something is or that something ought to be though both are conditioned then a certain definite condition of it may be either absolutely necessary or presupposed only as possible and contingent in the former case the condition is postulated per thesin in the latter supposed per hypothesin as there are practical laws which are absolutely necessary the moral laws it follows if they necessarily presuppose     any existence as the condition of the possibility of their obligatory power that the existence of that condition must be postulated because the conditioned from which we infer that condition has been recognised a priori as absolutely necessary on a future occasion we shall show that the moral laws not only presuppose the existence of a supreme being but that as they are in other respects absolutely necessary they postulate it by right though of course practically only for the present we leave this mode of argument untouched if we only speak of that which is not of that which ought to be the conditioned given to us in experience is always conceived as contingent and the condition belonging to it can therefore not be known as absolutely necessary but serves only as a relatively necessary or rather needful though in itself an a priori arbitrary supposition for a rational understanding of the conditioned if therefore we wish to know in our theoretical knowledge the absolute necessity of a thing this could only be done from concepts a priori and never as of a cause in reference to an existence which is given in experience     i call a theoretical knowledge speculative if it relates to an object or such concepts of an object which we can never reach in any experience it is opposed to our knowledge of nature which relates to no other objects     or predicates of them except those that can be given in a possible experience from something that happens the empirically contingent as an effect to infer a cause is a principle of natural though not of speculative knowledge for if we no longer use it as a principle involving the condition of possible experience and leaving out everything that is empirical try to apply it to the contingent in general there does not remain the smallest justification of such a synthetical proposition showing how from something which is there can be a transition to something totally different which we call cause nay in such purely speculative application the concepts both of cause and of the contingent lose all meaning the objective reality of which would be made intelligible in the concrete if from the existence of things in the world we infer their cause we are using reason not naturally but speculatively naturally reason refers not the things themselves substances but only that which happens their states as empirically contingent to some cause but it could know speculatively only that a substance itself matter is contingent in its existence and even if we were thinking only of the form of the world the     manner of its composition and the change of this composition and tried to infer from this a cause totally different from the world this would be again a judgment of speculative reason only because the object here is not an object of any possible experience in this case the principle of     causality which is valid within the field of experience only and utterly useless nay even meaningless outside it would be totally diverted from its proper destination what i maintain then is that all attempts at a purely speculative use of reason with reference to theology are entirely useless and intrinsically null and void while the principles of their natural use can never lead to any theology so that unless we depend on moral laws or are guided by them there cannot be any theology of reason for all synthetical principles of the understanding are applicable immanently only ie within its own sphere while in order to arrive at the knowledge of a supreme being we must use them transcendentally and for this our understanding is not prepared if the empirically valid law of causality is to conduct us to the original being that being must belong to the chain of objects of experience and in that case it would like all phenomena be itself conditioned and even if that sudden jump beyond the limits of     experience according to the dynamical law of the relation of effects to their causes could be allowed what concept could we gain by this proceeding certainly no concept of a supreme being because experience never presents to us the greatest of all possible effects to bear witness of its cause if we claim to be allowed only in order to leave no void in our reason to supply this defect in the complete determination of that cause by the mere idea of the highest perfection and of original necessity this may possibly be granted as a favour but can never be demanded on the strength of an irresistible proof the physicotheological proof as connecting speculation with intuition might possibly therefore be used in support of other proofs if they existed it cannot however finish the task for itself but     can only prepare the understanding for theological knowledge and impart to it the right and natural direction it must have been seen from this that transcendental questions admit of transcendental answers only that is of such which consist of mere concepts a priori without any empirical admixture our question however is clearly synthetical and requires an extension of our knowledge beyond all limits of experience till it reaches the existence of a being which is to correspond to our pure idea though no experience can ever be adequate to it according     to our former proofs all synthetical knowledge a priori is possible only if it conforms to the formal conditions of a possible experience all these principles therefore are of immanent validity only that is they must remain within the sphere of objects of empirical knowledge or of phenomena nothing therefore can be achieved by a transcendental procedure with reference to the theology of a purely speculative reason if people however should prefer to call in question all the former proofs of the analytic rather than allow themselves to be robbed of their persuasion of the value of the proofs on which they have rested so long they surely cannot decline my request when i ask them to justify themselves at least on this point in what manner and by what kind of illumination they trust themselves to soar above all possible experience on the wings of pure ideas i must ask to be excused from listening to new proofs or to the tinkered workmanship of the old no doubt the choice is not great for all speculative proofs end in the one namely the ontological nor need i fear to be much troubled by the inventive fertility of the dogmatical defenders of that reason which they have delivered from the     bondage of the senses nor should i even without considering myself a very formidable antagonist decline the challenge to detect the fallacy in every one of their attempts and thus to dispose of their pretensions but i know too well that the hope of better success     will never be surrendered by those who have once accustomed themselves to dogmatical persuasion and i therefore restrict myself to the one just demand that my opponents should explain in general from the nature of the human understanding or from any other sources of knowledge what we are to do in order to extend our knowledge entirely a priori and to carry it to a point where no possible experience and therefore no means whatever is able to secure to a concept invented by ourselves its objective reality in whatever way the understanding may have reached that concept it is clearly impossible that the existence of its object could be found in it through analysis because the very knowledge of the existence of the object implies that it exists outside our thoughts we cannot in fact go beyond concepts nor unless we follow the empirical connection by which nothing but phenomena can be given hope to discover new objects and imaginary beings although then reason in its purely speculative application is utterly insufficient for this great undertaking namely to prove the existence of a supreme being it has nevertheless this great advantage of being able to correct our knowledge of it if it can be acquired from   0 elsewhere to make it consistent with itself and every intelligible view and to purify it from everything incompatible with the concept of an original being and from all admixture of empirical limitations     in spite of its insufficiency therefore transcendental theology has a very important negative use as a constant test of our reason when occupied with pure ideas only which as such admit of a transcendental standard only for suppose that on practical grounds the admission of a highest and allsufficient being as the highest intelligence were to maintain its validity without contradiction it would be of the greatest importance that we should be able to determine that concept accurately on its transcendental side as the concept of a necessary and most real being to remove from it what is contradictory to that highest reality and purely phenomenal anthropomorphic in the widest sense and at the same time to put an end to all opposite assertions whether atheistic deistic or anthropomorphistic such a critical treatment would not be difficult because the same arguments by which the insufficiency of human reason in asserting the existence of such a being has been proved must be sufficient also to prove the invalidity of opposite assertions     for whence can anybody through pure speculation of reason derive his knowledge that there is no supreme being as the cause of all that exists or that it can claim none of those qualities which we to judge from their effects represent to ourselves as compatible with the dynamical realities of a thinking being or that in the latter case they would be subject to all those limitations which sensibility imposes inevitably on all the intelligences known to us by experience for the purely speculative use of reason therefore the supreme being remains no doubt an ideal only but an ideal without a flaw a concept which finishes and crowns the whole of human knowledge and the objective reality     of which though it cannot be proved can neither be disproved in that way if then there should be an ethicotheology to supply that deficiency transcendental theology which before was problematical only would prove itself indispensable in determining its concept and in constantly testing reason which is so often deceived by sensibility and not even always in harmony with its own ideas necessity infinity unity extramundane existence not as a worldsoul eternity free from conditions of time omnipresence free from conditions of space omnipotence etc all these are transcendental predicates and their purified     concepts which are so much required for every theology can therefore be derived from transcendental theology only appendix to the transcendental dialectic of the regulative use of the ideas of pure reason the result of all the dialectical attempts of pure reason does not only confirm what we proved in the transcendental analytic namely that all our conclusions which are to lead us beyond the field of possible experience are fallacious and groundless but teaches us also this in particular that human reason has a natural inclination to overstep these limits and that transcendental ideas are as natural to it as categories to the understanding with this distinction however that while the latter convey truth that is agreement of our concepts with their objects the former produce merely an irresistible illusion against which we can defend ourselves by the severest criticism only     everything that is founded in the nature of our faculties must have some purpose and be in harmony with the right use of them if only we can guard against a certain misunderstanding and discover their     proper direction the transcendental ideas therefore will probably possess their own proper and therefore immanent use although if their object is misunderstood and they are mistaken for the concepts of real things they may become transcendent in their application and hence deceptive for not the idea in itself but its use only can in regard to the whole of possible experience be either transcendent or immanent according as we direct them either immediately to objects wrongly supposed to correspond to them or only to the use of the understanding in general with reference to objects with which it has a right to deal all the faults of subreptio are to be attributed to a want of judgment never to the understanding or to reason themselves reason never refers immediately to an object but to the understanding only and through it to its own empirical use it does not form therefore concepts of objects but arranges them only and imparts to them that unity which they can have in their greatest possible extension that is with reference to the totality of different series while the understanding does not concern itself with this totality but only with that connection through which such series of conditions become possible according to concepts reason has therefore for its object     the understanding only and its fittest employment and as the understanding brings unity into the manifold of the objects by means of concepts reason brings unity into the manifold of concepts by means of ideas making a     certain collective unity the aim of the operations of the understanding which otherwise is occupied with distributive unity only i maintain accordingly that transcendental ideas ought never to be employed as constitutive so that by them concepts of certain objects should be given and that if they are so employed they are merely sophistical dialectic concepts they have however a most admirable and indispensably necessary regulative use in directing the understanding to a certain aim towards which all the lines of its rules converge and which though it is an idea only focus imaginarius that is a point from which as lying completely outside the limits of possible experience the concepts of the understanding do not in reality proceed serves nevertheless to impart to them the greatest unity and the greatest extension hence there arises no doubt the illusion as if those lines sprang  from an object itself outside the field of empirically possible experience as objects are seen behind the surface of a mirror but this illusion by which we need not allow ourselves to be deceived is nevertheless indispensably necessary if besides the objects which lie before our eyes     we want to see those also which lie far away at our back that is to say if as in our case we wish to direct the understanding beyond every given experience as a part of the whole of possible experience and thus to its greatest possible or extremest extension if we review the entire extent of our knowledge supplied to us by the understanding we shall find that it is the systematising of that knowledge that is its coherence     according to one principle which forms the proper province of reason this unity of reason always presupposes an idea namely that of the form of a whole of our knowledge preceding the definite knowledge of its parts and containing the conditions according to which we are to determine a priori the place of every part and its relation to the rest such an idea accordingly demands the complete unity of the knowledge of our understanding by which that knowledge becomes not only a mere aggregate but a system connected according to necessary laws we ought not to say that such an idea is a concept of an object but only of the complete unity of concepts so far as that unity can serve as a rule of the understanding such concepts of reason are not derived from nature but we only interrogate nature according to these ideas and consider our knowledge as defective so long as it is not adequate to them we must confess that     pure earth pure water pure air etc are hardly to be met with nevertheless we require the concepts of them which so far as their perfect purity is concerned have their origin in reason only in order to be able to determine properly the share which belongs to every one of these natural causes in phenomena thus every kind of matter is referred to earths as mere weight to salts and inflammable bodies as force and lastly to water and air as vehicles or as it were machines by which the former exercise their operations in order thus according to the idea of a mechanism to explain the mutual chemical workings of matter for although not openly acknowledged in these terms such an influence of reason on the classifications of natural philosophers can easily be discovered   0 if reason is the faculty of deducing the particular from the general the general is either certain in itself and given or not in the former case nothing is required but judgment in subsuming the particular being thus necessarily determined by the general this i shall call the apodictic use of reason in the latter case when the general is admitted as problematical only and as a mere idea while the particular is certain but the universality of the rule applying to it is still a problem several particular cases which are all certain are tested by the rule whether they submit to it and in this case when it appears that all particular cases which can be produced are subjected to it the rule is concluded to be     universal and from that universality of the rule conclusions are drawn afterwards with regard to all cases even those that are not given by themselves this i shall call the hypothetical use of reason the hypothetical use of reason resting on ideas as problematical concepts ought not to be used constitutively as if we could prove by it judging strictly the truth of the universal rule which has been admitted as an hypothesis for how are we to know all possible cases which as subject to the same principle should prove its universality the proper hypothetical use of reason is regulative only and intended to introduce as much as possible unity into the particulars of knowledge and thus to approximate the rule to universality the hypothetical use of reason aims therefore at the systematical unity of the knowledge of the understanding and that unity is the touchstone of the truth of the rules on the other hand that systematical unity as a mere idea is only a projected unity to be considered not as given in     itself but as a problem only though helping us to discover a principle for the manifold and particular exercise of the understanding and thus to lead the understanding to cases also which are not given and to render it more systematical we have learnt therefore that the systematical unity introduced by reason into the manifold knowledge     of the understanding is a logical principle intended to help the understanding by means of ideas where by itself it is insufficient to establish rules and at the same time to impart to the variety of its rules a certain harmony or system according to principles and by it a certain coherence so far as that is possible to say however whether the nature of the objects or the nature of the understanding which recognises them as objects were in themselves intended for systematical unity and whether to a certain extent we may postulate real unity a priori without any reference to the peculiar interest of reason maintaining that all possible kinds of knowledge of the understanding therefore the empirical also possess such unity and are subject to such general principles from which in spite of their differences they can all be derived would be to apply a transcendental principle of reason and to render systematical unity necessary not only subjectively and logically as a method but objectively also we shall try to illustrate this use of reason by an example one of the different kinds of unity according to the concepts of the understanding is that of the causality of a substance which we call power the different manifestations of one and the same substance display at first so much diversity that one feels constrained to admit at first almost as many powers as there are effects thus     we see for instance in the human mind sensation     consciousness imagination memory wit discrimination pleasure desire etc at first a simple logical maxim tells us to reduce this apparent diversity as much as possible by discovering through comparison hidden identity and finding out for instance whether imagination connected with consciousness be not memory wit discrimination or it may be understanding and reason the idea of a fundamental power of which logic knows nothing as to its existence is thus at least the problem of a systematical representation of the existing diversity of powers the logical principle of reason requires us to produce this unity as far as possible and the more we find that manifestations of one or the other power are identical the more probable does it become that they are only different expressions of one and the same power which relatively speaking may be called their fundamental power the same is done with the others these relatively fundamental powers must again be compared with each other in order if possible by discovering their harmony to bring them nearer to one only radical that is absolute fundamental power such a unity however is only an hypothesis of reason it is not maintained that such a unity must really exist but only that we must look for it in the interest of reason that is for the establishment of certain principles for the various rules supplied to us by experience and thus introduce if it is possible systematical unity into our knowledge   0 if however we watch the transcendental use of the understanding we find that the idea of a fundamental power is not only meant as a problem and for hypothetical     use but claims for itself objective reality postulating the systematical unity of the diverse powers of a substance and thus establishing an apodictic principle of reason for without even having tested the harmony of those diverse powers nay even if failing to discover it after repeated experiments we still suppose that such a unity exists and this not only as in our example on account of the unity of the substance but even in cases where very many though to a certain degree homogeneous powers are seen as in matter in general here too reason presupposes a systematical unity of diverse powers because particular laws of nature are subject to more general laws and parsimony in principles is not only considered as an economical rule of reason but as an essential law of nature and indeed it is difficult to understand how a logical principle by which reason demands the unity of rules can exist without a transcendental principle by which such a systematical unity is admitted as inherent in the objects themselves and as a priori necessary for how could reason in its logical application presume to treat     the diversity of powers which we see in nature as simply a disguised unity and to deduce it as far as possible from some fundamental power if it were open to reason to admit equally the diversity of all powers and to look upon the systematical unity in their derivation as contrary to nature in doing this reason would run counter to its own destination and propose as its aim an idea contrary to the constitution of nature nor could we say that reason had previously according to its principles deduced that unity from the contingent character of nature because this law of reason compelling her to look for unity is     necessary and without it we should have no reason at all and in the absence of reason no coherent use of the understanding and in the absence of that no sufficient test of empirical truth — on which account we must admit the systematical unity of nature as objectively valid and necessary we find this transcendental presupposition concealed in the cleverest way in the principles of philosophers though they are not aware of it nor have confessed it to themselves that all the diversities of particular things do not exclude identity of species that the various species must be treated as different determinations varieties     of a few genera and these again of still higher genera that therefore we ought to look for a certain systematical unity of all possible empirical concepts as derivable from higher and more general concepts this is a rule of the schools or a logical principle without which no use of the understanding would be possible for we can only conclude the particular from the general if the general qualities of things form the foundation on which the particular qualities rest that however there exists in nature such a unity is only a supposition of the philosophers embodied in their wellknown scholastic rule entia praeter necessitatem non esse multiplicanda beginnings or principles should not be multiplied beyond necessity it is implied in this that the nature of things itself offers material for the postulated unity of reason and that the apparent infinite variety ought not to prevent us from supposing behind it the existence of unity in fundamental properties from which all diversity is derived by mere determination only that unity though it is an idea only has been at all times so     zealously pursued that there was more ground for moderating than for encouraging the desire for it it was something when chemists succeeded in reducing all salts to two genera namely acids and alkalies but they tried to consider even this distinction as a variety only or as a different manifestation of one and the same fundamental     element different kinds of earths the material of stones and even of metals have been reduced gradually to three at last to two but not content with this chemists cannot get rid of the idea that there is behind those varieties but one genus nay that there may be even a common principle for the earths and the salts it might be supposed that this is only an economical trick of reason for the purpose of saving itself trouble and a purely hypothetical attempt which if successful would impart by that very unity a certain amount of probability to the presupposed principle of explanation such a selfish purpose however can easily be distinguished from the idea according to which we all presuppose that this unity of reason agrees with nature and that in this case reason does not beg but bids although we may be quite unable as yet to determine the limits of that unity if there existed among phenomena so great a diversity not of form for in this they may be similar but of contents that even the sharpest human understanding could not by a comparison of the one with the other discover the slightest similarity among them a case which is quite conceivable the logical law of genera would     have no existence at all there would be no concept of genus nor any general concept nay no understanding at all considering that the understanding has to do with concepts only the logical principle of genera presupposes     therefore a transcendental one if it is to be applied to nature that is to all objects presented to our senses according to it in the manifoldness of a possible experience some homogeneousness is necessarily supposed although it many be impossible to determine its degree a priori because without it no empirical concepts and consequently no experience would be possible the logical principle of genera which postulates identity is balanced by another principle namely that of species which requires manifoldness and diversity in things in spite of their agreement as belonging to the same genus and which prescribes to the understanding that it should pay no less attention to the one than to the other this principle depending on acute observation or on the faculty of distinction checks the generalising flights of fancy and reason thus exhibits a twofold and conflicting interest namely on the one hand the interest in the extent generality of genera on the other hand the interest in the contents distinction of the manifoldness of species in the former case the understanding thinks more under its concepts in the latter more in its concepts this distinction shows itself in the different manner of thought among students     of nature some of them who are preeminently speculative being almost averse to heterogeneousness and always intent on the unity of genera while others preeminently empirical are constantly striving to divide nature into so much variety that one might lose almost all hope of being able to judge its phenomena according to general principles this latter tendency of thought is likewise based on a logical principle which aims at the systematical completeness     of all knowledge so that beginning with the genus and descending to the manifold that may be contained in it we try to impart extension to our system as we tried to impart unity to it when ascending to a genus for if we only know the sphere of a concept which determines a genus we can no more judge how far its subdivision may be carried than we can judge how far the divisibility of matter may be carried by knowing the space it occupies hence every genus requires species and these again subspecies and as none even of these subspecies is without a sphere extent as conceptus communis reason in its utmost extension requires that no species or subspecies should in itself be considered as the lowest every species is always a concept containing that only which is common to different things and as it cannot be completely determined it cannot be directly referred to an individual but     must always comprehend other concepts that is subspecies this principle of specification might be expressed by entium varietates non temere esse minuendas it is easily seen that this logical law also would be without meaning and incapable of application unless it were founded on a transcendental law of specification which though it cannot demand a real infinity of variety in things that are to become our objects for this would not be justified by the logical principle which only asserts the indeterminability of the logical sphere with regard to a possible division yet imposes on the understanding the duty of looking for subspecies under every species and for smaller varieties for every variety if there were no lower concepts there could not be higher concepts now the understanding knows all that it knows by concepts     only and hence however far it may carry the division never by means of intuition alone but again and again by lower concepts in order to know phenomena in their complete determination which is possible by the understanding only it is necessary to carry on without stopping the specification of its concepts and always to proceed to still remaining differences or varieties of which abstraction had been made in forming the concept of the species and still more in forming that of the genus nor can this law of specification have been     derived from experience which can never give so farreaching a prospect empirical specification very soon comes to a standstill in the distinction of the manifold unless it is led by the antecedent transcendental law of specification as a principle of reason and impelled to look for and to conjecture still differences even where they do not appear to the senses that absorbent earths are of different kinds chalk and muriatic earths could only be discovered by an antecedent rule of reason which required the understanding to look for diversity because it presupposed such wealth in nature as to feel justified in anticipating such diversity for it is only under a presupposition of a diversity in nature and under the condition that its objects should be homogeneous that we have understanding because it is this very diversity of all that can be comprehended under a concept which constitutes the use of that concept and the occupation of the understanding reason thus prepares the field for the understanding —  st through the principle of the homogeneousness of the manifold as arranged under higher genera      ndly through the principle of the variety of the nomogeneous in lower species to which  rdly it adds a law of the affinity of all concepts which requires a continual transition from every species to every other species by a gradual increase of     diversity we may call these the principles of homogeneousness of specification and of continuity of forms the last arises from the union of the two former after both in ascending to higher genera and in descending to lower species the systematical connection in the idea has been completed so that all diversities are related to each other because springing from one highest genus through all degrees of a more and more extended determination we may represent to ourselves the systematical unity under these three logical principles in the following manner every concept may be regarded as a point which as the standpoint of the spectator has its own horizon enclosing a number of things that may be represented and as it were surveyed from that point within that horizon an infinite number of points must exist each of which has again its own narrower horizon that is every species contains subspecies according to the principle of specification and the logical horizon consists of smaller horizons subspecies only but not of points which possess no extent individuals but for all these different horizons that is genera determined by as many concepts a common horizon may be imagined in which they may all be surveyed as from a common centre this would be the higher genus while the highest     genus would be the universal and true horizon determined from the standpoint of the highest concept and comprehending all variety as genera species and subspecies   0 that highest standpoint is reached by the law of homogeneousness and all the lower standpoints in their greatest variety by the law of specification as in this way there is no void in the whole extent of all possible concepts and as nothing can be met with outside it there arises from the presupposition of that universal horizon and its complete division the principle of non datur vacuum formarum according to this principle there are no different original and first genera as it were isolated and separated from each other by an intervening void but all diverse genera are divisions only of one supreme and general genus from that principle springs its immediate consequence datur continuum formarum that is all the diversities of species touch each other and admit of no transition from one to another per saltum but only by small degrees of difference by which from one we arrive at the other in one word there are neither species nor subspecies which in the view of reason are the nearest possible to each other but there always remain possible intermediate species differing from the first and the second by   0 smaller degrees than those by which these differ from each other the first law therefore keeps us from admitting an extravagant variety of different original genera and recommends attention to homogeneousness the second on the contrary checks that tendency to unity and prescribes distinction of subspecies before applying any general concept to individuals the third unites both by prescribing even with the utmost variety homogeneousness through the gradual transition from the one species to another thus indicating a kind of relationship     of the different branches as having all sprung from the same stem this logical law however of the continuum specierum formarum logicarum presupposes a transcendental law lex continui in natura without which the understanding would only be misled by following it may be a path contrary to nature that law must therefore rest on purely transcendental and not on empirical grounds for in the latter case it would come later than the systems while in fact the systematical character of our knowledge of nature is produced by it nor are these laws intended only for tests to be carried out experimentally by their aid although such a connection if it is found in nature forms a powerful argument in support     of that unity which was conceived as hypothetical only these laws have therefore a certain utility in this respect also yet it is easily seen that they regard the parsimony of causes the manifoldness of effects and an affinity between the parts of nature arising from thence as both rational and natural so that these principles carry their recommendation direct and not only as aids towards a proper method of studying nature it is easy to see however that this continuity of forms is a mere idea and that no object corresponding to it can be pointed out in experience not only because the species in nature are actually divided and must form each by itself a quantum discretum while if the gradual progression of their affinity were continuous nature would contain a real infinity of intermediate links between every two given species which is impossible but also because we cannot make any definite empirical use of that law considering that not the smallest criterion of affinity is     indicated by it to tell us how and how far we ought to seek for grades of affinity it telling us only that we ought to seek for them if we now arrange these principles of systematical unity in the order required for their empirical employment     they might stand thus manifoldness variety and unity each of them as ideas taken in the highest degree of their completeness reason presupposes the cognitions of the understanding in their direct relation to experience and looks for their unity according to ideas which go far beyond the possibility of experience the affinity of the manifold in spite of its diversity under one principle of unity refers not only to things but even more to the qualities and powers of things thus if for example our imperfect experience represents to us the orbits of the planets as circular and we find deviations from that course we look for them in that which is able to change the circle according to a fixed law through infinite intervening degrees into one of these deviating courses that is we suppose that the movements of the planets which are not circular will approximate more or less to the properties of a circle and thus are led on to the ellipse the comets display a still greater deviation in their courses because so far as our experience goes they do not return in a circle and we then conjecture a parabolic course which at all events is allied to the ellipse and if its longer axis is widely extended cannot be distinguished from it in our observations we thus arrive     under the guidance of these principles at a unity of the different genera or kinds in the forms of these orbits and proceeding still further at a unity of the cause of all the laws of their movements namely gravitation here     we take our stand and extend our conquests trying to explain all varieties and seeming deviations from those rules from the same principle nay adding more than experience can ever affirm namely imaginary hyperbolic courses of comets constructed according to the rules of affinity in which courses these heavenly bodies may entirely leave our solar system and moving from sun to sun unite in their course the most distant parts of a universe unlimited to our minds but yet held together by one and the same moving power what is most remarkable in these principles and is in fact their chief interest for us is that they seem to be transcendental and although containing mere ideas for the guidance of the empirical use of reason ideas which our reason can only follow as it were asymptotically that is approximately and without our reaching them they nevertheless possess as synthetical propositions a priori an objective though an undefined validity serving as a rule for possible experience nay as heuristic principles in the elaboration of experience with all this a transcendental deduction of them cannot be produced     and is in fact as we have proved before always impossible with regard to ideas in the transcendental analytic we distinguished the dynamical principles of the understanding as purely regulative principles of the intuition from the mathematical which in regard to intuition are constitutive in spite of this these dynamical laws are constitutive with regard to experience because they render the concepts without which there can be no experience a priori possible the principles of pure reason however cannot be constitutive even with reference to empirical concepts because we cannot     assign to them any corresponding schema of sensibility they cannot consequently have any object in concreto if then i give up an empirical use of them as constitutive principles how can i yet secure to them a regulative employment and with it some objective validity and what can be the meaning of it the understanding forms an object for reason in the same manner as sensibility for the understanding it is the proper business of reason to render the unity of all possible empirical acts of the understanding systematical in the same manner as the understanding connects the manifold of phenomena by concepts and brings it under empirical laws the acts of the understanding however without the schemata of sensibility are undefined and in the same manner the unity of reason is in itself     undefined with reference to the conditions under which and the extent to which the understanding may connect its concepts systematically but although no schema of intuition can be discovered for the perfect systematical unity of all the concepts of the understanding it is possible and necessary that there should be an analogon of such a schema and this is the idea of the maximum both of the division and of the combination of the knowledge of the understanding under one single principle it is quite possible to form a definite thought of what is greatest and absolutely complete when all restrictive conditions that lead to an undefined manifoldness have been omitted in this sense the idea of reason forms an analogon of the schema of sensibility but with this difference that the application of the concepts of the understanding to the schema of reason is not a knowledge of the object itself as in the case of the application of the categories     to sensuous schemata but only a rule or principle for the systematical unity in the whole use of the understanding now as every principle which fixes a priori a perfect unity of its use for the understanding is valid though indirectly only for the object of experience also it follows that the principles of pure reason have objective reality with reference to that object also not however in order to determine anything therein but only in order to indicate the procedure by which the empirical and definite use of the understanding may throughout remain     in complete harmony with itself by being brought into connection as much as possible with the principle of systematical unity and being deduced from it i call all subjective principles which are derived not from the quality of an object but from the interest which reason takes in a certain possible perfection of our knowledge of an object maxims of reason thus there are maxims of speculative reason which rest entirely on its speculative interest though they may seem to be objective principles when purely regulative principles are taken for constitutive they may become contradictory as objective principles if however they are taken for maxims only there is no real contradiction but it is only the different interest of reason which causes different modes of thought in reality reason has one interest only and the conflict of its maxims arises only from a difference and a mutual limitation of the methods in which that interest is to be satisfied in this manner one philosopher is influenced more by the interest of diversity according to the principle of specification another by the interests of unity according     to the principle of aggregation each believes     that he has derived his judgment from his insight into the object and yet founds it entirely on the greater or smaller attachment to one of the two principles neither  of which rests on objective grounds but only on an interest of reason and should therefore be called maxims rather than principles i often see even intelligent men quarrelling with each other about the characteristic distinctions of men animals or plants nay even of minerals the one admitting the existence of certain tribal characteristics founded on descent or decided and inherited differences of families races etc while others insist that nature has made the same provision for all and that all differences are due to accidental environment but they need only consider the nature of the object in order to understand that it is far too deeply hidden for both of them to enable them to speak from a real insight into the nature of the object it is nothing but the twofold interest of reason one party cherishing the one another party the other or pretending to do so but this difference of the two maxims of manifoldness or unity in nature may easily be adjusted though as long as they are taken for objective knowledge they cause not only disputes but actually create impediments which hinder the progress of truth until a means is found of reconciling     the contradictory interests and thus giving satisfaction to reason the same applies to the assertion or denial of the famous law of the continuous scale of created beings first advanced by leibniz and so cleverly trimmed up by     bonnet it is nothing but a carrying out of the principle of affinity resting on the interest of reason for neither observation nor insight into the constitution of nature could ever have supplied it as an objective assertion the steps of such a ladder as far as they can be supplied by experience are too far apart from each other and the socalled small differences are often in nature itself such wide gaps that no value can be attached to such observations as revealing the intentions of nature particularly as it must always be easy to discover in the great variety of things certain similarities and approximations the method on the contrary of looking for order in nature according to such a principle and the maxim of admitting such order though it may be uncertain where and how far as existing in nature in general form certainly a legitimate and excellent regulative principle of reason only that as such it goes far beyond where experience or observation could follow it it only indicates the way which leads to systematical unity but does not determine anything beyond of the ultimate aim of the natural dialectic of human reason     the ideas of pure reason can never be dialectical in themselves but it must be due to their misemployment if a deceptive illusion arise from them they are given to us by the nature of our reason and this highest tribunal of all the rights and claims of speculation cannot possibly itself contain original fallacies and deceits we must suppose therefore that they had a good and legitimate intention in the natural disposition of our reason     the mob of sophists however cry out as usual about absurdities and contradictions and blame the government the secret plans of which they cannot even understand while it is to its beneficent influence that they owe their protection and that amount of intelligence which enables them to blame and condemn the government we cannot use a concept a priori with any safety without having first established its transcendental deduction it is true the ideas of pure reason do not allow of a deduction in the same manner as the categories but if they are to claim any though only an undefined objective validity and are not to represent mere fictions of thought only entia rationis ratiocinantis a   0 deduction of them must be possible even though it may differ from that which we were able to give of the categories this will form the completion of the critical task of pure reason and it is this which we now mean to undertake it makes a great difference whether something is represented to our reason as an object absolutely or merely as an object in the idea in the former case my concepts are meant to determine the object in the latter there is only a schema to which no object not even a hypothetical one corresponds directly but which only serves to represent to ourselves indirectly other objects through their relation to that idea and according to their systematical unity thus i say that the concept of a highest intelligence is a mere idea that is that its objective reality is not to consist in its referring directly to any object for in that sense we should not be able to justify its objective validity but that it is only a schema arranged according to the conditions of the highest unity of reason of the concept of a     thing in general serving only to obtain the greatest systematical unity in the empirical use of our reason by helping us as it were to deduce the object of experience from the imagined object of that idea as its ground or cause thus we are led to say for instance that the     things of the world must be considered as if they owed their existence to some supreme intelligence and the idea is thus a heuristic only not an ostensive concept showing us not how an object is really constituted but how we under the guidance of that concept should look for the constitution and connection of the objects of experience in general if then it can be shown that the three transcendental ideas the psychological cosmological and theological although they cannot be used directly to determine any object corresponding to them yet as rules  of the empirical use of reason will lead under the presupposition of such an object in the idea to a systematical unity and to an extension of our empirical knowledge without ever running counter to this knowledge it becomes a necessary maxim of reason to act in accordance with such ideas and this is really the transcendental deduction of all ideas of speculative reason considered not as constitutive principles for extending our knowledge to more objects than can be given by experience but as regulative principles for the systematical unity of the manifold of empirical knowledge in general which knowledge within its own limits can thus be better arranged and improved than it would be possible without such ideas and by the mere use of the principles of the understanding   0 i shall try to make this clearer following     these ideas as principles we shall first in psychology connect all phenomena all the activity and receptivity of our mind according to our internal experience as if our mind were a simple substance existing permanently and with personal identity in this life at least while its states to which those of the body belong as external conditions are changing continually secondly in cosmology we are bound to follow up the conditions both of internal and external natural phenomena in an investigation that can never become complete looking upon this investigation as infinite and without any first or supreme member but we ought not therefore to deny the purely intelligible first grounds of these phenomena as outside of them though not allowed to bring them ever into connection with our explanations of nature for the simple reason that we do not know them thirdly and lastly in theology we must consider everything that may belong to the whole of possible experience as if that experience formed one absolute but thoroughly dependent and always within the world of sense conditioned unity but at the same time as if it the whole of phenomena the world of sense itself had one supreme and allsufficient ground outside its sphere namely an independent original creative reason in reference to which we direct all empirical use of our     reason in its widest extension in such a way as if the objects themselves had sprung from that archetype of all reason in other words we ought not to derive the internal phenomena of the soul as if from a simple thinking substance but derive them from each other according to the idea of a simple being we ought not to derive the order and systematical unity of the world from a supreme     intelligence but borrow from the idea of a supremely wise cause the rule according to which reason may best be used for her own satisfaction in the connection of causes and effects in this world now there is nothing that could in the least prevent us from admitting these ideas as objective and hypostatical also except in the case of the cosmological idea where reason when trying to carry it out objectively is met by an antinomy there is no such antinomy in the psychological and theological ideas and how could anybody contest their objective reality as he knows as little how to deny as we how to assert their possibility it is true nevertheless that in order to admit anything it is not enough that there should be no positive impediment to it nor are we allowed to introduce fictions of our thoughts transcending all our concepts though contradicting none as real and definite objects on the mere credit of our somewhat perfunctory speculative reason     they should not therefore be admitted as real in themselves but their reality should only be considered as the reality of a schema of a regulative principle for the systematical unity of all natural knowledge hence they are to be admitted as analoga only of real things and not as real things in themselves we remove from the object of an idea the conditions which limit the concepts of our understanding and which alone enable us to have a definite concept of anything and then we represent to ourselves a something of which we know not in the least what it is by itself but which nevertheless we represent to ourselves in a relation to the whole of phenomena analogous to that relation which phenomena have among themselves if therefore we admit such ideal beings we do not really     enlarge our knowledge beyond the objects of possible experience but only the empirical unity of those objects by means of that systematical unity of which the idea furnishes us the schema and which therefore cannot claim to be a constitutive but only a regulative principle for if we admit a something or a real being corresponding to the idea we do not intend thereby to enlarge our knowledge of things by means of transcendental  concepts for such a being is admitted in the idea only and not by itself and only in order to express that systematical unity which is to guide the empirical use of our reason     without stating anything as to what is the ground of that unity or the internal nature of such a being on which as its cause that unity depends thus the transcendental and the only definite concept which purely speculative reason gives us of god is in the strictest sense deistic that is reason does not even supply us with the objective validity of such a concept but only with the idea of something on which the highest and necessary unity of all empirical reality is founded and which we cannot represent to ourselves except in analogy with a real substance being according to the laws of nature the cause of all things always supposing that we undertake to think it at all as a particular object and satisfied with the mere idea of the regulative principle of reason do not rather put aside the completion of all the conditions of our thought as too much for the human understanding which however is hardly compatible with that perfect systematical     unity of our knowledge to which reason at least imposes no limits thus it happens that if we admit a divine being we have not the slightest conception either of the internal possibility of its supreme perfection nor of the     necessity of its existence but are able at least thus to satisfy all other questions relating to contingent things and give the most perfect satisfaction to reason with reference to that highest unity in its empirical application that has to be investigated but not in reference to that hypothesis itself this proves that it is the speculative interest of reason and not its real insight which justifies it in starting from a point so far above its proper sphere in order to survey from thence its objects as belonging to a complete whole here we meet with a distinction in our mode of thought the premisses remaining the same a distinction which is somewhat subtle but of great importance in transcendental philosophy i may have sufficient ground for admitting something relatively suppositio relativa without having a right to admit it absolutely suppositio absoluta this distinction comes in when we have to deal with a regulative principle of which we know the necessity by itself but not the source of this necessity and where we admit a supreme cause only in order to think the universality of the principle with greater definiteness thus if i think of a being as existing which corresponds to a mere idea and to a transcendental one i ought not to admit the existence of such a being by itself because no concepts through which i can conceive any     object definitely can reach it and the conditions of the objective validity of my concepts are excluded by the idea     itself the concepts of reality of substance even of causality and those of necessity in existence have no meaning that could determine any object unless they are used to make the empirical knowledge of an object possible they may be used therefore to explain the possibility of things in the world of sense but not to explain the possibility of a universe itself because such an hypothesis is outside the world and could never be an object of possible experience i can however admit perfectly well such an inconceivable being being the object of a mere idea relative to the world of sense though not as existing by itself for if the greatest possible empirical use of my reason depends on an idea on the systematically complete unity of which i shall soon speak more in detail which by itself can never be adequately represented in experience though it is indispensably necessary in order to bring the empirical unity as near as possible to the highest perfection i shall not only have the right but even the duty to realise such an idea that is to assign to it a real object though only as a something in general which by itself i do not know at all and to which as the cause of that systematical unity i ascribe in reference to it such qualities as are analogous to the concepts     employed by the understanding in dealing with experience i shall therefore according to the analogy of realities in the world of substances of causality and of necessity conceive a being possessing all these in the highest perfection and as this idea rests on my reason only conceive that being as selfsubsistent reason being through the ideas of the greatest harmony and unity the cause of the universe in doing this i omit all conditions which could limit the idea simply in order to render with     the help of such a fundamental cause the systematical unity of the manifold in the universe and through it the greatest possible empirical use of reason possible i then look upon all connections in the world as if they were ordered by a supreme reason of which our own reason is but a faint copy and i represent to myself that supreme being through concepts which properly speaking are applicable to the world of sense only as however i make none but a relative use of that transcendental hypothesis as the substratum of the greatest possible unity of experience i may perfectly well represent a being which i distinguish from the world by qualities which belong to the world of sense only for i demand by no means nor am i justified in demanding that i should know that object of my idea according to what it may be by itself i have no concepts whatever for it and even the concepts     of reality substance causality ay of the necessity in existence lose all their meaning and become mere titles of concepts void of contents as soon as i venture with them outside the field of the senses i only present to myself the relation of a being utterly unknown to me as existing by itself to the greatest possible systematical unity of the universe in order to use it as a schema of the regulative principle of the greatest possible empirical use of my reason if now we glance at the transcendental object of our idea we find that we cannot according to the concepts of reality substance causality etc presuppose its reality by itself because such concepts are altogether inapplicable to something totally distinct from the world of sense the supposition therefore which reason makes of a supreme being as the highest cause is relative only devised     for the sake of the systematical unity in the world of sense and a mere something in the idea while we have no concept of what it may be by itself thus we are able to understand why we require the idea of an original being necessary by itself with reference to all that is given to the senses as existing but can never have the slightest conception of it and of its absolute necessity at this point we are able to place the results of the whole transcendental dialectic clearly before our eyes and to define accurately the final aim of the ideas   0 of pure reason which could become dialectical through misapprehension and carelessness only pure reason is in fact concerned with nothing but itself nor can it have any other occupation because what is given to it are not the objects intended for the unity of an empirical concept but the knowledge supplied by the understanding for the unity of the concept of reason that is of its connection according to a principle the unity of reason is the unity of a system and that systematical unity does not serve objectively as a principle of reason to extend its sway over objects but subjectively as a maxim to extend its sway over all possible empirical knowledge of objects nevertheless the systematical connection which reason can impart to the understanding in its empirical use helps not only to extend that use but confirms at the same time its correctness nay the principle of such systematical unity is objective also though in an indefinite manner principium vagum not as a constitutive principle determining something in its direct object but only as a regulative principle and maxim advancing and strengthening infinitely indefinitely the empirical use of reason by the opening of new paths unknown to the understanding     without ever running counter to the laws of its practical use reason however cannot think this systematical     unity without attributing to its idea an object which as experience has never given an example of complete systematical unity can never be given in any experience this being demanded by reason ens rationis ratiocinatae is no doubt a mere idea and not therefore received as something absolutely real and real by itself it is only admitted problematically for we cannot reach it by any concepts of the understanding in order to enable us to look upon the connection of things in the world of sense as if they had their ground in that being the real intention being to found upon it that systematical unity which is indispensable to reason helpful in every way to the empirical knowledge of the understanding and never a hindrance to it we misapprehend at once the true meaning of that idea if we accept it as the assertion or even as the hypothesis of a real thing to which the ground of the systematical construction of the world should be ascribed what we ought to do is to leave it entirely uncertain what that ground which escapes all our concepts may be by itself and to use the idea only as a point of view from which alone we may expand that unity which is as essential to reason as beneficial to the understanding in one word that transcendental thing is only the schema of     the regulative principle with which reason spreads systematical unity as far as possible over all experience the first object of such an idea is the ego considered merely as a thinking nature soul now if i want to know the qualities with which a thinking being exists in     itself i have to consult experience but of all the categories i cannot apply a single one to that object unless its schema is given in sensuous intuition thus however i can never arrive at a systematical unity of all the phenomena of the internal sense reason therefore instead of taking from experience the concept of that which the soul is in reality which would not lead us very far prefers the concept of the empirical unity of all thought and by representing that unity as unconditioned and original it changes it into a concept of reason or an idea of a simple substance a substance unchangeable in itself personally identical and in communication with other real things outside it in one word into a simple selfsubsistent intelligence in doing this its object is merely to find principles of systematical unity for the explanation of the phenomena of the soul so that all determinations may be received as existing in one subject all powers as much as possible as derived from one fundamental power and all changes as belonging to the states of one and the same permanent being while all phenomena in     space are represented as totally different from the acts of thought that simplicity of substance etc was only meant to be the schema of this regulative principle it is not assumed to be the real ground of all the properties of the soul these properties may rest on quite different grounds of which we know nothing nor could we know the soul even by these assumed predicates by itself even if we regarded them as absolutely valid with regard to it for they really constitute a mere idea which cannot be represented in concreto nothing but good can spring from such a psychological idea if only we take care not to take it for more than an idea that is if we apply it only in relation     to the systematical use of reason with reference to the phenomena of our soul for in that case no empirical laws of corporeal phenomena which are of a totally different kind are mixed up with the explanation of what belongs to the internal sense and no windy hypothesis of generation extinction and palingenesis of souls are admitted the consideration of this object of the internal sense remains pure and unmixed with heterogeneous matters while reason in its investigations is directed towards tracing all the grounds of explanation as far as possible to one single principle and this can best be achieved     nay cannot be achieved otherwise but by such a schema which attributes to the soul hypothetically the character of a real being the psychological idea cannot be anything but such a schema of a regulative concept the very question for instance whether the soul by itself be of a spiritual nature would have no meaning because by such a concept i should take away not only corporeal but all nature that is all predicates of any possible experience and therefore all the conditions under which the object of such a concept could be thought and in that case the concept would have no meaning at all the second regulative idea of speculative reason is the concept of the universe for nature is really the only object given to us in regard to which reason requires regulative principles nature however is twofold either thinking or corporeal in order to think the internal possibility of the latter that is in order to determine the application of the categories to it we require no idea that is no representation which transcends experience nor is such an idea possible in regard to it because we are here guided by sensuous intuition only different from   0 what it was in the case of the psychological fundamental concept of the i which contains a priori a certain form of thought namely the unity of the i there remains therefore for pure reason nothing to deal with but     nature in general and the completeness of its conditions according to some principle the absolute totality of the series of these conditions determining the derivation of all their members is an idea which though never brought to perfection in the empirical use of reason may yet become a rule telling us how to proceed in the explanation of given phenomena whether in an ascending or descending line namely as if the series were in themselves infinite that is in indefinitum while when reason itself is considered as the determining cause in freedom in the case of practical principles therefore we must proceed as if we had to deal not with an object of the senses but with one of the pure understanding here the conditions are no longer placed within the series of phenomena but outside it and the series of states considered as if it had an absolute beginning through an intelligible cause all this proves that cosmological ideas are nothing but regulative principles and by no means constitutive as establishing a real totality of such series the remainder of this argument may be seen in its place namely in the chapter on the antinomy of pure reason the third idea of pure reason containing a merely relative hypothesis of a being which is the only and allsufficient cause of all cosmological series is the idea of god we have not the slightest ground to     admit absolutely the object of that idea to suppose it in itself for what could enable or even justify us in believing or asserting a being of the highest perfection and     absolutely necessary from its very nature on the strength of its concept only except the world with reference to which alone such an hypothesis may be called necessary we then perceive that the idea of it like all speculative ideas means no more than that reason requires us to consider all connection in the world according to the principles of a systematical unity and therefore as if the whole of it had sprung from a single allembracing being as its highest and allsufficient cause we see therefore that reason can have no object here but its own formal rule in the extension of its empirical use but can never aim at extension beyond all limits of its empirical application this idea therefore does not involve a constitutive principle of its use as applied to possible experience the highest formal unity which is based on concepts of reason alone is the systematical and purposeful unity of things and it is the speculative interest of reason which makes it necessary to regard all order in the world as if it had originated in the purpose of a supreme wisdom such a principle opens to our reason in the field of experience quite new views how to connect the things     of the world according to teleological laws and thus to arrive at their greatest systematical unity the admission of a highest intelligence as the only cause of the universe though in the idea only can therefore always benefit reason and yet never injure it for if with regard to the figure of the earth which is round though somewhat flattened  of mountains and seas etc we     admit at once nothing but wise intentions of their author we are enabled to make in this wise a number of important discoveries if we keep to this hypothesis as a purely regulative principle even error cannot hurt us much for the worst that could happen would be that when we expected a teleological connection nexus finalis we only find a mechanical or physical nexus effectivus in which case we merely lose an additional unity but we     do not destroy the unity of reason in its empirical application and even this failure could not affect the law itself in its general and teleological character for although an anatomist may be convicted of error if referring any member of an animal body to a purpose of which it can clearly be shown that it does not belong to it it is entirely impossible in any given case to prove that an arrangement of nature be it what it may has no purpose at all medical physiology therefore enlarges its very limited empirical knowledge of the purposes of the members of an organic body by a principle inspired by pure reason only so far as to admit confidently and with the approbation of all intelligent persons that everything in an animal has its purpose and advantage such a supposition if used constitutively goes far beyond where our present observation would justify us in going which shows that it is nothing but a regulative principle of reason leading us on to the highest systematical unity by     the idea of an intelligent causality in the supreme cause of the world and by the supposition that this as the highest intelligence is the cause of everything according to the wisest design but if we remove this restriction of the idea     to a merely regulative use reason is led away in many ways it leaves the ground of experience which ought always to show the vestiges of its progress and ventures beyond it to what is inconceivable and unsearchable becoming giddy from the very height of it and from seeing itself on that high standpoint entirely cut off from its proper work in agreement with experience the first fault which arises from our using the idea of a supreme being not regulatively only but contrary to the nature of an idea constitutively is what i call the indolence of reason ignava ratio  we may so term every principle which causes us to look on our investigation of nature wherever it may be as absolutely complete so that reason may rest as if her task were fully   0 accomplished thus the task of reason is rendered very easy even by the psychological idea if that idea is used as a constitutive principle for the explanation of the phenomena of our soul and afterwards even for the extension of our knowledge of this subject beyond all possible experience its state after death but the natural use of reason under the guidance of experience is thus entirely     ruined and destroyed the dogmatical spiritualist finds no difficulty in explaining the unchanging unity of the person amidst all the changes of condition from the unity of the thinking substance which he imagines he perceives directly in the i — or the interest which we take in things that are to happen after death from the consciousness of the immaterial nature of our thinking subject and so on he dispenses with all investigations of the origin of these internal phenomena from physical causes passing by as it were by a decree of transcendent reason the immanent sources of knowledge given by experience this may be convenient to himself but involves a sacrifice of all real insight these detrimental consequences become still more palpable in the dogmatism involved in our idea of a supreme intelligence and of the theological system of nature erroneously based on it physicotheology for here all the aims which we observe     in nature many of which we only imagined ourselves serve to make the investigation of causes extremely easy if instead of looking for them in the general mechanical laws of matter we appeal directly to the unsearchable counsel of the supreme wisdom imagining the efforts of our reason as ended when we have really dispensed with its employment which nowhere finds its proper guidance except where the order of nature and the succession of changes according to their own internal and general laws supply it this error may be avoided if we do not merely consider certain parts of nature such as the distribution of land its structure the constitution and direction of certain mountains or even the organisation of plants and animals from the standpoint of final aims but look upon this systematical unity of nature as something general in     relation to the idea of a supreme intelligence for in this case we look upon nature as founded on intelligent purposes according to general laws no particular arrangement of nature being exempt from them but only exhibiting them more or less distinctly we have them in fact a regulative principle of the systematical unity in a teleological connection though we do not determine it beforehand but only look forward to it expectantly while following up the physicomechanical connection according     to general laws in this way alone can the principle of systematical and intelligent unity enlarge the use of reason with reference to experience without at any time being prejudicial to it the second error arising from the misapprehension of the principle of systematical unity is that of perverted reason perversa ratio ὕστερον πρότερον rationis the idea of systematic unity was only intended as a regulative principle for discovering that unity according to general laws in the connection of things believing that we have approached the completeness of its use by exactly so much as we have discovered of it empirically though never able to reach it fully instead of this the procedure is reversed the reality of a principle of systematical unity is at once admitted and hypostasised the concept of such a supreme intelligence though being in itself entirely inscrutable is determined anthropomorphically and aims are afterwards imposed on nature violently and dictatorially instead of looking for them by means of physical investigation thus teleology which was meant to supplement the unity of nature according to general laws contributes only     to destroy it and reason deprives itself of its own aim     namely that of proving the existence of such an intelligent supreme cause from nature for if we may not presuppose a priori the most perfect design in nature as belonging to its very essence what should direct us to look for it and to try to approach by degrees to the highest perfection of an author that is to an absolutely necessary and a priori intelligible perfection the regulative principle requires us to admit absolutely and as following from the very nature of things systematical unity as an unity of nature which has not only to be known empirically but must be admitted a priori though as yet in an indefinite form only but if i begin with a supreme ordaining being as the ground of all things the unity of nature is really surrendered as being quite foreign to the nature of things purely contingent and not to be known from its own general laws thus arises a vicious circle by our presupposing what in reality ought to have been proved to mistake the regulative principle of the systematical unity of nature for a constitutive principle and to presuppose hypostatically as cause what is only in the idea made the foundation for the consistent use of     reason is simply to confound reason the investigation of nature pursues its own course guided by the chain of natural causes only according to general laws it knows the idea of an author but not in order to derive from it that system of purposes which it tries to discover everywhere but in order to recognise his existence from those purposes which are sought in the essence of the things of nature and if possible also in the essence of all things in general and consequently to recognise his existence as absolutely necessary whether this succeeds     or not the idea itself remains always true as well as its use if only it is restricted to the conditions of a merely regulative principle complete unity of design constitutes perfection absolutely considered if we do not find such perfection in the nature of the things which form the object of experience that is of all our objectively valid knowledge if we do not find it in the general and necessary laws of nature how shall we thence infer the idea of a supreme and absolutely necessary perfection of an original being as the origin of all causality the greatest systematical and therefore wellplanned unity teaches us and first enables us to make the widest use of human reason and that idea is therefore inseparably connected with     the very nature of our reason that idea becomes in fact to us a law and hence it is very natural for us to assume a corresponding lawgiving reason intellectus archetypus from which as the object of our reason all systematical unity of nature should be derived when discussing the antinomy of pure reason we remarked that all questions raised by pure reason must admit of an answer and that the excuse derived from the natural limits of our knowledge which in many questions concerning nature is as inevitable as it is just cannot be admitted here because questions are here placed before us through the very nature of our reason referring entirely to its own natural constitution and not to the nature of things we have now an opportunity of confirming this assertion of ours which at first sight may have appeared rash with regard to the two questions in which pure reason takes the greatest interest and of thus bringing to perfection our considerations on the dialectic of pure reason     if then we are asked the question with reference to a transcendental theology  first whether there is something different from the world containing the     ground of the order of the world and of its connection according to general laws our answer is certainly there is for the world is a sum of phenomena and there must therefore be some transcendental ground of it that is a ground to be thought by the pure understanding only if secondly we are asked whether that being is a substance of the greatest reality necessary etc our answer is that such a question has no meaning at all for all the categories by which i can try to frame to myself a concept of such an object admit of none but an empirical use and have no meaning at all unless they are applied to objects of possible experience that is to the world of sense outside that field they are mere titles of concepts which we may admit but by which we can understand nothing if thirdly the question is asked whether we may not at least conceive this being which is different from the world in analogy with the objects of experience our answer is certainly we may but only as an object in the idea and not in the reality that is in so far only as it remains a     substratum unknown to us of the systematic unity order and design of the world which reason is obliged to adopt as a regulative principle in the investigation of     nature nay more we need not be afraid to admit certain anthropomorphisms in that idea which favour the regulative principle of our investigations for it always remains an idea only which is never referred directly to a being different from the world but only to the regulative principle of the systematical unity of the world and this by some schema of it namely that of a supreme intelligence being the author of it for the wisest purposes it was not intended that by it we should try to form a conception of what that original cause of the unity of the world may be by itself it was only meant to teach us how to use it or rather its idea with reference to the systematical use of reason applied to the things of the world but surely people will proceed to ask we may according to this admit a wise and omnipotent author of the world certainly we answer and not only we may but we must in that case therefore we surely extend our knowledge beyond the field of possible experience by no means for we have only presupposed a something of which we have no conception whatever as to     what it is by itself as a purely transcendental object we have only with reference to the systematical and welldesigned order of the world which we must presuppose if we are to study nature at all presented to ourselves that unknown being in analogy with what is an empirical concept namely an intelligence that is we have with reference to the purposes and the perfection which depend on it attributed to it those very qualities on which according to the conditions of our reason such a systematical unity may depend that idea therefore is entirely founded on the employment of our reason in the   0 world and if we were to attribute to it absolute and objective validity we should be forgetting that it is only a being in the idea which we think and as we should then be taking our start from a cause that cannot be determined by mundane considerations we should no longer be able to employ that principle in accordance with the empirical use of reason but people will go on to ask may we not then in this way use that concept and the supposition of a supreme being in a rational consideration of the world no doubt we may and it was for that very purpose that that idea of reason was established and if it be asked whether we may look upon arrangements in nature which have all the appearance of design as real designs and trace them back to a divine will though with the     intervention of certain arrangements in the world we answer again yes but only on condition that it be the same to you whether we say that the divine wisdom has arranged everything for the highest purposes or whether we take the idea of the supreme wisdom as our rule in the investigation of nature and as the principle of its systematical and wellplanned unity according to general laws even when we are not able to perceive that unity in other words it must be the same to you when you do perceive it whether we say god has wisely willed it so or nature has wisely arranged it so for it was that greatest systematical and wellplanned unity required by your reason as the regulative principle of all investigation of nature which gave you the right to admit the idea of a supreme intelligence as the schema of that regulative principle as much of design therefore as you discover in the world according to that principle so much of confirmation     has the legitimacy of your idea received but as that principle was only intended for finding the necessary and greatest possible unity in nature we shall no doubt owe that unity so far as we may find it to our idea of a supreme being but we cannot without contradicting ourselves ignore the general laws of nature for which that idea was adopted or look upon the designs of nature as contingent and hyperphysical  00 in their origin for we were not justified in admitting a being endowed with those qualities as above nature hyperphysical but only in using the idea of it in order to be able to look on all phenomena  as being systematically connected among themselves in analogy with a causal determination for the same reason we are justified not only in representing to ourselves the cause of the world in our idea according to a subtle kind of anthropomorphism without which we can think nothing of it as a being endowed with understanding the feelings of pleasure and displeasure and accordingly with desire and will but also in attributing to it infinite perfection which therefore far transcends any perfection known to us from the empirical knowledge of the order of the world for the regulative law of systematical unity requires that we should study nature as if there existed in it everywhere with the greatest possible variety an infinitely systematical and wellplanned unity and although we can discover but little of that perfection of the world it is nevertheless a law of our reason always to look for it and to expect it and it must be beneficial and can never be hurtful to     carry on the investigation of nature according to this principle but in admitting this fundamental  0  idea of a supreme author it is clear that i do not admit the existence and knowledge of such a being but its idea only and that in reality i do not derive anything from that being but only from the idea of it that is from the nature of the things of the world according to such an idea it seems also as if a certain though undeveloped consciousness of the true use of this concept of reason had dictated the modest and reasonable language of philosophers of all times when they use such expressions as the wisdom and providence of nature as synonymous with divine wisdom nay even prefer the former expression when dealing with speculative reason only as avoiding the pretension of a greater assertion than we are entitled to make and at the same time restricting reason to its proper field namely nature thus we find that pure reason which at first seemed to promise nothing less than extension of our knowledge beyond all limits of experience contains if properly understood nothing but regulative principles which indeed postulate greater unity than the empirical use of the understanding can ever achieve but which by the very fact that they place the goal which has to be reached at so great a distance carry the agreement of the understanding with itself by means of systematical  0  unity to the highest possible degree while if they are misunderstood and mistaken for constitutive principles of transcendent knowledge they produce by a brilliant but deceptive illusion some kind of persuasion and imaginary knowledge but at the same time constant contradictions and disputes                                         thus all human knowledge begins with intuitions advances to concepts and ends with ideas although with reference to every one of these three elements it possesses a priori sources of knowledge which at first sight seemed to despise the limits of all experience a perfect criticism soon convinces us that reason in its speculative use can never get with these elements beyond the field of possible experience and that it is the true destination of that highest faculty of knowledge to use all methods and principles of reason with one object only namely to follow up nature into her deepest recesses according to every principle of unity the unity of design being the most important but never to soar above its limits outside of which there is for us nothing but empty space no doubt the critical examination of all propositions which seemed to be able to enlarge our knowledge  0  beyond real experience as given in the transcendental analytic has fully convinced us that they could never lead to anything more than to a possible experience and if people were not suspicious even of the clearest but abstract and general doctrines and charming and specious prospects did not tempt us to throw off the restraint of those doctrines we might indeed have dispensed with the laborious examination of all the dialectical witnesses which a transcendent reason brings into court in support of her pretensions we knew beforehand with perfect certainty that all these pretensions though perhaps honestly meant were absolutely untenable because they relate to a kind of knowledge to which man can never attain but we know that there is no end of talk unless the true cause of the illusion by which even the wisest are deceived has been clearly exhibited we also know     that the analysis of all our transcendent knowledge into its elements as a study of our own internal nature has no little value in itself and to a philosopher is really a matter of duty we therefore thought that it was not only necessary to follow up the whole of this vain treatment of speculative reason to its first sources but considered it advisable also as the dialectical illusion does here not only deceive the judgment but owing to the interest which we take in the judgment possesses and always will possess a certain natural and irresistible  0  charm to write down the records of this lawsuit in full detail and to deposit them in the archives of human reason to prevent for the future all errors of a similar kind     ii method of transcendentalism  0          if we look upon the whole knowledge of pure  0  and speculative reason as an edifice of which we possess at least the idea within ourselves we may say that in the elements of transcendentalism we made an estimate of the materials and determined for what kind of edifice and of what height and solidity they would suffice we found that although we had thought of a tower that would reach to the sky the supply of materials would suffice for a dwellinghouse only sufficiently roomy for all our business on the level plain of experience and high enough to enable us to survey it and that the original bold undertaking could not but fail for want of materials not to mention the confusion of tongues which inevitably divided the labourers in their views of the building and scattered them over all the world where each tried to erect his own building according to his own plan at present however we are concerned not so much with the material as with the plan and though we have been warned not to venture blindly on a plan which may be beyond our powers we cannot altogether give up the erection of a solid dwelling but have to make the plan for a building in proportion to the material which we possess and sufficient for all our real wants this determination of the formal conditions of a complete system of pure reason i     call the method of transcendentalism we  0  shall here have to treat of a discipline a canon an architectonic and lastly a history of pure reason and shall have to do from a transcendental point of view what the schools attempt but fail to carry out properly with regard to the use of the understanding in general under the name of practical logic the reason of this failure is that general logic is not limited to any particular kind of knowledge belonging to the understanding not for instance to its pure knowledge nor to certain objects it cannot therefore without borrowing knowledge from other sciences do more than produce titles of possible methods and technical terms which are used in different sciences in reference to their systematical arrangement so that the pupil becomes acquainted with names only the meaning and application of which he has to learn afterwards     chapter i the discipline of pure reason negative judgments being negative not only in their logical form but in their contents also do not enjoy a very high reputation among persons desirous of increasing human knowledge they are even looked upon as jealous enemies of our neverceasing desire for  0  knowledge and we have almost to produce an apology in order to secure for them toleration or favour and esteem no doubt all propositions may logically be expressed as negative but when we come to the question whether the contents of our knowledge are enlarged or restricted by a judgment we find that the proper object of negative judgments is solely to prevent error hence negative propositions intended to prevent erroneous knowledge in cases where error is never possible may no doubt be very true but they are empty they do not answer any purpose and sound therefore often absurd like the wellknown utterance of a rhetorician that alexander could not have conquered any countries without an army but in cases where the limits of our possible knowledge are very narrow where the temptation to judge is great the illusion which presents itself very deceptive and the evil consequences of error very considerable the negative   0 element though it teaches us only how to avoid errors has even more value than much of that positive instruction which adds to the stock of our knowledge the restraint which checks our constant inclination to deviate from certain rules and at last destroys it is called discipline it is different from culture which is intended to form a certain kind of skill without destroying another kind which is already present in forming a talent therefore which has in itself an impulse to manifest itself   0 discipline will contribute a negative  culture and doctrine a positive influence that our temperament and various talents which like to indulge in free and unchecked exercise such as imagination and wit require some kind of discipline will easily be allowed by everybody but that reason whose proper duty it is to prescribe a discipline to all other endeavours should itself require such discipline may seem strange indeed it has in fact escaped that humiliation hitherto because considering the solemnity and thorough selfpossession in its behaviour no one has suspected it of thoughtlessly putting imaginations in the place of concepts and words in the place of things in its empirical use reason does not require such criticism because its principles are constantly subject to the test of experience nor is such criticism     required in mathematics where the concepts of reason     must at once be represented in concreto in pure intuition so that everything unfounded and arbitrary is at once discovered but when neither empirical nor pure intuition keeps reason in a straight groove that is when it is used transcendently and according to mere concepts the discipline to restrain its inclination to go beyond the narrow limits of possible experience and to keep it from extravagance and error is so necessary that the whole philosophy of pure reason is really concerned with that one negative discipline only single errors may be corrected by censure and their causes removed by criticism but when as in pure reason we are met by a whole system of illusions and fallacies well connected among themselves and united by common principles a separate negative code seems requisite which under the name of a discipline should erect a system of caution and selfexamination founded on the nature of reason and of the objects of its use before which no false sophistical illusion could stand but should at once betray itself in spite of all excuses it should be well borne in mind however     that in this second division of the transcendental critique i mean to direct the discipline of pure reason not to its contents but only to the method of its knowledge the former task has been performed in the elements of transcendentalism there is so much similarity in the use of reason whatever be the subject to which it is applied and yet so far as this use is to be transcendental it is so essentially different from every other that without the warning voice of a discipline especially devised for that purpose it would be impossible to avoid errors arising necessarily from the improper application of     methods which are suitable to reason in other spheres only not quite here section i the discipline of pure reason in its dogmatical use the science of mathematics presents the most brilliant example of how pure reason may successfully enlarge its domain without the aid of experience such examples are always contagious particularly when the faculty is the same which naturally flatters itself that it will meet with the same success in other cases which it has had in one thus pure reason hopes to be able to extend its domain as successfully and as thoroughly     in its transcendental as in its mathematical employment particularly if it there follows the same method which has proved of such decided advantage elsewhere it is therefore of great consequence for us to know whether the method of arriving at apodictic certainty which in the former science was called mathematical be identical with that which is to lead us to the same certainty in philosophy and would have to be called dogmatic philosophical knowledge is that which reason gains from concepts mathematical that which it gains from the construction of concepts by constructing a concept i mean representing a priori the intuition corresponding to it for the construction of a concept therefore a nonempirical intuition is required which as an intuition is a single object but which nevertheless as the construction of a     concept of a general representation must express in the representation something that is generally valid for all possible intuitions which fall under the same concept thus i construct a triangle by representing the object corresponding to that concept either by mere imagination in the pure intuition or afterwards on paper also in the empirical intuition and in both cases entirely a priori without having borrowed the original from any experience the particular figure drawn on the     paper is empirical but serves nevertheless to express the concept without any detriment to its generality because in that empirical intuition we consider always the act of the construction of the concept only to which many determinations as for instance the magnitude of the sides and the angles are quite indifferent these differences which do not change the concept of a triangle being entirely ignored philosophical knowledge therefore considers the particular in the general only mathematical the general in the particular nay even in the individual all this however a priori and by means of reason so that as an individual figure is determined by certain general conditions of construction the object of the concept of which this individual figure forms only the schema must be thought of as universally determined the essential difference between these two modes of the knowledge of reason consists therefore in the form and does not depend on any difference in their matter or objects those who thought they could distinguish philosophy from mathematics by saying that the former was concerned with quality only the latter with quantity only mistook effect for cause it is owing     to the form of mathematical knowledge that it can refer to quanta only because it is only the concept of quantities that admits of construction that is of a priori     representation in intuition while qualities cannot be represented in any but empirical intuition hence reason can gain a knowledge of qualities by concepts only no one can take an intuition corresponding to the concept of reality from anywhere except from experience we can never lay hold of it a priori by ourselves and before we have had an empirical consciousness of it we can form to ourselves an intuition of a cone from its concept alone and without any empirical assistance but the colour of this cone must be given before in some experience or other i cannot represent in intuition the concept of a cause in general in any way except by an example supplied by experience etc besides philosophy treats of quantities quite as much as mathematics for instance of totality infinity etc and mathematics treats also of the difference between lines and planes as spaces of different quality it treats further of the continuity of extension as one of its qualities but though in such cases both have a common object the manner in which reason treats it is totally different in philosophy and mathematics the former is concerned with general concepts only the other can do nothing with the pure concept but proceeds at once to intuition in which it looks upon the concept in concreto yet not in an     empirical intuition but in an intuition which it represents a priori that is which it has constructed and in which whatever follows from the general conditions of the construction must be valid in general of the object of the constructed concept also     let us give to a philosopher the concept of a triangle and let him find out in his own way what relation the sum of its angles bears to a right angle nothing is given him but the concept of a figure enclosed within three straight lines and with it the concept of as many angles now he may ponder on that concept as long as he likes he will never discover anything new in it he may analyse the concept of a straight line or of an angle or of the number three and render them more clear but he will never arrive at other qualities which are not contained in those concepts but now let the geometrician treat the same question he will begin at once with constructing a triangle as he knows that two right angles are equal to the sum of all the contiguous angles which proceed from one point in a straight line he produces one side of his triangle thus forming two adjacent angles which together are equal to two right angles he then divides the exterior of these angles by drawing a line parallel with the opposite side of the triangle and sees that an exterior adjacent angle has been formed which is equal to an interior etc in this way he arrives through a chain of conclusions though always guided by intuition at a thoroughly     convincing and general solution of the question in mathematics however we construct not only quantities quanta as in geometry but also mere quantity quantitas as in algebra where the quality of the object which has to be thought according to this quantitative concept is entirely ignored we then adopt a certain notation for all constructions of quantities numbers such as addition subtraction extraction of roots etc and after having denoted also the general concept of     quantities according to their different relations we represent in intuition according to general rules every operation which is produced and modified by quantity thus when one quantity is to be divided by another we place the signs of both together according to the form denoting division etc and we thus arrive by means of a symbolical construction in algebra quite as well as by an ostensive or geometrical construction of the objects themselves in geometry at results which our discursive knowledge could never have reached by the aid of mere conceptions what may be the cause of this difference between two persons the philosopher and the mathematician both practising the art of reason the former following his path according to concepts the latter according to intuitions which he represents a priori according to concepts if we remember what has been said     before in the elements of transcendentalism the cause is clear we are here concerned not with analytical propositions which can be produced by a mere analysis of concepts here the philosopher would no doubt have an advantage over the mathematician but with synthetical propositions and synthetical propositions that can be known a priori we are not intended here to consider what we are really thinking in our concept of the triangle this would be a mere definition but we are meant to go beyond that concept in order to arrive at properties which are not contained in the concept but nevertheless belong to it this is impossible except by our determining our object according to the conditions either of empirical or of pure intuition the former would give us an empirical proposition only through     the actual measuring of the three angles such a proposition would be without the character of either generality or necessity and does not therefore concern us here at all the second procedure consists in the mathematical and here the geometrical construction by means of which i add in a pure intuition just as i may do in the empirical intuition everything that belongs to the schema of a triangle in general and therefore to its concept and thus arrive at general synthetical propositions i should therefore in vain philosophise that is reflect discursively on the triangle without ever getting beyond the mere definition with which i ought to have begun there is no doubt a transcendental synthesis     consisting of mere concepts and in which the philosopher alone can hope to be successful such a synthesis however never relates to more than a thing in general and to the conditions under which its perception could be a possible experience in the mathematical problems on the contrary all this together with the question of existence does not concern us but the properties of objects in themselves only without any reference to their existence and those properties again so far only as they are connected with their concept we have tried by this example to show how great a difference there is between the discursive use of reason according to concepts and its intuitive use through the construction of concepts the question now arises what can be the cause that makes this twofold use of reason necessary and how can we discover whether in any given argument the former only or the latter use also takes place all our knowledge relates in the end to possible intuitions     for it is by them alone that an object can be given a concept a priori or a nonempirical concept contains either a pure intuition in which case it can be constructed or it contains nothing but the synthesis of possible intuitions which are not given a priori and in that case though we may use it for synthetical   0 and a priori judgments such judgments can only be discursive according to concepts and never intuitive through the construction of the concept there is no intuition a priori except space and time the mere forms of phenomena a concept of them as quanta can be represented a priori in intuition that is can be constructed either at the same time with their quality figure or as quantity only the mere synthesis of the manifoldhomogeneous by means of number the matter of phenomena however by which things are given us in space and time can be represented in perception only that is a posteriori the one concept which a priori represents the empirical contents of phenomena is the concept of a thing in general and the synthetical knowledge which we may have a priori of a thing in general can give us nothing but the mere rule of synthesis to be applied to what perception may present to us a posteriori but never an a priori intuition of a real object such an intuition being necessarily empirical synthetical propositions with regard to things in general the intuition of which does not admit of being given a priori are called transcendental transcendental propositions therefore can never be given through a construction of concepts but only according to concepts a priori they only contain the rule according to which we must look empirically for a certain synthetical unity     of what cannot be represented in intuition a     priori perceptions they can never represent any one of their concepts a priori but can do this only a posteriori that is by means of experience which itself becomes possible according to those synthetical principles only if we are to form a synthetical judgment of any concept we must proceed beyond that concept to the intuition in which it is given for if we kept within that which is given in the concept the judgment could only be analytical and an explanation of the concept in accordance with what we have conceived in it i may however pass from the conception to the pure or empirical intuition which corresponds to it in order thus to consider it in concreto and thus to discover what belongs to the object of the concept whether a priori or a posteriori the former consists in rational or mathematical knowledge arrived at by the construction of the concept the latter in the purely empirical mechanical knowledge which can never supply us with necessary and apodictic propositions thus i might analyse my empirical concept of gold without gaining anything beyond being able to enumerate everything that i can really think by this word this might yield a logical improvement of my knowledge but no increase or addition if however i take the material which is known by the name of gold i can make observations on it and these will yield me different synthetical but empirical     propositions again i might construct the mathematical concept of a triangle that is give it a priori in intuition and gain in this manner a synthetical but rational knowledge of it but when the transcendental concept   0 of a reality a substance a power etc is given me that concept denotes neither an empirical nor a pure intuition but merely the synthesis of empirical intuitions which being empirical cannot be given a priori no determining synthetical proposition therefore can spring from it because the synthesis cannot a priori pass beyond to the intuition that corresponds to it but only a principle of the synthesis  of possible empirical intuitions a transcendental proposition therefore is synthetical knowledge acquired by reason according to mere concepts and it is discursive because through it alone synthetical unity of empirical knowledge becomes possible while it cannot give us any intuition a priori we see therefore that reason is used in two     ways which though they share in common the generality of their knowledge and its production a priori yet diverge considerably afterwards because in each phenomenon and no object can be given us except as a phenomenon there are two elements the form of intuition space and time which can be known and determined entirely a priori and the matter the physical or the contents something which exists in space and time and therefore contains an existence corresponding to sensation as regards the latter which can never be given in a definite form except empirically we can have nothing a priori except indefinite concepts of the synthesis of possible     sensations in so far as they belong to the unity of apperception in a possible experience as regards the former we can determine a priori our concepts in intuition by creating to ourselves in space and time through a uniform synthesis the objects themselves considering them simply as quanta the former is called the use of reason according to concepts and here we can do nothing more than to bring phenomena under concepts according to their real contents which therefore can be determined empirically only that is a posteriori though in accordance with those concepts as rules of an empirical synthesis the latter is the use     of reason through the construction of concepts which as they refer to an intuition a priori can for that reason be given a priori and defined in pure intuition without any empirical data to consider everything which exists everything in space or time whether and how far it is a quantum or not to consider that we must represent in it either existence or absence of existence to consider how far this something which fills space or time is a primary substratum or merely determination of it to consider again whether its existence is related to something else as cause or effect or finally whether it stands isolated or in reciprocal dependence on others with reference to existence — this and the possibility reality and necessity of its existence or their opposites all belong to that knowledge of reason derived from concepts which is called philosophical but to determine a priori an intuition in space figure to divide time duration or merely to know the general character of the synthesis of one and the same thing in time and space and the quantity of an intuition in general which     arises from it number all this is the work of reason by means of the construction of concepts and is called mathematical the great success which attends reason in its mathematical use produces naturally the expectation that it or rather its method would have the same success outside the field of quantities also by reducing all concepts to intuitions which may be given a priori and by     which the whole of nature might be conquered while pure philosophy with its discursive concepts a priori does nothing but bungle in every part of nature without being able to render the reality of those concepts intuitive a priori and thereby legitimatised nor does there seem to be any lack of confidence on the part of those who are masters in the art of mathematics or of high expectations on the part of the public at large as to their ability of achieving success if only they would try it for as they have hardly ever philosophised on mathematics which is indeed no easy task they never think of the specific difference between the two uses of reason which we have just explained current and empirical rules borrowed from the ordinary operations of reason are then accepted instead of axioms from what quarter the concepts of space and time with which alone as the original quanta they have to deal may have come to them they do not care to enquire nor do they see any use in investigating the origin of the pure concepts of the understanding and with it the extent of their validity being satisfied to use them as they are in all this no blame would attach to them if only they did not overstep their proper limits namely those of nature but as it is they lose themselves without being aware of it away from the field of     sensibility on the uncertain ground of pure and even transcendental concepts instabilis tellus innabilis unda where they are neither able to stand nor to     swim taking only a few hasty steps the vestiges of which are soon swept away while their steps in mathematics become a highway on which the latest posterity may march on with perfect confidence we have chosen it as our duty to determine with accuracy and certainty the limits of pure reason in its transcendental use these transcendental efforts however have this peculiar character that in spite of the strongest and clearest warnings they continue to inspire us with new hopes before the attempt is entirely surrendered at arriving beyond the limits of experience at the charming fields of an intellectual world it is necessary therefore to cut away the last anchor of that fantastic hope and to show that the employment of the mathematical method cannot be of the slightest use for this kind of knowledge unless it be in displaying its own deficiencies and that the art of measuring and philosophy are two totally different things though they are mutually useful to each other in natural science and that the method of the one can never be imitated by the other the exactness of mathematics depends on definitions axioms and demonstrations i shall content myself with showing that none of these can be achieved or imitated by the philosopher in the sense in which they are understood by the mathematician i hope to show at the     same time that the art of measuring or geometry will by its method produce nothing in philosophy but cardhouses while the philosopher with his method produces in mathematics nothing but vain babble it is the very essence of     philosophy to teach the limits of knowledge and even the mathematician unless his talent is limited already by nature and restricted to its proper work cannot decline the warnings of philosophy or altogether defy them i of definitions to define as the very name implies means only to represent the complete concept of a thing within its limits and in its primary character  from this point of view an empirical concept cannot be defined but can be explained only for as we have in an empirical concept some predicates only belonging to a certain class of sensuous objects we are never certain whether by the word which denotes one and the same object we do not think at one time a greater at another a smaller number of predicates thus one man may by the     concept of gold think in addition to weight colour malleability the quality of its not rusting while another may know nothing of the last we use certain predicates so long only as they are required for distinction new observations add and remove certain predicates so that the concept never stands within safe limits and of what use would it be to define an empirical concept as for instance that of water because when we speak of water and its qualities we do not care much what is thought by that word but proceed at once to experiments the word itself with its few predicates being a designation only and not a concept so that a socalled definition would be no more     than a determination of the word secondly if we reasoned accurately no a priori given concept can be defined such as substance cause right equity etc for i can never be sure that the clear representation of a given but still confused concept has been completely analysed unless i know that such representation is adequate to the object as its concept however such as it is given may contain many obscure representations which we pass by in our analysis although we use them always in the practical application of the concept the completeness of the analysis of my concept must always remain doubtful and can only be rendered probable by means of apt examples although never apodictically certain i should     therefore prefer to use the term exposition rather than definition as being more modest and more likely to be admitted to a certain extent by a critic who reserves his doubts as to its completeness as therefore it is impossible to define either empirically or a priori given concepts there remain arbitrary concepts only on which such an experiment may be tried in such a case i can always define my concept because i ought certainly to know what i wish to think the concept being made intentionally by myself and not given to me either by the nature of the understanding or by experience but i can never say that i have thus defined a real object for if the concept depends on empirical conditions as for instance a ships chronometer the object itself and its possibility are not given by this arbitrary concept it does not even tell us whether there is an object corresponding to it so that my explanation should be called a declaration of my project rather than a definition of an object thus there remain no concepts fit for definition except those which contain     an arbitrary synthesis that can be constructed a priori it follows therefore that mathematics only can possess definitions because it is in mathematics alone that we represent a priori in intuition the object which we think and that object cannot therefore contain either more or less than the concept because the concept of   0 the object was given by the definition in its primary character that is without deriving the definition from anything else the german language has but the one word erklärung literally clearing up for the terms exposition explication declaration and definition and we must not therefore be too strict in our demands when denying to the different kinds of a philosophical clearing up the honourable name of definition what we really insist on is this that philosophical definitions are possible only as expositions of given concepts mathematical definitions as constructions of concepts originally framed by ourselves the former therefore analytically where completeness is never apodictically certain the latter synthetically mathematical definitions make the concept philosophical definitions explain it only hence it follows a that we must not try in philosophy to imitate mathematics by beginning with definitions except it be by way of experiment for as they are meant to be an analysis of given concepts these concepts themselves although as yet confused only must come first and the incomplete exposition must precede the complete one so that we are able from some characteristics known to us from an as yet incomplete analysis to infer many things before we come to a complete exposition that is the definition of the concept in philosophy in fact the definition     in its complete clearness ought to conclude rather     than begin our work  while in mathematics we really have no concept antecedent to the definition by which the concept itself is first given so that in mathematics no other beginning is necessary or possible b mathematical definitions can never be erroneous because as the concept is first given by the definition it contains neither more nor less than what the definition wishes should be conceived by it but although there can be nothing wrong in it so far as its contents are concerned mistakes may sometimes though rarely occur in the form or wording particularly with regard to perfect precision thus the common definition of a circle that it is a curved line every point of which is equally distant from one and the same point namely the centre is faulty     because the determination of curved is introduced unnecessarily for there must be a particular theorem derived from the definition and easily proved viz that every line all points of which are equidistant from one and the same point must be curved no part of it being straight analytical definitions however may be erroneous in many respects either by introducing characteristics which do not really exist in the concept or by lacking that completeness which is essential to a definition because     we can never be quite certain of the completeness of our analysis it is on these accounts that the method of mathematics cannot be imitated in the definitions of philosophy ii of axioms these so far as they are immediately certain are synthetical principles a priori one concept cannot however be connected synthetically and yet immediately with another because if we wish to go beyond a given concept a third connecting knowledge is required and as philosophy is the knowledge of reason based on concepts no principle can be found in it deserving the name of an axiom mathematics on the other hand may well possess axioms because here by means of the construction of concepts in the intuition of their object the predicates may always be connected a priori and immediately for instance that three points always lie in a plane a synthetical principle on the contrary made up of concepts only can never be immediately certain     as for example the proposition that everything which happens has its cause here i require something else namely the condition of the determination by time in a given experience it being impossible for me to know such a principle directly and immediately from the concepts discursive principles are therefore something quite different from intuitive principles or axioms the former always require in addition a deduction not at all required for the latter which on that very account are evident while philosophical principles whatever their certainty may be can never pretend to be so hence it is very far from true to say that any synthetical proposition of pure and transcendental reason is so evident as people sometimes emphatically maintain as the statement that twice     two are four it is true that in the analytic when giving the table of the principles of the pure understanding i mentioned also certain axioms of intuition but the principle there mentioned was itself no axiom but served only to indicate the principle of the possibility of axioms in general being itself no more than a principle based on concepts it was necessary in our transcendental philosophy to show the possibility even of mathematics philosophy therefore is without axioms and can never put forward its principles a priori with absolute authority but must first consent to justify its claims by a thorough deduction     iii of demonstrations an apodictic proof only so far as it is intuitive can be called demonstration experience may teach us what is but never that it cannot be otherwise empirical arguments therefore cannot produce an apodictic proof from concepts a priori however in discursive knowledge it is impossible that intuitive certainty that is evidence should ever arise however apodictically certain the judgment may otherwise seem to be demonstrations we get in mathematics only because here our knowledge is derived not from concepts but from their construction that is from intuition which can be given a priori in accordance with the concepts even the proceeding of algebra with its equations from which by reduction both the correct result and its proof are produced is a construction by characters though not geometrical in which by means of signs the concepts particularly those of the relation of quantities are represented in intuition and without any regard to the heuristic method all conclusions are secured against errors by submitting each of them to intuitive evidence philosophical   0 knowledge cannot claim this advantage for here we must always consider the general in the abstract by concepts while in mathematics we may consider the general in the concrete in each single intuition and yet through pure representation a priori where every mistake becomes at once manifest i should prefer     therefore to call the former acroamatic or audible discursive proofs because they can be carried out by words only the object in thought rather than demonstrations which as the very term implies depend on the intuition of the object it follows from all this that it is not in accordance with the very nature of philosophy to boast of its dogmatical character particularly in the field of pure reason and to deck itself with the titles and ribands of mathematics an order to which it can never belong though it may well hope for cooperation with that science all those attempts are vain pretensions which can never be successful nay which can only prove an obstacle in the discovery of the illusions of reason when ignoring its own limits and which must mar our success in calling back by means of a sufficient explanation of our concepts the conceit of speculation to the more modest and thorough work of selfknowledge reason ought not therefore in its transcendental endeavours to look forward with such confidence as if the path which it has traversed must lead straight to its goal nor depend with such assurance on its premisses as to consider it unnecessary to look back from time to time to find out whether in the progress of its conclusions errors may come to light which were overlooked in the principles and which render it necessary     either to determine those principles more accurately or to change them altogether     i divide all apodictic propositions whether demonstrable or immediately certain into dogmata and mathemata a directly synthetical proposition based on concepts is a dogma a proposition of the same kind arrived at by the construction of concepts is a mathema analytical judgments teach us really no more of an object than what the concept which we have of it contains in itself they cannot enlarge our knowledge beyond the concept but only clear it they cannot therefore be properly called dogmas a word which might perhaps best be translated by precepts lehrsprüche according to our ordinary mode of speech we could apply that name to that class only of the two abovementioned classes of synthetical propositions a priori which refers to philosophical knowledge and no one would feel inclined to give the name of dogma to the propositions of arithmetic or geometry in this way the usage of language confirms our explanation that those judgments only which are based on conceptions and not those which are arrived at by the construction of concepts can be called dogmatic now in the whole domain of pure reason in its purely speculative use there does not exist a single directly synthetical judgment based on concepts we have shown that reason by means of ideas is incapable of any synthetical judgments which could claim objective validity while by means of the concepts of our understanding it establishes no doubt some perfectly certain principles     but not directly from concepts but indirectly only by referring such concepts to something purely contingent namely possible experience when such experience anything as an object of possible experience is presupposed these principles are no doubt apodictically certain but     in themselves directly they cannot even be known a priori thus the proposition that everything which happens has its cause can never be thoroughly understood by means of the concepts alone which are contained in it hence it is no dogma in itself although from another point of view that is in the only field of its possible use namely in experience it may be proved apodictically it should be called therefore a principle and not a precept or a dogma though it is necessary that it should itself be proved because it has this peculiarity that it first renders its own proof namely experience possible and has always to be presupposed for the sake of experience if therefore there are no dogmata whatever in the speculative use of pure reason with regard to their contents also all dogmatical methods whether borrowed from mathematics or invented on purpose are alike inappropriate they only serve to hide mistakes and errors and thus deceive philosophy whose true object is to shed the clearest light on every step which reason takes the method may however well be systematical for our reason subjectively is itself a system though in its     pure use by means of mere concepts a system intended for investigation only according to principles of unity to which experience alone can supply the material we cannot however dwell here on the method of transcendental philosophy because all we have to do at present is to take stock in order to find out whether we are able to build at all and how high the edifice may be which we can erect with the materials at our command the pure concepts a priori     section ii the discipline of pure reason in its polemical use reason in all her undertakings must submit to criticism and cannot attempt to limit the free exercise of such criticism without injury to herself and without exposing herself to dangerous suspicion there is nothing so important with reference to its usefulness nothing so sacred that it could withdraw itself from that searching examination which has no respect of persons the very existence of reason depends on that freedom for reason can claim no dictatorial authority but its decrees are rather like the votes of free citizens every one of whom may freely express not only his doubts but even     his veto but though reason can never refuse to submit to criticism it does not follow that she need always be afraid of it while pure reason in her dogmatical not mathematical use is not so thoroughly conscious of having herself obeyed her own supreme laws as not to appear with a certain shyness nay without any of her assumed dogmatical authority before the tribunal of a higher judicial reason the case is totally different when reason has to deal not with the verdicts of a judge but with the claims of her fellowcitizens and has to defend itself only against these claims for as these mean to be as dogmatical in their negations as reason is in her affirmations reason may justify herself κατ ἄνθρωπον so as to be safe against     all damages and with a good title to her own property that need not fear any foreign claims although κατ ἀλήθειαν it could not itself be established with sufficient evidence by the polemical use of pure reason i mean the defence of her own propositions against dogmatical negations here the question is not whether her own assertions may not themselves be false but it is only to be shown that no one is ever able to prove the opposite with apodictic certainty nay even with a higher degree of plausibility for we are not on sufferance in our possession   0 when though our own title may not be sufficient it is nevertheless quite certain that no one can ever prove its insufficiency it is sad no doubt and discouraging that there should be an antithetic of pure reason and that reason being the highest tribunal for all conflicts should be in conflict with herself we had on a former occasion to treat of such an apparent antithetic but we saw that it arose from a misunderstanding phenomena according to the common prejudice being taken for things in themselves and an absolute completeness of their synthesis being demanded in one way or other being equally impossible in either way a demand entirely unreasonable with regard to phenomena there was therefore no real contradiction in reason herself when making the two propositions first that the series of phenomena given by themselves has an absolutely first beginning and secondly that the series is absolutely and by itself without any beginning for both propositions are perfectly consistent with each other because phenomena with regard to their existence as phenomena are by themselves nothing that is something     selfcontradictory so that their hypothesis must naturally lead to contradictory inferences     we cannot however appeal to a similar misunderstanding in order to remove the conflict of reason when it is said for instance on one side theistically that there is a supreme being and on the other atheistically that there is no supreme being or if in psychology it is maintained that everything which thinks possesses an absolute and permanent unity and is different therefore from all perishable material unity while others maintain that a soul is not an immaterial unity and not exempt therefore from perishableness for here the object of the question is free from anything heterogeneous or contradictory to its own nature and our understanding has to deal with things by themselves only and not with phenomena here therefore we should have a real conflict if only on the negative side pure reason could advance anything like the ground of an assertion we may well admit the criticism of the arguments advanced by those who dogmatically assert without therefore having to surrender these assertions which are supported at least by the interest of reason to which the opposite party cannot appeal i cannot share the opinion so frequently expressed by excellent and thoughtful men for instance sulzer who being fully conscious of the weakness of the proofs hitherto advanced indulge in a hope that the future would supply us with evident demonstrations of the two cardinal propositions of pure reason namely that there is a god and that there is a future life i am certain on the     contrary that this will never be the case for whence should reason take the grounds for such synthetical assertions which do not refer to objects of experience and     their internal possibility but there is the same apodictic certainty that no man will ever arise to assert the contrary with the smallest plausibility much less dogmatically for as he could prove it by means of pure reason only he would have to prove that a supreme being and that a thinking subject within us as pure intelligence is impossible but whence will he take the knowledge that would justify him in thus judging synthetically on things far beyond all possible experience we may therefore rest so completely assured that no one will ever really prove the opposite that there is no need to invent any scholastic arguments we may safely accept those propositions which agree so well with the speculative interests of our reason in its empirical use and are besides the only means of reconciling them with our practical interests as aganst our opponent who must not be considered here as a critic only we are always ready with our non liquet this must inevitably confound our adversary while we need not mind his retort because we can always fall back on the subjective maxim of reason     which our adversary cannot and can thus protected by it look upon all his vain attacks with calmness and indifference thus we see that there is really no antithetic of pure reason for the only arena for it would be the field of pure theology and psychology and on that field it is not able to support a champion in full armour and with weapons which we need be afraid of he can only use ridicule and boasting and these we may laugh at as mere childs play this ought to be a real comfort and inspire reason with new courage for what else could she depend on if she herself who is called upon to remove all errors were     divided against herself without any hope of peace and quiet possession whatever has been ordained by nature is good for some purpose or other even poisons serve to counteract other poisons which are in our own blood and they must not be absent therefore in a complete collection of medicines the objections against the vain persuasions and the conceit of our own purely speculative reason are inspired by the very nature of that reason and must therefore have their own good purpose which must not be lightly cast aside why has providence placed certain things which concern our highest interests so far beyond     our reach that we are only able to apprehend them very indistinctly and dubiously and our enquiring gaze is more excited than satisfied by them it is very doubtful whether it is useful to venture on any bold answers with regard to such obscure questions nay whether it may not be detrimental but one thing is quite certain namely that it is useful to grant to reason the fullest freedom both of enquiry and of criticism so that she may consult her own interest without let or hindrance and this is done quite as much by limiting her insight as by enlarging it while nothing but mischief must arise from any foreign interference or any attempt to direct reason against her own natural inclination towards objects forced upon her from without allow therefore your adversary to speak reason and combat him with weapons of reason only as to any practical interests you need not be afraid for in purely speculative discussions they are not involved at all what comes to light in these discussions is only a certain antinomy of reason which as it springs from the very nature     of reason must needs be listened to and examined rea son is thus improved only by a consideration of both sides of her subject her judgment is corrected by the very limitations imposed upon her what people may differ about is not the matter so much as the tone and manner of these discussions for though you have to surrender the language of knowledge it is perfectly open     to you to retain the language of the firmest faith which need not fear the severest test of reason if we could ask that dispassionate philosopher david hume who seemed made to maintain the most perfect equilibrium of judgment what induced him to undermine by carefully elaborated arguments the persuasion so useful and so full of comfort for mankind as that reason is sufficient to assert and to form a definite concept of a supreme being he would answer nothing but a wish to advance reason in selfknowledge and at the same time a certain feeling of indignation at the violence which people wish to inflict on reason by boasting of her powers and yet at the same time preventing her from openly confessing her weakness of which she has become conscious by her own selfexamination if on the contrary you were to ask priestley who was guided by the principles of the empirical use of reason only and opposed to all transcendental speculation what could have induced him to pull down two such pillars of religion as the freedom and immortality of our soul for the hope of a future life is with him an expectation only of the miracle of a resuscitation he who was himself so pious and zealous a teacher of religion could answer nothing but that he was concerned for reason which must suffer if certain subjects are withdrawn from the laws of material nature the only     laws which we can accurately know and fix it     would be most unjust to decry the latter who was able to combine his paradoxical assertions with the interests of religion and to inflict pain on a wellintentioned man simply because he could not find his way the moment he strayed away from the field of natural science and the same favour must be extended to the equally wellintentioned and in his moral character quite blameless hume who could not and would not leave his abstract speculations because he was rightly convinced that their object lies entirely outside the limits of natural science and within the sphere of pure ideas what then is to be done especially with regard to the danger which is believed to threaten the commonwealth from such speculations nothing is more natural nothing more fair than the decision which you have to come to let these people go if they show talent if they produce new and profound investigations in one word if they show reason reason can only gain if you have recourse to anything else but untrammelled reason if you raise the cry of high treason and call together the ignorant mob as it were to extinguish a conflagration — you simply render yourself ridiculous for here the question is not what may be useful or dangerous to the commonwealth but merely how far reason may advance in her speculations which are independent of all practical interests     in fact whether these speculations are to count for anything or are to be surrendered entirely for practical considerations instead of rushing in sword in hand it is far wiser to watch the struggle from the safe seat of the critic that struggle is very hard for the combatants themselves while to you it need not be anything but entertaining and as  00 the issue is sure to be without bloodshed it may become highly improving to your own intellect for it is extremely absurd to expect to be enlightened by reason and yet to prescribe to her beforehand on which side she must incline besides reason is naturally so subdued and checked by reason that you need not send out patrols in order to bring the civil law to bear on that party whose victory you fear in this dialectical war no victory is gained that need disturb your peace of mind reason really stands in need of such dialectical strife and it is much to be wished that it had taken place sooner and with the unlimited sanction of the public for in that case criticism would sooner have reached complete maturity and disputes would have come to an end by each party becoming aware of the illusions and prejudices which caused their differences there is in human nature a certain disingenuousness which however like everything that springs     from nature must contain a useful germ namely a tendency to conceal ones own true sentiments and to give expression to adopted opinions which are supposed to be good and creditable there is no doubt that this tendency to conceal oneself and to assume a favourable appearance has helped towards the progress of civilisation nay to a certain extent of morality because others who could not see through the varnish of respectability honesty and correctness were led to improve themselves by seeing everywhere these examples of goodness which they believed to be genuine this tendency however to show oneself better than one really is and to utter sentiments which one does not really share can only serve provisionally to rescue men from a rude state and to teach  0  them to assume at least the appearance of what they know to be good afterwards when genuine principles have once been developed and become part of our nature that disingenuousness must be gradually conquered because it will otherwise deprave the heart and not allow the good seeds of honest conviction to grow up among the tares of fair appearances i am sorry to observe the same disingenuousness concealment and hypocrisy even in the utterances of speculative thought though there are here fewer hindrances in uttering our convictions openly and freely as we ought and no advantage whatever in our not doing     so for what can be more mischievous to the advancement of knowledge than to communicate even our thoughts in a falsified form to conceal doubts which we feel in our own assertions and to impart an appearance of conclusiveness to arguments which we know ourselves to be inconclusive so long as those tricks arise from personal vanity only which is commonly the case with speculative arguments as touching no particular interests nor easily capable of apodictic certainty they are mostly counteracted by the vanity of others with the full approval of the public at large and thus the result is generally the same as what would or might have been obtained sooner by means of pure ingenuousness and honesty but where the public has once persuaded itself that certain subtle speculators aim at nothing less than to shake the very foundations of the common welfare of the people it is supposed to be not only prudent but even advisable and honourable to come to the succour of what is called the good cause by sophistries rather than to allow to our supposed antagonists the satisfaction of having lowered  0  our tone to that of a purely practical conviction and having forced us to confess the absence of all speculative and apodictic certainty i cannot believe this nor can i admit that the intention of serving a good cause can ever be combined with trickery misrepresentation and fraud that in weighing the arguments of a speculative discussion we ought to be honest seems the least that   0 can be demanded and if we could at least depend on this with perfect certainty the conflict of speculative reason with regard to the important questions of god the immortality of the soul and freedom would long ago have been decided or would soon be brought to a conclusion thus it often happens that the purity of motives and sentiments stands in an inverse ratio to the goodness of the cause and that its supposed assailants are more honest and more straightforward than its defenders supposing that i am addressing readers who never wish to see a just cause defended by unjust means i may say that according to our principles of criticism and looking not at what commonly happens but at what in all common fairness ought to happen there ought to be no polemical use of reason at all for how can two persons dispute on a subject the reality of which neither of them can present either in real or even in possible experience while they brood on the mere idea of it with the sole intention of eliciting something more than the idea namely the reality of the object itself how can they ever arrive at the end of their dispute as neither of them can make his view comprehensible and certain or do more than attack and refute the view of his opponent for this is the fate of all assertions of pure reason they go beyond the conditions of all possible experience where no proof      0  of truth is to be found anywhere but they have to follow nevertheless the laws of the understanding which are intended for empirical use only but without which no step can be made in synthetical thought thus it happens that each side lays open its own weaknesses and each can avail itself of the weaknesses of the other the critique of pure reason may really be looked upon as the true tribunal for all disputes of reason for it is not concerned in these disputes which refer to objects immediately but is intended to fix and to determine the rights of reason in general according to the principles of its original institution without such a critique reason may be said to be in a state of nature and unable to establish and defend its assertions and claims except by war the critique of pure reason on the contrary which bases all its decisions on the indisputable principles of its own original institution secures to us the peace of a legal status in which disputes are not to be carried on except in the proper form of a lawsuit in the former state such disputes generally end in both parties claiming victory which is followed by an uncertain peace maintained chiefly by the civil power while in the latter state a sentence is pronounced which     as it goes to the very root of the dispute must secure an eternal peace these neverceasing disputes of a purely dogmatical reason compel people at last to seek for rest and peace in some criticism of reason itself and in some sort of legislation founded upon such criticism thus hobbes maintains that the state of nature is a state of injustice and violence and that we must needs leave it and submit ourselves to the constraint of law which alone limits our freedom in such a way that it may consist with the freedom of others and with the common good  0  it is part of that freedom that we should be allowed openly to state our thoughts and our doubts which we cannot solve ourselves without running the risk of being decried on that account as turbulent and dangerous citizens this follows from the inherent rights of reason which recognises no other judge but universal human reason itself here everybody has a vote and as all improvements of which our state is capable must spring from thence such rights are sacred and must never be minished nay it would really be foolish to proclaim certain bold assertions or reckless attacks upon assertions which enjoy the approval of the largest and best portion of the commonwealth as dangerous for that would be to impart to them an importance which they do not possess     whenever i hear that some uncommon genius has demonstrated away the freedom of the human will the hope of a future life or the existence of god i am always desirous to read his book for i expect that his talent will help me to improve my own insight into these problems of one thing i feel quite certain even without having seen his book that he has not disproved any single one of these doctrines not because i imagine that i am myself in possession of irrefragable proofs of them but because the transcendental critique by revealing to me the whole apparatus of our pure reason has completely convinced me that as reason is insufficient to establish affirmative propositions in this sphere of thought it is equally nay even more powerless to establish the negative on any of these points for where is this socalled freethinker to take the knowledge that for instance there exists no supreme being this proposition lies outside the field of possible experience and therefore outside the limits of  0  all human cognition the dogmatical defender of the good cause i should not read at all because i know beforehand that he will attack the sophistries of the other party simply in order to recommend his own besides a mere defence of the common opinion does not supply so much material for new remarks as a strange and ingeniously contrived theory the opponent of religion himself dogmatical in his own way would give me a     valuable opportunity for amending here and there the principles of my own critique of pure reason while i should not be at all afraid of any danger arising from his theories but it may be argued that the youth at least entrusted to our academical teaching should be warned against such writings and kept away from a too early knowledge of such dangerous propositions before their faculty of judgment or we should rather say before the doctrines which we wish to inculcate on them have taken root and are able to withstand all persuasion and pressure from whatever quarter it may proceed yes if the cause of pure reason is always to be pleaded dogmatically and if opponents are to be disposed of polemically ie simply by taking up arms against them and attacking them by means of proofs of opposite opinions nothing might seem for the moment more advisable but nothing would prove in the long run more vain and inefficient than to keep the reason of youth in temporary tutelage and to guard it against temptation for a time at least if however curiosity or the fashion of the age should afterwards make them acquainted with such writings will their youthful persuasion then hold good he who is furnished with dogmatical weapons only in order to  0  resist the attacks of his opponent and is not able to analyse that hidden dialectic which is concealed in his own breast quite as much as in that of his opponent sees sophistries which at all events have the charm of     novelty opposed to other sophistries which possess that charm no longer and excite the suspicion of having imposed on the natural credulity of youth he sees no better way of showing that he is no longer a child than by ignoring all wellmeant warnings and accustomed as he is to dogmatism he swallows the poison which destroys his principles by a new dogmatism the very opposite of this is the right course for academical instruction provided always that it is founded on a thorough training in the principles of the criticism of pure reason for in order to practically apply these principles as soon as possible and to show their sufficiency even when faced by the strongest dialectical illusion it is absolutely necessary to allow the attacks which seem so formidable to the dogmatist to be directed against the young mind whose reason though weak as yet has been enlightened by criticism so as to let him test by its principles the groundless assertions of his opponents one after the other he cannot find it very difficult to dissolve them all into mere vapour and thus alone does he early begin to feel his own power and is able to secure himself against all dangerous illusions which in the end lose all their fascination on him it is true the same blows which destroy the stronghold     of his opponent must prove fatal also to his own speculative structures if he should wish to erect such but this need not disturb him because he does not wish to shelter himself beneath them but looks out for the  0  fair field of practical philosophy where he may hope to find firmer ground for erecting his own rational and beneficial system there is therefore no room for real polemic in the sphere of pure reason both parties beat the air and fight with their own shadows because they go beyond the limits of nature where there is nothing that they could lay hold of with their dogmatical grasp they may fight to their hearts content the shadows which they are cleaving grow together again in one moment like the heroes in valhalla in order to disport themselves once more in these bloodless contests nor can we admit a sceptical use of pure reason which might be called the principle of neutrality in all its disputes surely to stir up reason against itself to supply it with weapons on both sides and then to look on quietly and scoffingly while the fierce battle is raging does not look well from a dogmatical point of view but has the appearance of a mischievous and malevolent disposition if however we consider the invincible     obstinacy and the boasting of the dogmatical sophists who are deaf to all the warnings of criticism there really seems nothing left but to meet the boasting on one side by an equally justified boasting on the other in order at least to startle reason by a display of opposition and thus to shake her confidence and make her willing to listen to the voice of criticism but to stop at this point and to look upon the conviction and confession of ignorance not only as a remedy against dogmatical conceit but as the best means of settling the conflict of reason with herself is a vain attempt that will never give rest and peace to reason the utmost  0  it can do is to rouse reason from her sweet dogmatical dreams and to induce her to examine more carefully her own position as however the sceptical manner of avoiding a troublesome business seems to be the shortest way out of all difficulties and promises to lead to a permanent peace in philosophy or is chosen at least as the highroad by all who under the pretence of a scornful dislike of all investigations of this kind try to give themselves the air of philosophers it seems necessary to exhibit this mode of thought in its true light the impossibility of a sceptical satisfaction of pure reason in conflict with itself     the consciousness of my ignorance unless we recognise at the same time its necessity ought instead of forming the end of my investigations to serve on the contrary as their strongest impulse all ignorance is either an ignorance of things or an ignorance of the limits of our cognition if ignorance is accidental it should incite us in the former case to investigate things dogmatically in the latter to investigate the limits of possible knowledge critically that my ignorance is absolutely necessary and that i am absolved from the duty of all further investigation can never be established empirically by mere observation but critically only by a thorough examination of the first sources of our knowledge the determination of the true limits of our reason therefore can be made on a priori grounds only while its limitation which consists in a general recognition of our never entirely removable ignorance may be realised a posteriori also by seeing how much remains to be known in spite of  0  all that can be known the former knowledge of our ignorance possible only by criticism of reason is truly scientific the latter is merely matter of experience     where it is never possible to say how far the inferences drawn from it may reach if i regard the earth according to the evidence of my senses as a flat surface i cannot tell how far it may extend but what experience teaches me is that wheresoever i go i always see before me a space in which i can proceed further thus i am conscious of the limits of my actual knowledge of the earth at any given moment but not of the limits of all possible geography but if i have got so far as to know that the earth is a sphere and its surface spherical i am able from any small portion of it for instance from a degree to know definitely and according to principles a priori the diameter and through it the complete periphery of the earth and though i am ignorant with regard to the objects which are contained in that surface i am not so with regard to its extent its magnitude and its limits in a similar manner the whole of the objects of our knowledge appears to us like a level surface with its apparent horizon which encircles its whole extent and was called by us the idea of unconditioned totality to reach this limit empirically is impossible and all attempts have proved vain to determine it a priori according to a certain principle nevertheless all questions of pure reason refer to what lies outside of that horizon or it may be on its boundary line   0 the celebrated david hume was one of those geographers of human reason who supposed that all those questions were sufficiently disposed of by being relegated   0 outside that horizon which however he was not able to determine he was chiefly occupied with the principle of causality and remarked quite rightly that the truth of this principle and even the objective validity of the concept of an efficient cause in general was based on no knowledge ie on no cognition a priori and that its authority rested by no means on the necessity of such a law but merely on its general usefulness in experience and on a kind of subjective necessity arising from thence which he called habit from the inability of reason to employ this principle beyond the limits of experience he inferred the nullity of all the pretensions of reason in her attempts to pass beyond what is empirical this procedure of subjecting the facts of reason to examination and if necessary to blame may be termed the censorship of reason there can be no doubt that such a censorship must inevitably lead to doubts     against all the transcendental employment of such principles but this is only the second and by no means the last step in our enquiry the first step in matters of pure reason which marks its infancy is dogmatism the second which we have just described is scepticism and marks the stage of caution on the part of reason when rendered wiser by experience but a third step is necessary that of the maturity and manhood of judgment based on firm and universally applicable maxims when not the facts of reason but reason itself in its whole power and fitness for pure knowledge a priori comes to be examined this is not the censura merely but the true criticism of reason by which not the barrier only but the fixed frontiers of reason not ignorance only on this or that point but ignorance with reference to all possible questions of     a certain kind must be proved from principles instead of being merely guessed at thus scepticism is a restingplace of reason where it may reflect for a time on its dogmatical wanderings and gain a survey of the region where it happens to be in order to choose its way with greater certainty for the future but it can never be its permanent dwellingplace that can only be found in perfect certainty whether of our knowledge of the objects themselves or of the limits within which all our knowledge of objects is enclosed     our reason is not to be considered as an indefinitely extended plain the limits of which are known in a general way only but ought rather to be compared to a sphere the radius of which may be determined from the curvature of the arc of its surface corresponding to the nature of synthetical propositions a priori which enables us likewise to fix the extent and periphery of it with perfect certainty outside that sphere the field of experience nothing can become an object to our reason nay questions even on such imaginary objects relate to the subjective principles only for a complete determination of all the relations which may exist between the concepts of the understanding within that sphere it is a fact that we are in possession of different kinds of synthetical knowledge a priori as shown by the principles of the understanding which anticipate experience if anybody finds it quite impossible to understand the possibility of such principles he may at first have some doubts as to whether they really dwell within us a priori but he cannot thus by the mere powers of the understanding prove their impossibility and declare all the steps which reason takes under their     guidance as null and void all he can say is that if we could understand their origin and genuineness we should be able to determine the extent and limits of our reason and that until that is done all the     assertions of reason are made at random and in this way a complete scepticism with regard to all dogmatical philosophy which is not guided by a criticism of reason is well grounded though we could not therefore deny to reason such further advance after the way has once been prepared and secured on firmer ground for all these concepts nay all the questions which pure reason places before us have their origin not in experience but in reason itself and must therefore be capable of being solved and tested as to their validity or invalidity nor are we justified while pretending that the solution of these problems is really to be found in the nature of things to decline their consideration and further investigation under the pretext of our weakness for reason alone begets all these ideas by itself and is bound therefore to give an account of their validity or their dialectical vanity all sceptical polemic should properly be directed against the dogmatist only who without any misgivings about his own fundamental objective principles that is without criticism continues his course with undisturbed gravity and should be intended only to unsettle his brief and to bring him thus to a proper selfknowledge with regard to what we know or what we cannot know that polemic is of no consequence whatever all the unsuccessful dogmatical attempts of reason are facta and it is always     useful to submit them to the censura of the sceptic but this can decide nothing as to the expectations of reason in her hopes and claims of a better success in future attempts     and no mere censura can put an end to the disputes regarding the rights of human reason hume is perhaps the most ingenious of all sceptics and without doubt the most important with regard to the influence which the sceptical method may exercise in awakening reason to a thorough examination of its rights it will therefore be worth our while to make clear to ourselves the course of his reasoning and the errors of an intelligent and estimable man who at the outset of his enquiries was certainly on the right track of truth hume was probably aware though he never made it quite clear to himself that in judgments of a certain kind we pass beyond our concept of the object i have called this class of judgments synthetical there is no difficulty as to how i may by means of experience pass beyond the concept which i have hitherto had experience is itself such a synthesis of perceptions through which a concept which i have by means of one perception is increased by means of other perceptions but we imagine that we are able also a priori to pass beyond our concept     and thus to enlarge our knowledge this we attempt to do either by the pure understanding in relation to that which can at least be an object of experience or even by means of pure reason in relation to such qualities of things or even the existence of such things as can never occur in experience hume in his scepticism did not distinguish between these two kinds of judgments as he ought to have done but regarded this augmentation of concepts by themselves and so to say the spontaneous generation of our understanding and of our reason without being impregnated by experience as perfectly impossible considering     all principles a priori as imaginary he arrived at the conclusion that they were nothing but a habit arising from experience and its laws that they were therefore merely empirical that is in themselves contingent rules to which we wrongly ascribe necessity and universality in order to establish this strange proposition he appealed to the generally admitted principle of the relation between cause and effect for as no faculty of the understanding could lead us from the concept of a thing to the existence of something else that should follow from it universally and necessarily he thought himself justified in concluding that without experience we have nothing that could augment our concept and give us a right to form a judgment that extends itself a priori that the light of the sun which shines on the wax should melt the wax and at the same time harden the clay no understanding     he maintained could guess from the concepts which we had before of these things much less infer according to a law experience only being able to teach us such a law we have seen on the contrary in the transcendental logic that though we can never pass immediately beyond the content of a concept that is given us we are nevertheless able entirely a priori but yet in reference to something else namely possible experience to know the law of its connection with other things if therefore wax which was formerly hard melts i can know a priori that something else must have preceded for instance the heat of the sun upon which this melting has followed according to a permanent law although without experience i could never know a priori definitely either from the effect the cause or from the cause the effect hume was therefore wrong in inferring from the mere contingency of our     being determined according to the law of causality the contingency of that law itself and he mistook our passing beyond the concept of a thing to some possible experience which is entirely a priori and constitutes the objective reality of it for the synthesis of the objects of real experience which no doubt is always empirical he thus changed a principle of affinity which resides in the understanding and predicates necessary connection into a rule of association residing in the imitative faculty of imagination which can only represent contingent but     never objective connections the sceptical errors of that otherwise singularly acute thinker arose chiefly from a defect which he shared however in common with all dogmatists namely of not having surveyed systematically all kinds of synthesis a priori of the understanding for in doing this he would without mentioning others have discovered for instance the principle of permanency as one which like causality anticipates experience he would thus have been able also to fix definite limits to the understanding in its attempts at expansion a priori and to pure reason he only narrows the sphere of our understanding without definitely limiting it and produces a general mistrust but no definite knowledge of that ignorance which to us is inevitable he only subjects certain principles of the understanding to his censura but does not place the understanding with reference to all its faculties on the balance of criticism he is not satisfied with denying to the understanding what in reality it does not possess but goes on to deny to it all power of expanding a priori though he has never really tested all its powers for this reason what always defeats scepticism has happened to hume also namely     that he himself becomes subject to scepticism because his objections rest on facts only which are contingent and not on principles which alone can force a surrender of the right of dogmatical assertion     as besides this he does not sufficiently distinguish between the wellgrounded claims of the understanding and the dialectical pretensions of reason against which however his attacks are chiefly directed it so happens that reason the peculiar tendency of which has not in the least been destroyed but only checked does not at all consider itself shut out from its attempts at expansion and can never be entirely turned away from them although it may be punished now and then mere attacks only provoke counter attacks and make us more obstinate in enforcing our own views but a complete survey of all that is really our own and the conviction of a certain though a small possession make us perceive the vanity of higher claims and induce us after surrendering all disputes to live contentedly and peacefully within our own limited but undisputed domain these sceptical attacks are not only dangerous but even destructive to the uncritical dogmatist who has not measured the sphere of his understanding and has not therefore determined according to principles the limits of his own possible knowledge and does not know beforehand how much he is really able to achieve but thinks that he is able to find all this out by a purely tentative method for if he has been found out in one single assertion of his which he cannot justify or the fallacy of which he cannot evolve according to principles     suspicion falls on all his assertions however plausible they may appear     and thus the sceptic is the true schoolmaster to lead the dogmatic speculator towards a sound criticism of the understanding and of reason when he has once been brought there he need fear no further attacks for he has learnt to distinguish his own possession from that which lies completely beyond it and on which he can lay no claim nor become involved in any disputes regarding it thus the sceptical method though it cannot in itself satisfy with regard to the problems of reason is nevertheless an excellent preparation in order to awaken its circumspection and to indicate the true means whereby the legitimate possessions of reason may be secured against all attacks section iii the discipline of pure reason with regard to hypotheses as then the criticism of our reason has at last taught us so much at least that with its pure and speculative use we can arrive at no knowledge at all would not this seem to open a wide field for hypotheses as where we cannot assert with certainty we are at all events at liberty to form guesses and opinions if the faculty of imagination is not simply to   0 indulge in dreams but to invent and compose under the strict surveillance of reason it is necessary that there should always be something perfectly certain and not only invented or resting on opinion and that is the possibility of the object itself if that is once given it is     then allowable so far as its reality is concerned to have recourse to opinion which opinion however if it is not to be utterly groundless must be brought in connection with what is really given and therefore certain as its ground of explanation in that case and in that case only can we speak of an hypothesis as we cannot form the least conception of the possibility of a dynamical connection a priori and as the categories of the pure understanding are not intended to invent any such connection but only when it is given in experience to understand it we cannot by means of these categories invent one single object as endowed with a new quality not found in experience or base any permissible hypothesis on such a quality otherwise we should be supplying our reason with empty chimeras and not with concepts of things thus it is not permissible to invent any new and original powers as for instance an understanding capable of perceiving objects without the aid of the senses or a force of attraction without any contact a new kind of substances that should exist for instance in space without being impenetrable and consequently also any connection of substances different from that which is supplied by experience     no presence except in space no duration except in time in one word our reason can only use the conditions of possible experience as the conditions of the possibility of things it cannot invent them independently because such concepts although not selfcontradictory would always be without an object the concepts of reason as was said before are mere ideas and it is true that they have no object corresponding to them in experience but they do not for all that     refer to purely imaginary objects which are supposed to be possible they are purely problematical in order to supply as heuristic fictions regulative principles for the systematical employment of the understanding in the sphere of experience if they are not that they would become mere fictions the possibility of which is quite indemonstrable and which therefore can never be employed as hypotheses for the explanation of real phenomena it is quite permissible to represent the soul to ourselves as simple in order according to this idea to use the complete and necessary unity of all the faculties of the soul although we cannot understand it in concreto as the principle of all our enquiries into its internal phenomena but to assume the soul as a simple substance which is a transcendent concept would be a proposition not only indemonstrable this is the case with several physical hypotheses but purely     arbitrary and rash because the simple can never occur in any experience and if by substance we understand the permanent object of sensuous intuition the very possibility of a simple phenomenon is perfectly inconceivable reason has no right whatever to assume as an opinion purely intelligible beings or purely intelligible qualities of the objects of the senses although on the other side as we have no concepts whatever either of their possibility or impossibility we cannot claim any truer insight enabling us to deny dogmatically their possibility in order to explain given phenomena no other things or reasons can be adduced but those which according to the already known laws of phenomena have been put in connection with them a transcendental hypothesis adducing   0 a mere idea of reason for the explanation of natural things would therefore be no explanation at all because it would really be an attempt at explaining what according to known empirical principles we do not understand sufficiently by something which we do not understand at all nor would the principle of such an hypothesis serve to help the understanding with regard to its objects but only to satisfy our reason order and design in nature must themselves be explained on natural grounds and according to natural laws and for this     purpose even the wildest hypotheses if only they are physical are more tolerable than a hyperphysical one — that is the appeal to the divine author who is called in for that very purpose this would be a principle of ratio ignava to pass by all causes the objective reality of which in their possibility at least may be known by continued experience in order to rest on a mere idea which no doubt is very agreeable to our reason with regard to the absolute totality of the ground of explanation in the series of causes there can be no difficulty considering that all mundane objects are nothing but phenomena in which we can never hope to find absolute completeness in the synthesis of the series of conditions it is impossible to allow transcendental hypotheses in the speculative use of reason or the use of hyperphysical instead of physical explanations partly because reason is not in the least advanced in that way but on the contrary cut off from its own proper employment partly because such a licence would in the end deprive reason of all the fruits that spring from the cultivation of its own proper soil namely experience it is true no doubt that     whenever the explanation of nature seems difficult to us we should thus always have a transcendent explanation ready to hand which relieves us of all investigation but in that case we are led in the end not to an     understanding but to a complete incomprehensibility of the principle which from the very beginning was so designed that it must contain the concept of something which is the absolutely first what is secondly required in order to render an hypothesis acceptable is its adequacy for determining a priori by means of it all the consequences that are given if for that purpose we have to call in the aid of supplementary hypotheses they rouse the suspicion of a mere fiction because each of them requires for itself the same justification as the fundamental idea and cannot serve therefore as a sufficient witness no doubt if we once admit an absolutely perfect cause there is no difficulty in accounting for all the order magnitude and design which are seen in the world but if we consider what seem to us at least deviations and evils in nature new hypotheses will be required in order to save the first hypothesis from the objections which it has to encounter in the same manner whenever the simple independence of the human soul which has been admitted in order to account for all its phenomena is called into question on account of the difficulties arising from phenomena similar to the changes of matter growth and decay new hypotheses have to be called in which may seem plausible but possess no authority except what they derive from the opinion     which was to yield the chief explanation and which they themselves were called upon to defend if the two hypotheses which we have just mentioned     as examples of the assertions of reason the incorporeal unity of the soul and the existence of a supreme being are to be accepted not as hypotheses but as dogmas proved a priori we have nothing to say to them great care however should be taken in that case that they should be proved with the apodictic certainty of a demonstration it would be as absurd to try to make the reality of such ideas plausible only as to try to make a geometrical proposition plausible reason independent of all experience knows everything either a priori and as necessary or not at all its judgment therefore is never opinion but either an abstaining from all judgments or apodictic certainty opinions and guesses as to what belongs to things can be admitted in explanation only of what is really given or as resulting according to empirical laws from something that is really given they belong therefore to the series of the objects of experience only outside that field to opine is the same as to play with thoughts unless we suppose that even a doubtful and uncertain way of judging might lead us perhaps on to the truth but although when dealing with the purely     speculative questions of pure reason no hypotheses are admissible in order to found on them any propositions they are perfectly admissible in order if possible to defend them that is to say they may be used for polemical but not for dogmatical purposes nor do i understand by defending the strengthening of the proofs in support of our assertions but only the refutation of the dialectical arguments of the opponent which are intended to invalidate our assertions all synthetical propositions of pure reason have this peculiarity that although the philosopher     who maintains the reality of certain ideas never possesses sufficient knowledge in order to render his own propositions certain his opponent is equally unable to prove the opposite it is true no doubt that this equality of fortune which is peculiar to human reason favours neither of the two parties with regard to their speculative knowledge and hence the neverending feuds in this arena but we shall see nevertheless that in relation to its practical employment reason has the right of admitting what in the sphere of pure speculation it would not be allowed to admit without sufficient proof such admissions no doubt detract from the perfection of speculation but practical interests take no account of this here therefore reason is in possession without having to prove the legitimacy of its title which indeed it would be     difficult to do the burden of proof rests therefore on the opponent and as he knows as little of the point in question to enable him to prove its nonexistence as the other who maintains its reality it is evident that there is an advantage on the side of him who maintains something as a practically necessary supposition melior est conditio possidentis he is clearly entitled as it were in selfdefence to use the same weapons in support of his own good cause which the opponent uses against it that is to employ hypotheses which are not intended to strengthen the arguments in favour of his own view but only to show that the opponent knows far too little of the subject under discussion to flatter himself that he possesses any advantage over us so far as speculative insight is concerned in the field of pure reason therefore hypotheses are admitted as weapons of defence only not in order to establish a right but simply in order to defend it and it     is our duty at all times to look for a real opponent within ourselves speculative reason in its transcendental employment is by its very nature dialectical the objections which we have to fear lie in ourselves we must look for them as we look for old but never superannuated claims if we wish to destroy them and thus to establish a permanent peace external tranquillity is a mere illusion it is necessary to root up the very germ of these objections which lies in the nature of human reason and how can we root it up unless we allow it freedom nay     offer it nourishment so that it may send out shoots and thus discover itself to our eyes so that we may afterwards destroy it with its very root try yourselves therefore to discover objections of which no opponent has ever thought nay lend him your weapons and grant him the most favourable position which he could wish for you have nothing to fear in all this but much to hope for namely that you may gain a possession which no one will ever again venture to contest in order to be completely equipped you require the hypotheses of pure reason also which although but leaden weapons because not steeled by any law of experience are yet quite as strong as those which any opponent is likely to use against you if therefore for any not speculative reason you have admitted the immaterial nature of the soul which is not subject to any corporeal changes and you are met by the difficulty that nevertheless experience seems to prove both the elevation and the decay of our mental faculties as different modifications of our organs you can weaken the force of this objection by saying that you look upon the body as a fundamental phenomenon only which in our present state in this life forms the     condition of all the faculties of our sensibility and hence of our thought in that case the separation from the body would be the end of the sensuous employment and the beginning of the intelligible employment of our faculty of knowledge the body would thus have to be     considered not as the cause of our thinking but only as a restrictive condition of it and therefore if on one side as a support of our sensuous and animal life on the other all the more as an impediment of our pure and spiritual life so that the dependence of the animal life on the constitution of the body would in no wise prove the dependence of our whole life on the state of our organs you may go even further and discover new doubts which have either not been raised at all before or at all events have not been carried far enough generation in the human race as well as among irrational creatures depends on so many accidents on occasion on sufficient sustenance on the views and whims of government nay even on vice that it is difficult to believe in the eternal existence of a being whose life has first begun under circumstances so trivial and so entirely dependent on our own choice as regards the continuance here on earth of the whole race there is less difficulty because the accidents in individual cases are subject nevertheless to a rule with regard to the whole with regard to each individual however to expect so important an effect from such insignificant causes seems very strange but even against this you may adduce the following transcendental hypothesis namely that all life is really intelligible only not subject to the changes of time and neither   0 beginning in birth nor ending in death you may say that this life is phenomenal only that is a sensuous representation     of the pure spiritual life and that the whole world of sense is but an image passing before our present mode of knowledge but like a dream without any objective reality in itself nay that if we could see ourselves and other objects also as they really are we should see ourselves in a world of spiritual natures our community with which did neither begin at our birth nor will end with the death of the body both being purely phenomenal although it is true that we do not know anything about what we have here been pleading hypothetically against our opponents and that we ourselves do not even seriously maintain it it being simply an idea invented for selfdefence and not even an idea of reason yet we are acting throughout quite rationally in answer to our opponent who imagines that he has exhausted all possibilities and who wrongly represents the absence of empirical conditions as a proof of the total impossibility of our own belief we are simply showing him that he can no more by mere laws of experience comprehend the whole field of possible things by themselves than we are able outside of experience to establish anything for our reason on a really secure foundation because we bring forward such hypothetical defences against the pretensions of our boldly denying opponent we must not be supposed to have     adopted these opinions as our own we abandon them so soon as we have disposed of the dogmatical conceit of our opponent it seems no doubt very modest and moderate to maintain a simple negative position with regard to the assertions of other people but to attempt to represent objections as proofs of the opposite opinion is quite as arrogant as to assume the position of the affirming party and its opinions     it is easy to see therefore that in the speculative employment of reason hypotheses are of no value by themselves but relatively only as opposed to the transcendental pretensions of the opposite party for to extend the principles of possible experience to the possibility of things in general is quite as transcendent as to ascribe objective reality to concepts which cannot have an object except outside the limits of all possible experience the assertory judgments of pure reason must like everything known by reason be either necessary or nothing at all reason in fact knows of no opinions the hypotheses however which we have just been discussing are problematical judgments only which at least cannot be refuted though they can neither be proved by anything they are nothing but private  opinions but for our own satisfaction     we cannot well do without them to counteract misgivings that may arise in our minds in this character they should be maintained but we must take great care less they should assume independent authority and a certain absolute validity and drown our reason beneath fictions and phantoms section iv the discipline of pure reason with regard to its proofs what distinguishes the proofs of transcendental and synthetical propositions from all other proofs of a synthetical knowledge a priori is this that reason is not allowed here to apply itself directly to an object through its concepts     but has first to prove the objective validity of those concepts and the possibility of their synthesis a priori this rule is not suggested by prudence only but refers to the very nature and the possibility of such proofs if i am to go beyond the concept of an object a priori this is impossible without some special guidance coming to me from without that concept in mathematics it is intuition a priori which thus guides my synthesis so that all our conclusions may be drawn immediately from pure intuition in transcendental knowledge the same     guidance so long as we are dealing with concepts of the understanding only is to be found in possible experience for here the proof does not show that the given concept for instance the concept of that which happens leads directly to another concept that of a cause this would be a saltus which nothing could justify what our proof really shows is that experience itself and therefore the object of experience would be impossible without such a causal connection the proof therefore had at the same time to indicate the possibility of arriving synthetically and a priori at a certain knowledge of things which was not contained in our concept of them unless we attend to this point our proofs like streams which have broken their banks run wildly across the fields wherever the inclination of some hidden association may chance to lead them the semblance of a conviction based on subjective causes of association and mistaken for the perception of a natural affinity cannot balance the misgivings which are justly roused by such bold proceedings hence all attempts at proving the principle of sufficient reason have according to the universal admission of all competent judges been vain and before the appearance of transcendental     criticism it was thought better as that principle could never be surrendered to make a sturdy appeal to the common sense of mankind an expedient which     always shows that the cause of reason is desperate than to attempt new dogmatical proofs of it but if the proposition that has to be proved is an assertion of pure reason and if i even intend by means of pure ideas to go beyond my empirical concepts it would be all the more necessary that the proof should contain the justification of such a step of synthesis if it were possible as a necessary condition of its own validity the socalled proof of the simple nature of our thinking substance soul derived from the unity of apperception seems very plausible but it is confronted by an inevitable difficulty because as the absolute unity is not a concept that can be immediately referred to a perception but as an idea can only be inferred it is difficult to understand how the mere consciousness which is or at least may be contained in all thought though it may be so far a simple representation can lead me on to the consciousness and the knowledge of a thing in which thought alone is contained for if i represent to myself the power of my body as in motion it is then to me an absolute unity and my representation of it is a simple one i can therefore very well express this representation by the motion of a point because the volume of the body is here of no consequence and can without any diminution of its power be conceived as small as one likes and therefore even as existing in one point but i should never conclude from this that if nothing     is given to me but the motive power of a body that body can be conceived as a simple substance because its   0 representation is independent of the quantity of its volume and therefore simple i thus detect a paralogism because the simple in the abstract is totally different from the simple as an object and the ego which conceived in the abstract contains nothing manifold can as an object when signifying the soul become a very complex concept comprehending and implying many things in order to be prepared for such a paralogism for unless we suspected it the proof might excite no suspicion it is absolutely necessary to be always in possession of a criterion of such synthetical propositions which are meant to prove more than experience can ever supply this criterion consists in our demanding that the proof should not be carried directly to the predicate in question but that first the principle of the possibility of expanding our given concept a priori into ideas and realising them should be established if we always exercised this caution and before attempting any such proof wisely considered ourselves how and with what degree of confidence we might expect such an expansion through pure reason and whence we might take in such cases knowledge which cannot be evolved from concepts nor anticipated with reference     to possible experience we might spare ourselves many difficult and yet fruitless endeavours by not asking of reason what evidently is beyond its power or rather by subjecting reason which when once under the influence of this passion for speculative conquest is not easily checked to a thorough discipline of moderation the first rule therefore is to attempt no transcendental proofs before having first considered from whence we should take the principles on which such proofs are to be based and by what right we may expect our conclusions     to be successful if they are principles of the understanding for instance of causality it is useless to attempt to arrive by means of them at ideas of pure reason because they are valid only with regard to objects of experience if they are principles of pure reason it is again labour lost because though reason possesses such principles they are all as objective principles dialectical and cannot be valid except perhaps as regulative principles for the empirical use of reason in order to make it systematically coherent if such socalled proofs exist already we ought to meet their deceptive pleadings with the non liquet of a mature judgment and although we may be unable to expose their sophisms we have a perfect right     to demand a deduction of the principles employed which if these principles are to have their origin in reason alone will never be forthcoming you may thus dispense with the analysis and refutation of every one of these sophisms and dispose in a lump of the endless fallacies of dialectic by appealing to the tribunal of critical reason which insists on laws the second peculiarity of transcendental proofs is this that for every transcendental proposition one proof only can be found if i have to draw conclusions not from concepts but from the intuition which corresponds to a concept whether it be pure intuition as in mathematics or empirical as in physical science the intuition on which my conclusions are to rest supplies me with manifold material for synthetical propositions which i may connect in more than one way so that by starting from different points i can arrive at the same conclusion by different paths every transcendental proposition on the contrary starts     from one concept only and predicates the synthetical condition of the possibility of the object according to that concept there can therefore be but one proof because beside that concept there is nothing else whereby that object could be determined the proof therefore     can contain nothing more but the determination of an object in general according to that concept which is itself one only in the transcendental analytic for instance we had deduced the principle that everything which happens has a cause from the single condition of the objective possibility of the concept of an event in general namely that the determination of any event in time and therefore the event itself also as belonging to experience would be impossible unless it were subject to such a dynamical rule this is therefore the only possible proof for the event which we represent to ourselves has objective validity that is truth on this condition only that an object is determined as belonging to that concept by means of the law of causality it is true that other arguments in support of this proposition have been attempted for instance one derived from contingency but if that argument is examined more carefully we can discover no characteristic sign of contingency except the happening that is existence preceded by the nonexistence of the object which leads us back to the same argument as before if the proposition has to be proved that everything which thinks is simple no attention is paid to what is manifold in thought and the concept of the ego only is kept in view which is simple and to which all thinking is referred the same applies to the transcendental proof of the existence of god which rests entirely on the reciprocability of the two concepts of a most real         and a necessary being and cannot be found anywhere else by this caution the criticism of the assertions of reason is much simplified wherever reason operates with concepts only only one proof is possible if any if therefore we see the dogmatist advance with his ten proofs we may be sure that he has none for if he had one which as it ought to be in all matters of pure reason had apodictic power what need would he have of others his object can only be the same as that of the parliamentary lawyer who has one argument for one person and another for another he wants to take advantage of the weakness of the judges who without enquiring more deeply and in order to get away as soon as possible lay hold of the first argument that catches their attention and decide accordingly the third peculiar rule of pure reason if it is once subjected to a proper discipline with regard to transcendental proofs is this that such proofs must never be apagogical or circumstantial but always ostensive or direct the direct or ostensive proof combines with regard to every kind of knowledge a conviction of its truth with an insight into its sources the apagogical proof on the contrary though it may produce certainty cannot help us to comprehend the truth in its connection with the grounds of its possibility it is therefore a mere expedient   0 and cannot satisfy all the requirements of reason the apagogical proofs have however this advantage with regard to their evidence over direct proofs that contradiction always carries with it more clearness in the representation than the best combination and thus approaches more to the intuitional character of a demonstration     the real reason why apagogical proofs are so much employed in different sciences seems to be this if the grounds from which some knowledge is to be derived are too numerous or too deeply hidden one tries whether they may not be reached through their consequences now it is quite true that this modus ponens that is this inferring of the truth of some knowledge from the truth of its consequences is only permitted if all possible consequences flowing from it are true in that case they have only one possible ground which therefore is also the true one this procedure however is impracticable because to discover all possible consequences of any given proposition exceeds our powers nevertheless this mode of arguing is employed though under a certain indulgence whenever something is to be established as a hypothesis only in which case a conclusion according to analogy is admitted namely that if as many consequences as one has tested agree with an assumed ground all others will also agree with it to change in this way a hypothesis into a demonstrated truth is clearly impossible     the modus tollens of reasoning from consequences to their grounds is not only perfectly strict but also extremely easy for if one single false consequence only can be drawn from a proposition that proposition is wrong instead therefore of examining for the sake of an ostensive proof the whole series of grounds that may lead us to the truth of a cognition by means of a perfect insight into its possibility we have only to prove that one single consequence resulting from the opposite is false in order to show that the opposite itself is false and therefore the cognition which we had to prove true this apagogical method of proof however is admissible     in those sciences only where it is impossible to foist the subjective elements of our representations into the place of what is objective namely the knowledge of that which exists in the object when this is not impossible it must often happen that the opposite of any proposition contradicts the subjective conditions of thought only but not the object itself or that both propositions contradict each other under a subjective condition which is mistaken as objective so that as the condition is false both may be false without our being justified in inferring the truth of the one from the falseness of the other in mathematics such subreptions are impossible     and it is true therefore that the apagogical proof has its true place there in natural science in which everything is based on empirical intuitions that kind of subreption can generally be guarded against by a repeated comparison of observations but even thus this mode of proof is of little value there the transcendental endeavours of pure reason however are all made within the very sphere of dialectical illusion where what is subjective presents itself nay forces itself upon reason in its premisses as objective here therefore it can never be allowed with reference to synthetical propositions to justify ones assertions by refuting their opposite for either this refutation may be nothing but the mere representation of the conflict of the opposite opinion with the subjective conditions under which our reason could alone comprehend it and this would be of no avail for rejecting the proposition itself — thus we see for instance that the unconditioned necessity of the existence of a being cannot possibly be comprehended by us which subjectively bars every speculative proof of a necessary supreme being     but by no means the possibility of such a being by itself — or on the other hand it may be that both the affirmative and the negative party have been deceived by the transcendental illusion and base their arguments on an impossible concept of an object in that case the rule applies non entis nulla sunt praedicata that is     everything that has been asserted with regard to an object whether affirmatively or negatively is wrong and we cannot therefore arrive apagogically at the knowledge of truth by the refutation of its opposite if for example we assume that the world of sense is given by itself in its totality it is wrong to conclude that it must be either infinite in space or finite and limited for either is wrong because phenomena as mere representations which nevertheless are to be things by themselves as objects are something impossible and the infinitude of this imaginary whole though it might be unconditioned would because everything in phenomena is conditioned contradict that very unconditioned quantity which is presupposed in its concept the apagogical mode of proof is also the blind by which the admirers of our dogmatical philosophy have always been deceived it may be compared to a prizefighter who is willing to prove the honour and the incontestable rights of his adopted party by offering battle to all and every one who should dare to doubt them such brawling however settles nothing but only shows the respective strength of the two parties and even this on the part of those only who take the offensive the spectators seeing that each party is alternately conqueror and conquered     are often led to regard the very object of the dispute with a certain amount of scepticism in this however     they are wrong and it is sufficient to remind them of non defensoribus istis tempus eget it is absolutely necessary that every one should plead his cause directly by means of a legitimate proof based on a transcendental deduction of the grounds of proof thus only can we see what he may have to say himself in favour of his own claims of reason if his opponent relies on subjective grounds only it is easy no doubt to refute him but this does not benefit the dogmatist who generally depends quite as much on the subjective grounds of his judgment and can be quite as easily driven into a corner by his opponent if on the contrary both parties employ only the direct mode of proof they will either themselves perceive the difficulty nay the impossibility of finding any title for their assertions and appeal in the end to prescription only or our criticism will easily discover the dogmatical illusion and compel pure reason to surrender its exaggerated pretensions in the sphere of speculative thought and to retreat within the limits of its own domain — that of practical principles     chapter ii the canon of pure reason     it is humiliating no doubt for human reason that it can achieve nothing by itself nay that it stands in need of a discipline to check its vagaries and to guard against the illusions arising from them but on the other hand it elevates reason and gives it selfconfidence that it can and must exercise that discipline itself and allows no censorship to any one else the bounds moreover which it is obliged to set to its own speculative use check at the same time the sophistical pretensions of all its opponents and thus secure everything that remains of its formed exaggerated pretensions against every possible attack the greatest and perhaps the only advantage of all philosophy of pure reason seems therefore to be negative only because it serves not as an organon for the extension but as a discipline for the limitation of its domain and instead of discovering truth it only claims the modest merit of preventing error nevertheless there must be somewhere a source of positive cognitions which belong to the domain of pure reason and which perhaps owing to some misunderstanding     only may lead to error while they form in     reality the true goal of all the efforts of reason how else could we account for that inextinguishable desire to gain a footing by any means somewhere beyond the limits of experience reason has a presentiment of objects which possess a great interest for it it enters upon the path of pure speculation in order to approach them but they fly before it may we not suppose that on the only path which is still open to it namely that of its practical employments reason may hope to meet with better success i understand by a canon a system of principles a priori for the proper employment of certain faculties of knowledge in general thus general logic in its analytical portion is a canon for the understanding and reason in general but only so far as the form is concerned for it takes no account of any contents thus we saw that the transcendental analytic is the canon of the pure understanding and that it alone is capable of true synthetical knowledge a priori when no correct use of a faculty of knowledge is possible there is no canon and as all synthetical knowledge of pure reason in its speculative employment is according to all that has been hitherto said totally impossible there exists no canon of the speculative employment of reason for that employment is entirely dialectical but all transcendental logic is in this respect disciplinary only consequently if there exists     any correct use of pure reason at all and therefore a canon relating to it that canon will refer not to the speculative but to the practical use of reason which we shall now proceed to investigate   0 first section of the ultimate aim of the pure use of our reason reason is impelled by a tendency of its nature to go beyond the field of experience and to venture in its pure employment and by means of mere ideas to the utmost limits of all knowledge nay it finds no rest until it has fulfilled its course and established an independent and systematic whole of all knowledge the question is whether this endeavour rests on the speculative or rather exclusively on the practical interests of reason i shall say nothing at present of the success which has attended pure reason in its speculative endeavours and only ask which are the problems the solution of which forms its ultimate aim whether that object be really reached or not and in relation to which all other problems are only means to an end these highest aims must again according to the nature of reason possess     a certain unity in order to advance by their union that interest of humanity which is second to no other the highest aim to which the speculation of reason in its transcendental employment is directed comprehends three objects the freedom of the will the immortality of the soul and the existence of god the purely speculative interest of reason in every one of these three questions is very small and for its sake alone this fatiguing and ceaseless labour of transcendental investigation would hardly have been undertaken because whatever discoveries may be made they could never be used     in a way that would be advantageous in concreto that is in the investigation of nature our will may be free but this would only refer to the intelligible cause of our volition with regard to the phenomena in which that will manifests itself that is our actions we have to account for them according to an inviolable maxim without which reason could not be employed for empirical purposes at all in no other way than for all other phenomena of nature that is according to her unchangeable laws secondly the spiritual nature of the soul and with it its immortality may be understood by us yet we could not base upon this any explanation either with regard to the phenomena of this life or the peculiar nature of a     future state because our concept of an incorporeal nature is purely negative and does not expand our knowledge in the least nor does it offer any fit material for drawing consequences except such as are purely fictitious and could never be countenanced by philosophy thirdly even admitting that the existence of a highest intelligence had been proved we might no doubt use it in order to make the design in the constitution of the world and its order in general intelligible but we should never be justified in deriving from it any particular arrangement or disposition or in boldly inferring it where it cannot be perceived for it is a necessary rule for the speculative employment of reason never to pass by natural causes and abandoning what we may learn from experience to derive something which we know from something which entirely transcends all our knowledge in one word these three propositions remain always transcendent for speculative reason and admit of no     immanent employment that is an employment admissible for objects of experience and therefore of some real utility to ourselves but are by themselves entirely valueless and yet extremely difficult exertions of our reason if therefore these three cardinal propositions are of no use to us so far as knowledge is concerned and are yet so strongly recommended to us by our reason their true value will probably be connected with our  00 practical interests only i call practical whatever is possible through freedom when the conditions of the exercise of our freewill are empirical reason can have no other but a regulative use serving only to bring about the unity of empirical laws thus for instance in the teaching of prudence the whole business of reason consists in concentrating all the objects of our desires in one namely happiness and in coordinating the means for obtaining it reason therefore can give us none but pragmatic laws of free action for the attainment of the objects recommended to us by the senses and never pure laws determined entirely a priori pure practical laws on the contrary the object of which is given by reason entirely a priori and which convey commands not under empirical conditions but absolutely would be products of pure reason such are the moral laws and these alone therefore belong to the sphere of the practical use of reason and admit of a canon all the preparations of reason therefore in what may be called pure philosophy are in reality directed to those three problems only these themselves however have a still further object namely to know what ought to be done if the will is free if there is a god and if there is a future world as this concerns our actions with reference to the     highest aim of life we see that the last intention  0  of nature in her wise provision was really in the constitution of our reason directed to moral interests only we must be careful however lest as we are now considering a subject which is foreign to transcendental philosophy  we should lose ourselves in episodes and injure the unity of the system while on the other side if we say too little of this new matter there might be a lack of clearness and persuasion i hope to avoid both dangers by keeping as close as possible to what is transcendental and by leaving entirely aside what may be psychological that is empirical in it i have therefore first to remark that for the present i shall use the concept of freedom in its practical meaning only taking no account of the other concept of freedom in its transcendental meaning which cannot be presupposed empirically as an explanation of phenomena but is itself a problem of reason and has been disposed  0  of before a will is purely animal arbitrium brutum when it is determined by nothing but sensuous impulses that is pathologically a will on the contrary which is independent of sensuous impulses and can be determined therefore by motives presented by reason alone is called freewill arbitrium liberum and everything connected with this whether as cause or effect is called practical practical freedom can be proved by experience for human will is     not determined by that only which excites that is immediately affects the senses but we possess the power to overcome the impressions made on the faculty of our sensuous desires by representing to ourselves what in a more distant way may be useful or hurtful these considerations of what is desirable with regard to our whole state that is of what is good and useful are based entirely on reason reason therefore gives laws which are imperatives that is objective laws of freedom and tell us what ought to take place though perhaps it never does take place differing therein from the laws of nature which relate only to what does take place these laws of freedom therefore are called practical laws whether reason in prescribing these laws is  0  not itself determined by other influences and whether what in relation to sensuous impulses is called freedom may not with regard to higher and more remote causes be nature again does not concern us while engaged in these practical questions and while demanding from reason nothing but the rule of our conduct it is a purely speculative question which while we are only concerned with what we ought or ought not to do may well be left aside we know practical freedom by experience as one of the natural causes namely as a causality of reason in determining the will while transcendental freedom demands the independence of reason itself with reference to its causality in beginning a series of phenomena from all determining causes in the world of sense thus running counter as it would seem to the law of nature and therefore to all possible experience and remaining a problem reason however in its practical employment has nothing to do with this problem so that there remain but two questions in a     canon of pure reason which concern the practical interest of pure reason and with regard to which a canon of their employment must be possible namely is there a god is there a future life the question of transcendental freedom refers to speculative knowledge only and may be safely left aside as quite indifferent when we are concerned with practical interests a sufficient discussion  0  of it may be found in the antinomy of pure reason section ii of the ideal of the summum bonum as determining the ultimate aim of pure reason reason in its speculative employment conducted us through the field of experience and as it could find no perfect satisfaction there from thence to speculative ideas which however in the end conducted us back again to experience and thus fulfilled their purpose in a manner which though useful was not at all in accordance with our expectation we may now have one more trial namely to see whether pure reason may be met with in practical use also and whether thus it may lead to ideas which realise the highest aims of pure reason as we have just stated them and whether therefore from the point of view of its practical interest reason may not be able to grant us what it entirely refused to do with regard to its speculative interest the whole interest of my reason whether speculative or practical is concentrated in the three following questions —  0        what can i know   what should i do   what may i hope the first question is purely speculative we have as i flatter myself exhausted all possible answers and found at last that with which no doubt reason must be satisfied and except with regard to the practical has just cause to be satisfied we remained however as far removed from the two great ends to which the whole endeavour of pure reason was really directed as if we had consulted our ease and declined the whole task from the very beginning so far then as knowledge is concerned so much is certain and clear that with regard to these two problems knowledge can never fall to our lot the second question is purely practical as such it may come within the cognisance of pure reason but is even then not transcendental but moral and cannot consequently occupy our criticism by itself the third question namely what may i hope for if i do what i ought to do is at the same time practical and theoretical the practical serving as a guidance to the answer to the theoretical and in its highest form speculative question for all hoping is directed towards happiness and is with regard to practical interests and the law of morality the same as knowing and the law of nature with regard to the theoretical cognition of things the former arrives at last at a conclusion that something is  0  which determines the last possible aim because something ought to take place the latter that something is which operates as the highest cause because something does take place     happiness is the satisfaction of all our desires extensively in regard to their manifoldness intensively in regard to their degree and protensively in regard to their duration the practical law derived from the motive of happiness i call pragmatical rule of prudence but the law if there is such a law which has no other motive but to deserve to be happy i call moral law of morality the former advises us what we have to do if we wish to possess happiness the latter dictates how we ought to conduct ourselves in order to deserve happiness the former is founded on empirical principles for i cannot know except by experience what desires there are which are to be satisfied nor what are the natural means of satisfying them the second takes no account of desires and the natural means of satisfying them and regards only the freedom of any rational being and the necessary conditions under which alone it can harmonise with the distribution of happiness according to principles it can therefore be based on mere ideas of pure reason and known a priori i assume that there really exist pure moral laws  0  which entirely a priori without regard to empirical motives that is happiness determine the use of the freedom of any rational being both with regard to what has to be done and what has not to be done and that these laws are imperative absolutely not hypothetically only on the supposition of other empirical ends and therefore in every respect necessary i feel justified in assuming this by appealing not only to the arguments of the most enlightened moralists but also to the moral judgment of every man if he only tries to conceive such a law clearly pure reason therefore contains not indeed in its speculative     yet in its practical or more accurately its moral employment principles of the possibility of experience namely of such actions as might be met with in the history of man according to moral precepts for as reason commands that such actions should take place they must be possible and a certain kind of systematical unity also namely the moral must be possible while it was impossible to prove the systematical unity of nature according to the speculative principles of reason for reason no doubt possesses causality with respect to freedom in general but not with respect to the whole of nature and moral principles of reason may indeed produce free actions but not laws of nature consequently the principles of pure reason possess objective reality in their practical  0  and more particularly in their moral employment i call the world in so far as it may be in accordance with all moral laws which by virtue of the freedom of rational beings it may and according to the necessary laws of morality it ought to be a moral world as here we take no account of all conditions aims and even of all impediments to morality the weakness or depravity of human nature this world is conceived as an intelligible world only it is therefore so far a mere idea though a practical idea which can and ought really to exercise its influence on the sensible world in order to bring it as far as possible into conformity with that idea the idea of a moral world has therefore objective reality not as referring to an object of intelligible intuition which we cannot even conceive but as referring to the sensible world conceived as an object of pure reason in its practical employment and as a corpus mysticum of rational beings dwelling in it so far as their freewill placed under     moral laws possesses a thorough systematical unity both with itself and with the freedom of everybody else the answer therefore of the first of the two questions of pure reason with reference to practical interests  0  is this do that which will render thee deserving of happiness the second question asks how then if i conduct myself so as to be deserving of happiness may i hope thereby to obtain happiness the answer to this question depends on this whether the principles of pure reason which a priori prescribe the law necessarily also connect this hope with it i say then that just as the moral principles are necessary according to reason in its practical employment it is equally necessary according to reason in its theoretic employment to assume that everybody has reason to hope to obtain happiness in the same measure in which he has rendered himself deserving of it in his conduct and that therefore the system of morality is inseparably though only in the idea of pure reason connected with that of happiness in an intelligible that is in a moral world in conceiving which we take no account of any of the impediments to morality desires etc such a system in which happiness is proportioned to morality may even be considered as necessary because freedom as repelled or restrained by the moral law is itself the cause of general happiness and rational beings therefore themselves under the guidance of such principles the authors of the permanent wellbeing of themselves and at the same time of others but such a system of selfrewarding morality is   0 an idea only the realisation of which depends on everybody doing what he ought to do that is on all actions of   0 reasonable beings being so performed as if they sprang from one supreme will comprehending within itself or under itself all private wills but as the moral law remains binding upon every one in the use of his freedom even if others do not conform to that law it is impossible that either the nature of things in the world or the causality of the actions themselves or their relation to morality should determine in what relation the consequences of such actions should stand to happiness if therefore we take our stand on nature only the necessary connection of a hope of happiness with the unceasing endeavour of rendering oneself deserving of happiness cannot be known by reason but can only be hoped for if a highest reason which rules according to moral laws is accepted at the same time as the cause of nature i call the idea of such an intelligence in which the most perfect moral will united with the highest blessedness is the cause of all happiness in the world so far as it corresponds exactly with morality that is the being worthy of happiness the ideal of the supreme good it is therefore in the ideal only of the supreme original good that pure reason can find the ground of the practically necessary connection of both elements of the highest     derivative good namely of an intelligible that is moral world as we are bound by reason to conceive ourselves as belonging necessarily to such a world though the senses present us with nothing but a world of phenomena we shall have to accept the other world as the result of our conduct in this world of sense in which we see no such connection between goodness and happiness and therefore as to us a future world hence it follows that god and a future life are two suppositions which according     to the principles of pure reason cannot be separated from the obligation which that very reason imposes on us morality by itself constitutes a system but not so happiness unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality this however is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler such a ruler together with life in such a world which we must consider as future reason compels us to admit unless all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams because without that supposition the necessary consequences which the same reason connects with these laws would be absent hence everybody looks upon moral laws as commands which they could not be if they did not connect a priori adequate consequences with their rules and carried with them both promises and threats nor could they do this unless they rested on a necessary being as the supreme good which alone can render the     unity of such a design possible leibniz called the world if we have regard only to the rational beings in it and their mutual relations according to moral laws and under the government of the supreme good the kingdom of grace distinguishing it from the kingdom of nature in which these beings though standing under moral laws expect no other consequences from their conduct but such as follow according to the course of nature of our sensible world to view ourselves as belonging to the kingdom of grace in which all happiness awaits us except in so far as we have diminished our share in it through our unworthiness of being happy is a practically necessary idea of reason practical laws in so far as they become at the same time subjective grounds of actions that is subjective     principles are called maxims the criticism of morality with regard to its purity and its results takes place according to ideas the practical observance of its laws according to maxims it is necessary that the whole course of our life should be subject to moral maxims but this is impossible unless reason connects with the moral law which is a mere idea an efficient cause which assigns to all conduct in accordance with the moral law an issue accurately corresponding to our highest aims whether in this or in another     life thus without a god and without a world not visible to us now but hoped for the glorious ideas of morality are indeed objects of applause and admiration but not springs of purpose and action because they fail to fulfil all the aims which are natural to every rational being and which are determined a priori by the same pure reason and therefore necessary our reason does by no means consider happiness alone as the perfect good it does not approve of it however much inclination may desire it except as united with desert that is with perfect moral conduct nor is morality alone and with it mere desert of being happy the perfect good to make it perfect he who has conducted himself as not unworthy of happiness must be able to hope to participate in it even if freed from all private views and interests reason were it to put itself in the place of a being that had to distribute all happiness to others could not judge otherwise because in the practical idea both elements are essentially connected though in such a way that our participation in happiness should be rendered possible by the moral character as a condition and not conversely the moral character by the     prospect of happiness for in the latter case the     character would not be moral nor worthy therefore of complete happiness a happiness which in the eyes of reason admits of no limitation but such as arises from our own immoral conduct happiness therefore in exact proportion with the morality of rational beings who are made worthy of happiness by it constitutes alone the supreme good of a world into which we must necessarily place ourselves according to the commands of pure but practical reason but this is an intelligible world only and a sensible world never promises us such a systematical unity of ends as arising from the nature of things nor is the reality of this unity founded on anything but the admission of a supreme original good so that independent reason equipped with all the requirements of a supreme cause founds maintains and completes according to the most perfect design the universal order of things which in the world of sense is almost completely hidden from our sight this moral theology has this peculiar advantage over speculative theology that it leads inevitably to the concept of a sole most perfect and rational first being to which speculative theology does not even lead us on on objective grounds much less give us a conviction of it for neither in transcendental nor in natural theology however far reason may carry us on do we find any real ground for admitting even one sole being which we should be warranted in placing before all natural causes     and on which we might make them in all respects to depend on the other hand if from the point of view of moral unity as a necessary law of the universe we consider what cause alone could give to it its adequate     effect and therefore its binding force with regard to ourselves we find that it must be one sole supreme will which comprehends all these laws within itself for how with different wills should we find complete unity of ends that will must be omnipotent in order that the whole of nature and its relation to morality and the world may be subject to it omniscient that it may know the most secret springs of our sentiments and their moral worth omnipresent that it may be near for supplying immediately all that is required by the highest interests of the world eternal that this harmony of nature and freedom may never fail and so on but this systematical unity of ends in this world of intelligences which if looked upon as mere nature may be called a sensible world only but which if considered as a system of freedom may be called an intelligible that is a moral world regnum gratiae leads inevitably also to the admission of a unity of design in all things which constitute this great universe according to general natural laws just as the former unity was according to general and necessary laws of morality in this way practical and speculative reason become united the world must be represented as having originated from an idea if it is to harmonise with that employment of reason without which we should consider ourselves     unworthy of reason namely with its moral employment which is founded entirely on the idea of the supreme good in this way the study of nature tends to assume the form of a teleological system and becomes in its widest extension physicotheology and this as it starts from the moral order as a unity founded on the essence of freedom and not accidentally brought about by external     commands traces the design of nature to grounds which must be inseparably connected a priori with the internal possibility of things and leads thus to a transcendental theology which takes the ideal of the highest ontological perfection as the principle of systematical unity which connects all things according to general and necessary laws of nature because they all have their origin in the absolute necessity of the one original being what use can we make of our understanding even in respect to experience if we have not aims before us the highest aims however are those of morality and these we can only know by means of pure reason even with their help and guidance however we could make no proper use of the knowledge of nature unless nature itself had established a unity of design for without this we should ourselves have no reason     because there would be no school for it nor any culture derived from objects which supply the material for such concepts this unity of design is necessary and founded on the essence of freewill which must therefore as containing the condition of its application in concreto be so likewise so that in reality the transcendental development of the knowledge obtained by our reason would be not the cause but only the effect of that practical order and design which pure reason imposes upon us we find therefore in the history of human reason also that before the moral concepts were sufficiently purified and refined and before the systematical unity of the ends was clearly understood according to such concepts and in accordance with necessary principles the then existing knowledge of nature and even a considerable amount of the culture of reason in many other branches of science     could only produce crude and vague conceptions of the deity or allow of an astonishing indifference with regard to that question a greater cultivation of moral ideas which became necessary through the extremely pure moral law of our religion directed our reason to that object through the interest which it forced us to take in it and without the help either of a more extended knowledge of nature or of more correct and trustworthy transcendental views which have been wanting in all ages a concept of the divine being was elaborated     which we now hold to be correct not because speculative reason has convinced us of its correctness but because it fully agrees with the moral principles of reason and thus after all it is pure reason only but pure reason in its practical employment which may claim the merit of connecting with our highest interest that knowledge which pure speculation could only guess at without being able to establish its validity and of having made it not indeed a demonstrated dogma but a supposition absolutely necessary to the most essential ends of reason but after practical reason has reached this high point namely the concept of a sole original being as the supreme good it must not imagine that it has raised itself above all empirical traditions of its application and soared up to an immediate knowledge of new objects and thus venture to start from that concept and to deduce from it the moral laws themselves for it was these very laws the internal practical necessity of which led us to the admission of an independent cause or of a wise ruler of the world that should give effect to them we ought not therefore to consider them afterwards again as accidental and derived from the mere will of the ruler particularly as     we could have no concept of such a will if we had not formed it in accordance with those laws so     far as practical reason is entitled to lead us we shall not look upon actions as obligatory because they are the commands of god but look upon them as divine commands because we feel an inner obligation to follow them we shall study freedom according to the unity of design determined by the principles of reason and we shall believe ourselves to be acting in accordance with the divine will in so far only as we hold sacred the moral law which reason teaches us from the nature of actions themselves we shall believe ourselves to be serving him only by promoting everything that is best in the world both in ourselves and in others moral theology is therefore of immanent use only teaching us to fulfil our destiny here in the world by adapting ourselves to the general system of ends without either fanatically or even criminally abandoning the guidance of reason and her moral laws for our proper conduct in life in order to connect it directly with the idea of the supreme being this would be a transcendent use of moral theology which like a transcendent use of mere speculation must inevitably pervert and frustrate the ultimate aims of reason section iii of trowing knowing and believing   0 the holding a thing to be true is an event in our understanding which though it may rest on objective grounds     requires also subjective causes in the mind of the person who is to judge if the judgment is valid for everybody if only he is possessed of reason then the ground of it is objectively sufficient and the holding it to be true is called conviction if on the contrary it has its ground in the peculiar character of the subject only it is called persuasion persuasion is a mere illusion the ground of the judgment though it lies solely in the subject being regarded as objective such a judgment has therefore private validity only and the holding it to be true cannot be communicated to others truth however depends on agreement with the object and with regard to it the judgments of every understanding must agree with each other consentientia uni tertio consentiunt inter se etc an external criterion therefore as to whether our holding a thing to be true be conviction or only persuasion consists in the possibility of communicating it and finding its truth to be valid for the reason of every man for in that case there is at least a presumption that the ground of the agreement of all judgments in     spite of the diversity of the subjects rests upon the common ground namely on the object with which they all agree and thus prove the truth of the judgment persuasion therefore cannot be distinguished from conviction subjectively so long as the subject views its judgment as a phenomenon of his own mind only the experiment however which we make with the grounds that seem valid to us by trying to find out whether they will produce the same effect on the reason of others is a means though only a subjective means not indeed of producing conviction but of detecting the merely     private validity of the judgment that is of discovering in it what is merely persuasion if we are able besides to analyse the subjective causes of our judgment which we have taken for its objective grounds and thus explain the deceptive judgment as a phenomenon in our mind without having recourse to the object itself we expose the illusion and are no longer deceived by it although we may continue to be tempted by it in a certain degree if namely the subjective cause of the illusion is inherent in our nature i cannot maintain anything that is affirm it as a judgment necessarily valid for everybody except it work conviction persuasion i may keep for myself if it     is agreeable to me but i cannot and ought not to attempt to make it binding on any but myself the holding anything to be true or the subjective validity of a judgment admits with reference to the conviction which is at the same time valid objectively of the three following degrees trowing believing knowing trowing is to hold true with the consciousness that it is insufficient both subjectively and objectively if the holding true is sufficient subjectively but is held to be insufficient objectively it is called believing while if it is sufficient both subjectively and objectively it is called knowing subjective sufficiency is called conviction for myself objective sufficiency is called certainty for everybody i shall not dwell any longer on the explanation of such easy concepts i must never venture to trow or to be of opinion without knowing at least something by means of which a judgment problematical by itself is connected with truth which connection though it involves not a complete truth is yet attended with more than arbitrary fiction moreover   0 the law of such a connection must be certain for if even with regard to this law i should have nothing but an opinion all would become a mere play of the imagination without the least relation to truth in the judgments of pure reason opinion is not permitted for as they are not based on empirical grounds but everything has to be known a priori and     everything therefore must be necessary the principle of connection in them requires universality and necessity and consequently perfect certainty without which there would be nothing to lead us on to truth hence it is absurd to have an opinion in pure mathematics here one must either know or abstain from pronouncing any judgment the same applies to the principles of morality because one must not hazard an action on the mere opinion that it is allowed but must know it to be so in the transcendental employment of reason on the contrary mere opinion no doubt would be too little but knowledge too much speculatively therefore we cannot here form any judgment at all because the subjective grounds on which we hold a thing to be true as for instance those which may very well produce belief are not approved of in speculative questions as they cannot be held without empirical support nor if communicated to others can produce the same effect on them nor can the theoretically insufficient acceptance of truth be called belief except from a practical point of view and this practical view refers either to skill or to morality the former being concerned with any contingent and casual ends and objects whatsoever the latter with absolutely necessary ends only if we have once proposed an object or end to ourselves     the conditions of attaining it are hypothetically necessary this necessity is subjective and yet but relatively     sufficient if i know of no other conditions under which the end can be attained it is sufficient absolutely and for every one if i am convinced that no one can know of other conditions leading to the attainment of our end in the former case my assuming and holding certain conditions as true is merely an accidental belief while in the latter case it is a necessary belief thus a physician for instance may feel that he must do something for a patient who is in danger but as he does not know the nature of the illness he observes the symptoms and arrives at the conclusion as he knows nothing else that it is phthisis his belief according to his own judgment is contingent only and he knows that another might form a better judgment it is this kind of contingent belief which nevertheless supplies a ground for the actual employment of means to certain actions which i call pragmatic belief the usual test whether something that is maintained be merely persuasion or a subjective conviction at least that is firm belief is betting people often pronounce their views with such bold and uncompromising assurance that they seem to have abandoned all fear of error a bet startles them sometimes it turns out that a man has persuasion sufficient to be valued at one ducat but not at ten he is ready to venture the first ducat but     with ten he becomes aware for the first time that after all it might be possible that he should be mistaken if we imagine that we have to stake the happiness of our whole life the triumphant air of our judgment drops considerably we become extremely shy and suddenly discover that our belief does not reach so far thus pragmatic     belief admits of degrees which according to the difference of the interests at stake may be large or small now it is true no doubt that though with reference to an object of our belief we can do nothing and our opinion is therefore purely theoretical yet in many cases we can represent and imagine to ourselves an undertaking for which we might think that we had sufficient inducements if any means existed of ascertaining the truth of the matter thus even in purely theoretical judgments there is an analogon of practical judgments to which the word belief may be applied and which we shall therefore call doctrinal belief if it were possible to apply any test of experience i should be ready to stake the whole of my earthly goods on my belief that at least one of the planets which we see is inhabited hence i say that it is not only an opinion but a strong belief on the truth of which i should risk even many advantages of life that there are inhabitants in other worlds now we must admit that the doctrine of the     existence of god belongs to doctrinal belief for although with reference to my theoretical knowledge of the world i can produce nothing which would make this thought a necessary supposition as a condition of my being able to explain the phenomena of the world but on the contrary am bound to use my reason as if everything were mere nature nevertheless the unity of design is so important a condition of the application of reason to nature that i cannot ignore it especially as experience supplies so many examples of it of that unity of design however i know no other condition which would make it a guidance in my study of nature but the supposition that a supreme intelligence has ordered all things according to the wisest     ends as a condition therefore of it may be a contingent but not unimportant end namely in order to have a guidance in the investigation of nature it is necessary to admit a wise author of the world the result of my experiment confirms the usefulness of this supposition so many times while nothing decisive can be adduced against it that i am really saying far too little if i call my acceptation of it a mere opinion and it may be said even with regard to these theoretical matters that i firmly believe in god still if we use our words strictly this belief must always be called doctrinal and not practical such as the theology of nature physical theology must always     and necessarily produce in the same wisdom and in the prominent endowments of human nature combined with the inadequate shortness of life another sufficient ground may be found for the doctrinal belief in the future life of the human soul the expression of belief is in such cases an expression of modesty from the objective point of view and yet at the same time a firm confidence from a subjective if even i were to call this purely theoretical acceptance an hypothesis only which i am entitled to assume i should profess to be in possession of a more complete concept of the nature of a cause of the world and of another world than i really can produce if i accept anything even as an hypothesis only i must know it at least so much according to its properties that i need not imagine its concepts but its existence only but the word belief refers only to the guidance which an idea gives me and to its subjective influence on the conduct of my reason which makes me hold it fast though i may not be able to give an account of it from a speculative point of view     purely doctrinal belief however has always a somewhat unstable character speculative difficulties often make us lose hold of it though in the end we always     return to it it is quite different with moral belief for here action is absolutely necessary that is i must obey the moral law on all points the end is here firmly established and according to all we know one only condition is possible under which that end could agree with all other ends and thus acquire practical validity namely the existence of a god and of a future world i also know it for certain that no one is cognisant of other conditions which could lead to the same unity of ends under the moral law as then the moral precept is at the same time my maxim reason commanding that it should be so i shall inevitably believe in the existence of god and in a future life and i feel certain that nothing can shake this belief because all my moral principles would be overthrown at the same time and i cannot surrender them without becoming hateful in my own eyes we see therefore that even after the failure of all the ambitious schemes of reason to pass beyond the limits of all experience enough remains to make us satisfied for practical purposes no one no doubt will be able to boast again that he knows that there is a god and a future life for a man who knows that is the very man     whom i have been so long in search of as all knowledge if it refers to an object of pure reason can be communicated i might hope that through his teaching my own knowledge would be increased in the most wonderful way no that conviction is not a logical but a moral certainty and as it rests on subjective grounds of the moral sentiment     i must not even say that it is morally certain that there is a god etc but that i am morally certain etc what i really mean is that the belief in a god and in another world is so interwoven with my moral sentiment that as there is little danger of my losing the latter there is quite as little fear lest i should ever be deprived of the former the only point that may rouse misgivings is that this rational belief is based on the supposition of moral sentiments if we surrender this and take a man who is entirely indifferent with regard to moral laws the question proposed by reason becomes merely a problem for speculation and may in that case be still supported with strong grounds from analogy but not such to which the most obstinate scepticism has to submit  no man however is with regard to these questions   0 free from all interest for although in the absence of good sentiments he may be rid of all moral interest enough remains even thus to make him fear the existence of god and a future life for nothing is required for this but his inability to plead certainty with regard to the nonexistence of such a being and of a future life as this would have to be proved by mere reason and therefore apodictically he would have to establish the impossibility of both which i feel certain no rational being would venture to do this would be a negative belief which though     it could not produce morality and good sentiments would still produce something analogous namely a check on the outbreak of evil but it will be said is this really all that pure reason can achieve in opening prospects beyond the limits of experience nothing more than two articles of faith surely even the ordinary understanding could have achieved as much without taking counsel of     philosophers i shall not here dwell on the benefits which by the laborious efforts of its criticism philosophy has conferred on human reason granting even that in the end they should turn out to be merely negative on this point something will have to be said in the next section but i ask do you really require that knowledge which concerns all men should go beyond the common understanding and should be revealed to you by philosophers only the very thing which you find fault with is the best confirmation of the correctness of our previous assertions since it reveals to us what we could not have grasped before namely that in matters which concern all men without distinction nature cannot be accused of any partial distribution of her gifts and that with regard to the essential interests of human nature the highest philosophy can achieve no more than that guidance which nature has vouchsafed even to the meanest understanding     chapter iii the architectonic of pure reason     by architectonic i understand the art of constructing systems as systematical unity is that which raises common knowledge to the dignity of a science that is changes a mere aggregate of knowledge into a system it is easy to see that architectonic is the doctrine of what is really scientific in our knowledge and forms therefore a necessary part of the doctrine of method under the sway of reason our knowledge must not remain a rhapsody but must become a system because thus alone can the essential objects of reason be supported and advanced by system i mean the unity of various kinds of knowledge under one idea this is the concept given by reason of the form of the whole in which concept both the extent of its manifold contents and the place belonging to each part are determined a priori this scientific concept of reason contains therefore the end and also the form of the whole which is congruent with it the unity of the end to which all parts relate and through the idea of which they are related to each other enables us to miss any part if we possess a knowledge of the rest and prevents any arbitrary addition or vagueness of perfection     of which the limits could not be determined a priori thus the whole is articulated articulatio     not aggregated coacervatio it may grow internally per intussusceptionem but not externally per appositionem like an animal body the growth of which does not add any new member but without changing their proportion renders each stronger and more efficient for its purposes the idea requires for its realisation a schema that is an essential variety and an order of its parts which are determined a priori according to the principles inherent in its aim a schema which is not designed according to an idea that is according to the principal aim of reason but empirically only in accordance with accidental aims the number of which cannot be determined beforehand gives technical unity but the schema which originates from an idea only where reason dictates the aims a priori and does not wait for them in experience supplies architectonical unity now what we call a science the schema of which must have its outline monogramma and the division of the whole into parts devised according to the idea that is a priori and keep it perfectly distinct from everything else according to principles cannot be produced technically according to the similarity of its various parts or the accidental use of knowledge in concreto for this or that external purpose but architectonically only as based on the affinity of its parts and their dependence on one supreme and internal aim through which alone the whole becomes possible     no one attempts to construct a science unless he can base it on some idea but in the elaboration of it the schema nay even the definition which he gives in the beginning of his science corresponds very seldom to his     idea which like a germ lies hidden in reason and all the parts of which are still enveloped and hardly distinguishable even under microscopical observation it is necessary therefore to explain and determine all sciences considering that they are contrived from the point of view of a certain general interest not according to the description given by their author but according to the idea which from the natural unity of its constituent parts we may discover as founded in reason itself we shall often find that the originator of a science and even his latest successors are moving vaguely round an idea which they have not been able to perceive clearly failing in consequence to determine rightly the proper contents the articulation systematical unity and the limits of their science it is a misfortune that only after having collected for a long time at haphazard under the influence of an idea that lies hidden in us materials belonging to a science nay after having for a long time fitted them together     technically a time arrives when we are able to see its idea in a clearer light and to devise architectonically a whole system according to the aims of reason systems seem to develope like worms through a kind of generatio aequivoca by the mere aggregration of numerous concepts at first imperfect and gradually attaining to perfection though in reality they all had their schema as their original germ in reason which was itself being developed hence not only is each of them articulated according to an idea but all may be properly combined with each other in a system of human knowledge as members of one whole admitting of an architectonic of all human knowledge which in our time when so much material has been collected or may be taken over from the ruins of old   0 systems is not only possible but not even very difficult we shall confine ourselves here to the completion of our proper business namely to sketch the architectonic of all knowledge arising from pure reason beginning only at the point where the common root of our knowledge divides into two stems one of which is reason by reason however i understand here the whole higher faculty of knowledge and i distinguish therein rational from empirical knowledge if i take no account of the contents of knowledge objectively considered all knowledge is from a subjective point of view either historical or rational historical     knowledge is cognitio ex datis rational knowledge cognitio ex principiis whatever may be the first origin of some branch of knowledge it is always historical if he who possesses it knows only so much of it as has been given to him from outside whether through immediate experience or through narration or by instruction also in general knowledge hence a person who in the usual sense has learnt a system of philosophy for instance the wolfian though he may carry in his head all the principles definitions and proofs as well as the division of the whole system and have it all at his fingers ends possesses yet none but a complete historical knowledge of the wolfian philosophy his knowledge and judgments are no more than what has been given him if you dispute any definition he does not know whence to take another because he formed his own on the reason of another but the imitative is not the productive faculty that is knowledge in his case did not come from reason and though objectively it is rational knowledge subjectively it is historical only he has taken and kept     that is he has well learned and has become a plaster cast of a living man knowledge which is rational objectively that is which can arise originally from a mans own reason only can then only be so called subjectively also when they have been drawn from the general resources of reason that is from principles from which     also criticism nay even the rejection of what has been learnt may arise all knowledge of reason is again either based on concepts or on the construction of concepts the former being called philosophical the latter mathematical of their essential difference i have treated in the first chapter knowledge as we saw may be objectively philosophical and yet subjectively historical as is the case with most apprentices and with all who never look beyond their school and remain in a state of pupilage all their life but it is strange that mathematical knowledge as soon as it has been acquired may be considered subjectively also as knowledge of reason there being no such distinction here as in the case of philosophical knowledge the reason is that the sources from which alone the mathematical teacher can take his knowledge lie nowhere but in the essential and genuine principles of reason and cannot be taken by the pupil from anywhere else nor ever be disputed for the simple ground that the employment of reason takes place here in concreto only although a priori namely in the pure and therefore faultless intuition thus excluding all illusion and error of all the sciences of reason a priori therefore mathematics alone can be learnt but philosophy unless it be historically never with regard to reason we can at most learn to philosophise the system of all philosophical knowledge         is called philosophy it must be taken objectively if we understand by it the type of criticising all philosophical attempts which is to serve for the criticism of every subjective philosophy however various and changeable the systems may be in this manner philosophy is a mere idea of a possible science which exists nowhere in concreto but which we may try to approach on different paths until in the end the only true path though overgrown and hidden by sensibility has been discovered and the image which has so often proved a failure has become as like the original type as human power can ever make it till then we cannot learn philosophy for where is it who possesses it and how shall we know it we can only learn to philosophise that is to exercise the talent of reason according to its general principles on certain given attempts always however with the reservation of the right of reason of investigating the sources of these principles themselves and of either accepting or rejecting them so far the concept of philosophy is only scholastic as of a system of knowledge which is sought and valued as a science without aiming at more than a systematical unity of that knowledge and therefore the logical perfection of it but there is also a universal or if we may say so a cosmical concept conceptus cosmicus of philosophy which always formed the real foundation of that name     particularly when it had as it were to be personified and represented in the ideal of the philosopher as the original type in this sense philosophy is the science of the relation of all knowledge to the essential aims of human reason teleologia rationis humanae and the philosopher stands before us not as an artist but as the lawgiver of     human reason in that sense it would be very boastful to call oneself a philosopher and to pretend to have equalled the type which exists in the idea only the mathematician the student of nature and the logician however far the two former may have advanced in rational and the last particularly in philosophical knowledge are merely artists of reason there is besides an ideal teacher who controls them all and uses them as instruments for the advancement of the essential aims of human reason him alone we ought to call philosopher but as he exists nowhere while the idea of his legislation exists everywhere in the reason of every human being we shall keep entirely to that idea and determine more accurately what kind of systematical unity philosophy in this cosmical concept  demands from the standpoint of its aims   0 essential ends are not as yet the highest ends in fact there can be but one highest end if the perfect systematical unity of reason has been reached we must distinguish therefore between the ultimate end and subordinate ends which necessarily belong as means to the former the former is nothing but the whole destination of man and the philosophy which relates to it is called moral philosophy o account of this excellence which distinguishes moral philosophy from all other operations of reason the ancients always understood under the name of philosopher the moralist principally and even at present the external appearance of selfcontrol by means of reason     leads us through a certain analogy to call a man a philosopher however limited his knowledge may be the legislation of human reason philosophy has two objects only nature and freedom and contains therefore both the law of nature and the law of morals at first in two separate systems but combined at last in one great system of philosophy the philosophy of nature relates to all that is that of morals to that only that ought to be all philosophy is either knowledge derived from pure reason or knowledge of reason derived from empirical principles the former is called pure the latter empirical philosophy the philosophy of pure reason is either propaedeutic     preparation enquiring into the faculties of reason with regard to all pure knowledge a priori and called critic or secondly the system of pure reason science comprehending in systematical connection the whole both true and illusory of philosophical knowledge derived from pure reason and called metaphysic — although this name of metaphysic may be given also to the whole of pure philosophy inclusive of the critic in order thus to comprehend both the investigation of all that can ever be known a priori and the representation of all that constitutes a system of pure philosophical knowledge of that kind excluding all that belongs to the empirical and the mathematical employment of reason metaphysic is divided into that of the speculative and that of the practical use of pure reason and is therefore either metaphysic of nature or metaphysic of morals the former contains all the pure principles of reason derived from concepts only excluding therefore mathematics of the theoretical knowledge of all things the latter the principles     which determine a priori and necessitate all doing and not doing morality is the only legality of actions that can be derived from principles entirely a priori hence the metaphysic of morals is really pure moral philosophy in which no account is taken of anthropology or any empirical conditions metaphysic of speculative     reason has commonly been called metaphysic in the more limited sense as however pure moral philosophy belongs likewise to this branch of human and philosophical knowledge derived from pure reason we shall allow it to retain that name although we leave it aside for the present as not belonging to our immediate object it is of the highest importance to isolate various sorts of knowledge which in kind and origin are different from others and to take great care lest they be mixed up with those others with which for practical purposes they are generally united what is done by the chemist in the analysis of substances and by the mathematician in pure mathematics is far more incumbent on the philosopher in order to enable him to define clearly the part which in the promiscuous employment of the understanding belongs to a special kind of knowledge as well as its peculiar value and influence human reason therefore since it first began to think or rather to reflect has never been able to do without a metaphysic but it has never kept it sufficiently free from all foreign admixture the idea of a science of this kind is as old as speculation itself and what human reason does not speculate whether in a scholastic or a popular manner it must be admitted however that even thinkers by profession did     not clearly distinguish between the two elements of our knowledge the one being in our possession completely a     priori the other deducible a posteriori only from experience and did not succeed therefore in fixing the limits of a special kind of knowledge nor in realising the true idea of a science which had so long and so deeply engaged the interest of human reason when it was said that metaphysic is the science of the first principles of human knowledge this did not mark out any special kind of knowledge but only a certain rank or degree with regard to its character of generality which was not sufficient to distinguish it clearly from empirical knowledge for among empirical principles also some are more general and therefore higher than others and in such a series of subordinated principles where that which is entirely a priori is not distinguished from that which is known a posteriori only where should one draw the line to separate the first part from the last and the higher members from the lower what should we say if chronology should distinguish the epochs of history no better than by dividing it into the first centuries and the subsequent centuries we should ask no doubt whether the fifth or the tenth belongs to the first centuries and i ask in the same way whether the concept of what is extended belongs to metaphysic if you say yes i ask what about the concept of a body and of a liquid body you then hesitate for you     begin to see that if i continue in this strain everything would belong to metaphysic it thus becomes clear that the mere degree of subordination of the special under the general cannot determine the limits of a science but in our case only the complete difference in kind and origin the fundamental idea of metaphysic was obscured on another side because as     knowledge a priori it showed a certain similarity in kind with mathematics the two are no doubt related with regard to their origin a priori but if we consider how in metaphysic knowledge is derived from concepts while in mathematics we can only form judgments through the construction of concepts a priori we discover in comparing philosophical with mathematical knowledge the most decided difference in kind which was no doubt always felt but never determined by clear criteria thus it has happened that as philosophers themselves blundered in developing the idea of their science its elaboration could have no definite aim and no certain guidance and we may well understand how metaphysical science was brought into contempt in the outside world and at last among philosophers themselves considering how arbitrarily it had been designed and how constantly those very philosophers ignorant as to the path which they ought to take were disputing among themselves about the discoveries which each asserted he had made on his own peculiar path     all pure knowledge a priori constitutes therefore according to the special faculty of knowledge in which alone it can originate a definite unity and metaphysic is that philosophy which is meant to represent that knowledge in its systematical unity its speculative part which has especially appropriated that name namely what we call metaphysic of nature in which everything is considered from concepts a priori so far as it is not so far as it ought to be will have to be divided in the following manner metaphysic in the more limited sense of the word consists of transcendental philosophy and the physiology     of pure reason the former treats only of understanding and reason themselves in a system of all concepts and principles which have reference to objects in general without taking account of objects that may be given ontologia the latter treats of nature that is the sum of given objects whether given to the senses or if you like to some other kind of intuition and is therefore physiology although rationalis only the employment of reason in this rational study of nature is either physical or hyperphysical or more accurately speaking immanent or transcendent the former refers to nature in so far as its knowledge can take place in experience in concreto the latter to that connection of objects of experience which transcends all experience this transcendent physiology has for its object either an     internal or an external connection both transcending every possible experience the former is the physiology of nature as a whole or transcendental knowledge of the world the latter refers to the connection of the whole of nature with a being above nature and is therefore transcendental knowledge of god immanent physiology on the contrary considers nature as the sum total of all objects of the senses such therefore as it is given us but only according to conditions a priori under which alone it can be given us it has two kinds of objects only first those of the external senses which constitute together corporeal nature secondly the object of the internal sense the soul and what according to its fundamental principles in general may be called thinking nature the metaphysic of corporeal nature is called physic or because it must contain the principles of an a priori knowledge of nature only     rational physic metaphysic of the thinking nature is called psychology and for the same reason is here to be understood as the rational knowledge only of that nature thus the whole system of metaphysic consists of four principal parts   ontology   rational physiology   rational cosmology   rational theology the second part the physiology of pure reason contains two divisions namely physica rationalis  and phychologia     rationalis the fundamental idea of a philosophy of pure reason prescribes itself this division it is therefore architectonical adequate to its essential aims and not technical only contrived according to any observed similarities and as it were at haphazard for that very reason such a division is unchangeable and of legislative authority there are however a few points which might cause misgivings and weaken our conviction of its legitimate character first of all how can i expect knowledge a priori that is metaphysic of objects so far as they are given to our senses that is a posteriori and how is it possible to know the nature of things according to principles a priori and thus to arrive at a rational physiology our     answer is that we take nothing from experience beyond what is necessary to give us an object either of the external   0 or of the internal sense the former is done by the mere concept of matter impermeable lifeless extension the latter through the concept of a thinking being in the empirical internal representation i think for the rest we ought in the whole metaphysical treatment of these objects to abstain from all empirical principles which to the concept of matter might add any kind of experience for the purpose of forming any judgments on these objects secondly what becomes of empirical psychology which has always maintained its place in metaphysic and from which in our time such great things were expected for throwing light on metaphysic after all hope had been surrendered of achieving anything useful a priori i answer it has its place where the proper empirical study of nature must be placed namely by the side of applied philosophy to which pure philosophy supplies the principles a priori thus being connected but not to be confounded with it empirical psychology therefore must be entirely banished from metaphysic and is excluded from it by its very idea according to the tradition of the schools however we shall probably have to allow to it though as an episode only a small corner in metaphysic and this     from economical motives because as yet it is not so rich as to constitute a study by itself and yet too important to be banished entirely and to be settled in a place where it would find still less affinity than in metaphysic it is therefore a stranger only who has been received for a long time and whom one allows to stay a little longer until he can take up his own abode in a complete system of anthropology the pendant to the empirical doctrine of nature this then is the general idea of metaphysic which as in the beginning more was expected of it than could justly     be demanded fell into general disrepute after these pleasant expectations had proved fallacious the whole course of our critique must have convinced us sufficiently that although metaphysic cannot supply the foundation of religion it must always remain its bulwark and that human reason being dialectical by its very nature cannot do without a science which curbs it and by means of a scientific and perfectly clear selfknowledge prevents the ravages which otherwise this lawless speculative reason would certainly commit both in morals and religion we may be sure therefore that in spite of the coy or contemptuous airs assumed by those who judge a science not according to its nature but according to its accidental   0 effects we shall always return to it as to a beloved one with whom we have quarrelled because reason as essential interests are here at stake cannot rest till it has either established correct views or destroyed those which already exist metaphysic therefore that of nature as well as that of morals and particularly the criticism of our adventurous reason which forms the introduction and preparation of it constitute together what may be termed philosophy in the true sense of the word its only goal is wisdom and the path to it science the only path which if once opened is never grown over again and can never mislead mathematics natural science even the empirical knowledge of men have no doubt a high value as means for the most part to accidental but yet in the end necessary and essential aims of mankind but they have that value only by means of that knowledge of reason based on pure concepts which call it as you may is in reality nothing but metaphysic     for the same reason metaphysic is also the completion of the whole culture of human reason which is indispensable although one may discard its influence as a science with regard to certain objects for it enquires     into reason according to its elements and highest maxims which must form the very foundation of the possibility of some sciences and of the use of all that as mere speculation it serves rather to keep off error than to extend knowledge does not detract from its value but on the contrary confers upon it dignity and authority by that censorship which secures general order and harmony ay the wellbeing of the scientific commonwealth and prevents its persevering and successful labourers from losing sight of the highest aim the general happiness of all mankind     chapter iv the history of pure reason     this title stands here only in order to indicate the place in the system which remains empty for the present and has to be filled hereafter i content myself with casting a cursory glance from a purely transcendental point of view namely that of the nature of pure reason on the labours of former philosophers which presents to my eyes many structures but in ruins only it is very remarkable though naturally it could not well have been otherwise that in the very infancy of philosophy men began where we should like to end namely with studying the knowledge of god and the hope or even the nature of a future world however crude the religious concepts might be which owed their origin to the old customs as remnants of the savage state of humanity this did not prevent the more enlightened classes from devoting themselves to free investigations of these matters and they soon perceived that there could be no better and surer way of pleasing that invisible power which governs the world in order to be happy at least in another world than good conduct thus theology and morals     became the two springs or rather the points of attraction for all abstract enquiries of reason in later times though     it was chiefly the former which gradually drew speculative reason into those labours which afterwards became so celebrated under the name of metaphysic i shall not attempt at present to distinguish the periods of history in which this or that change of metaphysic took place but only draw a rapid sketch of the difference of the ideas which caused the principal revolutions in metaphysic and here i find three aims with which the most important changes on this arena were brought about   with reference to the object of all knowledge of our reason some philosophers were mere sensualists others mere intellectualists epicurus may be regarded as the first among the former plato as the first among the latter the distinction of these two schools subtle as it is dates from the earliest days and has long been maintained those who belong to the former school maintained that reality exists in the objects of the senses alone everything else being imagination those of the second school on the contrary maintained that in the senses there is nothing but illusion and that the true is known by the     understanding only the former did not therefore deny all reality to the concepts of the understanding but that reality was with them logical only with the others it was mystical the former admitted intellectual concepts but accepted sensible objects only the latter required that true objects should be intelligible only and maintained an intuition peculiar to the understanding separated from the senses which in their opinion could only confuse it   with reference to the origin of the pure concepts of reason and whether they are derived from experience or have their origin independent of experience in reason aristotle may be considered as the head of the empiricists     plato as that of the noologists locke who in modern times followed aristotle and leibniz who followed plato though at a sufficient distance from his mystical system have not been able to bring this dispute to any conclusion epicurus at least was far more consistent in his sensual system for he never allowed his syllogisms to go beyond the limits of experience than aristotle and locke more particularly the latter who after having derived all concepts and principles from experience goes so far in their application as to maintain that the existence of god and the immortality of the soul though both lie entirely outside the limits of all possible experience could     be proved with the same evidence as any mathematical proposition   with reference to method if anything is to be called method it must be a procedure according to principles the method at present prevailing in this field of enquiry may be divided into the naturalistic and the scientific the naturalist of pure reason lays it down as his principle that with reference to the highest questions which form the problems of metaphysic more can be achieved by means of common reason without science which he calls sound reason than through speculation this is the same as if we should maintain that the magnitude and distance of the moon can be better determined by the naked eye than by roundabout mathematical calculations this is pure misology reduced to principles and what is the most absurd the neglect of all artificial means is recommended as the best way of enlarging our knowledge as regards those who are naturalists because they know no better they are really not to be blamed they simply follow ordinary reason but they do not boast of their     ignorance as the method which contains the secret how we are to fetch the truth from the bottom of the well of democritus quod sapio satis est mihi non ego curo esse quod arcesilas aerumnosique solones pers is the motto with which they may lead a happy and honoured life without meddling with science or muddling it     as regards those who follow a scientific method they have the choice to proceed either dogmatically or sceptically but at all events systematically when i have mentioned in relation to the former the celebrated wolf and in relation to the other david hume i may for my present purpose leave all the rest unnamed the only path that is still open is the critical if the reader has been kind and patient enough to follow me to the end along this path he may judge for himself whether if he will help as far as in him lies towards making this footpath a highroad it may not be possible to achieve even before the close of the present century what so many centuries have not been able to achieve namely to give complete satisfaction to human reason with regard to those questions which have in all ages exercised its desire for knowledge

supplement ii preface to the second edition      vii whether the treatment of that class of knowledge with which reason is occupied follows the secure method of a science or not can easily be determined by the result if after repeated preparations it comes to a standstill as soon as its real goal is approached or is obliged in order to reach it to retrace its steps again and again and strike into fresh paths again if it is impossible to produce unanimity among those who are engaged in the same work as to the manner in which their common object should be obtained we may be convinced that such a study is far from having attained to the secure method of a science but is groping only in the dark in that case we are conferring a great benefit on reason if we only find out the right method though many things should have to be surrendered as useless which were comprehended in the original aim that had been chosen without sufficient reflection that logic from the earliest times has followed that viii secure method may be seen from the fact that since aristotle it has not had to retrace a single step unless we choose to consider as improvements the removal of some unnecessary subtleties or the clearer definition of its matter both of which refer to the elegance rather than to the solidity of the science it is remarkable also that to the present day it has not been able to make one step in advance so that to all appearance it may be considered as completed and perfect if some modern philosophers thought to enlarge it by introducing psychological chapters on the different faculties of knowledge faculty of imagination wit etc or metaphysical chapters on the origin of knowledge or the different     degrees of certainty according to the difference of objects idealism scepticism etc or lastly anthropological chapters on prejudices their causes and remedies this could only arise from their ignorance of the peculiar nature of logical science we do not enlarge but we only disfigure the sciences if we allow their respective limits to be confounded and the limits of logic are definitely fixed by the fact that it is a science which has nothing to do but fully to exhibit and strictly to prove all formal ix rules of thought whether it be a priori or empirical whatever be its origin or its object and whatever be the impediments accidental or natural which it has to encounter in the human mind that logic should in this respect have been so successful is due entirely to its limitation whereby it has not only the right but the duty to make abstraction of all the objects of knowledge and their differences so that the understanding has to deal with nothing beyond itself and its own forms it was of course far more difficult for reason to enter on the secure method of science when it has to deal not with itself only but also with objects logic therefore as a kind of preparation propaedeutic forms as it were the vestibule of the sciences only and where real knowledge is concerned is presupposed for critical purposes only while the acquisition of knowledge must be sought for in the sciences themselves properly and objectively so called if there is to be in those sciences an element of reason something in them must be known a priori and knowledge may stand in a twofold relation to its object by either simply determining x it and its concept which must be supplied from elsewhere or by making it real also the former is theoretical the latter practical knowledge of reason in both the pure part namely that in which reason determines its object entirely a priori whether it contain much or little must be treated first without mixing up with it what comes from other sources for it is bad economy to spend blindly whatever comes in and not to be able to determine when there is a stoppage which part of the income can bear the expenditure and where reductions must be made mathematics and physics are the two theoretical sciences of reason which have to determine their objects a priori the   0 former quite purely the latter partially so and partially from other sources of knowledge besides reason mathematics from the earliest times to which the history of human reason can reach has followed among that wonderful people of the greeks the safe way of a science but it must not be supposed that it was as easy for mathematics as for logic in which reason is concerned with itself alone to find or rather to make for itself that royal road i believe on the contrary that there was a long period of tentative work chiefly xi still among the egyptians and that the change is to be ascribed to a revolution produced by the happy thought of a single man whose experiment pointed unmistakably to the path that had to be followed and opened and traced out for the most distant times the safe way of a science the history of that intellectual revolution which was far more important than the discovery of the passage round the celebrated cape of good hope and the name of its fortunate author have not been preserved to us but the story preserved by diogenes laertius who names the reputed author of the smallest elements of ordinary geometrical demonstration even of such as according to general opinion do not require to be proved shows at all events that the memory of the revolution produced by the very first traces of the discovery of a new method appeared extremely important to the mathematicians and thus remained unforgotten a new light flashed on the first man who demonstrated the properties of the isosceles triangle  whether his name was thales or any other name for he found that he had not to investigate what xii he saw in the figure or the mere concept of that figure and thus to learn its properties but that he had to produce by construction what he had himself according to concepts a priori placed into that figure and represented in it so that in order to know anything with certainty a priori he must not attribute to that     figure anything beyond what necessarily follows from what he has himself placed into it in accordance with the concept it took a much longer time before physics entered on the high way of science for no more than a century and a half has elapsed since bacons ingenious proposal partly initiated that discovery partly as others were already on the right track gave a new impetus to it — a discovery which like the former can only be explained by a rapid intellectual revolution in what i have to say i shall confine myself to natural science so far as it is founded on empirical principles when galilei let balls of a particular weight which he had determined himself roll down an inclined plain or torricelli made the air carry a weight which he had previously determined to be equal to that of a definite volume of water or when in later times stahl  changed metal into lime and lime again into metals by withdrawing and restoring something a new xiii light flashed on all students of nature they comprehended that reason has insight into that only which she herself produces on her own plan and that she must move forward with the principles of her judgments according to fixed law and compel nature to answer her questions but not let herself be led by nature as it were in leading strings because otherwise accidental observations made on no previously fixed plan will never converge towards a necessary law which is the only thing that reason seeks and requires reason holding in one hand its principles according to which concordant phenomena alone can be admitted as laws of nature and in the other hand the experiment which it has devised according to those principles must approach nature in order to be taught by it but not in the character of a pupil who agrees to everything the master likes but as an appointed judge who compels the witnesses to answer the questions which he himself proposes therefore even the science of physics entirely owes the beneficial revolution in its character to the happy thought that we ought to seek in nature and not xiv     import into it by means of fiction whatever reason must learn from nature and could not know by itself and that we must do this in accordance with what reason itself has originally placed into nature thus only has the study of nature entered on the secure method of a science after having for many centuries done nothing but grope in the dark metaphysic a completely isolated and speculative science of reason which declines all teaching of experience and rests on concepts only not on their application to intuition as mathematics in which reason therefore is meant to be her own pupil has hitherto not been so fortunate as to enter on the secure path of a science although it is older than all other sciences and would remain even if all the rest were swallowed up in the abyss of an alldestroying barbarism in metaphysic reason even if it tries only to understand a priori as it pretends to do those laws which are confirmed by the commonest experience is constantly brought to a standstill and we are obliged again and again to retrace our steps because they do not lead us where we want to go while as to any unanimity among those who are engaged xv in the same work there is so little of it in metaphysic that it has rather become an arena specially destined it would seem for those who wish to exercise themselves in mock fights and where no combatant has as yet succeeded in gaining an inch of ground that he could call permanently his own it cannot be denied therefore that the method of metaphysic has hitherto consisted in groping only and what is the worst in groping among mere concepts what then can be the cause that hitherto no secure method of science has been discovered shall we say that it is impossible then why should nature have visited our reason with restless aspiration to look for it as if it were its most important concern nay more how little should we be justified in trusting our reason if with regard to one of the most important objects we wish to know it not only abandons us but lures us on by vain hopes and in the end betrays us or if hitherto we have only failed to meet with the right path what indications are there to make us hope that if we renew our researches we shall be more successful than others before us     the examples of mathematics and natural science which by one revolution have become what they now are seem xvi to me sufficiently remarkable to induce us to consider what may have been the essential element in that intellectual revolution which has proved so beneficial to them and to make the experiment at least so far as the analogy between them as sciences of reason with metaphysic allows it of imitating them hitherto it has been supposed that all our knowledge must conform to the objects but under that supposition all attempts to establish anything about them a priori by means of concepts and thus to enlarge our knowledge have come to nothing the experiment therefore ought to be made whether we should not succeed better with the problems of metaphysic by assuming that the objects must conform to our mode of cognition for this would better agree with the demanded possibility of an a priori knowledge of them which is to settle something about objects before they are given us we have here the same case as with the first thought of copernicus who not being able to get on in the explanation of the movements of the heavenly bodies as long as he assumed that all the stars turned round the spectator tried whether he could not succeed better by assuming the spectator to be turning round and the stars to be at rest a similar experiment may be tried in metaphysic so far as the intuition of objects is xvii concerned if the intuition had to conform to the constitution of objects i do not see how we could know anything of it a priori but if the object as an object of the senses conforms to the constitution of our faculty of intuition i can very well conceive such a possibility as however i cannot rest in these intuitions if they are to become knowledge but have to refer them as representations to something as their object and must determine that object by them i have the choice of admitting either that the concepts by which i carry out that determination conform to the object being then again in the same perplexity on account of the manner how i can know anything about it a priori or that the objects or what is the same the experience in which alone they are known as given objects must conform to those concepts in the latter case the solution becomes more easy     because experience as a kind of knowledge requires understanding and i must therefore even before objects are given to me presuppose the rules of the understanding as existing within me a priori these rules being expressed in concepts a priori to which all objects of experience must necessarily conform and with which they must agree with regard to objects xviii so far as they are conceived by reason only and conceived as necessary and which can never be given in experience at least in that form in which they are conceived by reason we shall find that the attempts at conceiving them for they must admit of being conceived will furnish afterwards an excellent test of our new method of thought according to which we do not know of things anything a priori except what we ourselves put into them  this experiment succeeds as well as we could desire and promises to metaphysic in its first part which deals with concepts a priori of which the corresponding objects may be given in experience the secure method of a science for by xix thus changing our point of view the possibility of knowledge a priori can well be explained and what is still more the laws which a priori lie at the foundation of nature as the sum total of the objects of experience may be supplied with satisfactory proofs neither of which was possible with the procedure hitherto     adopted but there arises from this deduction of our faculty of knowing a priori as given in the first part of metaphysic a somewhat startling result apparently most detrimental to the objects of metaphysic that have to be treated in the second part namely the impossibility of going with it beyond the frontier of possible experience which is precisely the most essential purpose xx of metaphysical science but here we have exactly the experiment which by disproving the opposite establishes the truth of our first estimate of the knowledge of reason a priori namely that it can refer to phenomena only but must leave the thing by itself as unknown to us though as existing by itself for that which impels us by necessity to go beyond the limits of experience and of all phenomena is the unconditioned which reason postulates in all things by themselves by necessity and by right for everything conditioned so that the series of conditions should thus become complete if then we find that under the supposition of our experience conforming to the objects as things by themselves it is impossible to conceive the unconditioned without contradiction while under the supposition of our representation of things as they are given to us not conforming to them as things by themselves but on the contrary of the objects conforming to our mode of representation that contradiction vanishes and that therefore the unconditioned must not be looked for in things so far as we know them so far as they are given to us but only so far as we do not know them as things by themselves we clearly perceive that what we at first assumed tentatively only is fully confirmed  but after all xxi progress in the field of the supersensuous has thus been denied     to speculative reason it is still open to us to see whether in the practical knowledge of reason data may not be found which enable us to determine that transcendent concept of the unconditioned which is demanded by reason in order thus according to the wish of metaphysic to get beyond the limits of all possible experience by means of our knowledge a priori which is possible to us for practical purposes only in this case speculative reason has at least gained for us room for such an extension of knowledge though it had to leave it empty so that we are not only at liberty but are really called upon to fill it up if we are able by practical data of reason  xxii the very object of the critique of pure speculative reason consists in this attempt at changing the old procedure of metaphysic and imparting to it the secure method of a science after having completely revolutionised it following the example of geometry and physical science that critique is a treatise on the method traité de la méthode not a system of the science itself but it marks out nevertheless the whole plan of that science both with regard to its limits and to its internal organisation for pure speculative reason has this peculiar xxiii advantage that it is able nay bound to measure its own powers according to the different ways in which it chooses its own objects and to completely enumerate the different ways of choosing problems thus tracing a complete outline of a system of metaphysic     this is due to the fact that with regard to the first point nothing can be attributed to objects in knowledge a priori except what the thinking subject takes from within itself while with regard to the second point reason so far as its principles of cognition are concerned forms a separate and independent unity in which as in an organic body every member exists for the sake of all others and all others exist for the sake of the one so that no principle can be safely applied in one relation unless it has been carefully examined in all its relations to the whole employment of pure reason hence too metaphysic has this singular advantage an advantage which cannot be shared by any other science in which reason has to deal with objects for logic deals only with the form of thought in general that if it has once attained by means of this critique to the secure method of a science it can completely comprehend the whole field of knowledge xxiv pertaining to it and thus finish its work and leave it to posterity as a capital that can never be added to because it has only to deal with principles and the limits of their employment which are fixed by those principles themselves and this completeness becomes indeed an obligation if it is to be a fundamental science of which we must be able to say nil actum reputans si quid superesset agendum but it will be asked what kind of treasure is it which we mean to bequeath to posterity in this metaphysic of ours after it has been purified by criticism and thereby brought to a permanent condition after a superficial view of this work it may seem that its advantage is negative only warning us against venturing with speculative reason beyond the limits of experience such is no doubt its primary use but it becomes positive when we perceive that the principles with which speculative reason ventures beyond its limits lead inevitably not to an extension but if carefully considered to a narrowing of the employment of reason because by indefinitely extending the limits of sensibility to which xxv they properly belong they threaten entirely to supplant the pure practical employment of reason hence our critique by limiting sensibility to its proper sphere is no doubt negative but by thus removing an impediment which threatened to narrow or     even entirely to destroy its practical employment it is in reality of positive and of very important use if only we are convinced that there is an absolutely necessary practical use of pure reason the moral use in which reason must inevitably go beyond the limits of sensibility and though not requiring for this purpose the assistance of speculative reason must at all events be assured against its opposition lest it be brought in conflict with itself to deny that this service which is rendered by criticism is a positive advantage would be the same as to deny that the police confers upon us any positive advantage its principal occupation being to prevent violence which citizens have to apprehend from citizens so that each may pursue his vocation in peace and security we had established in the analytical part of our critique the following points — first that space and time are only forms of sensuous intuition therefore conditions of the existence of things as phenomena only secondly that we have no concepts of the understanding and therefore nothing whereby we can arrive at the knowledge of things except in so far as an intuition xxvi corresponding to these concepts can be given and consequently that we cannot have knowledge of any object as a thing by itself but only in so far as it is an object of sensuous intuition that is a phenomenon this proves no doubt that all speculative knowledge of reason is limited to objects of experience but it should be carefully borne in mind that this leaves it perfectly open to us to think the same objects as things by themselves though we cannot know them  for otherwise we should arrive at the absurd conclusion that there is phenomenal appearance without xxvii     something that appears let us suppose that the necessary distinction established in our critique between things as objects of experience and the same things by themselves had not been made in that case the principle of causality and with it the mechanism of nature as determined by it would apply to all things in general as efficient causes i should then not be able to say of one and the same being for instance the human soul that its will is free and at the same time subject to the necessity of nature that is not free without involving myself in a palpable contradiction and this because i had taken the soul in both propositions in one and the same sense namely as a thing in general as something by itself as without previous criticism i could not but take it if however our criticism was true in teaching us to take an object in two senses namely either as a phenomenon or as a thing by itself and if the deduction of our concepts of the understanding was correct and the principle of causality applies to things only if taken in the first sense namely so far as they are objects of experience but not to things if taken in their second sense we can without any contradiction think the same will when phenomenal in visible actions as necessarily xxviii conforming to the law of nature and so far not free and yet on the other hand when belonging to a thing by itself as not subject to that law of nature and therefore free now it is quite true that i may not know my soul as a thing by itself by means of speculative reason still less through empirical observation and consequently may not know freedom either as the quality of a being to which i attribute effects in the world of sense because in order to do this i should have to know such a being as determined in its existence and yet as not determined in time which as i cannot provide my concept with any intuition is impossible this however does not prevent me from thinking freedom that is my representation of it contains at least no contradiction within itself if only our critical distinction of the two modes of representation the sensible and the intelligible and the consequent limitation of the concepts of the pure understanding and of the principles based on them has been properly carried out if then morality necessarily presupposed freedom in the strictest  00 sense as a property of our will producing as a priori data of it practical principles belonging originally to our reason which without freedom would be absolutely impossible while speculative reason had proved that such a freedom cannot even xxix be thought the former supposition namely the moral one would necessarily have to yield to another the opposite of which involves a palpable contradiction so that freedom and with it morality for its opposite contains no contradiction unless freedom is presupposed would have to make room for the mechanism of nature now however as morality requires nothing but that freedom should only not contradict itself and that though unable to understand we should at least be able to think it there being no reason why freedom should interfere with the natural mechanism of the same act if only taken in a different sense the doctrine of morality may well hold its place and the doctrine of nature may hold its place too which would have been impossible if our critique had not previously taught us our inevitable ignorance with regard to things by themselves and limited everything which we are able to know theoretically to mere phenomena the same discussion as to the positive advantage to be derived from the critical principles of pure reason might be repeated with regard to the concept of god and of the simple nature of our soul but for the sake of brevity i shall pass this by i am not allowed therefore even to assume for the sake xxx of the necessary practical employment of my reason god freedom and immortality if i cannot deprive speculative reason of its pretensions to transcendent insights because reason in order to arrive at these must use principles which are intended originally for objects of possible experience only and which if in spite of this they are applied to what cannot be an object of experience really changes this into a phenomenon thus rendering all practical extension of pure reason impossible i had therefore to remove knowledge in order to make room for belief for the dogmatism of metaphysic that is the presumption that it is possible to achieve anything in metaphysic without a previous criticism of pure reason is the source of all that unbelief which is always very dogmatical and wars against all morality  0  if then it may not be too difficult to leave a bequest to posterity in the shape of a systematical metaphysic carried out according to the critique of pure reason such a bequest is not to be considered therefore as of little value whether we regard the improvement which reason receives through the secure method of a science in place of its groundless groping and uncritical vagaries or whether we look to the better employment xxxi of the time of our enquiring youth who if brought up in the ordinary dogmatism are early encouraged to indulge in easy speculations on things of which they know nothing and of which they as little as anybody else will ever understand anything neglecting the acquirement of sound knowledge while bent on the discovery of new metaphysical thoughts and opinions the greatest benefit however will be that such a work will enable us to put an end for ever to all objections to morality and religion according to the socratic method namely by the clearest proof of the ignorance of our opponents some kind of metaphysic has always existed and will always exist and with it a dialectic of pure reason as being natural to it it is therefore the first and most important task of philosophy to deprive metaphysic once for all of its pernicious influence by closing up the sources of its errors in spite of these important changes in the whole field of science and of the losses which speculative reason must suffer in its fancied possessions all general human interests and all the xxxii advantages which the world hitherto derived from the teachings of pure reason remain just the same as before the loss if any affects only the monopoly of the schools and by no means the interests of humanity i appeal to the staunchest dogmatist whether the proof of the continued existence of our soul after death derived from the simplicity of the substance or that of the freedom of the will as opposed to the general mechanism of nature derived from the subtle but inefficient distinction between subjective and objective practical necessity or that of the existence of god derived from the concept of an ens realissimum the contingency of the changeable and the necessity of a prime mover have ever after they had been started by the schools penetrated the public mind or exercised the slightest influence on its convictions  0  if this has not been and in fact could not be so on account of the unfitness of the ordinary understanding for such subtle speculations and if on the contrary with regard to the first point the hope of a future life has chiefly rested on that peculiar character of human nature never to be satisfied by what is merely temporal and insufficient therefore for the character of its whole destination if with regard to the second the clear consciousness of freedom was produced only by the xxxiii clear exhibition of duties in opposition to all the claims of sensuous desires and if lastly with regard to the third the belief in a great and wise author of the world has been supported entirely by the wonderful beauty order and providence everywhere displayed in nature then this possession remains not only undisturbed but acquires even greater authority because the schools have now been taught not to claim for themselves any higher or fuller insight on a point which concerns general human interests than what is equally within the reach of the great mass of men and to confine themselves to the elaboration of these universally comprehensible and for moral purposes quite sufficient proofs the change therefore affects the arrogant pretensions of the schools only which would fain be considered as the only judges and depositaries of such truth as they are no doubt with regard to many other subjects allowing to the public its use only and trying to keep the key to themselves quod mecum nescit solus vult scire videri at the same time full satisfaction is given to the more moderate claims of speculative philosophers xxxiv they still remain the exclusive depositors of a science which benefits the masses without their knowing it namely the critique of reason that critique can never become popular nor does it need to be so because if on the one side the public has no understanding for the finedrawn arguments in support of useful truths it is not troubled on the other by the equally subtle objections it is different with the schools which in the same way as every man who has once risen to the height of speculation must know both the pros and the cons and are bound by means of a careful investigation of the rights of speculative reason to prevent once for all the scandal which sooner or later is sure to be caused even to the  0  masses by the quarrels in which metaphysicians and as such theologians also become involved if ignorant of our critique and by which their doctrine becomes in the end entirely perverted thus and thus alone can the very root be cut off of materialism fatalism atheism freethinking unbelief fanaticism and superstition which may become universally injurious and finally of idealism and scepticism also which are dangerous rather to the schools and can scarcely ever penetrate into the public if xxxv governments think proper ever to interfere with the affairs of the learned it would be far more consistent with their wise regard for science as well as for society to favour the freedom of such a criticism by which alone the labours of reason can be established on a firm footing than to support the ridiculous despotism of the schools which raise a loud clamour of public danger whenever the cobwebs are swept away of which the public has never taken the slightest notice and the loss of which it can therefore never perceive our critique is not opposed to the dogmatical procedure of reason as a science of pure knowledge for this must always be dogmatical that is derive its proof from sure principles a priori but to dogmatism only that is to the presumption that it is possible to make any progress with pure philosophical knowledge consisting of concepts and guided by principles such as reason has long been in the habit of employing without first enquiring in what way and by what right it has come possessed of them dogmatism is therefore the dogmatical procedure of pure reason without a previous criticism of its own powers and our opposition to this is not intended to defend either that loquacious xxxvi shallowness which arrogates to itself the good name of popularity much less that scepticism which makes short work with the whole of metaphysic on the contrary our critique is meant to form a necessary preparation in support of a thoroughly scientific system of metaphysic which must necessarily be carried out dogmatically and strictly systematically so as to satisfy all the demands not so much of the public at large as of the schools this being an indispensable condition as it has undertaken to carry out its work entirely a priori and thus to the complete satisfaction of speculative  0  reason in the execution of this plan as traced out by the critique that is in a future system of metaphysic we shall have to follow in the strict method of the celebrated wolf the greatest of all dogmatic philosophers who first showed and by his example called forth in germany that spirit of thoroughness which is not yet extinct how the secure method of a science could be attained only by a legitimate establishment of principles a clear definition of concepts an attempt at strictness of proof and an avoidance of all bold combinations in concluding he was therefore most eminently qualified to raise metaphysics to the dignity of a science if it had only occurred to him by criticism of the organum namely of pure reason itself first to prepare his field — an omission to be ascribed not so much to himself as to the dogmatical xxxvii spirit of his age and with regard to which the philosophers of his own as well as of all previous times have no right to reproach each other those who reject at the same time the method of wolf and the procedure of the critique of pure reason can have no other aim but to shake off the fetters of science altogether and thus to change work into play conviction into opinion and philosophy into philodoxy with regard to this second edition i have tried as was but fair to do all i could in order to remove as far as possible the difficulties and obscurities which not perhaps without my fault have misled even acute thinkers in judging of my book in the propositions themselves and their proofs likewise in the form and completeness of the whole plan i have found nothing to alter which is due partly to the longcontinued examination to which i had subjected them before submitting them to the public and partly to the nature of the subject itself for pure speculative reason is so constituted that it forms a true organism in which everything is organic the whole being there for the xxxviii sake of every part and every part for the sake of the whole so that the smallest imperfection whether a fault or a deficiency must inevitably betray itself in use i venture to hope that this  0  system will maintain itself unchanged for the future also it is not selfconceit which justifies me in this confidence but the experimental evidence produced by the identity of the result whether we proceed progressively from the smallest elements to the whole of pure reason or retrogressively from the whole for this also is given by the practical objects of reason to every single part the fact being that an attempt at altering even the smallest item produces at once contradictions not only in the system but in human reason in general with regard to the style however much remains to be done and for that purpose i have endeavoured to introduce several improvements into this second edition which are intended to remove first misapprehensions in the æsthetic especially with regard to the concept of time secondly obscurities in the deduction of the concepts of the understanding thirdly a supposed want of sufficient evidence in proving the propositions of the pure understanding fourthly the false interpretation put on the paralogisms with which we charged rational psychology to this point only to the end of the first chapter of transcendental dialectic do the changes xxxix of style and representation  extend and no further time was  0  too short for doing more nor did i with regard to the xl rest meet with any misapprehensions on the part of xli competent and impartial judges these even though i must not name them with that praise which is due to them will easily perceive in the proper place that i have paid careful attention to their remarks xlii  0  these improvements however entail a small loss to the reader it was inevitable without making the book too voluminous to leave out or abridge several passages which though not essential to the completeness of the whole may yet as useful for other purposes be missed by some readers thus only could i gain room for my new and more intelligible representation of the subject which though it changes absolutely nothing with regard to propositions and even to proofs yet deviates so considerably from the former in the method of the treatment here and there that mere additions and interpolations would not have been sufficient this small loss which every reader may easily supply by reference to the first edition will i hope be more than compensated for by the greater clearness of the present i have observed with pleasure and thankfulness in various publications containing either reviews or separate essays that the spirit of thoroughness is not yet dead in germany but has only been silenced for a short time by the clamour of a fashionable and pretentious licence of thought and that the difficulties xliii which beset the thorny path of my critique which is to lead to a truly scientific and as such permanent and therefore most necessary science of pure reason have not discouraged bold and clear heads from mastering my book to these excellent men who so happily blend thorough knowledge with a talent for lucid exposition to which i can lay no claim i leave the task of bringing my in that respect far from perfect work to greater perfection there is no danger of its being refuted though there is of its being misunderstood for my own part i cannot henceforth enter on controversies though i shall carefully attend to all hints whether from friends or opponents in order to utilise them in a future elaboration of the whole system according to the plan traced out in this propaedeutic as during these labours i have advanced pretty far in years this very month into my sixtyfourth year i must be careful in spending my time if i am to carry out my plan of furnishing a metaphysic of nature and a metaphysic of morals in confirmation of the truth of my critique both of speculative and of practical reason and must leave the elucidation of such obscurities as could at first be hardly avoided xliv  0  in such a work and likewise the defence of the whole to those excellent men who have made it their own at single points every philosophical treatise may be pricked for it cannot be armed at all points like a mathematical one while yet the organic structure of the system considered as a whole has not therefore to apprehend the slightest danger few only have that pliability of intellect to take in the whole of a system if it is new still fewer have an inclination for it because they dislike every innovation if we take single passages out of their connection and contrast them with each other it is easy to pick out apparent contradictions particularly in a work written with all the freedom of a running speech in the eyes of those who rely on the judgment of others such contradictions may throw an unfavourable light on any work but they are easily removed if we ourselves have once grasped the idea of the whole and if a theory possesses stability in itself then this action and reaction of praise and blame which at first seemed so dangerous serve only in time to rub off its superficial inequalities nay secure to it in a short time the requisite elegance also if only men of insight impartiality and true popularity will devote themselves to its study königsberg april       0  supplement iii     supplement iv see page   introduction i of the difference between pure and empirical knowledge that all our knowledge begins with experience there can be no doubt for how should the faculty of knowledge be called into activity if not by objects which affect our senses and which either produce representations by themselves or rouse the activity of our understanding to compare to connect or to separate them and thus to convert the raw material of our sensuous impressions into a knowledge of objects which we call experience in respect of time therefore no knowledge within us is antecedent to experience but all knowledge begins with it but although all our knowledge begins with experience it does not follow that it arises from experience for it is quite possible that even our empirical experience is a compound of that which we receive through impressions and of that which our own faculty of knowledge incited only by sensuous impressions supplies from itself a supplement which we do not distinguish from that raw material until long practice has roused our attention and rendered us capable of separating one from the other it is therefore a question which deserves at least closer investigation and cannot be disposed of at first sight whether there exists a knowledge independent of experience and even of all impressions of the senses such knowledge is called a priori and distinguished from empirical knowledge which has its sources a posteriori that is in experience     this term a priori however is not yet definite enough to indicate the full meaning of our question for people are wont to say even with regard to knowledge derived from experience that we have it or might have it a priori because we derive it from experience not immediately but from a general rule which however has itself been derived from experience thus one would say of a person who undermines the foundations of his house that he might have known a priori that it would tumble down that is that he need not wait for the experience of its really tumbling down but still he could not know this entirely a priori because he had first to learn from experience that bodies are heavy and will fall when their supports are taken away we shall therefore in what follows understand by knowledge a priori knowledge which is absolutely independent of all experience and not of this or that experience only opposed to this is empirical knowledge or such as is possible a posteriori only that is by experience knowledge a priori if mixed up with nothing empirical is called pure thus the proposition for example that every change has its cause is a proposition a priori but not pure because change is a concept which can only be derived from experience ii we are in possession of certain cognitions a priori and even the ordinary understanding is never without them all depends here on a criterion by which we may safely distinguish between pure and empirical knowledge now experience teaches us no doubt that something is so or so but not that it cannot be different first then if we have a proposition which is thought together with its necessity we have a judgment a priori and if besides it is not derived from any proposition except such as is itself again considered as necessary we have an absolutely a priori judgment secondly experience never imparts to its judgments true or strict but only assumed or relative universality by means of induction so that we ought always to say so far as we have observed hitherto there is no exception to this     or that rule if therefore a judgment is thought with strict universality so that no exception is admitted as possible it is not derived from experience but valid absolutely a priori empirical universality therefore is only an arbitrary extension of a validity which applies to most cases to one that applies to all as for instance in the proposition all bodies are heavy if on the contrary strict universality is essential to a judgment this always points to a special source of knowledge namely a faculty of knowledge a priori necessity therefore and strict universality are safe criteria of knowledge a priori and are inseparable one from the other as however in the use of these criteria it is sometimes easier to show the contingency than the empirical limitation  of judgments and as it is sometimes more convincing to prove the unlimited universality which we attribute to a judgment than its necessity it is advisable to use both criteria separately each being by itself infallible that there really exist in our knowledge such necessary and in the strictest sense universal and therefore pure judgments a priori is easy to show if we want a scientific example we have only to look to any of the propositions of mathematics if we want one from the sphere of the ordinary understanding such a proposition as that each change must have a cause will answer the purpose nay in the latter case even the concept of cause contains so clearly the concept of the necessity of its connection with an effect and of the strict universality of the rule that it would be destroyed altogether if we attempted to derive it as hume does from the frequent concomitancy of that which happens with that which precedes and from a habit arising thence therefore from a purely subjective necessity of connecting representations it is possible even without having recourse to such examples in proof of the reality of pure propositions a priori within our knowledge to prove their indispensability for the possibility of experience itself thus proving it a priori for whence should experience take its certainty if all the rules which it follows were always again and again empirical     and therefore contingent and hardly fit to serve as first principles for the present however we may be satisfied for having shown the pure employment of the faculty of our knowledge as a matter of fact with the criteria of it not only in judgments however but even in certain concepts can we show their origin a priori take away for example from the concept of a body as supplied by experience everything that is empirical one by one such as colour hardness or softness weight and even impenetrability and there still remains the space which the body now entirely vanished occupied that you cannot take away and in the same manner if you remove from your empirical concept of any object corporeal or incorporeal all properties which experience has taught you you cannot take away from it that property by which you conceive it as a substance or inherent in a substance although such a concept contains more determinations than that of an object in general convinced therefore by the necessity with which that concept forces itself upon you you will have to admit that it has its seat in your faculty of knowledge a priori     supplement v see page   empirical judgments as such are all synthetical for it would be absurd to found an analytical judgment on experience because in order to form such a judgment i need not at all step out of my concept or appeal to the testimony of experience that a body is extended is a proposition perfectly certain a priori and not an empirical judgment for before i call in experience i am already in possession of all the conditions of my judgment in the concept of body itself i have only to draw out from it according to the principle of contradiction the required predicate and i thus become conscious at the same time of the necessity of the judgment which experience could never teach me but though i do not include the predicate of gravity in the general concept of body that concept nevertheless indicates an object of experience through one of its parts so that i may add other parts also of the same experience besides those which belonged to the former concept i may first by an analytical process realise the concept of body through the predicates of extension impermeability form etc all of which are contained in it afterwards i expand my knowledge and looking back to the experience from which my concept of body was abstracted i find gravity always connected with the beforementioned predicates and therefore i add it synthetically to that concept as a predicate it is therefore experience on which the possibility of the synthesis of the predicate of gravity with the concept of body is founded because both concepts though neither of them is contained in the other belong to each other though accidentally only as parts of a whole namely of experience which is itself a synthetical connection of intuitions   0 supplement vi see page   v in all theoretical sciences of reason synthetical judgments a priori are contained as principles   all mathematical judgments are synthetical this proposition though incontestably certain and very important to us for the future seems to have hitherto escaped the observation of those who are engaged in the anatomy of human reason nay to be directly opposed to all their conjectures for as it was found that all mathematical conclusions proceed according to the principle of contradiction which is required by the nature of all apodictic certainty it was supposed that the fundamental principles of mathematics also rested on the authority of the same principle of contradiction this however was a mistake for though a synthetical proposition may be understood according to the principle of contradiction this can only be if another synthetical proposition is presupposed from which the latter is deduced but never by itself first of all we ought to observe that mathematical propositions properly so called are always judgments a priori and not empirical because they carry along with them necessity which can never be deduced from experience if people should object to this i am quite willing to confine my statement to pure mathematics the very concept of which implies that it does not contain empirical but only pure knowledge a priori at first sight one might suppose indeed that the proposition          is merely analytical following according to the principle of contradiction from the concept of a sum of   and       but if we look more closely we shall find that the concept of the sum of   and   contains nothing beyond the union of both sums into one whereby nothing is told us as to what this single number may be which combines both we by no means arrive at a concept of twelve by thinking that union of seven and five and we may analyse our concept of such a possible sum as long as we will still we shall never discover in it the concept of twelve we must go beyond these concepts and call in the assistance of the intuition corresponding to one of the two for instance our five fingers or as segner does in his arithmetic five points and so by degrees add the units of the five given in intuition to the concept of the seven for i first take the number   and taking the intuition of the fingers of my hand in order to form with it the concept of the   i gradually add the units which i before took together to make up the number   by means of the image of my hand to the number   and i thus see the number    arising before me that   should be added to   was no doubt implied in my concept of a sum      but not that that sum should be equal to    an arithmetical proposition is therefore always synthetical which is seen more easily still by taking larger numbers where we clearly perceive that turn and twist our conceptions as we may we could never by means of the mere analysis of our concepts and without the help of intuition arrive at the sum that is wanted nor is any proposition of pure geometry analytical that the straight line between two points is the shortest is a synthetical proposition for my concept of straight contains nothing of magnitude quantity but a quality only the concept of the shortest is therefore purely adventitious and cannot be deduced from the concept of the straight line by any analysis whatsoever the aid of intuition therefore must be called in by which alone the synthesis is possible it is true that some few propositions presupposed by the geometrician are really analytical and depend on the principle of contradiction but then they serve only like identical propositions to form the chain of the method and not as principles such are the propositions a  a the whole is equal to itself or     a  b  a that the whole is greater than its part and even these though they are valid according to mere concepts are only admitted in mathematics because they can be represented in intuition  what often makes us believe that the predicate of such apodictic judgments is contained in our concept and the judgment therefore analytical is merely the ambiguous character of the expression we are told that we ought to join in thought a certain predicate to a given concept and this necessity is inherent in the concepts themselves but the question is not what we ought to join to the given concept but what we really think in it though confusedly only and then it becomes clear that the predicate is no doubt inherent in those concepts by necessity not however as thought in the concept itself but by means of an intuition which must be added to the concept   natural science physica contains synthetical judgments a priori as principles i shall adduce as examples a few propositions only such as that in all changes of the material world the quantity of matter always remains unchanged or that in all communication of motion action and reaction must always equal each other it is clear not only that both convey necessity and that therefore their origin is a priori but also that they are synthetical propositions for in the concept of matter i do not conceive its permanency but only its presence in the space which it fills i therefore go beyond the concept of matter in order to join something to it a priori which i did not before conceive in it the proposition is therefore not analytical but synthetical and yet a priori and the same applies to the other propositions of the pure part of natural science   metaphysic even if we look upon it as hitherto a tentative science only which however is indispensable to us owing to the very nature of human reason is meant to contain synthetical knowledge a priori its object is not at all merely to analyse such concepts as we make to ourselves of things a priori and thus to explain them analytically but to expand our knowledge a priori     this we can only do by means of concepts which add something to a given concept that was not contained in it nay we even attempt by means of synthetical judgments a priori to go so far beyond a given concept that experience itself cannot follow us as for instance in the proposition that the world must have a first beginning thus according at least to its intentions metaphysic consists merely of synthetical propositions a priori vi the general problem of pure reason much is gained if we are able to bring a number of investigations under the formula of one single problem for we thus not only facilitate our own work by defining it accurately but enable also everybody else who likes to examine it to form a judgment whether we have really done justice to our purpose or not now the real problem of pure reason is contained in the question how are synthetical judgments a priori possible that metaphysic has hitherto remained in so vacillating a state of ignorance and contradiction is entirely due to people not having thought sooner of this problem or perhaps even of a distinction between analytical and synthetical judgments the solution of this problem or a sufficient proof that a possibility which is to be explained does in reality not exist at all is the question of life or death to metaphysic david hume who among all philosophers approached nearest to that problem though he was far from conceiving it with sufficient definiteness and universality confining his attention only to the synthetical proposition of the connection of an effect with its causes principium causalitatis arrived at the conclusion that such a proposition a priori is entirely impossible according to his conclusions everything which we call metaphysic would turn out to be a mere delusion of reason fancying that it knows by itself what in reality is only borrowed from experience and has assumed by mere habit the appearance of necessity if he had grasped our problem in all its universality he would never have thought of an assertion which     destroys all pure philosophy because he would have perceived that according to his argument no pure mathematical science was possible either on account of its certainly containing synthetical propositions a priori and from such an assertion his good sense would probably have saved him on the solution of our problem depends at the same time the possibility of the pure employment of reason in establishing and carrying out all sciences which contain a theoretical knowledge a priori of objects ie the answer to the questions how is pure mathematical science possible how is pure natural science possible as these sciences really exist it is quite proper to ask how they are possible for that they must be possible is proved by their reality  but as to metaphysic the bad progress which it has hitherto made and the impossibility of asserting of any of the metaphysical systems yet brought forward that it really exists so far as its essential aim is concerned must fill every one with doubts as to its possibility yet in a certain sense this kind of knowledge also must be looked upon as given and though not as a science yet as a natural disposition metaphysica naturalis metaphysic is real for human reason without being moved merely by the conceit of omniscience advances irresistibly and urged on by its own need to questions such as cannot be answered by any empirical employment of reason or by principles thence derived so that we may really say that all men as soon as their reason became ripe for speculation have at all times possessed some kind of metaphysic and will always continue to possess it and now it will also have to answer the question     how is metaphysic possible as a natural disposition that is how does the nature of universal human reason give rise to questions which pure reason proposes to itself and which it is urged on by its own need to answer as well as it can as however all attempts which have hitherto been made at answering these natural questions for instance whether the world has a beginning or exists from all eternity have always led to inevitable contradictions we cannot rest satisfied with the mere natural disposition to metaphysic that is with the pure faculty of reason itself from which some kind of metaphysic whatever it may be always arises but it must be possible to arrive with it at some certainty as to our either knowing or not knowing its objects that is we must either decide that we can judge of the objects of these questions or of the power or want of power of reason in deciding anything upon them — therefore that we can either enlarge our pure reason with certainty or that we have to impose on it fixed and firm limits this last question which arises out of the former more general problem would properly assume this form how is metaphysic possible as a science the critique of reason leads therefore necessarily to true science while its dogmatical use without criticism lands us in groundless assertions to which others equally specious can always be opposed that is in scepticism nor need this science be very formidable by its great prolixity for it has not to deal with the objects of reason the variety of which is infinite but with reason only and with problems suggested by reason and placed before it not by the nature of things which are different from it but by its own nature so that if reason has only first completely understood its own power with reference to objects given to it in experience it will have no difficulty in determining completely and safely the extent and limits of its attempted application beyond the limits of all experience we may and must therefore regard all attempts which have hitherto been made at building up a metaphysic dogmatically as nonavenu for the mere analysis of the concepts that dwell in our reason a priori which has been attempted in one or other     of those metaphysical systems is by no means the aim but only a preparation for true metaphysic namely the answer to the question how we can enlarge our knowledge a priori synthetically nay it is utterly useless for that purpose because it only shows what is contained in those concepts but not by what process a priori we arrive at them in order thus to determine the validity of their employment with reference to all objects of knowledge in general nor does it require much selfdenial to give up these pretensions considering that the undeniable and in the dogmatic procedure inevitable contradictions of reason with itself have long deprived every system of metaphysic of all authority more firmness will be required in order not to be deterred by difficulties from within and resistance from without from trying to advance a science indispensable to human reason a science of which we may lop off every branch but will never be able to destroy the root by a treatment entirely opposed to all former treatments which promises at last to ensure the successful and fruitful growth of metaphysical science     supplement vii see page  0 still less ought we to except here a criticism on the books and systems treating of pure reason but only on the faculty of pure reason itself it is only if we are in possession of this that we possess a safe criterion for estimating the philosophical value of old and new works on this subject otherwise an unqualified historian and judge does nothing but criticise the groundless assertions of others by means of his own which are equally groundless     supplement viii see page  0   space is represented as an infinite given quantity now it is quite true that every concept is to be thought as a representation which is contained in an infinite number of different possible representations as their common characteristic and therefore comprehends them but no concept as such can be thought as if it contained in itself an infinite number of representations nevertheless space is so thought for all parts of infinite space exist simultaneously consequently the original representation of space is an intuition a priori and not a concept §   transcendental exposition of the concept of space i understand by transcendental exposition erörterung the explanation of a concept as of a principle by which the possibility of other synthetical cognitions a priori can be understood for this purpose it is necessary   that such cognitions really do flow from the given concept   that they are possible only under the presupposition of a given mode of explanation of such concept geometry is a science which determines the properties of space synthetically and yet a priori what then must be the representation of space to render such a knowledge of it possible it must be originally intuitive for it is impossible from a mere concept to deduce propositions which go beyond that concept as we do in geometry introduction v see suppl vi that intuition however must be a priori that is it must exist within us before any perception of the object and must therefore be     pure not empirical intuition for all geometrical propositions are apodictic that is connected with the consciousness of their necessity as for instance the proposition that space has only three dimensions and such propositions cannot be empirical judgments nor conclusions from them introduction ii see suppl iv ii how then can an external intuition dwell in the mind anterior to the objects themselves and in which the concept of objects can be determined a priori evidently not otherwise than so far as it has its seat in the subject only as the formal condition under which the subject is affected by the objects and thereby is receiving an immediate representation that is intuition of them therefore as a form of the external sense in general it is therefore by our explanation only that the possibility of geometry as a synthetical science a priori becomes intelligible every other explanation which fails to account for this possibility can best be distinguished from our own by that criterion although it may seem to have some similarity with it   0 supplement ix see page    with the exception of space there is no other subjective representation referring to something external that could be called a priori objective for from none of them can we derive synthetical propositions a priori as we can from the intuition in space §   see suppl viii strictly speaking therefore they can claim no ideality at all though they agree with the representation of space in this that they belong only to the subjective nature of sensibility for instance of sight of hearing and feeling through the sensations of colours sounds and heat all these however being sensations only and not intuitions do not help us by themselves to know any object least of all a priori     supplement x see page    §   transcendental exposition of the concept of time i can here refer to no iii p    where for the sake of brevity i have placed what is properly transcendental under the head of metaphysical exposition here i only add that the concept of change and with it the concept of motion as change of place is possible only through and in the representation of time and that if this representation were not intuitive internal a priori no concept whatever it be could make us understand the possibility of a change that is of a connection of contradictorily opposed predicates for instance the being and notbeing of one and the same thing in one and the same place in one and the same object it is only in time that both contradictorily opposed determinations can be met with in the same object that is one after the other our concept of time therefore exhibits the possibility of as many synthetical cognitions a priori as are found in the general doctrine of motion which is very rich in them     supplement xi see page    ii as a confirmation of this theory of the ideality both of the external and of the internal sense and therefore of all objects of the senses as mere phenomena we may particularly remark that everything in our knowledge which belongs to intuition excluding therefore the feelings of pain and pleasure and the will which are no knowledge at all contains nothing but mere relations namely of the places in an intuition extension change of places motion and laws according to which that change is determined moving forces nothing is told us thereby as to what is present in the place or what besides the change of place is active in the things a thing by itself however cannot be known by mere relations and we may therefore fairly conclude that as the external sense gives us nothing but representations of relations that sense can contain in its representation only the relation of an object to the subject and not what is inside the object by itself the same applies to internal intuition not only do the representations of the external senses constitute its proper material with which we fill our mind but time in which these representations are placed and which precedes even our consciousness of them in experience nay forms the formal condition of the manner in which we place them in the mind contains itself relations of succession coexistence and that which must be coexistent with succession namely the permanent now that which as a representation can precede every act of thinking something is the intuition and if it contains nothing but relations then the form of intuition as this represents nothing except what is being placed in the mind it can itself be the manner only in which the mind through its own activity that is     by this placing of its representation is affected by itself in other words an internal sense with respect to its form whatever is represented by a sense is so far always phenomenal and we should therefore have either to admit no internal sense at all or the subject which is its object could be represented by it as phenomenal only and not as it might judge of itself if its intuition were spontaneous only that is if it were intellectual the difficulty here lies wholly in this how a subject can have an internal intuition of itself but this difficulty is common to every theory the consciousness of self apperception is the simple representation of the ego and if by it alone all the manifold representations in the subject were given spontaneously the inner intuition would be intellectual in man this consciousness requires internal perception of the manifold which is previously given in the subject and the manner in which this is given in the mind without spontaneity must on account of this difference be called sensibility if the faculty of selfconsciousness is to seek for that is to apprehend what lies in the mind it must affect the mind and can thus only produce an intuition of itself the form of this which lay antecedently in the mind determines the manner in which the manifold exists together in the mind namely in the representation of time the intuition of self therefore is not as if it could represent itself immediately and as spontaneously and independently active but according to the manner in which it is internally affected consequently as it appears to itself not as it is iii if i say that the intuition of external objects and the selfintuition of the mind represent both viz the objects and the mind in space and time as they affect our senses that is as they appear i do not mean that these objects are mere illusion for the objects as phenomena nay even the properties which we ascribe to them are always looked upon as something really given and all we do is that as their quality depends only on the manner of intuition on the part of the subject in relation to a given object we distinguish the object as phenomenon from itself as an object by itself thus if i assert that the quality of space and time according to which as a condition of their existence i accept both external objects and my own soul lies in my manner     of intuition and not in these objects by themselves i do not mean to say that bodies seem only to exist outside me or that my soul seems only to be given in my selfconsciousness it would be my own fault if i changed that which i ought to count as phenomenal into mere illusion  this cannot happen however according to our principle of the ideality of all sensuous intuitions on the contrary it is only when we attribute objective reality to those forms of intuition that everything is changed inevitably into mere illusion for if we take space and time as properties that ought to exist as possible in things by themselves and then survey the absurdities in which we should be involved in having to admit that two infinite things which are not substances nor something inherent in substances but nevertheless must be something existing nay the necessary condition of the existence of all things would remain even if all existing things were removed we really cannot blame the good bishop berkeley for degrading bodies to mere illusion nay it would follow that even our own existence which would thus be made dependent on the independent reality of such a nonentity as time must become a mere illusion an absurdity which hitherto no one has been guilty of iv in natural theology where we think of an object which not only can never be an object of intuition to us but which even to itself can never be an object of sensuous intuition great care is taken to remove all conditions of space and time from its intuition     for all its knowledge must be intuitive and not thought which always involves limitation but how are we justified in doing this when we have first made space and time forms of things by themselves such as would remain as conditions of the existence of things a priori even if the things themselves had been removed if conditions of all existence they would also be conditions of the existence of god if we do not wish to change space and time into objective forms of all things nothing remains but to accept them as subjective forms of our external as well as internal intuition which is called sensuous for the very reason that it is not originally spontaneous that is such that it could itself give us the existence of the objects of intuition such an intuition so far as we can understand can belong to the first being only but dependent on the existence of objects and therefore possible only if the faculty of representation in the subject is affected by them it is not necessary moreover that we should limit this intuition in space and time to the sensibility of man it is quite possible that all finite thinking beings must necessarily agree with us on this point though we cannot decide this on account of this universal character however it does not cease to be sensibility for it always is and remains derivative intuitus derivativus not original intuitus originarius and therefore not intellectual intuition for the reason mentioned before the latter intuition seems only to belong to the first being and never to one which is dependent both in its existence and its intuition which intuition determines its existence with reference to given objects this latter remark however must only be taken as an illustration of our æsthetic theory and not as a proof conclusion of the transcendental æsthetic here then we have one of the requisites for the solution of the general problem of transcendental philosophy how are synthetical propositions a priori possible namely pure intuitions a priori space and time in them we find if in a judgment a priori     we want to go beyond a given concept that which can be discovered a priori not in the concept but in the intuition corresponding to it and can be connected with it synthetically for this very reason however such judgments can never go beyond the objects of the senses but are valid only for objects of possible experience     supplement xii see page    §    this table of categories suggests some interesting considerations which possibly may have important consequences with regard to the scientific form of all knowledge of reason for it is clear that such a table will be extremely useful nay indispensable in the theoretical part of philosophy in order to trace the complete plan of a whole science so far as it rests on concepts a priori and to divide it systematically according to fixed principles because that table contains all elementary concepts of the understanding in their completeness nay even the form of a system of them in the human understanding and indicates therefore all the momenta of a projected speculative science nay even their order of this i have given an example elsewhere  here follow some of the considerations the first is that this table which contains four classes of the concepts of the understanding may in the first instance be divided into two sections the former of which refers to objects of intuition pure as well as empirical the latter to the existence of those objects either in their relation to each other or to the understanding the first section i shall call that of the mathematical the second that of the dynamical categories the first section has no correlates which are met with in the second section only must not this difference have some ground in the nature of the understanding our second remark is that in every class there is the same number of categories namely three which again makes us ponder     because generally all division a priori by means of concepts must be dichotomy it should be remarked also that the third category always arises from the combination of the second with the first thus totality is nothing but plurality considered as unity limitation nothing but reality connected with negation community is the casuality of a substance as determining another reciprocally lastly necessity the existence which is given by possibility itself it must not be supposed however that therefore the third category is only a derivative and not a primary concept of the pure understanding for the joining of the first and second concepts in order to produce the third requires an independent act of the understanding which is not identical with the act that produces the first and second concepts thus the concept of a number which belongs to the category of totality is not always possible when we have the concepts of plurality and unity for instance in the concept of the infinite nor can we understand by simply combining the concept of a cause and that of a substance the influence that is how a substance can become the cause of something in another substance this shows that a separate act of the understanding is here required and the same applies to all the rest third observation with regard to one category namely that of community which is found in the third class its accordance with the form of a disjunctive judgment which corresponds to it in the table of logical functions is not so evident as elsewhere in order to become quite certain of that accordance we must remark that in all disjunctive judgments their sphere that is all that is contained in them is represented as a whole divided into parts the subordinate concepts and that as one of them cannot be contained under the other they are conceived as coordinate not as subordinate determining each other not in one direction only as in a series but reciprocally as in an aggregate if one member of the division is given all the rest are excluded and vice versa a similar connection is conceived in a whole of things in which one as effect is not subordinated to another as the cause of its existence but is coordinated with it simultaneously and reciprocally     as cause of the determination of the other as for instance in a body of which the parts reciprocally attract and repel each other this is a kind of connection totally different from that which exists in a mere relation of cause to effect of ground to consequence for here the consequence does not reciprocally determine the ground again nor as in the case of the creator and the creation constitute with it a whole the process of the understanding in representing to itself the sphere of a divided concept is the same as that by which it thinks a thing as divisible and in the same manner in which in the former the members of a division exclude each other and are yet connected in one sphere the understanding represents to itself the parts of the latter as existing as substances each independent of the rest and yet united in a whole §    in the transcendental philosophy of the ancients there is another chapter containing concepts of the understanding which though they are not counted among the categories are yet considered by them as concepts a priori of objects if so they would increase the number of the categories which cannot be they are set forth in the famous proposition of the schoolmen quodlibet ens est unum verum bonum now although the inferences to be drawn from this principle yielding nothing but tautological propositions were very meagre so that modern metaphysicians mention it almost by courtesy only a thought which has maintained itself so long however empty it may seem deserves an investigation with regard to its origin nay leads us to suspect that it may have its foundation in some rule of the understanding which as often happens has only been wrongly interpreted what are supposed to be transcendental predicates of things are nothing but logical requirements and criteria of all knowledge of things in general whereby that knowledge is founded on the categories of quantity namely unity plurality and totality only instead of taking them as materially belonging to the possibility of things by themselves   0 they the predicates or rather those who employed them used them in fact in their formal meaning only as forming a logical requisite for every kind of knowledge and yet incautiously made these criteria of thought to be properties of the things by themselves in every cognition of an object there is unity of concept which may be called qualitative unity so far as we think by it only the unity in the comprehension of the manifold material of our knowledge as for instance the unity of the subject in a play or a speech or a fable secondly there is truth in respect to the deductions from it the more true deductions can be made from a given concept the more criteria are there of its objective reality this might be called the qualitative plurality of criteria which belong to a concept as their common ground but are not conceived in it as quantity thirdly there is completeness which consists in this that the plurality together leads back to the unity of the concept according completely with this and with no other concept which may be called the qualitative completeness totality this shows that these logical criteria of the possibility of knowledge in general do nothing but change the three categories of quantity in which the unity in the production of the quantum must throughout be taken as homogeneous for the purpose of connecting heterogeneous elements of knowledge also in one consciousness by means of the quality of the cognition as the principle of the connection thus the criterion of the possibility of a concept but not of its object is the definition of it in which the unity of the concept the truth of all that may be immediately deduced from it and lastly the completeness of what has been deduced from it supply all that is necessary for the constitution of the whole concept in the same manner the criterion of an hypothesis consists first in the intelligibility of the ground which has been admitted for the sake of explanation or of its unity without any auxiliary hypothesis secondly in the truth of the consequences to be deduced from it their accordance with themselves and with experience and lastly in the completeness of the ground admitted for the explanation of these consequences which point back to neither more nor less than what was admitted in the hypothesis and agree in giving us again analytically a posteriori what had     been thought synthetically a priori the concepts of unity truth and perfection therefore do not supplement the transcendental table of the categories as if it were imperfect but they serve only after the relation of these concepts to objects has been entirely set aside to bring their employment under general logical rules for the agreement of knowledge with itself     supplement xiii see page    locke for want of this reflection and because he met with pure concepts of the understanding in experience derived them also from experience and yet acted so inconsistently that he attempted to use them for knowledge which far exceeds all limits of experience david hume saw that in order to be able to do this these concepts ought to have their origin a priori but as he could not explain how it was possible that the understanding should be constrained to think concepts which by themselves are not united in the understanding as necessarily united in the object and never thought that possibly the understanding might itself through these concepts be the author of that experience in which its objects are found he was driven by necessity to derive them from experience namely from a subjective necessity produced by frequent association in experience which at last is wrongly supposed to be objective that is from habit he acted however very consistently by declaring it to be impossible to go with these concepts and with the principles arising from them beyond the limits of experience this empirical deduction which was adopted by both philosophers cannot be reconciled with the reality of our scientific knowledge a priori namely pure mathematics and general natural science and is therefore refuted by facts the former of these two celebrated men opened a wide door to fantastic extravagance because reason if it has once established such pretensions can no longer be checked by vague praises of moderation the other thinking that he had once discovered so general an illusion of our faculty of knowledge which had formerly been accepted as reason gave himself over entirely to scepticism we now intend to make the experiment whether it is not possible to conduct     reason safely between these two rocks to assign to her definite limits and yet to keep open for her the proper field for all her activities i shall merely premise an explanation of what i mean by the categories they are concepts of an object in general by which its intuition is regarded as determined with reference to one of the logical functions in judgments thus the function of the categorical judgment was that of the relation of the subject to the predicate for instance all bodies are divisible here however with reference to the pure logical employment of the understanding it remained undetermined to which of the two concepts the function of the subject or the predicate was to be assigned for we could also say some divisible is body but by bringing the concept of body under the category of substance it is determined that its empirical intuition in experience must always be considered as subject and never as predicate only the same applies to all other categories     supplement xiv see page    of the deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding second section transcendental deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding §    of the possibility of connecting conjunctio in general the manifold of representations may be given in an intuition which is purely sensuous that is nothing but receptivity and the form of that intuition may lie a priori in our faculty of representation without being anything but the manner in which a subject is affected but the connection conjunctio of anything manifold can never enter into us through the senses and cannot be contained therefore already in the pure form of sensuous intuition for it is a spontaneous act of the power of representation and as in order to distinguish this from sensibility we must call it understanding we see that all connecting whether we are conscious of it or not and whether we connect the manifold of intuition or several concepts together and again whether that intuition be sensuous or not sensuous is an act of the understanding this act we shall call by the general name of synthesis in order to show that we cannot represent to ourselves anything as connected in the object without having previously connected it ourselves and that of all representations connection is the only one which cannot be given through the objects but must be carried out by     the subject itself because it is an act of its spontaneity it can be easily perceived that this act must be originally one and the same for every kind of connection and that its dissolution that is the analysis which seems to be its opposite does always presuppose it for where the understanding has not previously connected there is nothing for it to disconnect because as connected it could only be given by the understanding to the faculty of representation but the concept of connection includes besides the concept of the manifold and the synthesis of it the concept of the unity of the manifold also connection is representation of the synthetical unity of the manifold  the representation of that unity cannot therefore be the result of the connection on the contrary the concept of the connection becomes first possible by the representation of unity being added to the representation of the manifold and this unity which precedes a priori all concepts of connection must not be mistaken for that category of unity of which we spoke on p    for all categories depend on logical functions in judgments and in these we have already connection and therefore unity of given concepts the category therefore presupposes connection and we must consequently look still higher for this unity as qualitative see suppl xii §    in that namely which itself contains the ground for the unity of different concepts in judgments that is the ground for the very possibility of the understanding even in its logical employment §    the original synthetical unity of apperception it must be possible that the i think should accompany all my representations for otherwise something would be represented     within me that could not be thought in other words the representation would either be impossible or nothing at least so far as i am concerned that representation which can be given before all thought is called intuition and all the manifold of intuition has therefore a necessary relation to the i think in the same subject in which that manifold of intuition is found that representation however that i think is an act of spontaneity that is it cannot be considered as belonging to sensibility i call it pure apperception in order to distinguish it from empirical apperception or original apperception also because it is that selfconsciousness which by producing the representation i think which must accompany all others and is one and the same in every act of consciousness cannot itself be accompanied by any other i also call the unity of it the transcendental unity of selfconsciousness in order to indicate that it contains the possibility of knowledge a priori for the manifold representations given in any intuition would not all be my representations if they did not all belong to one selfconsciousness what i mean is that as my representations even though i am not conscious of them as such they must be in accordance with that condition under which alone they can stand together in one common selfconsciousness because otherwise they would not all belong to me from this original connection the following important conclusions can be deduced the unbroken identity of apperception of the manifold that is given in intuition contains a synthesis of representations and is possible only through the consciousness of that synthesis the empirical consciousness which accompanies various representations is itself various and disunited and without reference to the identity of the subject such a relation takes place not by my simply accompanying every relation with consciousness but by my adding one to the other and being conscious of that act of adding that is of that synthesis only because i am able to connect the manifold of given representations in one consciousness is it possible for me to represent to myself the identity of the consciousness in these representations that is only under the supposition     of some synthetical unity of apperception does the analytical unity of apperception become possible  the thought that the representations given in intuition belong all of them to me is therefore the same as that i connect them in one selfconsciousness or am able at least to do so and though this is not yet the consciousness of the synthesis of representations it nevertheless presupposes the possibility of this synthesis in other words it is only because i am able to comprehend the manifold of representations in one consciousness that i call them altogether my representations for otherwise i should have as manifold and various a self as i have representations of which i am conscious the synthetical unity of the manifold of intuitions as given a priori is therefore the ground also of the identity of that apperception itself which precedes a priori all definite thought connection however does never lie in the objects and cannot be borrowed from them by perception and thus be taken into the understanding but it is always an act of the understanding which itself is nothing but a faculty of connecting a priori and of bringing the manifold of given representations under the unity of apperception which is in fact the highest principle of all human knowledge it is true no doubt that this principle of the necessary unity of apperception is itself identical and therefore an analytical proposition but it shows nevertheless the necessity of a synthesis of the     manifold which is given in intuition without which synthesis it would be impossible to think the unbroken identity of selfconsciousness for through the ego as a simple representation nothing manifold is given in the intuition which is different from that it can be given only and then by connection be thought in one consciousness an understanding in which by its selfconsciousness all the manifold would be given at the same time would possess intuition our understanding can do nothing but think and must seek for its intuition in the senses i am conscious therefore of the identical self with respect to the manifold of the representations which are given to me in an intuition because i call them altogether my representations as constituting one this means that i am conscious of a necessary synthesis of them a priori which is called the original synthetical unity of apperception under which all representations given to me must stand but have to be brought there first by means of a synthesis §    the principle of the synthetical unity of apperception is the highest principle of all employment of the understanding the highest principle of the possibility of all intuition in relation to sensibility was according to the transcendental æsthetic that all the manifold in it should be subject to the formal conditions of space and time the highest principle of the same possibility in relation to the understanding is that all the manifold in intuition must be subject to the conditions of the original synthetical unity of apperception  all the manifold representations of intuition so far as they     are given us are subject to the former so far as they must admit of being connected in one consciousness to the latter and without that nothing can be thought or known by them because the given representations would not share the act of apperception i think in common and could not be comprehended in one selfconsciousness the understanding in its most general sense is the faculty of cognitions these consist in a definite relation of given representations to an object and an object is that in the concept of which the manifold of a given intuition is connected all such connection of representations requires of course the unity of the consciousness in their synthesis consequently the unity of consciousness is that which alone constitutes the relation of representations to an object that is their objective validity and consequently their becoming cognitions so that the very possibility of the understanding depends on it the first pure cognition of the understanding therefore on which all the rest of its employment is founded and which at the same time is entirely independent of all conditions of sensuous intuition is this very principle of the original synthetical unity of apperception space the mere form of external sensuous intuition is not yet cognition it only supplies the manifold of intuition a priori for a possible cognition in order to know anything in space for instance a line i must draw it and produce synthetically a certain connection of the manifold that is given so that the unity of that act is at the same time the unity of the consciousness in the concept of a line and so that an object a determinate space is then only known for the first time the synthetical unity of consciousness is therefore an objective condition of all knowledge a condition not necessary for myself only in order to know an object but one to which each intuition must be subject in order to become an object for me because the manifold could not become connected in one consciousness in any other way and without such a synthesis no doubt that proposition as i said before is itself analytical though it makes synthetical unity a condition of all thought for it really says no more than that all my representations in any given   0 intuition must be subject to the condition under which alone i can ascribe them as my representations to the identical self and therefore comprehend them as synthetically connected in one apperception through the general expression i think and yet this need not be a principle for every possible understanding but only for that which gives nothing manifold through its pure apperception in the representation i am an understanding which through its selfconsciousness could give the manifold of intuition and by whose representation the objects of that representation should at the same time exist would not require a special act of the synthesis of the manifold for the unity of its consciousness while the human understanding which possesses the power of thought only but not of intuition requires such an act to the human understanding that first principle is so indispensable that it really cannot form the least concept of any other possible understanding whether it be intuitive by itself or possessed of a sensuous intuition different from that in space and time §    what is the objective unity of selfconsciousness the transcendental unity of apperception connects all the manifold given in an intuition into a concept of an object it is therefore called objective and must be distinguished from the subjective unity of consciousness which is a form of the internal sense by which the manifold of intuition is empirically given to be thus connected whether i can become empirically conscious of the manifold as either simultaneous or successive depends on circumstances or empirical conditions the empirical unity of consciousness therefore through the association of representations is itself phenomenal and wholly contingent while the pure form of intuition in time merely as general intuition containing the manifold that is given is subject to the original unity of the consciousness through the necessary relation only of the manifold of intuition to the one i think — that is through the pure synthesis of the understanding which forms the a priori ground of the empirical     synthesis that unity alone is therefore valid objectively the empirical unity of apperception which we do not consider here and which is only derived from the former under given conditions in concreto has subjective validity only one man connects the representation of a word with one thing another with another and the unity of consciousness with regard to what is empirical is not necessary nor universally valid with reference to that which is given §    the logical form of all judgments consists in the objective unity of apperception of the concepts contained therein i could never feel satisfied with the definition of a judgment in general given by our logicians who say that it is the representation of a relation between two concepts without disputing with them in this place as to the defect of that explanation that it may possibly apply to categorical but not to hypothetical and disjunctive judgments the latter containing not a relation of concepts but of judgments themselves — though many tedious consequences have arisen from this mistake of logicians — i must at least make this observation that we are not told in what that relation consists  but if i examine more closely the relation of given cognitions in every judgment and distinguish it as belonging to the understanding from the relation according to the rules of reproductive imagination which has subjective validity only i find that a judgment is nothing but the mode of bringing given cognitions     into the objective unity of apperception this is what is intended by the copula is which is meant to distinguish the objective unity of given representations from the subjective it the copula is indicates their relation to the original apperception and their necessary unity even though the judgment itself be empirical and therefore contingent as for instance bodies are heavy by this i do not mean to say that these representations belong necessarily to each other in the empirical intuition but that they belong to each other by means of the necessary unity of apperception in the synthesis of intuitions that is according to the principles of the objective determination of all representations so far as any cognition is to arise from them these principles being all derived from the principle of the transcendental unity of apperception thus and thus alone does the relation become a judgment that is a relation that is valid objectively and can thus be kept sufficiently distinct from the relation of the same representations if it has subjective validity only for instance according to the laws of association in the latter case i could only say that if i carry a body i feel the pressure of its weight but not that it the body is heavy which is meant to say that these two representations are connected together in the object whatever the state of the subject may be and not only associated or conjoined in the perception however often it may be repeated §  0 all sensuous intuitions are subject to the categories as to conditions under which alone their manifold contents can come together in one consciousness the manifold which is given us in a sensuous intuition is necessarily subject to the original synthetical unity of apperception because by it alone the unity of intuition becomes possible §   that act of the understanding further by which the manifold of given representations whether intuitions or concepts is brought under one apperception in general is the logical function of a judgment §    the manifold therefore so far as it     is given in an empirical intuition is determined with regard to one of the logical functions of judgment by which indeed it is brought to consciousness in general the categories however are nothing but these functions of judgment so far as the manifold of a given intuition is determined with respect to them §    see p    therefore the manifold in any given intuition is naturally subject to the categories §    note the manifold contained in an intuition which i call my own is represented through the synthesis of the understanding as belonging to the necessary unity of selfconsciousness and this takes place through the category  this category indicates therefore that the empirical consciousness of the manifold given in any intuition is subject to a pure selfconsciousness a priori in the same manner as the empirical intuition is subject to a pure sensuous intuition which likewise takes place a priori in the above proposition a beginning is made of a deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding in this deduction as the categories arise in the understanding only independent of all sensibility i ought not yet to take any account of the manner in which the manifold is given for an empirical intuition but attend exclusively to the unity which by means of the category enters into the intuition through the understanding in what follows §    we shall show from the manner in which the empirical intuition is given in sensibility that its unity is no other than that which is prescribed by the category according to §  0 to the manifold of any given intuition thus only that is by showing their validity a priori with respect to all objects of our senses the purpose of our deduction will be fully attained     there is one thing however of which in the above demonstration i could not make abstraction namely that the manifold for an intuition must be given antecedently to the synthesis of the understanding and independently of it — how remains uncertain for if i were to imagine an understanding itself intuitive for instance a divine understanding which should not represent to itself given objects but produce them at once by his representation the categories would have no meaning with respect to such cognition they are merely rules for an understanding whose whole power consists in thinking that is in the act of bringing the synthesis of the manifold which is given to it in intuition from elsewhere to the unity of apperception an understanding which therefore knows nothing by itself but connects only and arranges the material for cognition that is the intuition which must be given to it by the object this peculiarity of our understanding of producing unity of apperception a priori by means of the categories only and again by such and so many cannot be further explained any more than why we have these and no other functions of judgment and why time and space are the only forms of a possible intuition for us §    the category admits of no other employment for the cognition of things but its application to objects of experience we have seen that to think an object is not the same as to know an object in order to know an object we must have the concept by which any object is thought the category and likewise the intuition by which it is given if no corresponding intuition could be given to a concept it would still be a thought so far as its form is concerned but it would be without an object and no knowledge of anything would be possible by it because so far as i know there would be nothing and there could be nothing to which my thought could be referred now the only possible intuition for us is sensuous see æsthetic the thought of any object therefore by means of a pure concept of the understanding can with us become knowledge only if it is referred to     objects of the senses sensuous intuition is either pure space and time or empirical ie if it is an intuition of that which is represented in space and time through sensation as immediately real by means of pure intuition we can gain knowledge a priori of things as phenomena in mathematics but only so far as their form is concerned but whether there are things which must be perceived according to that form remains unsettled mathematical concepts by themselves therefore are not yet knowledge except under the supposition that there are things which admit of being represented by us according to the form of that pure sensuous intuition only consequently as things in space and time are only given as perceptions as representations accompanied by sensations that is through empirical representations the pure concepts of the understanding even if applied to intuitions a priori as in mathematics give us knowledge in so far only as these pure intuitions and therefore through them the concepts of the understanding also can be applied to empirical intuitions consequently the categories by means of intuition do not give us any knowledge of things except under the supposition of their possible application to empirical intuition they serve in short for the possibility of empirical knowledge only which is called experience from this it follows that the categories admit of no other employment for the cognition of things except so far only as these are taken as objects of possible experience §    the foregoing proposition is of the greatest importance for it determines the limits of the employment of the pure concepts of the understanding with reference to objects in the same manner as the transcendental æsthetic determined the limits of the employment of the pure form of our sensuous intuition space and time are conditions of the possibility of how objects can be given to us so far only as objects of the senses therefore of experience are concerned beyond these limits they represent nothing for they belong only to the senses and have no reality beyond them pure concepts of the understanding are free from     this limitation and extend to objects of intuition in general whether that intuition be like our own or not if only it is sensuous and not intellectual this further extension however of concepts beyond our sensuous intuition is of no avail to us for they are in that case empty concepts of objects and the concepts do not even enable us to say whether such objects be possible or not they are mere forms of thought without objective reality because we have no intuition at hand to which the synthetical unity of apperception which is contained in the concepts alone could be applied so that they might determine an object nothing can give them sense and meaning except our sensuous and empirical intuition if therefore we assume an object of a nonsensuous intuition as given we may no doubt determine it through all the predicates which follow from the supposition that nothing belonging to sensuous intuition belongs to it that therefore it is not extended or not in space that its duration is not time that no change succession of determinations in time is to be met in it etc but we can hardly call this knowledge if we only indicate how the intuition of an object is not without being able to say what is contained in it for in that case i have not represented the possibility of an object corresponding to my pure concept of the understanding because i could give no intuition corresponding to it but could only say that our intuition did not apply to it but what is the most important is this that not even a single category could be applied to such a thing as for instance the concept of substance that is of something that can exist as a subject only but never as a mere predicate for i do not know whether there can be anything corresponding to such a determination of thought unless empirical intuition supplies the case for its application of this more hereafter §    of the application of the categories to objects of the senses in general the pure concepts of the understanding refer through the mere understanding to objects of intuition whether it be our own or any     other if only sensuous intuition but they are for that very reason mere forms of thought by which no definite object can be known the synthesis or connection of the manifold in them referred only to the unity of apperception and became thus the ground of the possibility of knowledge a priori so far as it rests on the understanding and is therefore not only transcendental but also purely intellectual now as there exists in us a certain form of sensuous intuition a priori which rests on the receptivity of the faculty of representation sensibility the understanding as spontaneity is able to determine the internal sense through the manifold of given representations according to the synthetical unity of apperception and can thus think synthetical unity of the apperception of the manifold of sensuous intuition a priori as the condition to which all objects of our human intuition must necessarily be subject thus the categories though pure forms of thought receive objective reality that is application to objects which can be given to us in intuition but as phenomena only for it is with reference to them alone that we are capable of intuition a priori this synthesis of the manifold of sensuous intuition which is possible and necessary a priori may be called figurative synthesis speciosa in order to distinguish it from that which is thought in the mere category with reference to the manifold of an intuition in general and is called intellectual synthesis synthesis intellectualis both are transcendental not only because they themselves are carried out a priori but because they establish also the possibility of other knowledge a priori but this figurative synthesis if it refers to the original synthetical unity of apperception only that is to that transcendental unity which is thought in the categories must be called the transcendental synthesis of the faculty of imagination in order thus to distinguish it from the purely intellectual synthesis imagination is the faculty of representing an object even without its presence in intuition as all our intuition is sensuous the faculty of imagination belongs on account of the subjective condition under which alone it can give a corresponding intuition to the concepts of the understanding to our sensibility as however its synthesis     is an act of spontaneity determining and not like the senses determinable only and therefore able to determine a priori the senses so far as their form is concerned according to the unity of apperception the faculty of imagination is so far a faculty of determining our sensibility a priori so that the synthesis of the intuitions according to the categories must be the transcendental synthesis of the faculty of imagination this is an effect produced by the understanding on our sensibility and the first application of it and at the same time the ground of all others to objects of the intuition which is only possible to us as figurative it is distinguished from the intellectual synthesis which takes place by the understanding only without the aid of the faculty of imagination in so far as imagination is spontaneity i call it occasionally productive imagination distinguishing it from the reproductive which in its synthesis is subject to empirical laws only namely those of association and which is of no help for the explanation of the possibility of knowledge a priori belonging therefore to psychology and not to transcendental philosophy                                     this is the proper place for trying to account for the paradox which must have struck everybody in our exposition of the form of the internal sense §   see p    namely how that sense represents to the consciousness even ourselves not as we are by ourselves but as we appear to ourselves because we perceive ourselves only as we are affected internally this seems to be contradictory because we should thus be in a passive relation to ourselves and for this reason the founders of the systems of psychology have preferred to represent the internal sense as identical with the faculty of apperception while we have carefully distinguished the two what determines the internal sense is the understanding and its original power of connecting the manifold of intuition that is of bringing it under one apperception this being the very ground of the possibility of the understanding as in us men the understanding is not itself an intuitive faculty and could not even if intuitions were given in our sensibility take them into itself in order to connect as it were the manifold of its own intuition the     synthesis of the understanding if considered by itself alone is nothing but the unity of action of which it is conscious without sensibility also but through which the understanding is able to determine that sensibility internally with respect to the manifold which may be given to it the understanding according to the form of its intuition the understanding therefore exercises its activity under the name of a transcendental synthesis of the faculty of imagination on the passive subject to which it belongs as a faculty and we are right in saying that the internal sense is affected by that activity the apperception with its synthetical unity is so far from being identical with the internal sense that as the source of all synthesis it rather applies under the name of the categories to the manifold of intuitions in general that is to objects in general before all sensuous intuition while the internal sense on the contrary contains the mere form of intuition but without any connection of the manifold in it and therefore as yet no definite intuition which becomes possible only through the consciousness of the determination of the internal sense by the transcendental act of the faculty of imagination the synthetical influence of the understanding on the internal sense which i have called the figurative synthesis this we can always perceive in ourselves we cannot think a line without drawing it in thought we cannot think a circle without describing it we cannot represent at all the three dimensions of space without placing from the same point three lines perpendicularly on each other nay we cannot even represent time except by attending during our drawing a straight line which is meant to be the external figurative representation of time to the act of the synthesis of the manifold only by which we successively determine the internal sense and thereby to the succession of that determination in it it is really motion as the act of the subject not as the determination of an object  therefore   0 the synthesis of the manifold in space abstraction being made of space and our attention fixed on the act only by which we determine the internal sense according to its form which first produces the very concept of succession the understanding does not therefore find in the internal sense such a connection of the manifold but produces it by affecting the internal sense it may seem difficult to understand how the thinking ego can be different from the ego which sees or perceives itself other modes of intuition being at least conceivable and yet identical with the latter as the same subject and how therefore i can say i as intelligence and thinking subject know myself as an object thought so far as being given to myself in intuition also but like other phenomena not as i am to the understanding but only as i appear to myself in reality however this is neither more nor less difficult than how i can be to myself an object and more especially an object of intuition and of internal perceptions but that this must really be so can clearly be shown — if only we admit space to be merely a pure form of the phenomena of the external senses — by the fact that we cannot represent to ourselves time which is no object of external intuition in any other way than under the image of a line which we draw a mode of representation without which we could not realise the unity of its dimension or again by this other fact that we must always derive the determination of the length of time or of points of time for all our internal perceptions from that which is represented to us as changeable by external things and have therefore to arrange the determinations of the internal sense as phenomena in time in exactly the same way in which we arrange the determinations of the external senses in space if then with regard to the latter we admit that by them we know objects so far only as we are affected externally we must also admit with regard to the internal sense that by it we only are or perceive ourselves as we are internally affected by ourselves in other words that with     regard to internal intuition we know our own self as a phenomenon only and not as it is by itself  §    in the transcendental synthesis however of the manifold of representations in general and therefore in the original synthetical unity of apperception i am conscious of myself neither as i appear to myself nor as i am by myself but only that i am this representation is an act of thought not of intuition now in order to know ourselves we require besides the act of thinking which brings the manifold of every possible intuition to the unity of apperception a definite kind of intuition also by which that manifold is given and thus though my own existence is not phenomenal much less a mere illusion yet the determination of my existence  can only take place according to the form of the internal sense and in that special manner in which the manifold which i connect is given in the internal intuition this shows that i have no knowledge of myself as i am but only as i     appear to myself the consciousness of oneself is therefore very far from being a knowledge of oneself in spite of all the categories which constitute the thinking of an object in general by means of the connection of the manifold in an apperception as for the knowledge of an object different from myself i require besides the thinking of an object in general in a category an intuition also to determine that general concept i require for the knowledge of my own self besides consciousness or besides my thinking myself an intuition also of the manifold in me to determine that thought i exist therefore as such an intelligence which is simply conscious of its power of connection but with respect to the manifold that has to be connected is subject to a limiting condition which is called the internal sense according to which that connection can only become perceptible in relations of time which lie entirely outside the concepts of the understanding such an intelligence therefore can only know itself as it appears to itself in an intuition which cannot be intellectual and given by the understanding itself and not as it would know itself if its intuition were intellectual §    transcendental deduction of the universally possible employment of the pure concepts of the understanding in experience in the metaphysical deduction of the categories their a priori origin was proved by their complete accordance with the general logical functions of thought while in their transcendental deduction we established their possibility as knowledge a priori of objects of an intuition in general §  0    now we have to explain the possibility of our knowing a priori by means of the categories whatever objects may come before our senses and this not according to the form of their intuition but according to the laws of their connection and of our thus as it were prescribing laws to nature nay making nature possible unless they were adequate to that purpose we could not understand how everything that may come before our senses must be subject to laws which have their origin a priori in the understanding alone     first of all i observe that by the synthesis of apprehension i understand the connection of the manifold in an empirical intuition by which perception that is empirical consciousness of it as phenomenal becomes possible we have forms of the external as well as the internal intuition a priori in our representations of space and time and to these the synthesis of the apprehension of the manifold in phenomena must always conform because it can take place according to that form only time and space however are represented a priori not only as forms of sensuous intuition but as intuitions themselves containing a manifold and therefore with the determination of the unity of that manifold in them see transcendental æsthetic  therefore unity of the synthesis of the manifold without or within us and consequently a connection to which everything that is to be represented as determined in space and time must conform is given a priori as the condition of the synthesis of all apprehension simultaneously with the intuitions not in them and that synthetical unity can be no other but that of the connection of the manifold of any intuition whatsoever in an original consciousness according to the categories only applied to our sensuous intuition consequently all synthesis without which even perception would be impossible is subject to the categories and as experience consists of knowledge by means of connected perceptions the categories are conditions of the possibility of experience and valid therefore a priori also for all objects of experience                                         if for instance i raise the empirical intuition of a house through the apprehension of the manifold contained therein into a perception the necessary unity of space and of external sensuous intuition in general is presupposed and i draw as it were the shape of the house according to that synthetical unity of the manifold in space but this very synthetical unity if i make abstraction of the form of space has its seat in the understanding and is in fact the category of the synthesis of the homogeneous in intuition in general that is the category of quantity to which that synthesis of apprehension that is the perception must always conform  or if to take another example i perceive the freezing of water i apprehend two states that of fluidity and that of solidity and these as standing to each other in a relation of time but in the time which as internal intuition i make the foundation of the phenomenon i represent to myself necessarily synthetical unity of the manifold without which that relation could not be given as determined in an intuition with reference to the succession of time that synthetical unity however as a condition a priori under which i connect the manifold of any intuition turns out to be if i make abstraction of the permanent form of my intuition namely of time the category of cause through which if i apply it to my sensibility i determine everything that happens according to its relation in time thus the apprehension in such an event and that event itself considered as a possible perception is subject to the concept of the relation of cause and effect the same applies to all other cases                                     categories are concepts which a priori prescribe laws to all phenomena and therefore to nature as the sum total of all phenomena natura materialiter spectata the question therefore     arises as these laws are not derived from nature nor conform to it as their model in which case they would be empirical only how we can understand that nature should conform to them that is how they can determine a priori the connection of the manifold in nature without taking that connection from nature the solution of that riddle is this it is no more surprising that the laws of phenomena in nature must agree with the understanding and its form a priori that is with its power of connecting the manifold in general than that the phenomena themselves must agree with the form of sensuous intuition a priori for laws exist as little in phenomena themselves but relatively only with respect to the subject to which so far as it has understanding the phenomena belong as phenomena exist by themselves but relatively only with respect to the same being so far as it has senses things by themselves would necessarily possess their conformity to the law independent also of any understanding by which they are known but phenomena are only representations of things unknown as to what they may be by themselves as mere representations they are subject to no law of connection except that which is prescribed by the connecting faculty now that which connects the manifold of sensuous intuition is the faculty of imagination which receives from the understanding the unity of its intellectual synthesis and from sensibility the manifoldness of apprehension thus as all possible perceptions depend on the synthesis of apprehension and that synthesis itself that empirical synthesis depends on the transcendental and therefore on the categories it follows that all possible perceptions everything in fact that can come to the empirical consciousness that is all phenomena of nature must so far as their connection is concerned be subject to the categories on these categories therefore nature considered as nature in general depends as on the original ground of its necessary conformity to law as natura formaliter spectata beyond the laws on which nature in general as a lawful order of phenomena in space and time depends the pure faculty of the understanding is incapable of prescribing a priori by means of mere categories laws to phenomena special laws therefore as they refer to phenomena which are empirically     determined cannot be completely derived from the categories although they are all subject to them experience must be superadded in order to know such special laws while those other a priori laws inform us only with regard to experience in general and what can be known as an object of it §    results of this deduction of the concepts of the understanding we cannot think any object except by means of the categories we cannot know any subject that has been thought except by means of intuitions corresponding to those concepts now all our intuitions are sensuous and this knowledge so far as its object is given is empirical but empirical knowledge is experience and therefore no knowledge a priori is possible to us except of objects of possible experience only  this knowledge however though limited to objects of experience is not therefore entirely derived from experience for both the pure intuitions and the pure concepts of the understanding are elements of knowledge which exist in us a priori now there are only two ways in which a necessary harmony of experience with the concepts of its objects can be conceived either experience makes these concepts possible or these concepts make experience possible the former will not hold good with respect to the categories nor with pure sensuous intuition for they are concepts a priori and therefore independent of experience to ascribe to them an empirical origin would be to admit a kind     of generatio aequivoca there remains therefore the second alternative only a kind of system of the epigenesis of pure reason namely that the categories on the part of the understanding contain the grounds of the possibility of all experience in general how they render experience possible and what principles of the possibility of experience they supply in their employment on phenomena will be shown more fully in the following chapter on the transcendental employment of the faculty of judgment some one might propose to adopt a middle way between the two namely that the categories are neither selfproduced first principles a priori of our knowledge nor derived from experience but subjective dispositions of thought implanted in us with our existence and so arranged by our creator that their employment should accurately agree with the laws of nature which determine experience a kind of system of preformation of pure reason but in that case not only would there be no end of such an hypothesis so that no one could know how far the supposition of predetermined dispositions to future judgments might be carried but there is this decided objection against that middle course that by adopting it the categories would lose that necessity which is essential to them thus the concept of cause which asserts under a presupposed condition the necessity of an effect would become false if it rested only on some subjective necessity implanted in us of connecting certain empirical representations according to the rule of causal relation i should not be able to say that the effect is connected with the cause in the object that is by necessity but only i am so constituted that i cannot think these representations as connected in any other way this is exactly what the sceptic most desires for in that case all our knowledge resting on the supposed objective validity of our judgments is nothing but mere illusion nor would there be wanting people to say they know nothing of such subjective necessity which can only be felt and at all events we could not quarrel with anybody about what depends only on the manner in which his own subject is organised     comprehensive view of this deduction the deduction of the pure concepts of the understanding and with them of all theoretical knowledge a priori consists in representing them as principles of the possibility of experience and in representing experience as the determination of phenomena in space and time — and lastly in representing that determination as depending on the principle of the original synthetical unity of apperception as the form of the understanding applied to space and time as the original forms of sensibility                                          supplement xv see page     all conjunction conjunctio is either composition compositio or connection nexus the former is the synthesis of a manifold the parts of which do not belong to each other necessarily the two triangles for instance into which a square is divided by a diagonal do by themselves not necessarily belong to each other such is also the synthesis of the homogeneous in everything that can be considered mathematically and that synthesis can be divided again into aggregation and coalition the former referring to extensive the latter to intensive qualities the latter conjunction nexus is the synthesis of a manifold in so far as its elements belong to each other necessarily thus the accident belonging to a substance or the effect belonging to a cause though heterogeneous are yet represented as a priori connected which connection as it is not arbitrary i call dynamical because it concerns the connection of the existence of the manifold this may again be divided into the physical connection of phenomena among each other and their metaphysical connection in the faculty of cognition a priori this forms a note in the  nd edition   0 supplement xvi a see page     in the  nd edition the title is i axioms of intuition their principle is all intuitions are extensive quantities proof all phenomena contain so far as their form is concerned an intuition in space and time which forms the a priori foundation of all of them they cannot therefore be apprehended that is received into empirical consciousness except through the synthesis of the manifold by which the representations of a definite space or time are produced ie through the synthesis of the homogeneous and the consciousness of the synthetical unity of that manifold homogeneous now the consciousness of the manifold and homogeneous in intuition so far as by it the representation of an object is first rendered possible is the concept of quantity quantum therefore even the perception of an object as a phenomenon is possible only through the same synthetical unity of the manifold of the given sensuous intuition by which the unity of the composition of the manifold and homogeneous is conceived in the concept of a quantity that is phenomena are always quantities and extensive quantities because as intuitions in space and time they must be represented through the same synthesis through which space and time in general are determined     supplement xvi b see page     ii anticipations of perception their principle is in all phenomena the real which is the object of a sensation has intensive quantity that is a degree proof perception is empirical consciousness that is a consciousness in which there is at the same time sensation phenomena as objects of perception are not pure merely formal intuitions like space and time for space and time can never be perceived by themselves they contain therefore over and above the intuition the material for some one object in general through which something existing in space and time is represented that is they contain the real of sensation as a merely subjective representation which gives us only the consciousness that the subject is affected and which is referred to some object in general now there is a gradual transition possible from empirical to pure consciousness till the real of it vanishes completely and there remains a merely formal consciousness a priori of the manifold in space and time and therefore a synthesis also is possible in the production of the quantity of a sensation from its beginning that is from the pure intuition  0 onwards to any quantity of it as sensation by itself is no objective representation and as in it the intuition of neither space nor time can be found it follows that though not an extensive yet some kind of quantity must belong to it and this through the apprehension of it in which the empirical consciousness may grow in a certain time from nothing  0 to any amount that quantity must be intensive and corresponding to it an intensive quantity ie a degree of influence upon the senses must be attributed to all objects of perception so far as it contains sensation     supplement xvii see page     iii analogies of experience their principle is experience is possible only through the representation of a necessary connection of perceptions proof experience is empirical knowledge that is knowledge which determines an object by means of perceptions it is therefore a synthesis of perceptions which synthesis itself is not contained in the perception but contains the synthetical unity of the manifold of the perceptions in a consciousness that unity constituting the essential of our knowledge of the objects of the senses ie of experience not only of intuition or of sensation of the senses in experience perceptions come together contingently only so that no necessity of their connection could be discovered in the perceptions themselves apprehension being only a composition of the manifold of empirical intuition but containing no representation of the necessity of the connected existence in space and time of the phenomena which it places together experience on the contrary is a knowledge of objects by perceptions in which therefore the relation in the existence of the manifold is to be represented not as it is put together in time but as it is in time objectively now as time itself cannot be perceived the determination of the existence of objects in time can take place only by their connection in time in general that is through concepts connecting them a priori as these concepts always imply necessity we are justified in saying that experience is possible only through a representation of the necessary connection of perceptions     supplement xviii see page     a first analogy principle of the permanence of substance in all changes of phenomena the substance is permanent and its quantum is neither increased nor diminished in nature proof all phenomena exist in time and in it alone as the substratum as permanent form of the internal intuition can simultaneousness as well as succession be represented time therefore in which all change of phenomena is to be thought does not change for it is that in which simultaneousness and succession can be represented only as determinations of it as time by itself cannot be perceived it follows that the substratum which represents time in general and in which all change or simultaneousness can be perceived in apprehension through the relation of phenomena to it must exist in the objects of perception that is in the phenomena now the substratum of all that is real that is of all that belongs to the existence of things is the substance and all that belongs to existence can be conceived only as a determination of it consequently the permanent in reference to which alone all temporal relations of phenomena can be determined is the substance in phenomena that is what is real in them and as the substratum of all change remains always the same as therefore substance cannot change in existence we were justified in saying that its quantum can neither be increased nor diminished in nature     supplement xix see page     b second analogy principle of the succession of time according to the law of causality all changes take place according to the law of connection between cause and effect proof it has been shown by the preceding principle that all phenomena in the succession of time are changes only ie a successive being and notbeing of the determinations of the substance which is permanent and consequently that the being of the substance itself which follows upon its notbeing and its notbeing which follows on its being — in other words that an arising or perishing of the substance itself is inadmissible the same principle might also have been expressed thus all change succession of phenomena consists in modification only for arising and perishing are no modifications of the substance because the concept of modification presupposes the same subject as existing with two opposite determinations and therefore as permanent after this preliminary remark we shall proceed to the proof i perceive that phenomena succeed each other that is that there is a state of things at one time the opposite of which existed at a previous time i am therefore really connecting two perceptions in time that connection is not a work of the senses only and of intuition but is here the product of a synthetical power of the faculty of imagination which determines the internal sense     with reference to relation in time imagination however can connect those two states in two ways so that either the one or the other precedes in time for time cannot be perceived by itself nor can we determine in the object empirically and with reference to time what precedes and what follows i am therefore conscious only that my imagination places the one before the other after and not that in the object the one state comes before the other in other words the objective relation of phenomena following upon each other remains undetermined by mere perception in order that this may be known as determined it is necessary to conceive the relation between the two states in such a way that it should be determined thereby with necessity which of the two should be taken as coming first and which as second and not conversely such a concept involving a necessity of synthetical unity can be a pure concept of the understanding only which is not supplied by experience and this is in this case the concept of the relation of cause and effect the former determining the latter in time as the consequence the cause not being something that might be antecedent in imagination only or might not be perceived at all experience itself therefore that is an empirical knowledge of phenomena is possible only by our subjecting the succession of phenomena and with it all change to the law of causality and phenomena themselves as objects of experience are consequently possible according to the same law only     supplement xx see page     c third analogy principle of coexistence according to the law of reciprocity or community all substances so far as they can be perceived as coexistent in space are always affecting each other reciprocally proof things are coexistent when in empirical intuition the perception of the one can follow upon the perception of the other and vice versa which as was shown in the second principle is impossible in the temporal succession of phenomena thus i may first observe the moon and afterwards the earth or conversely also first the earth and afterwards the moon and because the perceptions of these objects can follow each other in both ways i say that they are coexistent now coexistence is the existence of the manifold in the same time time itself however cannot be perceived so that we might learn from the fact that things exist in the same time that their perceptions can follow each other reciprocally the synthesis of imagination in apprehension would therefore give us each of these perceptions as existing in the subject when the other is absent and vice versa it would never tell us that the objects are coexistent that is that if the one is there the other also must be there in the same time and this by necessity so that the perceptions may follow each other reciprocally hence we require a concept of understanding of the reciprocal sequence of determinations of things existing at the same time     but outside each other in order to be able to say that the reciprocal sequence of the perceptions is founded in the object and thus to represent their coexistence as objective the relation of substances however of which the first has determinations the ground of which is contained in the other is the relation of influence and if conversely also the first contains the ground of determinations in the latter the relation is that of community or reciprocity hence the coexistence of substances in space cannot be known in experience otherwise but under the supposition of reciprocal action and this is therefore the condition also of the possibility of things themselves as objects of experience     supplement xxi see page     an important protest however against these rules for proving existence mediately is brought forward by idealism and this is therefore the proper place for its refutation                                     refutation of idealism idealism i mean material idealism is the theory which declares the existence of objects in space without us as either doubtful only and not demonstrable or as false and impossible the former is the problematical idealism of descartes who declares one empirical assertion only to be undoubted namely that of i am the latter is the dogmatical idealism of berkeley who declares space and all things to which it belongs as an inseparable condition as something impossible in itself and therefore the things in space as mere imaginations dogmatic idealism is inevitable if we look upon space as a property belonging to things by themselves for in that case space and all of which it is a condition would be a nonentity the ground on which that idealism rests has been removed by us in the transcendental æsthetic problematical idealism which asserts nothing but only pleads our inability of proving any existence except our own by means of immediate experience is reasonable and in accordance with a sound philosophical mode of thought which allows of no decisive judgment before a sufficient proof has been found the required proof will have to demonstrate that we may have not only an imagination but also an experience of external things and this it seems can hardly be effected in any other way except by proving that even our internal experience which descartes considers as     andoubted is possible only under the supposition of external experience theorem the simple but empirically determined consciousness of my own existence proves the existence of objects in space outside myself proof i am conscious of my own existence as determined in time and all determination in time presupposes something permanent in the perception  that permanent however cannot be an intuition within me because all the causes which determine my existence so far as they can be found within me are representations and as such require themselves something permanent different from them in reference to which their change and therefore my existence in time in which they change may be determined the perception of this permanent therefore is possible only through a thing outside me and not through the mere representation of a thing outside me and the determination of my existence in time is consequently possible only by the existence of real things which i perceive outside me now as the consciousness in time is necessarily connected with the consciousness of the possibility of that determination of time it is also necessarily connected with the existence of things outside me as the condition of the determination of time in other words the consciousness of my own existence is at the same time an immediate consciousness of the existence of other things note   — it will have been perceived that in the foregoing proof the trick played by idealism has been turned against it and with greater justice idealism assumed that the only immediate experience is the internal and that from it we can no more than infer external things though in an untrustworthy manner only as always happens if from given effects we infer definite   0 causes it being quite possible that the cause of the representations which are ascribed by us it may be wrongly to external things may lie within ourselves we however have proved that external experience is really immediate  and that only by means of it though not the consciousness of our own existence yet its determination in time that is internal experience becomes possible no doubt the representation of i am which expresses the consciousness that can accompany all thought is that which immediately includes the existence of a subject but it does not yet include a knowledge of it and therefore no empirical knowledge that is experience for that we require besides the thought of something existing intuition also and in this case internal intuition in respect to which that is to time the subject must be determined for that purpose external objects are absolutely necessary so that internal experience itself is possible mediately only and through external experience note   — this view is fully confirmed by the empirical use of our faculty of knowledge as applied to the determination of time not only are we unable to perceive any determination of time except through a change in external relations motion with reference to what is permanent in space for instance the movement of the sun with respect to terrestrial objects but we really have nothing permanent to which we could refer the concept of a substance as an intuition except matter only and even its permanence is not derived from external experience but     presupposed a priori as a necessary condition of all determination of time and therefore also of  the determination of the internal sense with respect to our own existence through the existence of external things the consciousness of myself in the representation of the ego is not an intuition but a merely intellectual representation of the spontaneity of a thinking subject hence that ego has not the slightest predicate derived from intuition which predicate as permanent might serve as the correlate of the determination of time in the internal sense such as is for instance impermeability in matter as an empirical intuition note   — because the existence of external objects is required for the possibility of a definite consciousness of ourselves it does not follow that every intuitional representation of external things involves at the same time their existence for such a representation may well be the mere effect of the faculty of imagination in dreams as well as in madness but it can be such an effect only through the reproduction of former external perceptions which as we have shown is impossible without the reality of external objects what we wanted to prove here was only that internal experience in general is possible only through external experience in general whether this or that supposed experience be purely imaginary must be settled according to its own particular determinations and through a comparison with the criteria of all real experience     supplement xxii see page                                         general note on the system of the principles it is something very remarkable that we cannot understand the possibility of anything from the category alone but must always have an intuition in order to exhibit by it the objective reality of the pure concept of the understanding let us take for instance the categories of relation it is impossible to understand from mere concepts alone — first how something can exist as subject only and not as a mere determination of other things that is how it can be a substance or secondly how because something is something else must be that is how something can ever be a cause or thirdly how when there are several things something could follow from the existence of one of them as affecting the rest and vice versa so that there should exist in this way a certain community of substances the same applies to the other categories as for instance how a thing could be of the same kind as many others and thus be a quantity so long as there is no intuition we do not know whether by the categories we conceive an object nay whether any object can at all belong to them and thus we see again that by themselves the categories are not knowledge but mere forms of thought by which given intuitions are turned into knowledge it likewise follows from this that no synthetical proposition can be made out of mere categories as for instance if it is said that in everything existing there is substance ie something that can     exist as subject only and not as a mere predicate or everything is a quantum etc here we have really nothing whatever which would enable us to go beyond a given concept and to connect with it another hence no one has ever succeeded in proving a synthetical proposition by pure concepts of the understanding only as for instance the proposition that everything which exists contingently has a cause all that could be proved was that without such a relation we could not conceive the existence of what is contingent that is that we could not know a priori through the understanding the existence of such a thing from which it does not follow in the least that the same condition applies to the possibility of things themselves if the reader will go back to our proof of the principle of causality he will perceive that we could prove it of objects of possible experience only by saying that everything which happens every event presupposes a cause we could prove it only as the principle of the possibility of experience that is of the knowledge of an object given in empirical intuition but not by means of mere concepts it is perfectly true that nevertheless this proposition that everything contingent must have a cause carries conviction to everybody from mere concepts but it should be observed that in this case the concept of the contingent contains no longer the category of modality as something the nonexistence of which can be conceived but that of relation as something which can only exist as the consequence of something else it thus becomes in reality an identical proposition namely that that which can exist as a consequence only has its cause and thus when we have to give examples of contingent existence we have always recourse to changes and not only to the possibility of conceiving the opposite  change however is an event which as such is     possible through a cause only and the nonexistence of which is therefore possible in itself we thus mean by contingency that something can exist as the effect of a cause only and if therefore a thing is assumed to be contingent it becomes a merely analytical proposition to say that it has a cause it is still more remarkable however that in order to understand the possibility of things according to the categories and thus to establish the objective reality of the latter we require not only intuitions but always external intuitions thus if we take for instance the pure concepts of relation we find that — first in order to give something permanent in intuition corresponding to the concept of substance and thus to show the objective reality of that concept we require an intuition in space of matter because space alone can determine anything as permanent while time and therefore everything that exists in the internal sense is in a constant flux secondly that in order to exhibit change as the intuition corresponding to the concept of causality we must use motion as change in space for our example nay can thus only gain an intuition of changes the possibility of which no pure understanding can ever conceive change is the connection of contradictory opposites in the existence of one and the same thing now how it is possible that from a given state another state opposed to it should arise in the same thing no reason can comprehend without an example nay without an intuition cannot even render it intelligible to itself that intuition however is that of the motion of a point in space the presence of which in different places as a consequence of opposite determinations gives us for the first time an intuition of change so that in order to make even internal changes afterwards conceivable to ourselves we must make time as the form of the internal sense figuratively comprehensible to ourselves by means of a line and the internal     change by means of the drawing of that line motion in other words the successive existence of ourselves in different states by means of an external intuition the real reason of this lies in the fact that all change presupposes something permanent in intuition in order that it may itself be perceived as change while no permanent intuition is to be found in the internal sense thirdly and lastly the category of community cannot so far as its possibility is concerned be conceived by mere reason alone and the objective reality of that concept cannot therefore be possibly understood without intuition and without external intuition in space for how should we conceive the possibility that when several substances exist something as an effect could follow from the existence of one of them as affecting reciprocally the existence of the other and that therefore because there is something in the former something must also be in the latter which from the existence of the latter alone could not be understood for this is necessary to establish community though it is utterly inconceivable among things each of which completely isolates itself through its substantiality leibniz therefore as he attributed community to the substances of the world as conceived by the understanding alone required the interference of a deity because as he justly perceived such community would have been inconceivable from the existence of such substances only we on the contrary can render the possibility of such a communion of substances as phenomena perfectly conceivable to ourselves if we represent them to ourselves in space that is in external intuition for space contains even a priori formal external relations as conditions of the possibility of the real relations of action and reaction that is of community it is easy to show in the same manner that the possibility of things as quanta and therefore the objective reality of the category of quantity can be exhibited in external intuition only and by means of it alone be afterwards applied to the internal sense but in order to avoid prolixity i must leave it to the reflection of the reader to find the examples of this the whole of these notes is of great importance not only as confirming our previous refutation of idealism but even more     when we come to treat of selfknowledge by mere internal consciousness and the determination of our own nature without the help of external empirical intuitions in order to show us the limits of the possibility of such knowledge the last result of the whole of this section is therefore this all principles of the pure understanding are nothing more than a priori principles of the possibility of experience and to experience alone do all synthetical propositions a priori relate nay their possibility itself rests entirely on that relation     supplement xxiii see page     in one word none of these concepts admit of being authenticated nor can their real possibility be proved if all sensuous intuition the only one which we possess is removed and there remains in that case a logical possibility only that is that a concept a thought is possible this however does not concern us here but only whether the concept refers to an object and does therefore signify anything     supplement xxiv see page  0  we are met here by an illusion which is difficult to avoid the categories do not depend in their origin on sensibility like the forms of intuition space and time and seem therefore to admit of an application extending beyond the objects of the senses but on the other side they are nothing but forms of thought containing the logical faculty only of comprehending a priori in one consciousness the manifold that is given in intuition and they would therefore if we take away the only intuition which is possible to us have still less significance than those pure sensuous forms by which at least an object is given while a peculiar mode of our understanding of connecting the manifold unless that intuition in which the manifold alone can be given is added signifies nothing at all nevertheless it seems to follow from our very concept if we call certain objects as phenomena beings of the senses by distinguishing between the mode of our intuition and the nature of those objects by themselves that we may take either the same objects in that latter capacity though they cannot as such come before our intuition or other possible things which are not objects of our senses at all and place them as objects thought only by the understanding in opposition to the former calling them beings of the understanding noumena the question then arises whether our pure concepts of the understanding do not possess some significance with regard to these socalled beings of the understanding and constitute a mode of knowing them at the very outset however we meet with an ambiguity which may cause great misapprehension the understanding by calling     an object in one aspect a phenomenon only makes to itself apart from that aspect another representation of an object by itself and imagines itself able to form concepts of such an object as then the understanding yields no other concepts but the categories it supposes that the object in the latter aspect can be thought at least by those pure concepts of the understanding and is thus induced to take the entirely indefinite concept of a being of the understanding as of a something in general outside our sensibility as a definite concept of a being which we might know to a certain extent through the understanding if by noumenon we mean a thing so far as it is not an object of our sensuous intuition and make abstraction of our mode of intuition it may be called a noumenon in a negative sense if however we mean by it an object of a nonsensuous intuition we admit thereby a peculiar mode of intuition namely the intellectual which however is not our own nor one of which we can understand even the possibility this would be the noumenon in a positive sense the doctrine of sensibility is at the same time the doctrine of noumena in their negative sense that is of things which the understanding must think without reference to our mode of intuition and therefore not as phenomena only but as things by themselves but to which after it has thus separated them the understanding knows that it must not in this new aspect apply its categories because these categories have significance only with reference to the unity of intuitions in space and time and can therefore a priori determine that unity on account of the mere ideality of space and time only by means of general connecting concepts where that unity in time cannot be found ie in the noumenon the whole use nay the whole significance of categories comes to an end because even the possibility of things that should correspond to the categories would be unintelligible on this point i may refer the reader to what i have said at the very beginning of the general note to the previous chapter suppl xxii the possibility of a thing can never be proved from the fact that its concept is not selfcontradictory but only by being authenticated by an intuition corresponding to it   0 if therefore we attempted to apply the categories to objects which are not considered as phenomena we should have to admit an intuition other than the sensuous and thus the object would become a noumenon in a positive sense as however such an intuition namely an intellectual one is entirely beyond our faculty of knowledge the use of the categories also can never reach beyond the limits of the objects of experience beings of the understanding correspond no doubt to beings of the senses and there may be beings of the understanding to which our faculty of sensuous intuition has no relation at all but our concepts of the understanding being forms of thought for our sensuous intuition only do not reach so far and what is called by us a noumenon must be understood as such in a negative sense only     supplement xxv see page  0  we must not speak as is often done of an intellectual world for intellectual and sensitive apply to knowledge only that however to which the one or the other mode of intuition applies that is the objects themselves must however harsh it may sound be called intelligible or sensible     supplement xxvi see page     metaphysic has for the real object of its investigations three ideas only god freedom and immortality the second concept connected with the first leading by necessity to the third as conclusion everything else treated by that science is a means only in order to establish those ideas and their reality metaphysic does not require these ideas for the sake of natural science but in order to go beyond nature a right insight into them would make theology morality and by the union of both religion also therefore the highest objects of our existence dependent on the speculative faculty of reason only and on nothing else in a systematical arrangement of those ideas the above order being synthetical would be the most appropriate but in their elaboration which must necessarily come first the analytical or inverse order is more practical enabling us by starting from what is given us by experience namely the study of the soul psychology and proceeding thence to the study of the world cosmology and lastly to a knowledge of god theology to carry out the whole of our great plan in its entirety     supplement xxvii see page     we shall therefore follow it with a critical eye through all the predicaments of pure psychology but we shall for the sake of brevity let their examination proceed uninterruptedly the following general remark may at the very outset make us more attentive to this mode of syllogism i do not know any object by merely thinking but only by determining a given intuition with respect to that unity of consciousness in which all thought consists therefore i do not know myself by being conscious of myself as thinking but only if i am conscious of the intuition of myself as determined with respect to the function of thought all modes of selfconsciousness in thought are therefore by themselves not yet concepts of understanding of objects categories but mere logical functions which present no object to our thought to be known and therefore do not present myself either as an object it is not a consciousness of the determining but only that of the determinable self that is of my internal intuition so far as the manifold in it can be connected in accordance with the general condition of the unity of apperception in thought which forms the object   in all judgments i am always the determining subject only of the relation which constitutes the judgment that i who think can be considered in thinking as subject only and as something not simply inherent in the thinking as predicate is an apodictical and even identical proposition but it does not mean that as an object i am a selfdependent being or a substance the latter would be saying a great deal and requires for its support data which are not found in the thinking perhaps so far as     i consider only the thinking subject as such more than i shall ever find in it   that the ego of apperception and therefore the ego in every act of thought is a singular which cannot be dissolved into a plurality of subjects and that it therefore signifies a logically simple subject follows from the very concept of thinking and is consequently an analytical proposition but this does not mean that a thinking ego is a simple substance which would indeed be a synthetical proposition the concept of substance always relates to intuitions which with me cannot be other but sensuous and which therefore lie completely outside the field of the understanding and its thinking which alone is intended here when we say that the ego in thinking is simple it would indeed be strange if what elsewhere requires so great an effort namely to distinguish in what is given by intuition what is substance and still more whether that substance can be simple as in the case of the component parts of matter should in our case be given to us so readily in what is really the poorest of all representations and as it were by an act of revelation   the proposition of the identity of myself amidst the manifold of which i am conscious likewise follows from the concepts themselves and is therefore analytical but the identity of the subject of which in all its representations i may become conscious does not refer to the intuition by which it is given as an object and cannot therefore signify the identity of the person by which is understood the consciousness of the identity of ones own substance as a thinking being in all the changes of circumstances in order to prove this the mere analysis of the proposition i think would avail nothing but different synthetical judgments would be required which are based on the given intuition   to say that i distinguish my own existence as that of a thinking being from other things outside me one of them being my body is likewise an analytical proposition for other things are things which i conceive as different from myself but whether such a consciousness of myself is even possible without things outside me whereby representations are given to me and whether     i could exist merely as a thinking being without being a man i do not know at all by that proposition nothing therefore is gained by the analysis of the consciousness of myself in thought in general towards the knowledge of myself as an object the logical analysis of thinking in general is simply mistaken for a metaphysical determination of the object it would be a great nay even the only objection to the whole of our critique if there were a possibility of proving a priori that all thinking beings are by themselves simple substances that as such as a consequence of the same argument personality is inseparable from them and that they are conscious of their existence as distinct from all matter for we should thus have made a step beyond the world of sense and entered into the field of noumena and after that no one could dare to question our right of advancing further of settling in it and as each of us is favoured by luck taking possession of it the proposition that every thinking being is as such a simple substance is synthetical a priori because first it goes beyond the concept on which it rests and adds to act of thinking in general the mode of existence and secondly because it adds to that concept a predicate simplicity which cannot be given in any experience hence synthetical propositions a priori would be not only admissible as we maintained in reference to objects of possible experience and then only as principles of the possibility of that experience but could be extended to things in general and to things by themselves a result which would put an end to the whole of our critique and bid us to leave everything as we found it however the danger is not so great if only we look more closely into the matter in this process of rational psychology there lurks a paralogism which may be represented by the following syllogism that which cannot be conceived otherwise than as a subject does not exist otherwise than as a subject and is therefore a substance a thinking being considered as such cannot be conceived otherwise than as a subject therefore it exists also as such only that is as a substance     in the major they speak of a being that can be thought in every respect and therefore also as it may be given in intuition in the minor however they speak of it only so far as it considers itself as subject with respect to the thinking and the unity of consciousness only but not at the same time in respect to the intuition whereby this unity is given as an object of thinking the conclusion therefore has been drawn by a sophism and more especially by sophisma figurae dictionis  that we are perfectly right in thus resolving that famous argument into a paralogism will be clearly seen by referring to the general note on the systematical representation of the principles and to the section on the noumena for it has been proved there that the concept of a thing which can exist by itself as a subject and not as a mere predicate carries as yet no objective reality that is that we cannot know whether any object at all belongs to it it being impossible for us to understand the possibility of such a mode of existence it yields us therefore no knowledge at all if such a concept is to indicate under the name of a substance an object that can be given and thus become knowledge it must be made to rest on a permanent intuition as the indispensable condition of the objective reality of a concept that is as that by which alone the object can be given in internal intuition however we have nothing permanent for the ego is only the consciousness of my thinking and if we do not go beyond this thinking we are without the necessary condition for applying the concept of substance     that is of an independent subject to the self as a thinking being thus the simplicity of the substance entirely disappears with the objective reality of the concept and is changed into a purely logical qualitative unity of selfconsciousness in thinking in general whether the subject be composite or not refutation of mendelssohns proof of the permanence of the soul this acute philosopher perceived very quickly how the ordinary argument that the soul if it is once admitted to be a simple being cannot cease to exist by decomposition was insufficient to prove its necessary continuance because it might cease to exist by simply vanishing he therefore tried in his phædon to prove that the soul was not liable to that kind of perishing which would be a real annihilation by endeavouring to show that a simple being cannot cease to exist because as it could not be diminished and thus gradually lose something of its existence and be changed by little and little into nothing it having no parts and therefore no plurality in itself there could be no time between the one moment in which it exists and the other in which it exists no longer and this would be impossible he did not consider however that though we might allow to the soul this simple nature namely that it contains nothing manifold nothing by the side of each other and therefore no extensive quantity yet we could not deny to it as little as to any other existing thing intensive quantity ie a degree of reality with respect to all its faculties nay to all which constitutes its existence such a degree of reality might diminish by an infinite number of smaller degrees and thus the supposed substance the thing the permanence of which has not yet been established might be changed into nothing not indeed through decomposition but through a gradual remission of its powers or if i may say so through elanguescence for even consciousness has always a degree which admits of being diminished  and therefore also     the faculty of being conscious of oneself as well as all other faculties the permanence of the soul therefore considered merely as an object of the internal sense remains undemonstrated and undemonstrable though its permanence in life while the thinking being as man is at the same time to itself an object of the external senses is clear by itself but this does not satisfy the rational psychologist who undertakes to prove from mere concepts the absolute permanence of the soul even beyond this life      if now we take the above propositions in synthetical connection as indeed they must be taken as valid for all thinking beings in a system of rational psychology and proceed from the category of relation with the proposition all thinking beings as such are substances backwards through the series till the circle is completed we arrive in the end at their existence and this according to that system they are not only conscious of independently of external things but are supposed to be able to determine it even of themselves with respect to that permanence which necessarily belongs to the character of substance hence it follows that in this rationalistic system idealism is inevitable at least problematical idealism because if the existence of external things is not required at all for the determination of ones own existence in time their existence is really a gratuitous assumption of which no proof can ever be given if on the contrary we proceed analytically taking the proposition i think which involves existence according to the category  00 of modality as given and analyse it in order to find our whether and how the ego determines its existence in space and time by it alone the propositions of rational psychology would not start from the concept of a thinking being in general but from a reality and the inference would consist in determining from the manner in which that reality is thought after everything that is empirical in it has been removed what belongs to a thinking being in general this may be shown by the following table      i think       as subject  as simple subject      as identical subject in every state of my thought  as it has not been determined in the second proposition whether i can exist and be conceived to exist as a subject only and not also as a predicate of something else the concept of subject is here taken as logical only and it remains undetermined whether we are to understand by it a substance or not in the third proposition however the absolute unity of apperception the simple i being the representation to which all connection or separation which constitute thought relate assumes its own importance although nothing is determined as yet with regard to the nature of the subject or its subsistence the apperception is something real and it is only possible if it is simple in space however there is nothing real that is simple for points the only simple in space are limits only and not themselves something which as a part serves to constitute space from this follows the impossibility of explaining the nature of myself as merely a thinking subject from the materialistic point of view as however in the first proposition my existence is taken for granted for it is not said in it that every thinking being exists this would predicate too much namely absolute necessity of them but only i exist as thinking the proposition itself is empirical and contains only the determinability of my existence  0  in reference to my representations in time but as for that purpose again i require first of all something permanent such as is not given to me at all in internal intuition so far as i think myself it is really impossible by that simple selfconsciousness to determine the manner in which i exist whether as a substance or as an accident thus if materialism was inadequate to explain my existence spiritualism is equally insufficient for that purpose and the conclusion is that in no way whatsoever can we know anything of the nature of our soul so far as the possibility of its separate existence is concerned and how indeed should it be possible by means of that unity of consciousness which we only know because it is indispensable to us for the very possibility of experience to get beyond experience our existence in life and even to extend our knowledge to the nature of all thinking beings in general by the empirical but with reference to every kind of intuition undetermined proposition i think there is therefore no rational psychology as a doctrine furnishing any addition to our selfknowledge but only as a discipline fixing unpassable limits to speculative reason in this field partly to keep us from throwing ourselves into the arms of a soulless materialism partly to warn us against losing ourselves in a vague and with regard to practical life baseless spiritualism it reminds us at the same time to look upon this refusal of our reason to give a satisfactory answer to such curious questions which reach beyond the limits of this life as a hint to turn our selfknowledge away from fruitless speculations to a fruitful practical use — a use which though directed always to objects of experience only derives its principle from a higher source and so regulates our conduct as if our destination reached far beyond experience and therefore far beyond this life we see from all this that rational psychology owes its origin to a mere misunderstanding the unity of consciousness on which the categories are founded is mistaken for an intuition of the subject as object and the category of substance applied to it but that unity is only the unity in thought by which alone no object is given and to which therefore the category of substance  0  which always presupposes a given intuition cannot be applied and therefore the subject cannot be known the subject of the categories therefore cannot by thinking them receive a concept of itself as an object of the categories for in order to think the categories it must presuppose its pure selfconsciousness the very thing that had to be explained in like manner the subject in which the representation of time has its original source cannot determine by it its own existence in time and if the latter is impossible the former as a determination of oneself as of a thinking being in general by means of the categories is equally so                                      thus vanishes as an idle dream that knowledge which was to go beyond the limits of possible experience and was connected no doubt with the highest interests of humanity so far at least  0  as speculative philosophy was to supply it yet no unimportant service has thus been rendered to reason by the severity of our criticism in proving at the same time the impossibility of settling anything dogmatically with reference to an object of experience beyond the limits of experience and thus securing it against all possible assertions to the contrary this can only be done in two ways either by proving ones own proposition apodictically or if that does not succeed by trying to discover the causes of that failure which if they lie in the necessary limits of our reason must force every opponent to submit to exactly the same law of renunciation with reference to any claims to dogmatic assertion nothing is lost however by this with regard to the right nay the necessity of admitting a future life according to the principles of practical as connected with the speculative employment of reason it is known besides that a purely speculative proof has never been able to exercise any influence on the ordinary reason of men it stands so entirely upon the point of a hair that even the schools can only keep it from falling so long as they keep it constantly spinning round like a top so that even in their own eyes it yields no permanent foundation upon which anything could be built the proofs which are useful for the world at large retain their value undiminished nay they gain in clearness and natural power by the surrender of those dogmatical pretensions placing reason in its own peculiar domain namely the system of ends which is however at the same time the system of nature so that reason as a practical faculty by itself without being limited by the conditions of nature becomes justified in extending the system of ends and with it our own existence beyond the limits of experience and of life according to the analogy with the nature of living beings in this world in which reason must necessarily admit the principle that no organ no faculty no impulse can be found as being either superfluous or disproportionate to its use and therefore purposeless but that everything is adequate to its destination in life man who alone can contain in himself the highest end of all this would be the only creature excepted from it for his natural dispositions not only so far as he uses them according to his talents and impulses  0  but more especially the moral law within him go so far beyond all that is useful and advantageous in this life that he is taught thereby in the absence of all advantages even of the shadowy hope of posthumous fame to esteem the mere consciousness of righteousness beyond everything else feeling an inner call by his conduct in this world and a surrender of many advantages to render himself fit to become the citizen of a better world which exists in his idea only this powerful and incontrovertible proof accompanied by our constantly increasing recognition of a design pervading all that we see around us and by a contemplation of the immensity of creation and therefore also by the consciousness of an unlimited possibility in the extension of our knowledge and a desire commensurate therewith all this remains and always will remain although we must surrender the hope of ever being able to understand from the mere theoretical knowledge of ourselves the necessary continuance of our existence conclusion of the solution of the psychological paralogism the dialectical illusion in rational psychology arises from our confounding an idea of reason that of a pure intelligence with the altogether indefinite concept of a thinking being in general what we are doing is that we conceive ourselves for the sake of a possible experience taking no account as yet of any real experience and thence conclude that we are able to become conscious of our existence independently of experience and of its empirical conditions we are therefore confounding the possible abstraction of our own empirically determined existence with the imagined consciousness of a possible separate existence of our thinking self and we bring ourselves to believe that we know the substantial within us as the transcendental subject while what we have in our thoughts is only the unity of consciousness on which as on the mere form of knowledge all determination is based the task of explaining the community of the soul with the body does not properly fall within the province of that psychology of which we are here speaking because that psychology tries to prove the personality of the soul apart also from that community  0  after death being therefore transcendent in the proper sense of that word inasmuch as though dealing with an object of experience it deals with it only so far as it has ceased to be an object of experience according to our doctrine however a sufficient answer may be returned to that question also the difficulty of the task consists as is well known in the assumed heterogeneousness of the object of the internal sense the soul and the objects of the external senses the formal condition of the intuition with regard to the former being time only with regard to the latter time and space if we consider however that both kinds of objects thus differ from each other not internally but so far only as the one appears externally to the other and that possibly what is at the bottom of phenomenal matter as a thing by itself may not be so heterogeneous after all as we imagine that difficulty vanishes and there remains that one difficulty only how a community of substances is possible at all a difficulty which it is not the business of psychology to solve and which as the reader will easily understand after what has been said in the analytic of fundamental powers and faculties lies undoubtedly beyond the limits of all human knowledge general note on the transition from rational psychology to cosmology the proposition i think or i exist thinking is an empirical proposition such a proposition is based on an empirical intuition and its object is phenomenal so that it might seem as if according to our theory the soul was changed altogether even in thinking into something phenomenal and our consciousness itself as merely phenomenal would thus indeed refer to nothing thinking taken by itself is a logical function only and therefore pure spontaneity in connecting the manifold of a merely possible intuition it does not represent the subject of consciousness as phenomenal for the simple reason that it takes no account whatsoever of the manner of intuition whether it be sensuous or intellectual i do not thereby represent myself to myself either as i am or as i appear to myself but i only conceive of myself  0  as of any other object without taking account of the manner of intuition if thereby i represent myself as the subject of my thoughts or as the ground of thinking these modes of representation are not the categories of substance or cause because these are functions of thought judgment as applied already to our sensuous intuition such sensuous intuition being necessary if i wish to know myself but i only wish to become conscious of myself as thinking and as i take no account of what my own self may be as a phenomenon it is quite possible that it might be a phenomenon only to me who thinks but not to me so far as i am thinking in the consciousness of myself in mere thinking i am the substance itself but of that substance nothing is thus given me for thinking the proposition i think if it means i exist thinking is not merely logical function but determines the subject which then is at the same time object with reference to its existence and is impossible without the internal sense the intuition of which always supplies the object not as a thing by itself but as phenomenal only here therefore we have no longer mere spontaneity of thinking but also receptivity of intuition that is the thinking of myself applied to the empirical intuition of the same subject in that empirical intuition the thinking self would have to look for the conditions under which its logical functions can be employed as categories of substance cause etc in order not only to distinguish itself as an object by itself through the ego but to determine the mode of its existence also that is to know itself as a noumenon this as we know is impossible because the internal empirical intuition is sensuous and supplies us with phenomenal data only which furnish nothing to the object of the pure consciousness for the knowledge of its own separate existence but can serve the purpose of experience only supposing however that we should hereafter discover not indeed in experience but in certain not only logical rules but a priori established laws of pure reason concerning our existence some ground for admitting ourselves entirely a priori as determining and ruling our own existence there would then be a spontaneity by which our reality would be determinable without the  0  conditions of empirical intuition and we should then perceive that in the consciousness of our existing there is contained a priori something which may serve to determine with respect to some inner faculty our existence which otherwise can be determined sensuously only with reference to an intelligible though of course an ideal world only this however would not in the least benefit the attempts of rational psychology for though through that wonderful faculty which becomes first revealed to myself by the consciousness of a moral law i should have a principle purely intellectual for a determination of my existence what would be its determining predicates no other but those which must be given to me in sensuous intuition and i should therefore find myself again in the same situation where i was before in rational psychology requiring sensuous intuitions in order to give significance to the concepts of my understanding such as substance cause etc by which alone i can gain a knowledge of myself and these intuitions can never carry me beyond the field of experience nevertheless for practical purposes which always concern objects of experience i should be justified in applying these concepts in analogy with their theoretical employment to liberty also and to the subject of liberty by taking them only as logical functions of subject and predicate  of cause and effect according to them acts or effects as following those moral laws would be so determined that they may together with the laws of nature be explained in accordance with the categories of substance and cause though arising in reality from a totally different principle all this is only meant to prevent a misunderstanding to which our doctrine which represents selfintuition as purely phenomenal might easily be exposed in what follows we shall have occasion to make good use of it  0  supplement xxviii see page  00 i have sometimes called it formal idealism also in order to distinguish it from the material or common idealism which doubts or denies the very existence of external things in some cases it seems advisable to use these terms rather than those in the text in order to prevent all misunderstanding this is an additional note in the second edition printed in the united states of america   the second

observes obscures rather than illustrates the articulation of the book   this preface is left out in later editions and replaced by a new preface see supplement ii page       we often hear complaints against the shallowness of thought in our own time and the decay of sound knowledge but i do not see that sciences which rest on a solid foundation such as mathematics physics etc deserve this reproach in the least on the contrary they maintain their old reputation of solidity and with regard to physics even surpass it the same spirit would manifest itself in other branches of knowledge if only their principles had first been properly determined till that is done indifferentism and doubt and ultimately severe criticism are rather signs of honest thought our age is in every sense of the word the age of criticism and everything must submit to it religion on the strength of its sanctity and law on the strength of its majesty try to withdraw themselves from it but by so doing they arouse just suspicions and cannot claim that sincere respect which reason pays to those only who have been able to stand its free and open examination   terrasson philosophie nach ihrem allgemeinen

here a new heading — iii philosophy requires a science to determine the possibility the principles and the extent of all cognitions a priori   the second edition adds here these inevitable problems of pure reason itself are god freedom and immortality the science which with all its apparatus is really intended for the solution of these problems is called metaphysic its procedure is at first dogmatic ie unchecked by a previous examination of what reason can and cannot do before it engages confidently in so arduous an undertaking   these two paragraphs to in synthetical judgments a priori however are left out in the second edition and replaced by supplement v   this paragraph left out in the second edition and replaced by supplement vi   if any of the ancients had ever thought of asking this question this alone would have formed a powerful barrier against all systems of pure reason to the present day and would have saved many vain attempts undertaken blindly and without a true knowledge of the subject in hand   as with our manner of knowing objects so far as this is meant to be possible a priori second edition   here follows supplement vii in second edition   addition in the second edition   the germans are the only people who at present      use the word æsthetic for what others call criticism of taste there is implied in that name a false hope first conceived by the excellent analytical philosopher baumgarten of bringing the critical judgment of the beautiful under rational principles and to raise its rules to the rank of a science but such endeavours are vain for such rules or criteria are according to their principal sources empirical only and can never serve as definite a priori rules for our judgment in matters of taste on the contrary our judgment is the real test of the truth of such rules it would be advisable therefore to drop the name in that sense and to apply it to a doctrine which is a real science thus approaching more nearly to the language and meaning of the ancients with whom the division into αeditor illegible characterσθητ ὰ καὶ νοητά was very famous or to share that name in common with speculative philosophy and thus to use æsthetic sometimes in a transcendental sometimes in a psychological sense   no   no   is differently worded in the second edition see supplement viii   this passage to my object in what i have said is differently worded in the second edition see supplement ix   in the second edition the title is metaphysical exposition of the concept of time with reference to par   transcendental exposition of the concept of time   i retain the reading of the first edition vor derselben nicht durch dieselbe von denselben the reading of later editions is wrong the emendation of rosenkranz vor denselben nicht durch dieselben unnecessary the second edition has likewise vor derselben   here follows in the second edition supplement x   read allein instead of alle   i can say indeed that my representations follow one another but this means no more than that we are conscious of them as in a temporal succession that is according to the form of our own internal sense time therefore is nothing by itself nor is it a determination inherent objectively in things   here follows in the second edition supplement xi   the first edition has diallele the second dialexe   veränderlich in the first edition is rightly corrected into theilbar in later editions though in the second it is still veränderlich   as if in the first thought were a function of the understanding in the second of the faculty of judgment in the third of reason a remark which will receive its elucidation in the sequel   see however karls remarks on p   0 p     of first edition   here follows in the second edition supplement xii   that is a transcendental deduction   read deren instead of dessen   the last paragraph is omitted in the second edition there is instead a criticism of locke and hume supplement xiii the deduction of the categories is much changed as seen in supplement xiv   this point is of great importance and should be carefully considered all representations have a necessary relation to some possible empirical consciousness for if they did not possess that relation and if it were entirely impossible to become conscious of them this would be the same as if they did not exist all empirical consciousness has a necessary relation to a transcendental consciousness which precedes all single experiences namely the consciousness of my own self as the original apperception it is absolutely necessary therefore that in my knowledge all consciousness should belong to one consciousness of my own self here we have a synthetical unity of the manifold consciousness which can be known a priori and which may thus supply a foundation for synthetical propositions a priori concerning pure thinking in the same way as space and time supply a foundation for synthetical propositions which concern the form of mere intuition the synthetical proposition that the different kinds of empirical consciousness must be connected in one selfconsciousness is the very first and synthetical foundation of all our thinking it should be remembered that the mere representation of the ego in reference to all other representations the collective unity of which would be impossible without it constitutes our transcendental consciousness it does not matter whether that representation is clear empirical consciousness or confused not even whether it is real but the possibility of the logical form of all knowledge rests necessarily on the relation to this apperception as a faculty   it has hardly struck any psychologist that this imagination is a necessary ingredient of perception this was partly owing to their confining this faculty to reproduction partly to our belief that the senses do not only give us impressions but compound them also for us thus producing pictures of objects this however beyond our receptivity of impressions requires something more namely a function for their synthesis   of may be omitted if we read aller empirischer gebrauch   that is out of one or out of the unity of apperception   deficiency in the faculty of judgment is really what we call stupidity and there is no remedy for that an obtuse and narrow mind deficient in nothing but a proper degree of understanding and correct concepts may be improved by study so far as to become even learned but as even then there is often a deficiency of judgment secunda petri we often meet with very learned men who in handling their learning betray that original deficiency which can never be mended   desselben has been changed into derselben in later editions desselben however may be meant to refer to urtheil as contained in urtheilskraft the second edition has desselben   read dem letzteren as corrected by rosenkranz for der letzteren   the insertion of man as suggested by rosenkranz is impossible   here follows in the second edition supplement xv   here follows in the later editions supplement xvi   here follows in the second edition supplement xvi b   kant wrote etwas — etwas auffallendes the second etwas being the adverb rosenkranz has left out one etwas without necessity it seems necessary however to add überlegung after transcendentalen as done by erdmann   anticipiren könne must certainly be added as suggested by schopenhauer   the first and later editions have a priori the correction is first made in the seventh edition        see supplement xvii   the first and second editions read when two terms of a proposition are given the third also   read den erscheinungen   i read deren and afterwards der ersteren though even then the whole passage is very involved professor noiré thinks that dessen may be referred to gebrauch and des ersteren to grundsatz   see supplement xviii   read das man   see supplement xix   read anzunehmamen berechtigt   the reading of the first edition is ursache ursachen is a conjecture made by rosenkranz and approved by others   it should be remarked that i am not speaking here of the change of certain relations but of the change of a state therefore when a body moves in a uniform way it does not change its state of movement but it does so when its motion increases or decreases   see supplement xx   the unity of the universe in which all phenomena are supposed to be connected is evidently a mere deduction of the quietly adopted principle of the communion of all substances as coexistent for if they were isolated they would not form parts of a whole and if their connection the reciprocity of the manifold were not necessary for the sake of their coexistence it would be impossible to use the latter which is a purely ideal relation as a proof of the former which is real we have shown however that communion is really the ground of the possibility of an empirical knowledge of coexistence and that really we can only conclude from this the existence of the former as its condition   here the same as transcendent   i have adopted erdmanns conjecture als solche begriffe instead of aus solchen begriffen   see supplement xxi   insert man before gleichwohl and leave out können at the end of the sentence   read seine ursache instead of ihre   no doubt by reality i assert more than by possibility but not in the thing itself which can never contain more in its reality than what is contained in its complete possibility while possibility is only the positing of a thing in reference to the understanding in its empirical use reality is at the same time a connection of it with perception   see supplement xxii   additions of the second edition   i am treating here of the real definition which not only puts in place of the name of a thing other and more intelligible words but that which contains a clear mark by which the object definitum can at all times be safely recognised and by which the defined concept becomes fit for practical use a real definition realarklärung must therefore render clear the concept itself and its objective reality also of this kind are the mathematical explanations which represent an object in intuition according to its concept   read nimmt instead of nehmen and können instead of könne   the passage from it seems to be to objective concepts is left out in the second edition and replaced by a short note see supplement xxiii   the passage from appearances to given to me in intuition is left out in the second edition and replaced by supplement xxiv   read welches instead of welcher   addition of the second edition   an additional note in the second edition is given in supplement xxv   whatever is omitted in the second edition   if one wished to use here the usual subterfuge that realitates noumena at least cannot oppose each other it would be necessary to produce an example of such pure and nonsensuous reality to enable us to see whether it was something or nothing no example however can be produced except from experience which never offers us anything but phenomena so that this proposition means really nothing but that a concept which contains affirmatives only contains no negative a proposition which we at least have never doubted   sensibility if subjected to the understanding as the object on which it exercises its function is the source of real knowledge but sensibility if it influences the action of the understanding itself and leads it on to a judgment is the cause of error   it is true however that he extended his concept of ideas to speculative knowledge also if only it was pure and given entirely a priori he extended it even to mathematics although they can have their object nowhere but in possible experience in this i cannot follow him nor in the mystical deduction of his ideas and in the exaggerations which led him as it were to hypostasise them although the highflown language which he used when treating of this subject may well admit of a milder interpretation and one more in accordance with the nature of things   instead of anleitung read ableitung   see supplement xxvi   transcendent is a misprint   all that follows from here to the beginning of the second chapter is left out in the second edition and replaced by supplement xxvii   afterwards transcendental instead of pure   it would be very easy to give to this argument the ordinary scholastic dress but for my purposes it is sufficient to have clearly exhibited even in a popular form the ground on which it rests   an elastic ball which impinges on another in a straight line communicates to it its whole motion and therefore if we only consider the places in space its whole state if then in analogy with such bodies we admit substances of which the one communicates to the other representations with consciousness we could imagine a whole series of them in which the first communicates its state and its consciousness to the second the second its own state with that of the first substance to a third and this again all the states of the former together with its own and a consciousness of them to another that last substance would be conscious of all the states of the previously changed substances as of its own because all of them had been transferred to it with the consciousness of them but for all that it would not have been the same person in all those states   we must well master this paradoxical but quite correct proposition that nothing can be in space except what is represented in it for space itself is nothing but representation and whatever is in it must therefore be contained in that representation there is nothing whatever in space except so far as it is really represented in it that a thing can exist only in the representation of it may no doubt sound strange but will lose its strangeness if we consider that the things with which we have to deal are not things by themselves but phenomena only that is representations   simplicität was a misprint for substantialität   ich bin was a mistake it can only be meant for ich denke   the absolute total of a series of conditions of anything given as conditioned is itself always unconditioned because there are no conditions beyond on which it could depend such an absolute total of a series is however an idea only or rather a problematical concept the possibility of which has to be investigated with reference to the mode in which the unconditioned that is in reality the transcendental idea with which we are concerned may be contained in it   nature if taken adjective formaliter is meant to express the whole complex of the determinations of a thing according to an inner principle of causality while if taken substantive materialiter it denotes the totality of phenomena so far as they are all held together by an internal principle of causality in the former meaning we speak of the nature of liquid matter of fire etc using the word adjective while if we speak of the objects of nature or of natural objects we have in our mind the idea of a subsisting whole   the antinomies follow each other according to the order of the transcendental ideas mentioned before p      p       we may perceive an indefinite quantum as a whole if it is included in limits without having to build up its totality by means of measuring that is by the successive synthesis of its parts the limits themselves determine its completeness by cutting off everything beyond   the concept of totality is in this case nothing but the representation of the completed synthesis of its parts because as we cannot deduce the concept from the intuition of the whole this being in this case impossible we can conceive it only through the synthesis of its parts up to the completion of the infinite at least in the idea   space is merely the form of external intuition formal intuition and not a real object that can be perceived by external intuition space as prior to all things which determine it fill or limit it or rather which give an empirical intuition determined by its form is under the name of absolute space nothing but a mere possibility of external phenomena so far as they either exist already or can be added to given phenomena empirical intuition therefore is not a compound of phenomena and of space perception and empty intuition the one is not a correlate of the other in a synthesis but the two are only connected as matter and form in one and the same empirical intuition if we try to separate one from the other and to place space outside all phenomena we arrive at a number of empty determinations of external intuition which however can never be possible perceptions for instance motion or rest of the world in an infinite empty space ie a determination of the mutual relation of the two which can never be perceived and is therefore nothing but the predicate of a mere idea   this quantum contains therefore a multitude of given units which is greater than any number this is the mathematical concept of the infinite   it is easily seen that what we wish to say is that empty space so far as limited by phenomena that is space within the world does not at least contradict transcendental principles and may be admitted therefore so far as they are concerned though by this its possibility is not asserted   rosenkranz thinks that atomus is here used intentionally by kant as a masculine to distinguish it from the atomon translated by scholastic philosophers as inseparable indiscernible simplex etc while with the greek philosophers atomus is feminine erdman however has shown that kant has used atomus elsewhere also as masculine   antithesis is a misprint   as formal condition of the possibility of changes time is no doubt objectively prior to them read dissen instead of disser subjectively however and in the reality of our consciousness the representation of time like every other is occasioned solely by perceptions   the word to begin is used in two senses the first is active when the cause begins or starts infit a series of states as its effect the second is passive or neuter when the causality begins in the cause itself fit i reason here from the former to the latter meaning   it is however doubtful whether epicurus did ever teach these principles as objective assertions if he meant them to be no more than maxims for the speculative use of reason he would have shown thereby a truer philosophical spirit than any of the philosophers on antiquity the principles that in explaining phenomena we must proceed as if the field of investigation were enclosed by no limit or beginning of the world that the material of the world should be accepted as it must be if we want to learn anything about it from experience that there is no origination of events except as determined by invariable laws of nature and lastly that we must not appeal to a cause distinct from the world all these are still perfectly true though seldom observed in enlarging the field of speculative philosophy or in discovering the principles of morality independently of foreign aid it is not permissible that those who wish only to ignore those dogmatical propositions while still engaged in mere speculation should be accused of wishing to deny them   though we cannot answer the question what kind of quality a transcendental object may possess or what it is we are well able to answer that the question itself is nothing because it is without an object all questions therefore of transcendental psychology are answerable and have been answered for they refer to the transcendental subject of all internal phenomena which itself is not phenomenal and not given as an object and possesses none of the conditions which make any of the categories and it is to them that the question really refers applicable to it we have therefore here a case where the common saying applies that no answer is as good as an answer that is that the question regarding the quality of something which cannot be conceived by any definite predicates being completely beyond the sphere of objects is entirely null and void   read keine in original not eine   see supplement xxviii   this cosmical series can therefore be neither greater nor smaller than the possible empirical regressus on which alone its concept rests and as this can give neither a definite infinite nor a definite finite absolutely limited it becomes clear that we cannot accept the quantity of the world either as finite or as infinite because the regressus by which it is represented admits of neither the one nor the other   it will have been observed that the argument has here been carried on in a very different way from the dogmatical argument which was presented before in the antithesis of the first antinomy there we took the world of sense according to the common and dogmatical view as a thing given by itself in its totality before any regressus and we had denied to it if it did not occupy all time and all space any place at all in both hence the conclusion also was different from what it is here for it went to the real infinity of the world   mathematical omitted in the first and second editions   the understanding admits of no condition among phenomena which should itself be empirically unconditioned but if we might conceive an intelligible condition that is to say a condition not belonging itself as a link to the series of phenomena of something conditioned as a phenomenon without in the least interrupting the series of empirical conditions such a condition might be admitted as empirically unconditioned without interfering with the empirical continuous regressus   it seems better to read noumenon instead of phenomenon   the true morality of actions merit or guilt even that of our own conduct remains therefore entirely hidden our imputations can refer to the empirical character only how much of that may be the pure effect of freedom how much should be ascribed to nature only and to the faults of temperament for which man is not responsible or its happy constitution merits fortunae no one can discover and no one can judge with perfect justice   after anzusehen sind may be added for the sake of clearness but it is often omitted in kants style   according to this principle therefore everything is referred to a common correlate that is the whole possibility which if it that is the matter for all possible predicates could be found in the idea of any single thing would prove an affinity of all possible things through the identity of the ground of their complete determination the determinability of any concept is subordinate to the universality universalitas of the principle of the excluded middle while the determination of a thing is subordinate to the totality universitas or the sum total of all possible predicates   the observations and calculations of astronomers have taught us much that is wonderful but the most important is that they have revealed to us the abyss of our ignorance which otherwise human reason could never have conceived so great to meditate on this must produce a great change in the determination of the aims of our reason   this ideal of the most real of all things although merely a representation is first realised that is changed into an object then hypostasised and lastly by the natural progress of reason towards unity as we shall presently show personified because the regulative unity of experience does not rest on the phenomena themselves sensibility alone but on the connection of the manifold through the understanding in an apperception so that the unity of the highest reality and the complete determinability possibility of all things seem to reside in a supreme understanding and therefore in an intelligence   read nothwendig instead of unmöglich noiré   a concept is always possible if it is not selfcontradictory this is the logical characteristic of possibility and by it the object of the concept is distinguished from the nihil negativum but it may nevertheless be an empty concept unless the objective reality of the synthesis by which the concept is generated has been distinctly shown this however as shown above must always rest on principles of possible experience and not on the principle of analysis the principle of contradiction this is a warning against inferring at once from the possibility of concepts logical the possibility of things real   this conclusion is too well known to require detailed exposition it rests on the apparently transcendental law of causality in nature that everything contingent has its cause which if contingent again must likewise have a cause till the series of subordinate causes ends in an absolutely necessary cause without which it could not be complete   not theological ethics for these contain moral laws which presuppose the existence of a supreme ruler of the world while ethicotheology is the conviction of the existence of a supreme being founded on moral laws   read ausgeschossen   read keiner instead of keine   instead of alle read als   the early editions read transcendenten instead of transcendentalen which is given in the corrigenda of the fifth edition it is not impossible however that kant may have meant to write transcendenten in order to indicate the illegitimate use of these concepts   the advantage which arises from the circular shape of the earth is well known but few only know that its flattening which gives it the form of a spheroid alone prevents the elevations of continents or even of smaller volcanically raised mountains from continuously and within no very great space of time considerably altering the axis of the earth the protuberance of the earth at the equator forms however so considerable a mountain that the impetus of every other mountain can never drive it perceptibly out of its position with reference to the axis of the earth and yet people do not hesitate to explain this wise arrangement simply from the equilibrium of the once fluid mass   this was a name given by the old dialecticians to a sophistical argument which ran thus if it is your fate that you should recover from this illness you will recover whether you send for a doctor or not cicero says that this argument was called ignava ratio because if we followed it reason would have no use at all in life it is for this reason that i apply the same name to this sophistical argument of pure reason   after what i have said before about the psychological idea and its proper destination to serve as a regulative principle only for the use of reason there is no necessity for my discussing separately and in full detail the transcendental illusion which leads us to represent hypostatically that systematical unity of the manifold phenomena of the internal sense the procedure would here be very similar to that which we are following in our criticism of the theological ideal   instead of der erscheinungen read die erscheinungen   i am well aware that in the language of the schools discipline is used as synonymous with instruction but there are so many cases in which the former term in the sense of restraint is carefully distinguished from the latter in the sense of teaching and the nature of things makes it so desirable to preserve the only suitable expressions for that distinction that i hope that the former term may never be allowed to be used in any but a negative meaning   in the concept of cause i really pass beyond the empirical concept of an event but not to the intuition which represents the concept of cause in concreto but to the conditions of time in general which in experience might be found in accordance with the concept of cause i therefore proceed here according to concepts only but cannot proceed by means of the construction of concepts because the concept is only a rule for the synthesis of perceptions which are not pure intuitions and therefore cannot be given a priori   completeness means clearness and sufficiency of predicates limits mean precision no more predicates being given than belong to the complete concept in its primary character means that the determination of these limits is not derived from anything else and therefore in need of any proof because this would render the socalled definition incapable of standing at the head of all the judgments regarding its object   philosophy swarms with faulty definitions particularly such as contain some true elements of a definition but not all if therefore it were impossible to use a concept until it had been completely defined philosophy would fare very ill as however we may use a definition with perfect safety so far at least as the elements of the analysis will carry us imperfect definitions also that is propositions which are not yet properly definitions but are yet true and therefore approximations to a definition may be used with great advantage in mathematics definitions belong ad esse in philosophy ad melius esse it is desirable but it is extremely difficult to construct a proper definition jurists are without a definition of right to the present day   read reine instead of keine   all practical concepts relate to objects of pleasure or displeasure that is of joy or pain and therefore at least indirectly to objects of our feelings but as feeling is not a faculty of representing things but lies outside the whole field of our powers of cognition the elements of our judgments so far as they relate to pleasure or pain that is the elements of practical judgments do not belong to transcendental philosophy which is concerned exclusively with pure cognitions a priori   the interest which the human mind takes in morality an interest which as i believe is necessary to every rational being is natural though it is not undivided and always practically preponderant if you strengthen and increase that interest you will find reason very docile and even more enlightened so as to be able to join the speculative with the practical interests if you do not take care that you first make men at least moderately good you will never make them honest believers   cosmical concept is meant here for a concept relating to what must be of interest to everybody while i determine the character of a science according to scholastic concepts if i look upon it only as one of many crafts intended for certain objects   it must not be supposed that i mean by this what is commonly called physica generalis and which is rather mathematics than a philosophy of nature for the metaphysic of nature is entirely separate from mathematics and does not enlarge our knowledge as much as mathematics but it is nevertheless very important as supplying a criticism of the pure knowledge of the understanding that should be applied to nature for want of its guidance even mathematicians given to certain common concepts which in reality are metaphysical have unconsciously encumbered physical science with hypotheses which vanish under a criticism of those principles without however causing the least detriment to the necessary employment of mathematics in this field   kant himself in a letter to schütz darstellung seines lebens von seinem sohn halle      band ii s  0  pointed out the mistake which appears in the preface to the  nd edition namely gleichseitig equilateral instead of gleichschenkelig isosceles   i am not closely following here the course of the history of the experimental method nor are the first beginnings of it very well known   this method borrowed from the student of nature consists in our looking for the elements of pure reason in that which can be confirmed or refuted by experiment now it is impossible in order to test the propositions of pure reason particularly if they venture beyond all the limits of possible experience to make any experiment with their objects as in natural science we can therefore only try with concepts and propositions which we admit a priori by so contriving that the same objects may be considered on one side as objects of the senses and of the understanding in experience and on the other as objects which are only thought intended it may be for the isolated reason which strives to go beyond all the limits of experience this gives us two different sides to be looked at and if we find that by looking on things from that twofold point of view there is an agreement with the principle of pure reason while by admitting one point of view only there arises an inevitable conflict with reason then the experiment decides in favour of the correctness of that distinction   this experiment of pure reason has a great similarity with that of the chemists which they sometimes call the experiment of reduction or the synthetical process in general the analysis of the metaphysician divided pure knowledge a priori into two very heterogeneous elements namely the knowledge of things as phenomena and of things by themselves dialectic combines these two again to bring them into harmony with the necessary idea of the unconditioned demanded by reason and then finds that this harmony can never be obtained except through the above distinction which therefore must be supposed to be true   in the same manner the laws of gravity determining the movements of the heavenly bodies imparted the character of established certainty to what copernicus had assumed at first as an hypothesis only and proved at the same time the invisible force the newtonian attraction which holds the universe together which would have remained for ever undiscovered if copernicus had not dared by an hypothesis which though contradicting the senses was yet true to seek the observed movements not in the heavenly bodies but in the spectator i also propose in this preface my own view of metaphysics which has so many analogies with the copernican hypothesis as an hypothesis only though in the critique itself it is proved by means of our representations of space and time and the elementary concepts of the understanding not hypothetically but apodictically for i wish that people should observe the first attempts at such a change which must always be hypothetical   in order to know an object i must be able to prove its possibility either from its reality as attested by experience or a priori by means of reason but i can think whatever i please provided only i do not contradict myself that is provided my conception is a possible thought though i may be unable to answer for the existence of a corresponding object in the sum total of all possibilities before i can attribute to such a concept objective reality real possibility as distinguished from the former which is purely logical something more is required this something more however need not be sought for in the sources of theoretical knowledge for it may be found in those of practical knowledge also   the only thing which might be called an addition though in the method of proof only is the new refutation of psychological idealism and the strict and as i believe the only possible proof of the objective reality of external phenomena on p     suppl xxi that idealism may be considered entirely innocent with respect to the essential aims of metaphysic though it is not so in reality yet it remains a scandal to philosophy and to human reason in general that we should have to accept the existence of things without us from which we derive the whole material of knowledge for our own internal sense on faith only unable to meet with any satisfactory proof an opponent who is pleased to doubt it see p     it will probably be urged against this proof that after all i am immediately conscious of that only which is within me that is of my representation of external things and that consequently it must still remain uncertain whether there be outside me anything corresponding to it or not but by internal experience i am conscious of my existence in xl time consequently also of its determinability in time and this is more than to be conscious of my representation only and yet identical with the empirical consciousness of my existence which can be itself determined only by something connected with my existence yet outside me this consciousness of my existence in time is therefore connected as identical with the consciousness of relation to something outside me so that it is experience and not fiction sense and not imagination which indissolubly connects the external with my internal sense the external sense is by itself a relation of intuition to something real outside me and its real in contradistinction to a purely imaginary character rests entirely on its being indissolubly connected with internal experience as being the condition of its possibility this is what happens here if with the intellectual consciousness of my existence in the representation i am which accompanies all my judgments and all acts of my understanding i could at the same time connect a determination of that existence of mine by means of intellectual intuition then that determination would not require the consciousness of relation to something outside me but although that intellectual consciousness comes first the inner intuition in which alone any existence can be determined is sensuous and dependent on the condition of time and that determination again and therefore internal experience itself depends on something permanent which is not within me consequently on something outside me only to which i must consider myself as standing in a certain relation hence the reality of the external sense is necessarily connected in order to make experience possible at all with the reality of the internal sense that is i am conscious with the same certainty that there are things outside me which have a reference to my sense as that i exist myself in time in order to ascertain to what given intuitions objects outside me really correspond these intuitions belonging to the external sense and not to the faculty of imagination we must in each single case apply the rules according to which experience in general even internal is distinguished from imaginations the proposition that there really is an external experience being always taken for granted it may be well to add here the remark that the representation of something permanent in existence is not the same as a permanent representation for this the representation of something permanent in existence can change and alternate as all our representations even those of matter and may yet refer to something permanent which must therefore be something external and different from all my representations the existence of which is necessarily involved in the determination of my own existence and constitutes with it but one experience which could never take place internally unless in part it were external also the how admits here of as little explanation as the permanent in time in general the coexistence of which with the variable produces the concept of change   according to an emendation adopted both by vaihinger and adickes   this paragraph from it is true to intuition seems to have been a marginal note as shown by dr vaihinger see translators preface p lii   one might doubt this with regard to pure natural science but one has only to consider the different propositions which stand at the beginning of real empirical physical science those for example relating to the permanence of the same quantity of matter to the vis inertiae the equality of action and reaction etc in order to become convinced that they constitute a physica pura or rationalis which well deserves to stand by itself as an independent science in its whole extent whether narrow or wide   phenomenal predicates can be attributed to the object in its relation to our sense as for instance to the rose its red colour and its scent but what is merely illusion can never be attributed to an object as a predicate for the simple reason that the illusion attributes to the object by itself something which belongs to it only in its relation to the senses or to a subject in general as for instance the two handles which were formerly attributed to saturn that which is never to be found in the object itself but always in its relation to a subject and is inseparable from its representation by a subject is phenomenal and the predicates of space and time are therefore rightly attributed to objects of the senses as such in this there is no illusion if on the contrary i were to attribute to the rose by itself redness handles to saturn and extension to all external objects without restricting my judgment to the relation of these objects to a subject we should have illusion   metaphysical elements of natural science   whether the representations themselves are identical and whether therefore one can be thought analytically by the other is a matter of no consequence here the consciousness of the one has always to be distinguished from the consciousness of the other so far as the manifold is concerned and everything here depends on the synthesis only of this possible consciousness   this analytical unity of consciousness belongs to all general concepts as such if for instance i think red in general i represent to myself a property which as a characteristic mark may be found in something or can be connected with other representations that is to say only under a presupposed possible synthetical unity can i represent to myself the analytical a representation which is to be thought as common to different representations is looked upon as belonging to such as possess besides it something different it must therefore have been thought in synthetical unity with other though only possible representations before i can think in it that analytical unity of consciousness which makes it a conceptus communis the synthetical unity of apperception is therefore the highest point with which all employment of the understanding and even the whole of logic and afterwards the whole of transcendental philosophy must be connected ay that faculty is the understanding itself   space and time and all portions thereof are intuitions and consequently single representations with the manifold of their content see the transcendental æsthetic they are not therefore mere concepts through which the same consciousness as existing in many representations but intuitions through which many representations are brought to us as contained in one and in its consciousness this latter therefore is compounded and these intuitions represent the unity of consciousness as synthetical but yet as primitive this character of singleness in them is practically of great importance see §      the lengthy doctrine of the four syllogistic figures concerns categorical syllogisms only and though it is really nothing but a trick for obtaining the appearance of more modes of concluding than that of the first figure by secretly introducing immediate conclusions consequentiae immediatae among the premisses of a pure syllogism this would hardly have secured its great success had not its authors succeeded at the same time in establishing the exclusive authority of categorical judgments as those to which all others must be referred this as we showed in §   p    is wrong   the proof of this rests on the represented unity of intuition by which an object is given and which always includes a synthesis of the manifold which is given for an intuition and contains the relation of the latter to the unity of apperception   motion of an object in space does not belong to a pure science consequently not to geometry because the fact that a thing is moveable cannot be known a priori but from experience only motion however considered as describing a space is a pure act of successive synthesis of the manifold in external intuition in general by means of productive imagination and belongs therefore by right not only to geometry but even to transcendental philosophy   i do not see how so much difficulty should be found in admitting that the internal sense is affected by ourselves every act of attention gives us an instance of it in such an act the understanding always determines the internal sense according to the connection which it thinks to such an internal intuition as corresponds to the manifold in the synthesis of the understanding how much the mind is commonly affected thereby anybody will be able to perceive in himself   the i think expresses the act of determining my own existence what is thus given is the existence but what is not yet given is the manner in which i am to determine it that is in which i am to place within me the manifold belonging to it for that purpose selfintuition is required which depends on an a priori form that is on time which is sensuous and belongs to our receptivity of what is given to us as determinable if then i have not another selfintuition which likewise before the act of determination gives the determining within me of the spontaneity of which i am conscious only as time gives the determinable i cannot determine my existence as that of a spontaneously acting being but i only represent to myself the spontaneity of my thinking that is of the act of determination my existence remaining sensuous only that is determinable as the existence of a phenomenon it is however on account of this spontaneity that i call myself an intelligence   space represented as an object as required in geometry contains more than the mere form of intuition namely the comprehension of the manifold which is given according to the form of sensibility into a perceptible intuitable representation so that the form of intuition gives the manifold only while the formal intuition gives unity of representation in the æsthetic i had simply ascribed this unity to sensibility in order to show that it precedes all concepts though it presupposes a synthesis not belonging to the senses and by which all concepts of space and time become first possible for as by that synthesis the understanding determining the sensibility space and time are first given as intuitions the unity of that intuition a priori belongs to space and time and not to the concept of the understanding see §      in this manner it is proved that the synthesis of apprehension which is empirical must necessarily conform to the synthesis of apperception which is intellectual and contained in the category entirely a priori it is one and the same spontaneity which there under the name of imagination and here under the name of understanding brings connection into the manifold of intuition   lest anybody should be unnecessarily frightened by the dangerous consequences of this proposition i shall only remark that the categories are not limited for the purpose of thought by the conditions of our sensuous intuition but have really an unlimited field it is only the knowledge of that which we think the determining of an object that requires intuition and even in the absence of intuition the thought of the object may still have its true and useful consequences so far as the subjective use of reason is concerned that use of reason however as it is not always directed to the determination of the object that is to knowledge but also to the determination of the subject and its volition cannot be treated of in this place   kant does not carry the division into paragraphs in his second edition further because as he says he has to treat no more of elementary concepts and prefers in representing their employment to adopt a continuous treatment without paragraphs   this passage has been translated as amended by kant himself in the preface to the second edition p       the immediate consciousness of the existence of external things is not simply assumed in the preceding theorem but proved whether we can understand the possibility of this consciousness or not the question with regard to that possibility would come to this whether we have an internal sense only and no external sense but merely an external imagination it is clear however that even in order to imagine only something as external that is to represent it to the senses in intuition we must have an external sense and thus distinguish immediately the mere receptivity of an external intuition from that spontaneity which characterizes every act of imagination for merely to imagine an external sense would really be to destroy the faculty of intuition which is to be determined by the faculty of imagination   read der instead of als   it is easy enough to conceive the nonexistence of matter but the ancients did not infer from this its contingency not even the change of being and notbeing of any given state of a thing which constitutes all change can prove the contingency of that state as if from the reality of its opposite the rest of a body for instance following on its motion does not yet prove the contingency of that motion because the former is the opposite of the latter the opposite here is opposed to the other not realiter but logically only in order to prove the contingency of the motion of a body we should have to prove that instead of the motion at the antecedent point of time it would have been possible for the body to have been at rest at that very time not that it is at rest afterwards for in this case both opposites are quite consistent with each other   the thinking is taken in each of the two premisses in a totally different meaning — in the major as it refers to an object in general and therefore also as it may be given in intuition but in the minor only as it exists in its relation to selfconsciousness where no object is thought of but where we only represent the relation to the self as the subject as the form of thought in the former things are spoken of that cannot be conceived otherwise than as subjects while in the second we do not speak of things but of the thinking abstraction being made of all objects wherein the ego always serves as the subject of consciousness the conclusion therefore ought not to be that i cannot exist otherwise than as a subject but only that in thinking my existence i can use myself as the subject of a judgment only this is an identical proposition and teaches us nothing whatever as to the mode of our existence   clearness is not as the logicians maintain the consciousness of a representation for a certain degree of consciousness though insufficient for recollection must exist even in many dark representations because without all consciousness we should make no distinction in the connection of dark representations which yet we are able to do with the notae of many concepts such as those of right and justice or as the musician does who in improvising strikes several keys at once a representation is clear in which the consciousness is sufficient for a consciousness of its difference from others if the consciousness is sufficient for distinguishing but not for a consciousness of the difference the representation would still have to be called dark there is therefore an infinite number of degrees of consciousness down to its complete vanishing   those who in establishing the possibility of a new theory imagine that they have done enough if they can show triumphantly that no one can show a contradiction in their premisses as do those who believe that they understand the possibility of thinking of which they have an example in the empirical intuitions of human life only even after the cessation of life can be greatly embarrassed by other possible theories which are not a whit bolder than their own such is for instance the possibility of a division of simple substance into several or of the coalition of several substances into one simple substance for although divisibility presupposes a composite it does not necessarily require a composite of substances but of degrees only of the manifold faculties of one and the same substance as then we may conceive all powers and faculties of the soul even that of consciousness as diminished by onehalf the substance still remaining we may also represent to ourselves without any contradiction that extinguished half as preserved though not within it but outside it so that as the whole of what is real in it and has a degree and therefore the whole existence of it without any rest has been halved another separate substance would arise apart from it for the plurality which has been divided existed before though not as a plurality of substances yet of every reality as a quantum of existence in it and the unity of substance was only a mode of existence which by mere division has been changed into a plurality of substantiality in the same manner several simple substances might coalesce again into one nothing being lost thereby but merely the plurality of substantiality so that one substance would contain in itself the degree of reality of all former substances together we might suppose that the simple substances which give us matter as a phenomenon not indeed through a mechanical or chemical influence upon each other but yet it may be by some unknown influence of which the former is only a manifestation produce by such a dynamical division of parental souls taken as intensive quantities what may be called childsouls while they themselves repair their loss again through a coalition with new matter of the same kind i am far from allowing the slightest value of validity to such vague speculations and i hope that the principles of our analytic have given a sufficient warning against using the categories as for instance that of substance for any but empirical purposes but if the rationalist is bold enough to create an independent being out of the mere faculty of thought without any permanent intuition by which an object can be given simply because the unity of apperception in thought does not allow him to explain it as something composite instead of simply confessing that he cannot explain the possibility of a thinking nature why should not a materialist though he can as little appeal to experience in support of his theories be entitled to use the same boldness and use his principle for the opposite purpose though retaining the formal unity on which his opponent relied   the i think is as has been stated an empirical proposition and contains within itself the proposition i exist i cannot say however everything which thinks exists for in that case the property of thinking would make all beings which possess it necessary beings therefore my existence cannot as descartes supposed be considered as derived from the proposition i think for in that case the major everything that thinks exists ought to have preceded but is identical with it it expresses an indefinite empirical intuition that is a perception and proves therefore that this proposition asserting existence is itself based on sensation which belongs to sensibility but it precedes experience which is meant to determine the object of perception through the categories in respect to time existence therefore is here not yet a category which never refers to an indefinitely given object but only to one of which we have a concept and of which we wish to know whether it exists also apart from that conception or no an indefinite perception signifies here something real only that has been given merely for thinking in general not therefore as a phenomenon nor as a thing by itself noumenon but as something that really exists and is designated as such in the proposition i think for it must be observed that if i have called the proposition i think an empirical proposition i did not mean to say thereby that the ego in that proposition is an empirical representation it is rather purely intellectual because it belongs to thought in general without some empirical representation however which supplies the matter for thought the act i think would not take place and the empirical is only the condition of the application or of the use of the pure intellectual faculty   it is necessary to put a comma after
