celestina in four volumes  celestina a novel in four volumes  by charlotte smith  vol iii  london printed for t cadell in the strand mdccxci  celestina chapter i at the end of a week celestina with mrs elphinstone and her children were arrived at the small village of kirby thorn where as the youngest of the little boys had appeared the preceding day to droop his mother determined to pass the night celestina who saw her friend greatly alarmed by the indisposition of the child endeavored to appease her fears by imputing it to the fatigue and heat of their journey but the terrified mother saw every moment new grounds for her apprehensions and the next day the child was evidently much worse four and twenty hours more passed in painful solicitude and then mrs elphinstone knew that it was the measles and became much easier though the eldest boy had every symptom of having taken the same disorder  mrs elphinstone never left her children a moment and celestina with the tenderest solicitude assisted her the elder boy was of a sanguine and irritable constitution and the eruptive fever ran high while the situation they were in at a little inn where the servants and children of the house had not had the distemper was rendered extremely uncomfortable by the fears of it is other inhabitants  the murmurs of the landlady and the reluctance of the servants  celestina with that cheerful benignity which was on all occasions ready for the service of the distressed now acted for her friend almost the part of a servant and in her frequent visits to the kitchen for what was wanted in the sick room she saw three servents a postillion and two footmen and observed that they seemed fixed there and were not at present traveling the men were remarkably well behaved and observing the discontent of the people of the inn had more than once offered to go out for her on any messages she might have occasion to send  the mind of celestina was however too much occupied by the little invalids to suffer her curiosity to be awakened by this circumstance and she never enquired to whom these servants nor a very plain but fashionable post chaise about which she saw them sometimes busied belonged the children were in the height of the distemper and the anxious mother and celestina entirely occupied about them when a very decent person about fifty who had the look of a housekeeper to some person of fashion came to the door of their room which was left open for the sake of air and asking permission to come in told them that her lady lady horatia howard had ordered her to wait on them to enquire if her servants or any thing in her power could contribute to the ease of the children or the ladies to whom they belonged  mrs elphinstone returned a proper answer to this very polite and humane message and after the person who had delivered it was withdrawn celestina pausing a moment said that she recollected the name of lady horatia howard and that she was one of the friends most esteemed among the numerous acquaintance cultivated by mrs willoughby  it was now debated between them whether after so obliging a message celestina should not make herself known to lady horatia mrs elphinstone was inclined to think she ought but celestina seemed rather disposed to avoid it  it is true said she that i recollect my dear mrs willoughby to have been very partial to her but it is probable that she has long since forgotten me and that i shall be exposed to the disagreeable necessity of announcing myself and recalling to her mind circumstances which i cannot remember but with pain perhaps too she may know the strange occurrences which have since happened and though i remember her conversation to have been very refined and elegant perhaps she may expect if she honors me with her notice that i should prove myself worthy of it by relating all that has happened for who knows in what light the castlenorths may have represented my conduct i am unequal to all this i fear and unless to avail myself of our former acquaintance will be of any use to you my dear mrs elphinstone i shall not for my own fake only endeavor to renew it  in a few hours afterward however lady horatia who had heard from her servant of the fine form and amiable manners of the young person who was so attentive to the sick children contrived to have a door left open by which she must pass and seeing her immediately knew her on her return into the room therefore lady horatia sent her woman again with her compliments begging to know if the name of one of the ladies was not de mornay and if it was requesting the favor of speaking to her  celestina could not now decline going and following the messenger was shown into a room where lady horatia sat alone  pardon me dear miss de mornay cried she the moment she entered if instead of waiting on you i request to see you here the truth is i am foolishly affected by the sight of illness that which has attacked your little friends is not however i hope dangerous  celestina who by the freedom and kindness of this address was immediately relieved from some little uneasiness which she had felt from this unexpected interview answered with all her usual ease and grace and lady horatia who seemed extremely pleased with having met her enquired after lady molyneux and such other of their former friends as she thought would renew no unpleasing recollections for though she did not know all that had happened she was well aware how cruel a blow the death of mrs willoughby had been to celestina and had heard some confused reports that the marriage of willoughby and miss fitzhayman was interrupted by his prior attachment to his mothers ward but she knew not how far celestina had been preferred to the haughty heiress and though she had always a partial kindness to her when she used to meet her at mrs willoughbys she had lost fight of her entirely afterward and after some enquiries concluded she was gone back to france  the sight of her now at a remote inn in the north was as agreeable as it was unexpected and though the difference of their ages seemed to preclude any great degree of intimacy before for lady horatia was passed the middle of life yet now she felt herself strongly disposed to cultivate a pleasure thus thrown in her way celestina could not be insensible of the honor she derived from the notice of a person more eminent for her goodness and her talents than her birth or her fortune and always pleasing she grew infinitely more so where she desired to please in a few hours therefore they became so happy with each other that lady horatia could not part with her but with regret and celestina would have left her with reluctance on any other occasion than to attend the children of her friend which during her absence mrs hemmings lady horatias woman had done with an attention that prevented mrs elphinstones suffering from the engagement of celestina with her lady  the children became better and their mother easier lady horatia saw and liked her and invited both her and celestina to give her as much of their time as they could spare from their little convalescents in consequence of this invitation they were now a good deal with her and mrs elphinstone on some occasion expressing how fortunate she thought herself that in so remote a place she had the honor of becoming known to her lady horatia said smiling  and i dare say you think it very extraordinary too my dear madam for unless you had known me before it would be difficult to account for my being here did you never remark that unhappiness makes people restless  oh yes very often replied mrs elphinstone with a sigh  it has had that effect on me said lady horatia and satiated with every thing in what is called the world where i have passed the greater part of my life i often leave it and ramble about careless of every thing but change of place my old faithful servants and a few books being the sole companions of my travels i have for these last four or five years given up my house in the country and passed all the summer in wandering about switzerland france and england this year i am going into scotland for no other reason than because i have not been there before at this village one of my horses fell lame and as it was indifferent to me where i was i agreed to my servants request of staying here a day or two while i waited you arrived here and i own very sincerely that i became interested for the children and for the ladies such as hemmings described them to me i hope we shall none of us be sorry for the accidents that detained us here when the little boys are quite well as i am persuaded they will be now in a few days they will have passed happily through a very troublesome distemper and i think you will each of you have added a friend to your stock the advantage however will be still more evidently mine for i hope to have added two  a few days confirmed the good opinion which lady horatia entertained of her new acquaintance and her acquaintance of her if she was particularly attached to celestina it was because she was young enough to be her daughter and because she told her that she could not look at her especially when she was reading or employed in any thing that gave a serious cast to her features without remarking her likeness to a person she had once fondly loved  celestina whose thoughts were perpetually fixed on the strange mystery which hung over her birth and who caught at every thing likely to clear it up blushed deeply the first time she made this remark and asked whether this person was a foreigner  lady horatia sighed in her turn and said no it was a brother of hers who had not been long dead he was a soldier said she and lost his life in america in that war which tore it from the british empire judge yourself of the likeness though i well know it must be accidental  she then took out of a traveling trunk a little filligreed casket in which were several valuable trinkets and several pictures three were the portraits of gentlemen  come said lady horatia to prove whether this resemblance is merely a chimera of mine let us ask mrs elphinstone if among these pictures she sees one which is like any body she knows for my dear miss de mornay do you know this similitude of countenance struck me when you were a child with mrs willoughby and now that your features are more formed it is in my mind wonderfully strong but my sweet friend why do you appear so uneasy  i cannot very well tell replied celestina trying to force a smile i am sure to bear a resemblance to any body dear to your ladyship must be ever pleasing to me though i well know that it must be as you observe quite accidental  mrs elphinstone then coming in lady horatia showed her the three portraits  come tell us mrs elphinstone if you know any living friend whom either of these portraits resembles  mrs elphinstone took them and looked steadily a moment on each then fixing on one she looked more intently first on that and then on celestina indeed i think i do cried she i surely see a resemblance  a very strong resemblance between this picture and miss de mornay bless me how very like the shape of the face the mouth the darkbrown eyebrow the color of the eyes the setting on of the hair round the forehead and temples except that it is less fair that the features are proportionably larger and that you wear a cap in truth my dear friend it might have been drawn for you  and yet said lady horatia smiling mournfully this was drawn for a brother of mine who could i fear be no relation to our lovely friend here so strangely it happens that features coincide  it is fortunate very fortunate for me madam said celestina gravely if this resemblance has had the effect of prejudicing your ladyship in my favor  you have merit enough to justify it though i had conceived an affection for you without any introduction but we will talk no more of resemblances if such discourse makes us melancholy  lady horatia then turned the conversation and the next day as the two little boys were by this time well enough to continue their journey they moved on about twenty miles together lady horatia begging for that day to have celestina with her while her woman went with mrs elphinstone to assist in the care of her children  celestina who knew only in general that lady horatia was a widow of very affluent fortune who gave up much of her time to literary pursuits and literary connections and much of her fortune to the assistance of the unhappy now learned that domestic misfortunes had contributed with her natural turn of mind to estrange her entirely from those scenes where celestina had sometimes formerly seen her and that having lost an only daughter the last of her children of a deep decline she now tried to call off her mind from the subjects of her mournful contemplations by change of place and had never since that period resided long at any of her own houses but had passed almost the whole year in traveling stopping wherever she found a pleasant spot and often remaining several days or even weeks at some remote house she had once or twice she said engaged friends to go with her on these expeditions but had always found the difficulties they made so much counterbalance the pleasure they were capable of affording her that she now traveled alone some said she were tired and some were tasteless some were talkative and some were insipid you will certainly think me fastidious and perhaps i am so but indeed it is more difficult to find such a companion as suits me in every respect than appears at first view women of my own age who are established in the world cannot of course leave their families and connections those who are not are for the most part unhappy from pecuniary or family distresses and the mind depressed at that period of life has lost it is power of resistance and sinks in that hopeless languor from which i often want to be myself relieved by cheerful conversation the young do not travel for prospects or enjoy cataracts and mountains they are looking out for lovers and are wearied when there are neither men to talk to or adventures to be hoped for i have tried two or three young ladies and found that as we had no ideas in common our conversation was soon exhausted and when i was near any place of summer resort or passed through a town at the time of a race or a music meeting their hearts were beating to enter into scenes which i was only solicitous to fly from do you know however that if i had not met you absolutely engaged on this scottish journey i should have been strongly tempted to enquire whether you would allow me to make the experiment once more where i am strongly impressed with an idea that i should meet with better success  celestina answered that her good opinion did her the utmost honor and by degrees the tender and maternal solicitude lady horatia expressed for her drew from her the little narrative of her life lady horatia expressed the greatest aversion to lady castlenorth it is true said she i do hot know her much from my own observation for she is a woman whose conversation i have always disliked and avoided but from some anecdotes of her that have been related to me by those who know her well i believe it may with truth be said of her as was said of a celebrated political character that she has a heart to imagine a head to contrive and a hand to execute any mischief willoughby is young openhearted and artless by no means likely to suspect or likely to detect artifice so deep as what she is capable of and i am well convinced that there are no contrivances at which she would hesitate either to carry a favorite point or avenge it is failure  celestina was extremely comforted by this opinion given by so good a judge every other sorrow was comparatively light to that which she felt from the idea whenever it forced itself upon her mind that willoughby had through ambition or caprice or avarice voluntarily deserted her and every opinion that strengthened her own hopes of his unaltered affection and imputed his leaving her to the evil machinations of the castlenorths was soothing and consolatory  lady horatia howard was now traveling toward edinburgh and made the time of mrs elphinstone her own for the pleasure she derived from her company and still more from that of celestina to whom during this journey she became so much attached that she made her promise to come to her whenever the abode she was now going to should be inconvenient or whenever she was under the necessity of changing it an invitation so flattering was gratefully accepted and lady horatia having shown both her traveling friends every polite and generous attention took leave of them with regret on their leaving edinburgh with elphinstone who was there waiting for them she gave celestina directions whither to write to her for the remainder of the summer and again made her promise to come to her in the winter if she left her scottish friends and at all events to contrive to pass with her two or three months of the next summer after taking leave of her a very tedious and very dreary journey of many days brought the elphinstones and celestina to the sea side where they were to embark for the isle of sky mrs elphinstone accustomed to see so many different countries was yet struck with dismay at the sight of the black and dreary heaths over which they traveled and in spite of all her attempts to sustain her courage she looked at her children with eyes where maternal anguish was too visibly expressed elphinstone however to whom novelty had always charms was not yet weary of his situation and he was as gay and unconcerned as if he had been leading his wife to the most beautiful estate in england celestina though very little delighted with the country they had passed through was determined to testify no dislike to it that might add to the painful dejection of her friend and by making light of the inconveniences of the journey and putting their hopes and prospects in the fairest light she supported her drooping spirits which the thoughtless and somewhat unfeeling vivacity of elphinstone himself served rather to depress than to support  chapter ii arrived at their insular abode after great fatigue mrs elphinstone recalling all her fortitude busied herself in making it as comfortable as she could and assumed at least the appearance of cheerfulness though celestina saw with concern that it was often but appearance celestina herself however whose mind had too long been unpleasingly called off from that object on which she best loved to fix it was far from being displeased by the perfect seclusion of the place she could now wander whole days alone amid the wild solitude in which she found herself listening only to the rush of the cataract which dashing through broken stones sparkled amid the dark heath on either side of it or the sullen waves of the ocean itself which on all sides surrounded her the ptarmigan a bird of the grous kind common in the highlands of scotland bursting from it is heathy covert or the sea fowl screeming from the rocks were the only sounds that broke these murmurs but she found her spirits soothed by the wildness of the places she visited and far from regretting the more cultivated scenes she had left she rejoiced that since she no longer could hope to see willoughby she was released from the necessity of attending to any other person  the immense distance that was now between them she sometimes considered with dismay but at others she remembered  that distance only cannot change the heart  she trusted on the long tried the long assured tenderness of her lover and was willing to indulge the soothing hope that they should meet again to be separated no more and that he was laboring to remove the fatal obstacle whatever it was that now divided them  after having been above five weeks on the island a large packet arrived from cathcart it enclosed among many to his sister one to celestina from willoughby and this more than any she had yet received from him since his absence seemed to assure her of his unfailing attachment it was less confused than those he had formerly written and seemed the production of a mind more master of itself and though it did not speak in positive terms of his immediate return celestina fancied that many of the expressions alluded to that hour and her heart found this idea so deliciously soothing that she would not suffer her reason to deprive her of any part of the pleasure she found in indulging it  a few of the residents of this and the neighboring islands were by this time acquainted at the house of mr elphinstone the young and of young people their visitors principally consisted were all charmed with celestina who whatever was her inclination for solitude never refused to make one in the ramble of the morning or to join the cheerful dance of an evening elphinstone naturally good humoured and particularly desirous of pleasing her soon became anxious to promote these parties which celestina whose heart was opened to new sensations of pleasure since the receipt of willoughbys last letter did not decline not only because she found much in these remote regions to gratify her curiosity but because she foresaw that from the shortnessof the summer so far north the days when these amusements were practicable were drawing to their conclusion and that she soon should be left unmolested to listen to the roaring of the waters and the sighings of the wind round the naked rocks against which it incessantly beat  it was now the end of july and celestina had already visited jona and several other islands sometimes these excursions had been made with mrs elphinstone but oftener without her elphinstone kept a boat which was always ready for the service of celestina and when his wife could not go with her a miss macqueen a very agreeable young highland lady always made the third  several little isles which afford no habitations for winter are scattered among the larger islands which are called the hebrides one of these lay within sight of elphinstones house which was close to the shore at the distance of about a mile and a half it was remarkable for the grotesque form of the cliffs which arose round it and for a stream of the purest water that bubbled up at the highest ground and fell into the sea through a chasm of the rock celestina to whom elphinstone had shown it laughingly called it her island and he in return had said that were she established on it it would become more dangerous than the island of calypso among other little plans of amusement which the decline of summer insensibly rendered more frequent it was agreed that on the first fine day some cold provisions should be taken and that they would all dine together on one of the natural stone tables in celestinas island  a fine day was found the party which were mr and mrs elphinstone miss macqueen and two gentlemen were ready when one of the boatmen who usually accompanied them was no where to be found elphinstone equally impatient and eager whatever was the importance or insignificance of the matter he was engaged in was going himself in search of the missing man when one of those who remained in the boat followed and told him that there was a young man a few yards farther on the shore who would take the place of him that was absent and that it was better not to wait elphinstone satisfied so long as his party was not interrupted accepted the offer and the boatman beckoning to a highlander who stood at some distance he ran toward them and was admitted into the boat  the party now put off from shore the water was beautifully smooth the sky clear and the wind in their favor very little exertion therefore on the part of the men who were entrusted with the navigation landed them safely on the ilk it did not contain more than three acres of land and the sole inhabitant of it was a solitary herdsman whose temporary dwelling composed of loose stones turf and heath he had raised under the protection of a large cliff of gray slate that seemed to have started away in some strange concussion of nature from some other island and to have fixed itself as a sea mark amidst the perpendicular and abrupt rocks that fenced this on every side the spring burst out near it is base and here the party sat down to make their gay repast  when it was over the gentlemen went away and while the boatmen were at dinner pushed out the boat themselves and began to fish near the shore while celestina leaving the ladies together walked away alone to the western coast of the island  the sun was already declining in an almost cloudless sky and gave the warmest splendor to the broad expanse of ocean broken by several islands whose rocky points and angular cliffs caught the strong lights in brilliant contrast to the lucid hue of the heath with which their summits were clothed and which on the northern and eastern sides threw a dark shadow on the clear and tranquil bosom of the sea the sea birds in swarming myriads were returning to their nests among the ragged precipices beneath her and celestina recalling to her mind the green delights of alvestone it is deepening woods gay lawns and airy summits compared it in pensive contemplation with the scene before her yet different as they were she thought that with willoughby any place would be to her a paradise and that even in such a remote spot as this she should be happy if it gave only a subsistence with him  this train of thought a little indulged made her have recourse to her pencil and produced an address to him in the following  sonnet on this lone island whose unfruitful breast feeds but the summershepherds little flock with scanty herbage from the half clothed rock where osprays cormorants and sea mews rest even in a scene so desolate and rude i could with thee for months and years be blessed and of thy tenderness and love possessed find all my world in this lone solitude when the bright sun these northern seas illume with thee admire the lights reflected charms and when drear winter spreads his cheerless gloom still find elysium in thy sheltering arms for thou to me can sovereign bliss impart thy mind my empire and my throne thy heart the broad orb of the sun was now only half seen above the horizon and celestina who had little marked the progress of time rose and hastened to join her companions as she turned for this purpose toward that part of the island where she had left them she saw the highlander who had been taken by chance into the boat in consequence of the absence of another start up from the ground at about two hundred paces from her where he seemed to have been concealed behind a cairn or pile of rude stones and hurry away toward the part of the shore where the boat had been left the incident however made no great impression on her mind but from the singular appearance of the man who was in a complete highland dress which is now not often seen and which made him as he walked very quickly on before her seem exactly the figure a painter would have chosen to have placed in a landscape representing the heathy summits and romantic rocks of the hebrides  she soon rejoined mrs elphinstone and miss macqueen the three gentlemen almost as soon approached to tell them it was time to return and they arrived again at their home after a little excursion with which all seemed pleased though celestina had suffered some raillery for having so long deserted them  every day now passed nearly alike diversified only now and then by the company of a stranger from some of the other islands and sometimes a party in the boat elphinstone was not yet tired by the project which brought him hither for to use an expression of his wifes which she uttered with a melancholy smile to celestina the new was not yet off he was therefore gay and alert persuaded himself by calculations which he made after his own sanguine manner that he was not only a benefactor to the public but should in a few years realize a great fortune by facilitating the capture of herrings among the western islands of scotland  the season for the proof of his exploits in this way was now rapidly approaching and he became every day more busy but his wife looked forward to it with less pleasure she languished for her little girls who were at the other extremity of england and thought with dismay of the tempests of winter which would shut her out from the little communication she yet had with that country but whatever was her regret she suffered it not to disturb the transient happiness her husband seemed to enjoy nor to communicate any gloom to the milder cheerfulness of celestina whose company was her greatest resource against that cold despondence which in despite of all her fortitude sometimes seized on her heart  celestina had now been almost three months an inhabitant of the isle of sky and felt nothing unpleasant in her insular situation but the length of time that must always elapse before she could hear from willoughby or even from cathcart a second packet was however brought to mrs elphinstone from the latter before the expiration of the eleventh week of their abode with eager impatience it was opened celestina received her part of it with a beating heart but on unsealing it found no letter from willoughby a letter in a hand which she did not at the moment recollect ever to have seen before attracted her attention and mingled it with something of terror she looked eagerly at the name and saw it signed with that of the elder mr thorold her spirits sunk was it some ill news of willoughby which he communicated that he might soften the blow she hurried it over in such breathless agitation as hardly gave her leave to understand what she read which was to this effect  your old friend amiable celestina though he has only had one letter from you since you left him reminds you of himself once more and is sorry that like every thing in this world his letter will convey to you a mixture of pleasure and pain  my daughter arabella is married to her own wishes and those of her mother in point of fortune she has done well we cannot here obtain every thing i hope she will be happy and am sure she will be rich which in the opinion of most fathers you know puts the former point out of doubt you will guess that mr bettenson is the gentleman who is now numbered with my family my wife has been gone with the new married couple some weeks to the seat of mr bettensons father in norfolk  you know i love home and i love that those who are less delighted with it should not be needlessly disturbed when they are out for which reason i have never communicated to his mother that montague after attending his sisters wedding here did not return to oxford as he talked of doing that i know not whither he is gone and have only had one letter from him since in which he assures me he is well and desires i would not be uneasy about him  it is very difficult to be otherwise this eccentric young man makes me tremble for him perpetually having no clue to direct my guesses i have no conjecture where or with whom he is and think it better to say as little as i can about an absence on which a thousand unfavourable constructions may be put ah my lovely ward how fortunate it would have been if when his judgment directed his heart it could have been accepted where  but this is wrong or at best useless farewell may heaven protect you and i pray you not to forget  your most faithful friend e thorold   relieved from her first apprehensions celestina felt extremely concerned at the absence of montague thorold so painful to his father perhaps so discreditable to himself she read over the letter again and fancied it very evident that mr thorold imputed it to some new attachment and giving a sigh to the recollection of all it must cost such a father to see such an unfortunate turn of mind blast all the acquirements of learning and all the advantages of genius she turned her thoughts to willoughby and felt with renewed poignancy the disappointment of not having heard from him  another and another week passed without any intelligence and all the soothing hopes celestina had so fondly encouraged gradually gave way to fear and apprehension at length a second packet arrived it contained a letter indeed from willoughby but so far was it from confirming the favorable presages of the former that she saw in it only a prelude to the event which other information made her believe would soon happen  the marriage of willoughby and miss fitzhayman lady horatia howard whoseattachment to celestina had taken very deep root had written to her from london whither she was now gone and had told her with as much tenderness as she could that such was the general report among the relations of the family and what was generally be lieved in the world from the same channel she also learned that sir philip and lady molyneux were expected in england early in the ensuing winter and that a large house in portmansquare was fitting up in the most splendid style for their reception  lady horatia concluded a most friendly letter to celestina thus  but my dear miss de mornay however all these things may be let me hope that you will not hide yourself in the hebrides all the winter why should you talents and virtues like yours were never intended for obscurity come then to me and assure yourself of the truest welcome you need not apprehend meeting mr willoughby and his bride for it is understood that they are to remain some time abroad and before they return to england you will have learned to conquer those painful emotions which the sight of them now perhaps might give you your understanding sets you above the puerile indulgence which inferior minds claim by prescription toward a first love the man whom any common consideration could induce after having won your affections to desert you never could deserve you and if some insurmountable barrier is between you you will learn to consider him as a friend and consult his peace in regaining that cheerfulness which he meant not to destroy but which to see destroyed must overcloud his days however prosperous they may otherwise be   there was in this letter more meant than was expressed and on considering it the wonder and uneasiness of celestina were redoubled but however obliged she thought herself by the friendly interest lady horatia took in her happiness and however just her arguments might be she felt no inclination to quit her present solitude and since she had now less hope than ever of meeting willoughby she had less than ever a desire to return into the world but gave herself up to that melancholy despondence against which hope and her own sanguine and cheerful temper had till now supported her  to indulge this increasing sadness it was now her custom to walk out alone after dinner and to make for herself a species of gloomy enjoyment from the dreary and wild scenes around her a little time before she had been imagining how pleasant the most desolate of these barren islands might be rendered to her by the presence of her beloved willoughby she now rather sought images of horror the sun far distant from this northern region was as faint and languid as the sick thoughts of celestina his feeble rays no longer gave any warm coloring to the rugged cliffs that rose above her head or lent the undulating sea that sparkling brilliance which a few weeks before had given gaiety and cheerfulness even to these scattered masses of almost naked stone against which the water incessantly broke gray sullen and cold the waves now slowly rolled toward the shore where celestina frequently sat whole hours as if to count them when she had in reality no idea present to her but willoughby lost to her for ever  willoughby forgetting her and married to miss fitzhayman  she had more than once remarked in returning from her walks that a man who kept always at such a distance that she could merely discover to be a highlander seemed to be observing her yet as he never came near her and always disappeared before she got near the house she could not imagine him to be one of the people belonging to elphinstone but puzzled rather than alarmed by his appearance for which she could not account she insensibly ceased to notice him mrs elphinstone occupied as she was by her own domestic uneasiness was still most tenderly attentive to celestina and endeavored to communicate to her some of that still and mournful acquiescence which served her in place of philosophy celestina had not yet suffered enough to learn it but she forbore to add to the melancholy of her friend by indulging her own while they were together and this restraint threw her more than ever into entire solitude though the autumn was so far advanced that the weather frequently drove her from the open hill or the vale under it to the casual shelter of some natural cave by the side of which the torrent increased by the storm hoarsely rushed and was answered by the roar of other streams whose hollow murmurs swelled in the gusts of wind that whistled through the mountainous tracks and compelled even the fowls of the desert to seek shelter where only it was afforded within the caverns of the cliffs or among the matted heath that clothed their summits  the delicate the elegant the lovely celestina she whose talents would have adorned the most informed society and whose beauty might have given new luster to the fairest assembly was thus a selfbanished recluse in the remotest and most uncultivated part of the british dominions her wish now was to pass her whole life here in that sullen calm which she at length hoped to obtain and the rudest scene of these islands now appeared to her infinitely preferable to any of the pleasures lady horatia howard offered her since they could only serve to remind her of willoughby perhaps to show her how happy he could learn to be united with another  the frequency of storms now prevented many of those visits which had during summer a little broken for elphinstone the uniformity of solitude but it was the height of the season for catching herrings and he was busy and for the present happy while his unfortunate wife who desolate as her present situation was yet dreaded the hour when this bustle should sink into discontent and give place to other projects received him on his return from those expeditions to other islands in which he was now frequently engaged always with cheerfulness which he did not or would not see was forced and sometimes with smiles which to every body but him very evidently were the smiles of stifled anguish  celestina answered lady horatias letter as it deserved but to willoughby she determined not to write that trembling solicitude with which she had been accustomed to expect letters from him it was now she thought time to subdue for she persuaded herself that never again they would bring to her any thing but anguish and regret and yet by those contradicting sensations to which violent attachments subject the human heart she incessantly indulged herself in thinking of all those happy hours which she had passed with him whom she fancied deserved little or no regret of whom she ought not to think at all and yet was so fond of recollecting that every conversation was irksome to her and every employment a task which took off her attention a moment from him  ti perdo ti lascio non ti vedro piu  she repeated incessantly to herself sometimes with tears of tenderness and sometimes with those painful emotions of mingled anger and regret which press on the heart when pride and resentment are struggling with affection in other moods she reproached herself for thus cherishing this unhappy passion tried to recall those days of resignation when without hope of ever being his she yet preferred willoughby to all mankind and to dismiss from her mind for ever the recollection of the few weeks when he had awakened that hope and called forth all her sensibility only as it should seem to render her wretched then she exclaimed in her native language  felicite passee qui ne peut revenir tourment de ma pensee que nai je en te perdant perdu le souvenir   in these gloomy moods she was quite unable to remain a moment in company especially in the company of elphinstone who with the true projecters infatuation fancied every body else as much interested about the fishery as he was and persecuted her with details of how many busses he had out and how many lasts they had taken what was the best method of curing them and of the superiority which a few years would give the fishery in which he was engaged over the dutch  celestina began to dread the conversation and had it not been for mrs elphinstone of whose suffering merit she was every hour more sensible she would not have forborne to express her weariness and disgust a hearer was necessary to elphinstone and when he had nobody else to talk to this unenviable place was filled by the inwardlyimpatient celestina  it happened however that she was released from this for some days toward the end of november elphinstone went to the isle of harries on his business as he fancied and the wind being against his return she no longer listened to the method of curing herrings but returned to her shortened but less interrupted walks in one of these toward the close of a very lowering and cheerless day when her way was along the rugged cliffs that on the western side of the island hung over the sea she composed the following sonnet  the pilgrim faultering and sad the unhappy pilgrim roves who on the eve of bleak decembers night divided far from all he fondly loves journeys alone along the giddy height of these steep cliffs and as the suns last ray fades in the west sees from the rocky verge dark tempest scowling over the shortened day and hears with ear appalled the impetuous surge beneath him thunder  so with heart oppressed alone reluctant desolate and slow by friendships cheering radiance now unblest along lifes rudest path i seem to go nor see where yet the anxious heart may rest that trembling at the past  recoils from future woe chapter iii elphinstone had now been absent some days and the wind which was contrary and violent prevented his return to the place of his abode mrs elphinstone became uneasy at the storms which detained him and celestina participated in her anxiety at length the wind sunk and toward the evening of the fifth day of his absence was fair to bring him from herries mrs elphinstone who had been a good deal alarmed by the hurricanes of several preceding days and had wearied her spirits by watching the weather and keeping an anxious eye toward the impracticable sea found herself indisposed and shivering and telling celestina that she believed she had caught cold she went early to bed remarking as she bade her good night that elphinstone would probably be at home in the morning  celestina left alone went out as was her custom even although the evening was already closed in and standing on the edge of the rocks near the house remarked the singular appearance of the moon which was now rising it was large and of a dull red surrounded by clouds of a deep purple whose skirts seemed touched with flame large volumes of heavy vapor were gathering in the sky and the heaving surges swelled toward the shore and broke upon it with that sullen regularity that foretells a storm from the north arose distinctly the pointed rays of the aurora borealis fiery and portentous they seemed to flash like faint lightning a little while till the moon becoming clearer rendered them less visible  not a sound was heard but the dull murmurs of the sea on one side and the rapid waterfalls on the other whose increased noise foretold with equal certainty an approaching tempest celestina who was in that disposition of mind to which horrors are congenial walked slowly on notwithstanding but quitting the cliffs on account of the gales of wind which now blew from the sea she went along a narrow pass where there was a cairn or heap of stones loosely piled together the work of the first wild natives of the country and as that was as far as she thought it proper to venture from the house though it was not more than eight oclock she leaned pensively against it and watched with some surprise the fluctuations of the clouds that were wildly driven by the wind across the disk of the moon and listened with a kind of chill awe to the loud yet hollow echo of the wind among the hills which sometimes sobbed with stormy violence for a moment and then suddenly sinking was succeeded by a pause more terrible  it was in one of these moments of alarming silence that celestina thought she saw the shadow of a human form for a moment on the ground as if the person was behind her who occasioned it she was very little subject to fear but the loneliness of the place and her own desponding spirits together made her start with terror and turn round something immediately glided away and convinced that the first impression had not been the work of fancy she hastened with quick steps from the place and hardly at the distance of above a hundred yards ventured to look behind her she fancied that she saw a man standing in the place she had left and the strange superstitions of the islands of which she had heard much since her residing on them crowding at that moment on her mind she became extremely terrified and hurried on with such unguarded speed that a little before she reached the house she trod on a loose stone that turned under her foot and she fell with some violence and with considerable pain which together with the fear she had before felt produced a momentary stupor from which she was awakened by finding herself eagerly raised from the ground by some person who wildly expressed his fears for her safety and in whose voice she recognized with astonishment that deprived her of utterance montague thorold surprise at that moment conquered the pain she felt oh mr montague cried she is it possible for heavens sake what brought you hither  no matter what replied he eagerly think not  ask not about me  when you are yourself hurt  in pain  bruised i fear by your fall  i have no hurt so great said celestina rising and attempting to walk i feel no bodily pain so acute as that which your extraordinary conduct gives me  let me assist you into the house interrupted he do you not see that the tempest which has been gathering the whole evening in the southwest is now driving hither with uncommon fury  and let it come answered she languidly i am just now so very unhappy myself  i feel so much for the unhappiness of my friends particularly of your father that it is indifferent to me what comes  it is not for me at least that you feel answered he that i know but too well but undoubtedly you will be greatly concerned for poor elphinstone whose boat has been beating about ever since nightfall within a mile of the shore at the imminent hazard of being dashed to pieces  at this information celestina forgot herself forgot the uneasy astonishment into which the unexpected presence of montague thorold had thrown her and the danger of elphinstone occupied all her thoughts oh where cried she where is he show me the bark which is in so much hazard and for heavens sake call the people who are not perhaps aware of it is danger  alas answered he several men have been upon the shore above half an hour alarmed as i was at the danger the vessel was in of striking on the rocks which she has got among from the unexpected shifting of the wind but in their present state no human assistance can do them any service  he had during this dialogue taken her arm and led her toward a point of the rock where she saw by the pale and uncertain light of a moon wrapped continually in volumes of clouds the boat struggling among the dark heavy waves which often totally concealed it and continually driven by the sudden gusts of violent wind from the point it was attempting to reach  she now saw and shuddered at the peril of those who were in it but still fancying it was possible to afford them assistance she felt impatient and almost angry that montague thorold holding her arm within his stood gazing when she fancied he might be helping why stand here cried she when we might be of use in summoning people to the assistance of those poor creatures while she yet spoke and while montague though not less alive to their distress was less sanguine in the hope to assist them and therefore still hesitated she disengaged herself hastily from his arm and flew toward the house no longer conscious of any thing but their danger before she could reach it though the distance was not a quarter of a mile the wind suddenly blew with treble fury and a hail storm accompanied it against which she found it difficult to stand she found the door open and mrs elphinstone whom the wind and the talking of the servants had awakened already below trembling with apprehension which the sudden appearance of celestina increased  good god my dear friend what is the matter cried she and why are you out in so dreadful a night  ah dear madam replied celestina mr elphinstone  his boat    what of him interrupted her terrified friend is he drowned is he lost  no no i hope i believe not cried celestina but a boat which they say is his is beating off the island and the people are afraid it will go to pieces  this was enough for the unhappy mrs elphinstone who seeing in it is most dreadful light the evil which threatened her now ran herself wildly toward the beach while celestina overtaking her with difficulty persuaded her to accept her assistance  assistance which she was very little able to give  the sad event had happened before the trembling friends had reached the headland the boat striking on the sunken rocks to save it from which the united efforts of the little crew had been exerted in vain was staved to pieces and the unhappy men already exhausted with fatigue were unable to resist by swimming the violence of the sea mrs elphinstone and celestina looked out in vain for the place where a few moments before the boat had been seen no vestige of it remained and they saw only by the waining moon which but served to lend new horrors to the view the wild waves dashing over these rocks in sheets of white foam while the fury of the winds and the beating of the rain hardly allowed them to stand on the precipice that overlooked the scene of stormy desolation  celestina doubted but little of the calamity and therefore endeavored to persuade her unfortunate friend to return to the house but this was impossible she continued to wander backwards and forwards for some moments till terror quite overcame her and she threw herself on the ground saying in a low and solemn voice to celestina  elphinstone is drowned i know he is and here i will wait to see his corpse which will be driven on shore in the morning then starting up she would have gone down to the shore from an idea which suddenly occurred to her that he might yet be saved by swimming celestina not knowing whether it was best to prevent or to indulge her unable to dissimulate and affect hope she did not feel was in a situation hardly better than that of her distracted friend whom she supported when montague thorold joined them mrs elphinstone occupied only by the terror of the moment took no notice of the extraordinary circumstance of a stranger whom she had never seen before thus suddenly appearing but unconscious of every thing and heedless of who he was requested in accents of piercing anguish his assistance to help her down the winding path which led to the beach he lent it though very certain that the catastrophe had already taken place which by her eager and wild enquiries he saw she yet thought doubtful and giving her one arm while with the other he clasped the trembling hand of celestina they reached the place where seven or eight men were already assembled the moon was by this time down and the darkness was only broken by livid flashes of faint lightning which with the thunder muttering at a distance increased the horrors of the storm amid the black and swelling waves however objects were seen floating and many of these heavy seas had not broken on the shore before these objects were discerned to be the bodies of those who had perished and that of the ill fated elphinstone was one of the first which was thrown on the beach and too well known by his unhappy wife she now no longer remembered all the causes of uneasiness that her husband had given her but saw only elphinstone once so fondly beloved the possessor of her first affections the father of her children a disfigured corpse before her her native strength of understanding and the calmness acquired by habitual suffering forsook her at once and grief produced a momentary phrenzy during which fearful paroxysm celestina whose presence of mind was now summoned to the assistance of her poor unhappy friend had her conveyed with great difficulty to the house where montague thorold attending them both with the most assiduous tenderness she watched for many days over the disordered intellects of the ill fated mrs elphinstone before she saw them restored at length the violence of her affliction which celestina found means to soften by presenting her children continually to her and talking to her of those that were absent sunk into the calm torpor of despair she heard nothing she saw nothing but the children whom she would not suffer to be a moment absent from her and the agitation of her mind preying on her slender frame she was reduced to a state of languor which made celestina tremble for her life  celestina had immediately after the fatal event written to cathcart desiring his directions and even entreating him to come himself to fetch them all from a place where there was now no reason for their stay but she knew that it must be five or six weeks before she could have an answer and hardly dared trust herself to meditate on the scenes of distress she must in that time encounter  amid all the horrors however which had surrounded her she had not forgotten the fears and alarms to which she knew the absence of montague thorold exposed his father her benefactor she seized the first interval after the death of elphinstone to urge to him the cruelty of his conduct and to entreat him to return home but he replied that nothing on earth should induce him to leave the place where she was while there was a probability of his being of use to her and that whether she admitted him to see her or drove her from him the island should be his residence while she remained in it all that then remained for her was to write to mr thorold which she did under cover to cathcart acquainting him as briefly as she could of the unexpected appearance of his son and all that had happened since  having thus far acquitted herself she found herself in a situation in which it was almost impossible for her to help receiving the assistance of one to whom she trembled to be obliged while she knew it encouraged and augmented a passion that empoisoned his life on him however she was compelled to entrust the regulation of the last melancholy offices that were to be performed for poor elphinstone who was interred in a little ruined chapel about two miles from his late residence his wife consenting reluctantly to this disposition and taking opiates incessantly to procure that torpor which alone prevented the more violent ebullitions of grief from seizing her again when the remains of her husband were removed  recourse to opiates became gradually a habit with mrs elphinstone and though celestina trembled for the consequences she thought it almost inhuman to oppose the application of any remedy which under such circumstances won her friend from sorrow even for an hour yet the frequent absences it occasioned compelled her to be very long and very often alone with montague thorold to whose manly tenderness on the late sad occasion she could not be insensible and to whose unceasing attention she was every hour more obliged in the first conference they had held when the melancholy event to which they had been witnesses allowed them to talk of themselves celestina after urging him to return to his father by every motive with which reason and truth supplied her repeated to him with great firmness her resolution never to marry if willoughby was not her husband and represented very forcibly the cruelty as well as absurdity of his pursuing her to which he replied that he knew all she represented before he came thither that his only wish was to be allowed to see her though at a distance and his only gratification that of being suffered to breathe the same air that it was the natural privilege of every human being to pursue their happiness when it injured nobody and that finding his consisted in being near her though without even the hope of her admitting him into her presence he had followed that axiom and had for some weeks been the distant and unseen companion of all her walks i was the highlander said he who supplied the vacancy i had before taken care to make when you went your excursion on the water i am the person of whom you have sometimes caught a glimpse at a distance and who would never have approached you nearer had not my fears for you the evening of the storm thrown me off my guard and induced me to conceal myself within a few yards of you behind those piled up stones against which you leaned ah i heard you sigh  i heard the name of willoughby repeated with tenderness but i bore it all and nothing believe me nothing but your fall your apparent danger could have compelled me to break the vow i had made never to intrude upon you  never to offend you with my unhappy passion  celestina could not help being affected with the melancholy solemnity with which he uttered these words but making an effort to prevent his perceiving it she said  it is absolutely necessary now that you again take up as much of so proper a resolution as relates to not speaking to me on a topic which to you must be useless and to me painful and while you persist in remaining here let me at least owe it to your complaisance not to be distressed by declarations to which i cannot ought not will not listen  montague thorold then laying his hand on his heart assured her that if she would allow him only to see her indulge him only with being useful to her in her present remote and comfortless residence he never would again name to her the passion which he knew he said he must carry to the grave and from that moment he kept his word though celestina saw with more emotion perhaps than the warmest declarations could have given her his painful struggles and continual contention with himself but while her pity for him increased she studied more carefully to conceal from him that she felt any and behaved with as much calm politeness as she could have done toward the most indifferent man in the world  to beguile the tedious moments during which they were compelled to wait the hoped for arrival of cathcart and while the sea that surrounded them was agitated continually by the wintry tempest celestina had recourse to the books with which poor elphinstone who among all his faults and errors was not without taste had furnished a closet in the house mrs elphinstone moved by the representations of celestina to attend to her health for the sake of her children whose sole dependence was now on her consented by degrees to listen while celestina read montague thorold whose residence was at the cottage of a highlander that boasted of having two rooms and a chimney about a mile farther on the island was sometimes admitted to these parties and as celestina was soon fatigued and as he read remarkably well mrs elphinstone appeared pleased with his taking occasionally the office of their reader and gradually he became accustomed to attend them every afternoon and to read aloud to them till the hour of their simple supper  among the books in this little collection there were several that celestina recollected as the peculiar favorites of willoughby and the remembrance of those days when heread them to her though never a moment absent from her thoughts were now most forcibly recalled by hearing them again repeated some pieces of poetry particularly affected her from their simple pathos and the manner in which montague thorold read them while they often drew tears from the unhappy mrs elphinstone an effect at which celestina rejoiced as her grief was now settled into that still and sullen melancholy unsolicitous of consolation and incapable of receiving it which while it produces a degree of apparent calmness preys with fatal power on the heart  thus passed the heavy hours till at length after a fortnight longer delay than they had reckoned upon letters were received from cathcart they contained intelligence that old winnington was dead and jessy in such a state of health as made it almost impossible for cathcart to leave her he therefore besouglit celestina to accept the protection of montague thorold for herself for mrs elphinstone and her children and to hasten to his house where he was now as able as happy to receive them as soon as was possible and safe mr thorold wrote also to celestina and expressed his hope that the wild eccentricity of his son which had occasioned to him so much pain might at least be of service to her and entreated her to allow him to attend her and her unfortunate friend into devonshire where he assured her he would prevent her receiving any trouble from the importunities of montague should he be weak enough to presume too much on her favor he wrote also to his son but after the contents of that letter celestina did not enquire and montague carefully concealed them  it was now determined that the plan laid down by cathcart and mr thorold should be pursued montague undertook the arrangement of every thing and within ten days they were ready to depart  the weather alone seemed now likely to prevent their crossing the water mrs elphinstone who had till now feared nothing being so apprehensive for her children that every gust of wind every swell of the sea made her shrink back with dismay and postpone from day to day a little voyage which she yet earnestly wished over it was the end of november and very good weather could hardly be expected dark and gloomy days with storms of wind and rain succeeded each other and celestina whose thoughts had been of late called frequently from her own mournful contemplations to the acute distresses of others now relapsed again into that desponding state of mind which her long absence from willoughby and his apparent neglect of her unavoidably threw her into she had confined herself a good deal to the house since montague thorold had been so much with them because there either mrs elphinstone or the children were usually in the room and she by that means avoided being alone with him but now as he was more engaged by the preparations for their departure which he had undertaken to superintend and in settling poor elphinstones accounts with his employers celestina again ventured out of an evening whenever she could escape unseen  in one of these walks along the edge of very steep rocks where the scene presented only desolation the dark and turbulent sea on one side and on the other a succession of mountains which seemed to have been thrown upon each other in some tremendous convulsion of nature she turned toward the yet more dreary north and reflected on the condition of those whom the poet describes as the last of men the inhabitants of siberia of lapland and those extreme regions where life at last goes out  alas cried she if they have not our enjoyments they suffer not from those sensibilities which embitter our days their short summer passes in laying up necessaries for their long winter and with what their desolate region affords them they are content because they know not that there are comforts and conveniences beyond what it affords them void of the wish and the power to observe other modes of life they are content with their own and though little superior in point of intellect to the animal from which they derive their support yet they are happy if not from the possession of good at least from the absence of evil from that sickness of the soul which we taste from deprivation and disappointment  a deep sigh closed this short soliloquy and after indulging a little longer this train of thought it produced the following sonnet  the laplander the shivering native who by tenglios side beholds with fond regret the parting light sink far away beneath the darkening tide and leave him to long months of dreary night yet knows that springing from the eastern wave the suns glad beams shall reillume his way and from the snows secured within his cave he waits in patient hope  returning day not so the sufferer feels who over the waste of joyless life is destined to deplore fond love forgotten tender friendship past which once extinquishd can revive no more over the blank void he looks with hopeless pain for him those beams of heaven shall never shine again a few days after this an interval of calm weather gave to mrs elphinstone courage to determine on embarking but the evening before that on which it was finally fixed that they should go she told celestina with a solemnity of voice and manner that convinced her she was not to be diverted from her purpose that she could not be satisfied to leave the island without visiting the spot where lay the remains of her husband celestina without much hope of success represented to her how wrong it was to yield or rather to encourage sorrow unavailing to it is object and injurious to those who were his living representatives by depriving her of her calmness of mind when exertion was most necessary and injuring her own health now so particularly precious to them to these arguments her poor friend replied with melancholy composure that she should suffer more in reflecting on her omission than she could do in fulfilling what she had persuaded herself was a duty celestina therefore agreed to accompany her that evening montague thorold had already shown her the place and mrs elphinstone desired to have no other witness to her sorrows than the soft hearted and pitying friend without whose generous sympathy she would probably long before have sunk under them  it was near two months since the death of elphinstone when this melancholy farewell visit was to be paid by his widow a calm but sullen day with an overclouded sky threatening snow was succeeded by a dark but mild evening the distant sun had left a few lines of red light in the western horizon and the moon within a day or two of being at the full edged with fainter rays the opposite clouds through which it appeared not but at intervals the unhappy widow leaning on the arm of her tender friend walked slowly and with languid steps as she was guided toward the ruined chapel and a universal pause of nature seemed to respect her sorrows not a breath of air wandered among the channels of the hills and the waterfalls murmured low and hollow at a distance the sea was calm and being low on the sands was hardly heard while the birds and few animals who inhabited the land were retired to their repose  around this little chapel now more than half in ruins a few rude stones were raised to the memory of the dead of former times the grass and weeds concealed many and on the rest no figures but those of crosses rudely cut were now visible elphinstone had been interred within the walls of the edifice itself his widow desired her friend to enter it with her to show her the place and to leave her  as they approached the spot the ground sounded hollow beneath their feet and a mournful echo ran round the damp walls the moon darting for a moment through the ruined stone work of the dismantled window showed them a broken table that had once been the altar on which some pieces of the gothic ornaments of the chapel and several human bones were scattered and near it the newly turned up earth on which a few stones were loosely piled discovered the grave of poor elphinstone celestina could not trust her voice to point it out but leading her friend to it she immediately comprehended that there lay the remains of her husband and fetching a deep sigh she stopped at it  i had better not leave you surely cried celestina mournfully i cannot bear to leave you in this dreadful place  pray oblige me replied her friend it is the last indulgence i will ask and i promise not to stay long  i will wait for you without then replied celestina and pray dear sophy consider your children and let it not be long that you indulge this sad propensity  she then went out of the chapel and seating herself on one of the ruined monuments near it is entrance yielded to all the gloomy thoughts which the place the hour and the occasion inspired ah who knows cried she whether i too may not have reason to lament even as this poor mourner whose groans tear my heart to pieces while i listen to them i hear her she implores forgiveness of the shade of her departed husband for all the involuntary offenses she committed against him she whose whole life has been one course of suffering solicits forgiveness of him to whom those sufferings were owing she forgets his faults toward her and recollects only that he once loved her that he was the husband of her youth and that he is gone for ever while she trembles for the future fate of him whose errors she only remembers to recommend them to mercy dreadful then is the final separation even from those of whom though we have reason to complain we have once loved ah what must it be when an eternal barrier is put between us and those whom we unreservedly and passionately love willoughby if i have regretted so deeply our separation what would become of me should i ever hang over the grave where thy adored form moulders in the dust oh god grant that i never sustain a trial like that  overwhelmed by these sad thoughts and terrified at the increasing darkness and fearful silence which was broken only by the deep sighs of her unhappy friend prostrate on the grave of her husband she started up to recall her from her mournful employment when montague thorold breathless with haste and anxiety approached her she was glad to recognize him and took the hand he offered her while he cried impatiently  wherefore is all this my dear madam and where is your friend  celestina led him to the place shuddering as she approached while mrs elphinstone recovering herself by an effort of resolution and having perhaps disburthened her oppressed heart and satisfied her mournful propensity agreed immediately to go with them and having turned once more her streaming eyes on the spot as she quitted the chapel she suffered each of her friends to take an arm and lead her home in silence where montague thorold advised her and celestina to take immediately a few hours rest as the tide would serve very early in the morning for their embarkation in the vessel which now lay ready to receive them  they followed his advice and before day break on the twentieth of december near seven months after their arrival in the isle of sky they quitted it and landing safely on the coast of scotland they proceeded with very great fatigue though fortunately without being intercepted by such heavy snows as they had at such a season reason to apprehend to edinburgh where it was necessary for them to rest some days before they proceeded on their long journey to the other extremity of great britain  chapter iv as mrs elphinstone was too much dejected to allow her to go out celestina who had great pleasure in visiting antiquities and whose active mind was perpetually in search of new ideas was compelled either to relinquish these gratifications or to permit montague thorold only to accompany her he was generally so guarded in his conversation that though it was easy to see how much he suffered in suppressing his passion celestina had no reasonable ground of complaint he found however at edinburgh that it was particularly uneasy to her to visit the places she wished to see without some other companion and recollecting that one of the professors was well known to his father he made use of the claim that acquaintance gave him and by that means celestina received all the attention and hospitality for which the scottish nation are so justly praised the gentleman to whom she thus became known had several daughters amiable and elegant young women with them she saw all that the capital of scotland afforded worthy of observation with them she visited the ruinous chapel and magnificently mournful apartments of holyrood house and gave a sigh to the fate of the lovely luckless mary who was almost its last resident sovereign then parting with her newly acquired friends with mutual regret she proceeded on her road to england nothing particular occurring on the way for some time except the slow but evident amendment of mrs elphinstones spirits and the symptoms of increased attachment in montague thorold who if he loved her before with an attachment fatal to his peace and subversive of his prospects now seemed to idolize her with an ardour bordering on phrenzy in despite of the resolutions she had avowed to him in despite of those he had himself formed this ardent and invincible passion was visible in every thing he said and did he seemed to have forgotten that he had any other business in the world than to serve her to listen to the enchantment of her voice to watch every change of her countenance his whole being was absorbed in that one sentiment and though he had promised not to consider the advantages which his own wild quixotism aided by accident had thus obtained for him as making the least alteration in the decided preference of celestina for another he insensibly forgot at least at times her unalterable affection for willoughby and seeing notwithstanding all her attempts to conceal it that she pitied him that she was not insensible of his attempts to please her nor blind to his powers of pleasing he cherished in defiance of reason and conviction from which he fled as much as possible the extravagant hope that the barrier whatever it was between her and willoughby would be found invincible and that the time though it might yet be remote would at length arrive when he should himself be allowed to aspire to her favor  the human mind however strong yields too easily to these illusions whence at least it enjoys the soft consolations of hope and sees rays of light which though imaginary perhaps are all we often have to carry us on with courage over the rugged way too thickly sown with real or missing them with imaginary and selfcreated evils  it is therefore little to be wondered at if montague thorold so sanguine in temperament of so little experience in life for he was yet hardly twenty two and so much in love should thus eagerly feed himself with hopes of its ultimate success and be wilfully deaf to every argument which reason would have brought against the reality of the gay visions he cherished  celestina pitying and esteeming him was very anxious to reduce this unhappy and fruitless prepossession to the bounds of friendship and esteem and though she at this time thought of willoughby with so much internal anguish that she never on other occasions willingly named him yet she now took occasion sometimes to speak of him and purposely laid her train of conversation in such a way with mrs elphinstone as gave montague thorold to understand that her sentiments in regard to him who had first possessed and still was master of her heart could never suffer any material change or be transferred to another even though she was sure that she was personally divided from him for ever  after some days traveling which the languor of mrs elphinstone and her extreme anxiety about her children rendered tedious the party arrived at york and there it was determined to remain two days celestina who had nobody to receive her at the end of her pilgrimage with peculiar delight was not very eager to finish it mrs elphinstone seeing nothing but poverty and dependence before her of which her mind being enfeebled by grief was little able to bear a nearer prospect was yet less anxious and montague thorold cared not how long a journey lasted which gave him what he must at its termination lose the happiness of being with and of being useful to the mistress of his heart  when they arrived at york there was an appearance of snow it fell with violence during the night and by ten oclock the next morning the north road was rendered impassable  the travelers were well assured that in a day or two it would be sufficiently beat for them to proceed with safety and as their original intention was to remain at least two days the farther immaterial delay with which this circumstance threatened them gave to none of them any concern  the snow however continued to fall very heavily and the cold became almost insupportably severe the party were drawn round a good fire at the inn and mrs elphinstone had just put her children to bed when an unusual clamor and bustle below attracted their attention horses were called for and a loud voice was heard to say  if four are not sufficient my master will have fourteen rather than be stopped a moment  this is some matrimonial expedition cried montague thorold or why all this haste the idea which the ladies allowed to be probable excited some degree of curiosity and when the waiter soon after came in to lay the cloth for supper montague could not forbear enquiring if the horses which were a short time before so eagerly called for were not for the accommodation of a young couple hastening into scotland the man replied that the gentleman was going into scotland and had been stopped by the snow about seven miles off the horses he had to his chaise being unable to draw him but that he understood he was quite alone that horses and men had been sent to his assistance and that he was expected there presently  the man who probably loved to hear himself talk went on to inform them though they now no longer felt any great degree of curiosity that the gentlemans valet de chamber and one of the postillions who had come forward who were warming themselves at the fire below before they returned back as they were ordered had declared that they were almost dead with cold but as for that sir continued the waiter he says that is sir the walet de sham says says he my master if once heve got a scheme in his head it is not cold no nor water nor fire neither as will find it an easy matter to stop him and then says he as for fatigue to his own self says he or danger or any thing of the like nature or expense though it cost him a hundred aye or a thousand pounds why my master says he minds it no more than nothing it is all one to him yet to be sure says he he is a good master in the main and no sneaker neither in money nor liquor nor no other accommodation to servants  and pray said montague thorold who is this courageous bountiful and accommodating gentleman  i did not think to ask his name sir replied the waiter but i can know in a minute he then without waiting for an answer ran down stairs and returning almost instantly said that the gentleman was squire vavasour of staffordshire  vavasour cried celestina in a faint voice and turning as pale as death good heaven to what purpose can vavasour be traveling in such haste toward scotland  vavasour echoed montague thorold his countenance betraying all that passed in his heart vavasour ah miss de mornay it was to you he was undoubtedly going willoughby is returned and sends his friend to reclaim his betrothed wife  sends his friend oh no no answered celestina with quickness that cannot be were willoughby returned he would not send rather it is some sad news he has to impart and i must prepare myself for it  i must bear it be it what it may  the cruellest anxiety now took possession of both celestina and montague thorold they both dreaded an explanation though unable to bear the suspense thorold went down to see what he could gather from the men but mr vavasours servant was gone back to meet his master and the postillion had only come with him from the last post town celestina in the mean time now traversed the room now went to the window and now appeared to attend to the conjectures mrs elphinstone offered that perhaps this journey might in no respect relate to her but might be owing to one of those sudden starts of caprice in which vavasour was known to indulge himself  this state of suspense and conjecture which is of all others least easy to be borne did not last long for in about a quarter of an hour the carriage in which vavasour himself was arrived  celestina now debated within herself whether she ought to send to him to inform him of her being on her way to england or suffer him to proceed whither she doubted not he was going even to the hebrides in search of her this internal debate was however short her extreme solicitude to have news of willoughby superceded every other thought and whether vavasour was going to scotland to announce her fate to her by the direction of willoughby or merely in consequence of some whim of his own she knew that he in all probability could give her some intelligence of him of whom she most wished to hear montague thorold who trembled least in consequence of this interview all the day dreams in which he had been indulging himself should be at once destroyed would have represented to her some imaginary improprieties which his wish to find them raised in his mind  celestina however had with all her candor and humility a decisive spirit the effect of her great good sense which when she had once examined and determined on any subject did not leave her open to the trifling perplexities of feeble and unimportant debate she considered that even if vavasour was going on some eccentric idea of his own to follow her into scotland it would be cruel and unjust to suffer him to pursue such a journey at such a season and therefore steadily resisting all the representations of montague thorold against it she addressed to him the following note  miss de mornay presents her compliments to mr vavasour and having learned by accident that he is at this place requests the favor of seeing him tomorrow morning to breakfast with mrs elphinstone and with her at half past nine  montague thorold being unable wholly to prevent thought he could at least impede the delivery of this note till the next day but celestina was too impatient to hear of willoughby to be blind to the artifice which montague was too much in love to manage very dexterously and therefore quitting the room herself she found one of the waiters who she enjoined to give the note to the gentleman who was just arrived as soon as he had done supper  this was not perhaps very discreet but celestina thought much at the moment of willoughby and very little of vavasour and in her anxiety to hear news of the one she reflected not on the way in which it might be conveyed by the other who after a long and cold journey having finished his supper was not likely at least to be a clear and calm messenger and a moments reflection would have convinced her that he was not a man who from motives of delicate forbearance and polite deference would put off the interview to the time she had named  no sooner was the note from celestina delivered to vavasour than he ran up stairs with an impatience amounting almost to phrenzy his eyes flashing fire and his countenance expressive of the violent emotions with which he was agitated he hardly noticed mrs elphinstone but casting a look of angry surprise at montague thorold whom he immediately knew he approached celestina took her hand and eagerly kissing it told her in a hurried manner that he was hastening to scotland to give her intelligence of very great consequence and to deliver her a packet from willoughby  from willoughby replied celestina so extremely affected by his abrupt entrance that she was ready to faint is he well is he returned to england  no replied he without seeming sensible of the nature of her sufferings not returned to england or likely to return but    is he married then said celestina interrupting him in a still more trembling voice  not yet but i have a letter for you which    give it me cried she hardly able to breathe he had it not about him but ringing for his servant gave him the key of his portmanteau and bidding him bring a large sealed packet which he said he would find there the man immediately returned with it and celestina without speaking to vavasour hurried away with it in breathless agitation mrs elphinstone alarmed at her looks following her in silence  all this time montague thorold had remained leaning against one of the piers with contracted brows and clasped hands watching the countenance of celestina while his own changed from pale to red from red again to pale he had always returned the dislike which vavasour had shown toward him as much as his nature could return dislike and this was increased by the abrupt and unfeeling manner in which vavasour had executed a commission that whether it brought to her welcome or unwelcome tidings demanded he thought more delicacy and more preparation when celestina and mrs elphinstone were gone he felt no inclination therefore to stay with vavasour who walked up and down the room as if expecting their return but was preparing to leave it when as he crossed to the door vavasour turning short toward him asked how he came to be at york with miss de mornay  how i came sir replied montatague thorold with equal abruptness have you any right sir to enquire  yes replied vavasour contemptuously i have a right  to enquire into my actions sir interrupted thorold surely not  to enquire into those of miss de mornay sir i have a right  well sir if she allows of that right to her you may then apply but you will be so good as to leave me at liberty to be at york or wherever else it is convenient to me to be  not with her sir you must not not with miss de mornay be assured as for the rest pray understand that were it not for the circumstance of your being seen in company with her i should never recollect that such a person was in the world as mr montague thorold  thorold though naturally of a gentle disposition was little disposed to bear the contemptuous arrogance of any man he therefore answered with more quickness that it was an honor he could well dispense with to be thought of at all by such a man as mr vavasour the tone in which he spoke this and the emphasis he laid on the words such a man provoked the haughty and impetuous spirit of vavasour and words rose so high between them that mrs elphinstone who was only in the next room came in and extremely terrified at their violence besought them to separate vavasour whose passions were at all times too strong to suffer him to listen either to reason from others or to his own gave very little attention to her remonstrances but montague thorold on seeing her extreme uneasiness and on hearing the name of celestina became in a moment apparently calm and assuring mrs elphinstone that she had no reason to be alarmed he addressed himself coolly to vavasour and said that if he had any business with him he would be at his service in the morning he then besought mrs elphinstone to return to celestina and taking her hand led her out of the room assuring her in a whisper that he would not return that evening to vavasour nor have any farther contention with him make yourself easy therefore my dear madam said he and tell me  how is our lovely friend what are the contents of a letter which required so extraordinary a messenger  mrs elphinstone answered that celestina had appeared in great emotion while she read the beginning of the letter and then telling her that she should finish it in her own room had left her in increased agitation she thought but without tears  and shall you see her no more tonight enquired montague thorold  i rather believe not replied mrs elphinstone  and do you think said thorold do you think my dear madam that the agitation the emotion you remarked was the effect of joy of grief    of grief of disappointment of regret i think answered she i believe celestina is now convinced that every probability of her becoming the wife of mr willoughby is at an end for ever  then cried montague thorold unable to repress the violence of his feelings oh then there will be hope for me  there was something like the transports of phrenzy in the manner in which he uttered this and mrs elphinstone was shocked at it be not too sanguine mr montague said she i do not believe that the affections of miss de mornay are to be easily or lightly transferred but if they were think of the powerful claims upon them that are using against yours  claims what claims cried he who shall dare to dispute with me an heart to which    nay nay answered mrs elphinstone this is all phrenzy and wildness do you not know that you have no claim though i am willing to allow all your merit and do you not see that willoughby in being compelled to resign her recommends his friend vavasour to her favor and therefore sends him hither  vavasour cried he recommend vavasour to her and would celestina who with all that dignified gentleness has a great deal of spirit with a proper consciousness of her own value would she bear to be consigned like a bale of merchandise to a friend and to such a man as vavasour impossible he dare not think of it but i wish he may for her insulted pride will mitigate the pain of her disappointed love and she will be mine  the charmer will be mine  the look the manner in which this was uttered increased the concern of mrs elphinstone who from her own recent and severe sufferings had learned to dread any thing like romantic eccentricity she laid her soft cold hand on the burning hands of montague thorold as they were wildly clasped together  my dear sir said she in the gentlest accents i owe you a thousand obligations for all the attention you showed me in my late calamitous situation and ill very ill should i repay those obligations if i did not try as a friend to mitigate these violent transports believe me the heart of celestina fixed in her early life to one object is attached to that object with more than common firmness vavasours frantic fondness and your real merit will in my opinion be equally indifferent to her and i verily believe that if willoughby marries another as i conclude he will miss de mornay will never marry at all  montague thorold could not bear this the idea of rivalry had been painful but the pain was mitigated by his knowledge of her character and of the character of vavasour which with all its avowed libertinism he knew celestina could not even tolerate and certainly not approve but the idea of her living only for willoughby even when willoughby lived for another was insupportable and since he was unwilling to own it was possible he would therefore have been ready to quarrel with any body but mrs elphinstone for supposing it probable but to every being who was unfortunate and especially if that unfortunate being was a woman the kind heart of montague thorold overflowed with good will and sympathy he therefore checked himself and saying he should be impatient to hear of miss de mornay in the morning he wished mrs elphinstone a good night and left her  chapter v it was not till after two or three readings with a palpitating heart  a heart so much agitated as hardly to leave her the use of her reason that celestina perfectly understood the meaning of willoughbys letter which ran thus  the only apology dear celestina that the unhappy willoughby has to offer for his conduct is to relate to you all that has befallen him since that fatal night when he parted from you at alvestone the emotions which i must feel while i write i will endeavor to suppress both for your sake and my own it shall be if i can command myself a history of events rather than of the sufferings to which those events have condemned me you know that after the abrupt and unaccountable note that i received i hastened to the inn at exeter where i was informed some persons who had business of the utmost importance which admitted not of a moments delay waited to see me the terms in which the note was written were such as gave me a strange alarm though i knew not what to dread this uneasy astonishment was not lessened when after much appearance of mystery i was introduced to  lady castlenorth  you know the woman and can imagine how ill her harshness when irritated by the malignity of disappointed pride was calculated to soften the blow which it was her pleasure to give me herself she told me that having heard i was on the following morning to become your husband she felt it to be her duty to save me from the horrors of such a union by informing me that she knew you to be the daughter of my mother the daughter of that mr everard who was my tutor and that the woman she had with her who had been a servant in the house at the time could give the most indisputable account of your birth  stunned as by a stroke of thunder i turned toward the woman of whose face as a servant of my mothers i had not the least recollection i know not what i said to her i only remember that she gave in a confused and vulgar way an account of what she pretended to have been witness to i suffered her to talk on for my very soul was sinking with anguish my mothers honor destroyed my celestina torn from me my soul recoiled from the idea as from an execrable falsehood yet when i remembered the solemn injunction that beloved mother gave me in her last moments to marry miss fitzhayman the promise she drew from me never otherwise to unite myself  when my agonized mind ran back to the displeasure she sometimes expressed at my fondness and admiration for you  i dared not with all the pain and all the horror i felt i dared not throw from me with indignation this odious intelligence i dared not load the hateful communicators of it with the odium which would have been dictated by my swelling heart had it not been checked by these sad recollections which pressed upon me in despite of myself and gave me something like internal evidence of the facts i would very fain have denied  there was in the countenance of lady castlenorth something of insolent triumph which i could not bear she made a merit of her disinterested conduct and talked of virtue and honor and integrity till i was blind and deaf she then threw out some reflections on my mothers memory which roused me from the torpor of amazement and sorrow to resentment she uttered some malignant sarcasms against you and i flew from her  she had however completely executed her purpose if it was that of rendering me the most wretched of human beings and in quitting the house which she did soon afterward had the barbarous pleasure of knowing that she had destroyed my peace for some time  if not for ever  to return to you celestina under the doubts which distracted me was impossible to become your husband  so lately the fondest the first wish of a heart that doated upon you was not to be thought of while ideas of so much horror obtruded themselves on my mind yet to leave you without accounting for my absence to leave you to all the torturing suspense of vague conjectures to leave you to suppose i had deceived and forsaken you was cruel was unpardonable it was however what after a long and dreadful struggle i determined to do i might indeed have put an end to your conjectures by delivering you over to others more tormenting  by communicating the doubts lady castlenorth had raised but this i found i could less bear to do than even to leave you wholly in suspense believing her capable of any thing which revenge or malice could dictate there was reason notwithstanding all my trembling apprehensions to suppose it more than possible that she might have invented the story and have bribed the woman with her to give evidence of it is truth to this possibility my mind clung with the eagerness of a drowning wretch and i could not resolve to sully before you the memory of my angel mother which i know you hold in such tender veneration i could not determine to raise in your delicate and sensible mind doubts and terrors which might make such fatal impressions as might impede our union even if the fallacy of this invention to divide us was detected in a state of mind then which i will not attempt to describe i at length determined to send for cathcart and without explaining even to him the motives of my sudden journey to secure if i could your continuance at alvestone and to set out myself to discover the real circumstances of your birth and never to return till i had the most thorough convinction that you were not the daughter of my mother or till i could learn to consider you if it were so  only as a beloved sister  ah celestina i little knew the task i undertook yet with anguish and depression to which no words can do justice i set about it my first step was to find out watson my mothers old servant who had never i knew left her for many years i knew that after her death and on receiving the legacy of fifty pounds that her mistress left her she had retired to the house of her son who was married and settled at whitehaven i might have written to have enquired after her but then i must have waited some days in suspense i could not bear and while i was in motion i felt my misery less from an idea that i was doing something to end it i sat out therefore on horseback for whitehaven and on my arrival there learned that she had been dead about six weeks this first hope of certainty thus frustrated it occurred to me that perhaps among her papers there might be some memorandums that would be useful and as she always hired and discharged the inferior servants and kept an account of the time and terms of their service in a book i flattered myself that i might find some date of the time when hannah biscoe who pretended to have been in her confidence and to have been entrusted with a secret of such importance really lived in the family  i told her son that to see all the papers his mother had left was of importance to me he readily brought all he had there were some books of accounts and some memorandums about servants but none that gave me any light or were of any importance to my enquiry for none went back above ten years the man told me there were more but that not knowing they were of any consequence or even supposing them likely to be called for he had given them to his children who had cut them to pieces i believe however sir said he that there are some letters in a drawer of a bureau which i remember to have seen during my mothers illness i will fetch them if you think they will be of any service  i desired him to do so and he brought me about twenty letters some of them were from my mother while she was in london in the years      and    0 and watson was at alvestone with you and my sister of whom she had as you well remember the care on all occasions where it was necessary for my mother to be absent you were then about nine and matilda about eleven years old the only sentences of any kind of consequence were these  i have no notion of any real danger from the landing of troops from the fleets of france and spain no landing can take place and it is all nonsense and bravado i thought you had more sense watson than to catch the panic of the vulgar and the ignorant which they rather like to communicate however since you write so pressingly to know what should be done if any thing should happen i give you an answer first that nothing will happen and secondly if you have any alarm which a reasonable being would consider such take my two girls and bring them up hither instantly but i shall be down at alvestone in about ten days and nothing can happen within that time believe me  my two girls was the only sentence in this letter on which i could lay any stress my two girls well and what then have i not heard my mother a thousand times say my two girls my matilda my celestina were names indiscriminately used my children even my daughters were terms not unfrequent with her ah little little did her generous and benevolent heart suppose that such advantage might be taken of that generosity  of that benevolence for now  even now  no  i do not i cannot i will not believe that celestina has any other claim to her friendship to her protection than what arose from that generosity and benevolence now do i say  can i say it oh heaven how dreadfully contradictory are the sentiments that agitate and tear my heart  let me however recall my scattered thoughts and remember that it is a simple history of facts only and not of feelings that i promised to relate  another letter was written to watson when mr everard after a very tedious illness which had long confined him in town went down to alvestone in the year eighty for change of air rather than to his own parsonage where some repairs were then going on this letter was expressive of great solicitude and anxiety but from thence what could be inferred nothing but that the dear and benevolent writer was solicitous for the health of a friend to whom she had long been attached there was not in this a word on which the most invidious observer could dwell nor was there in any other letter a syllable to give me any confirmation of what i dreaded to find still i procured from the person who had succeeded to watsons effects every paper and every book that remained but i found nothing and returned to london as miserable as dissatisfied as i left it  nothing made me more wretched than the questions with which i was now persecuted i fled from society stopped at a small village in the neighborhood of london where i avoided every body who was likely to know me and thought only how i might satisfy my own torturing doubts and escape those of others  the most obvious method seemed to be to find out the woman who had accompanied lady castlenorth and question her when she was no longer under the influence of her employer but this i could not do without getting at my uncles house information which i knew not how to set about to go there was hateful to me i could not now bear the sight of people whom i had never loved and to whom i imputed all the misery i labored under  my servant farnham had been little used to those sort of negociations and knew not much better than i did how to ingratiate himself into the favor of the persons through whose means only he could procure the intelligence so necessary to us he went however about it as well as he could but all i learned was that lady castlenorth had soon after her journey into devonshire sent the woman who accompanied her away into her native country which was either norfolk or suffolk and with so much secrecy that nobody knew whither she was gone or how she was provided for but farnham with some difficulty drew from the rest of the servants with whom he found means of conversing that she had boasted in some moments of vulgar exultation that her fortune was made for ever  no clue however could i obtain by which i could find out this woman and after much fruitless enquiry where the art of the adversary with whom i had to engage baffled all my assiduity i determined to go to lord castlenorth to state to him the stigma that his wife had thrown on the honor of my mother his sister and to demand that i might have proofs of the facts she alleged such as she could now give or that she might acknowledge the wickedness and injustice of her aspersions  i was not aware till i conversed with lord castlenorth to how debilitated a state indolence ignorance pride and prejudice can reduce the human mind his however was of so singular a cast that instead of being shocked at the injury done to his sisters honor he affected to resent in spite of his family pride my doubts of his wifes veracity flew from the point to which i attempted to bring him and we parted in mutual disgust at least i was disgusted and more wretched and more hopeless than before i had made this attempt  every effort to discover the retreat of the woman failing my next measure was to go to the convent at hieres it was owing to these cruel circumstances celestina that i left you in doubt while i remained in england it was owing to these that i left england in the hope  though it became every day more mingled with apprehension  that i left england without accounting to you for my conduct were these surmises groundless why should i empoison your delicate mind why should i sully for a moment the sacred fame of my mother by divulging them were they found to be at length too well substantiated it would be then time enough to inform you of them  on my arrival at hieres i went directly to the present confessor of the community out of whose care my mother took you i found him to be intelligent obliging and officious from him i learned that the present superior was a young woman of good family who had been compelled to take the veil and who would probably have very few real scruples as to giving me all the information she could  i succeeded easily in my research as far as it depended on these two persons i found that the memorandum of my mothers having taken you out of the convent by the name of celestina de mornay remained and i found with emotions on which i must not dwell that there was another memorandum of expenses for the little english child received at the request of madame de p  such is the literal sense of the french words who then was this madame de p  an old nun who had lived in the house above five and twenty years and who was the only person who recollected any circumstances of your reception told me that she well remembered that this madame de p  came from bayonne or some part of the country in the neighborhood of that town and that she was an intimate friend of the then abbess and her name of which only the initials were expressed in the memorandum was le marquise de pellatier  i enquired of the old nun if she knew on what ground it was you were represented as an english child she replied that she knew no more than that when first you were received under the care of the superior you were said to be the child of english parents or at least that one of your parents was of that nation but that soon afterward this was by the abbesss authority contradicted it was forbidden to be mentioned in the community and it was ordered that you should from that time be spoken of as mademoiselle de mornay while intimations were given that you were a relation of her own born of a concealed marriage and that your father being dead and your mother married to another person you were to be considered as belonging only to the community in which you were destined to pass your life  ah celestina what food was here for those corrosive conjectures which preyed on my heart having exhausted however every kind of information which it was here possible to procure i set out for bayonne where some of the family at least of madame de pellatier were i understood to be found  she had herself been dead some years i met however with her son a gay young man of four or five and twenty from whom i could obtain nothing but a general confession that his mother probably had from the general tenor of her life occasion in more than one instance to exercise the secrecy and kind offices of her friends and very probably obliged them in her turn and when i explained to him my reasons for the anxious enquiries i made which i thought the only means likely to interest him for me he said that he was  vraiment au desespoir at the little embarras into which i had fallen that la belle demoiselle might be my sister or might be his that he had not the least hope of being of service to me in unravelling the mystery for he had destroyed all his mothers papers in pursuance of her dying directions some years before and did not believe the slightest trace remained of any connection with an english lady or an english family i enquired where his mother lived in the years    0 and      which was about the time of your birth and where in the year      the time of your reception in the convent he replied that she was then sometimes at paris where she was believed to have an arrangement with count w  a german nobleman sometimes at pezenas and sometimes at hieres from all this i could gather nothing to my purpose and monsieur de pellatier soon quitting his house in the neighborhood of bayonne to go to paris i returned thither also infinitely more unhappy than before my research  all i have related celestina is so little convincing when it is put together that perhaps i ought not to lay any stress upon it when to such slight and unsatisfactory ground of conjecture is opposed the character and the principles of my mother yet shall i tell you truly that the energy with which she pressed me with her last words to marry miss fitzhayman the displeasure she always showed at my expressing any partiality toward you her grief at the death of mr everard which it was easy to see she never recovered some words which though i could not clearly understand them escaped her lips almost with her last sigh and in which the name of celestina seemed united with some ardent prayer or some earnest injunction while in her cold convulsed hand she pressed mine to her trembling lips oh celestina those sounds i have since interpreted into a confession of this fatal secret still still inarticulate as they were they vibrate on my heart and now united with the story of lady castlenorth and the circumstances i have gathered of your being born of english parents  all all unite to render me wretched  yet there is not the least likeness between you and my mother there is not the remotest resemblance between you and mr everard who had remarkably strong features and very red hair oh celestina what am i to conjecture what am i to do can i ought i on such grounds to resign you can i ever learn to consider you only as my sister where shall i go next how satisfy my doubts how ever possess again a moments happiness every other evil is light to this even the disorder of my affairs the necessity i shall soon be in to sell alvestone is hardly felt on my leaving england i raised money at an enormous premium in order to pay vavasour what i could not bear to owe him uncertain as i was what would become of me this together with my absence has alarmed some of my mortgagees who talk of foreclosing their mortgages while my own neglect of my affairs has in despite of cathcarts assiduity contributed to my embarrassments but what are these inferior distresses compared to the wretchedness of a heart adoring celestina yet afraid of indulging his passion lest it lead him into guilt ah every evil fortune could inflict but this i could bear  but again it is necessary to recall my pen from the description of feelings to the narrative of facts  lord and lady castlenorth and their daughetr arrived in the early part of the summer in france i was then absent on the research i have related to you but heard they had been very earnest in their enquiries after me at paris and on my return thither some months afterward i received a letter from lord castlenorth earnestly desiring me to join them at florence or naples the letter imported that the alliance he once wished was no longer in question but that finding his health every day declining he wished to see the only male relation he had on the settlement of some family concerns  this invitation i ought not perhaps on other accounts to have refused but the hope of being able to gain some farther intelligence of the circumstances which occupied my mind incessantly determined me at once to accept it i went then and met them at florence where my uncle received me with as much overacted civility as when we parted last he had treated me with supercilious scorn  i found him however not more reasonable than before the prejudices that had taken possession of his mind were so strong that he was angry and amazed that what made the whole business of his life could be to any other person matters of mere indifference he talked to me incessantly of remedies for the gout of the medicines he was taking and of their effects told me how he slept and how he eat and read dissertations without end on chronic disorders in general and from this discourse he glided by some link which escaped me into his other favorite science heraldry oh the quarterings and bearings which i was compelled to affect hearing the genealogies i was distracted with and the marriages and intermarriages to which i appeared to listen while in fact i knew nothing of what he said and only endured this sort of martyrdom in the hope of seeing lady castlenorth who on my first visits did not deign to appear  all these latter harangues were i found intended to impress on my mind the pride and prudence which would attend a union with my cousin his daughter and the advantage it would give me above any other alliance i could form my patient acquiescence was imputed to returning inclination for this boasted connection and when i was thought to be sufficiently impressed with the ideas thus meant to be conveyed to me and to be weaned from the weakness i had betrayed i was admitted without any solicitation however on my part to the honor of seeing lady castlenorth and her daughter  the elder lady was the only one of them with whom i wished to have any conversation and her love of hearing herself talk obtained me this favor in spite of all the displeasure she had conceived against me but it was very difficult to bring her to converse on that subject which alone interested me she would talk politics or give me a dissertation on the nature of the soul or on the eruptions of vesuvius descant on the age of the world or on her own ageif her auditors would allow her to be not quite five and forty but of celestina she would not talk and if ever i in spite of her evasions introduced the conversation she affected to hear me with horror and to consider every mention i made of a person whom she called so connected with me as the most indelicate and improper conversation with which i could entertain her she was for the most part surrounded when i was admitted to her with abbati and the oracle of a circle she had herself formed in which it was generally impracticable to entertain her with any other conversation than that she chose to lead to  her daughter who had formerly received me with so much haughtiness and who had since been offended in the tenderest point a point too in which her extreme vanity had rendered her particularly susceptible affected no longer the overweening pride which in our first interviews had been so repulsive but a soft melancholy which sits well enough on some people but was in her more likely to move mirth than pity she seldom spoke to me but when she did it was with the air of one whose just indignation was conquered by softer sentiments i knew i never could deserve those sentiments from her and therefore was very sorry to see them even though certain they were feigned  but it was here only i could hope to gain any information of the woman hannah biscoe who pretended to have lived with my mother near twenty years since lady castlenorth evaded with wonderful art ever giving me any trace of this circumstance and of her daughter i knew it was in vain to enquire but there was a little smart italian girl called justina who had attended on miss fitzhayman for some time and who had been in england with her and i took occasion as often as i could see her to say some obliging thing to her and sometimes to make her a trifling present justina in consequence of my taking so much notice of her began officiously to put herself in my way and i believe her vanity prompted her for some time to suppose i had very different motives for my attention than those with which i was really actuated  but in a foreign woman of that rank even vanity usually yields to avarice when i had obtained an opportunity of clearly explaining myself justina undertook to procure me a direction to the woman whom i was so solicitous to find she produced it in about a week but artfully evaded my question as to how she came by it i sent off my own servant instantly with it determined to follow him myself if the information as to her place of abode proved to be true i received an account from him that a few days before his arrival at the house in suffolk where she was said to live she had removed from thence and the people either did not know or would not tell whither she was gone  this seemed so like an artifice of lady castlenorths to prevent my making the enquiry which she knew i had so long and so earnestly desired that i could now no longer doubt but that justina had betrayed me but during this disquieting suspense time wore away and you celestina  what did you what could you think of me  i entertained the strongest hopes that since lady castlenorth so industriously kept me from the person she had herself produced as likely to give me authentic and indisputable testimony that she knew her evidence would not bear investigation and to this hope i eagerly adhered my mind however was too much irritated by the idea of such complicated treachery to allow me to keep terms with her as i had hitherto done i was wandering about italy all the time of farnhams absence on his rejoining me i went back to the residence of lord castlenorth and very peremptorily taxed his wife with fraud i denied that hannah biscoe lived with my mother at the period she pretended to have done so and that least i should discover the deception that she had been sent away from the place where i had with difficulty discovered her  lady castlenorth affected the calm indifference of injured innocence the proud consciousness of ill treated integrity she affected to declare that she was desirous of my seeing this hannah biscoe that she knew not of her departure from the place whither she went which was the house of a brother in law nor was in any way concerned about her but added she rising and going to a cabinet where she kept papers you shall presently be convinced that she did live with your mother in the year    0  she took out a letter which i saw immediately to be my mothers hand it was directed to hannah biscoe at mrs willoughbys south audleystreet where my mothers town house then was these were the words  hannah i desire you will immediately on receipt of this go to kensington and deliver the enclosed to the person for whom it is directed and let me know by the return of the post whether the orders i gave in a former letter were executed and how everything goes on there  alvestone april       0 m willoughby   i returned the letter to lady castlenorth and expressed myself very warmly insisting upon it that from such evidence nothing could be derived or even guessed at but she bade me with a contemptuous smile remember that when i questioned this woman at exeter she had told me that you were for the first months of your life nursed at kensington whither she went almost every day to see you and that at five or six months old you were sent abroad and when my mother went to the south of france on pretense of recovering her health eighteen or twenty months after the death of my father you were conveyed thither and there put under the care of a friend who placed you soon after with the superior of the convent of st celestine at hieres as a relation of her own  the coincidence of this story with what i had heard before relative to madame pellatier struck me with more force than any thing i had yet learned i left the house of lord castlenorth more miserable than i had ever been before and again set out for provence hardly knowing why and not caring at all what became of me  ever since that period celestina i have been wandering from place to place in search of information which i cannot obtain and which obtained would certainly render me wretched if indeed any wretchedness can be greater than that which in my present state of miserable uncertainty it is my lot to suffer  are we then celestina are we related by blood and is there an invincible bar between us was my mother that admirable that excellent and almost faultless woman capable of living in a state of continual dissimulation as to you and of hiding one fault by another which might have been followed by consequences so hideous to my imagination oh celestina it seems sacrilege to her memory to think it yet her aversion to my expressions of tenderness toward you her conduct in a hundred instances i can recollect her strong injunctions the promise she extorted from me to marry miss fitzhayman  a promise urged with such vehemence even in her last moments could the poor consideration of pecuniary advantage influence her then did it ever influence her and the repetition of your name with her last breath mingled with words that might be a prayer for you but which i have since thought was possibly the fatal secret which she determined to divulge only in death the sad recollection of that scene her countenance which i continually behold her voice which murmurs still in my ears all all contribute to empoison every moment of my life and to make that tender affection that ardent love which was once the joy of my existence and the pride of my heart the severest curse with which heaven can pursue me  yes celestina unless i dared indulge that fondness with which my heart overflows i would i could forget you for ever and determine never to see you more for i despair of ever seeing you as i  pardon me i am lost in the confusion of sensations i cannot describe and at this moment i hope so miserable a being does not exist on this earth write to me celestina you have more strength of mind than i have you are not like me the sport of agonizing passions write to me tell me what you would have me do farther to unveil this sad mystery or to throw it from us for ever if that may be i have told vavasour what it appeared impossible longer to conceal from him he is warmly my friend and you may employ him in any way in which you think he can be useful celestina i commit you to his protection till  till when heaven only knows and i dare not trust my pen with another word only i entreat you to write to me and may every happiness that virtue and innocence and excellence like yours deserves ever be the portion of my celestina whatever becomes of the unhappy  g willoughby   thus ended this long letter and thus was explained the strange circumstances that had cost celestina so many tears but she wept not now she read the letter over twice her first tremulous emotion subsided but her stunned senses had not recovered their tone it was late it was cold her candle had burnt nearly out she put the letter on her pillow and unable to undress herself threw herself on the bed in her clothes and lay pondering on what she had read on willoughbys situation and her own till the tedious night was at an end  chapter vi vavasour who had passed great part of his night over a bottle was not however at all more disposed to sleep toward morning than if he had been in bed but at half after seven oclock he sent the housemaid to know if miss de mornay was up and if she was directed the servant to give his compliments to her and let her know that he should take it as a favor if she would allow him to speak to her for a few moments before her other friends were assembled  celestina had but just fallen into an unquiet slumber when she was awakened by the maid who tapped at the door from an uneasy dream indeed but from a change of uneasiness with her returning memory all the purport of willoughbys letter returned and vavasours message added most painfully the recollection that she must discuss it all with him  she ordered him to be told that she was not very well and could not immediately attend him then shaking off the heavy lassitude which uneasiness and want of rest had occasioned she called to her aid all that strength of mind and rectitude of heart with which she was eminently endowed by nature and having again read over willoughbys letter began to consider what she ought to do  with a doubt of such a nature on his mind she resolved whatever it cost her never to meet him but as his sister unless which was very improbable the strong and bewildering circumstances which had given rise to such an idea could all be removed with so much purity did she love him that she felt that were he happy with another and his esteem and tenderness for her undiminished she could be content through life to find her felicity in witnessing his she resolved therefore after much debate with herself and some pangs of unavoidable regret that since this dark and unpassable barrier was raised either by nature or by artifice between her and the only man she had ever thought of with fond partiality she would never marry but would leave him at full liberty to complete that union with miss fitzhayman which might at once fulfill his engagement to his mother wean him from that lingering fondness for her which it was folly if not guilt to indulge and retrieve his pecuniary concerns from those embarrassments which were now hastening to overwhelm him  having formed this heroic and proper determination she endeavored to compose her countenance to quiet the agitation of her mind and to meet vavasour with that degree of calm spirit which she imagined from past experience of his behavior such a meeting would require  this however was easier to imagine than to execute she wished indeed to meet him without witnesses because she knew he possessed too little of that delicacy which would teach him to repress any part of his knowledge before strangers as mrs elphinstone and montague thorold were to him but when she opened the door of the room where she knew he waited for her the blood forsook her cheeks her trembling hands refused the little exertion necessary to turn the lock her feet refused to carry her forward and she would have returned without speaking to him for that time if he who was eagerly waiting her approach had not heard her light foot steps in the passage and opened the door while she yet stood hesitating at it  he was struck by the fight of her swollen and heavy eyes the languor of her air and the paleness of her countenance and his usual address which had more of warmth and vivacity than elegance was softened by the real concern of which he was at that moment sensible he took her hand which trembled within his as he led her to a feat  i am sorry said he to see that you are not well  celestina tried to speak but could not vavasour had but an indifferent notion of administering consolation nor could he contrive to condole with her for what he secretly rejoiced at himself so that between his dissembled concern and his undissembled satisfaction he sat a moment or two silent and then remarked that the letter he had brought gave a very good account of georges health  celestina without having any very precise idea of what she said answered faintly yes and by this time vavasour added that it contained also he supposed like what he had at the sametime received the history of a devilish awkward mysterious business  celestina who found herself unequal to the conversation thought it better to put an end to it at once and for ever she therefore by an effort of resolution commanded voice enough to say  mr vavasour you understand undoubtedly that every idea of the alliance between your friend and me is at an end for ever as for the reasons that exist against it a thousand motives make me wish they may remain secret from this moment therefore you will very much oblige me by forbearing to speak of mr willoughby otherwise than as my best friend and by concealing from the world a secret in which it can have no interest but which will give pain to many to have divulged  divulged cried he laughing what then do you suppose it is any secret  to be sure i do she replied  oh yes answered he that is mighty likely when lady castlenorth has taken such pains to talk of it every where already  lady castlenorth cried celestina a faint blush rising in her pale cheek  aye to be sure said vavasour carelessly that she did months ago why dont you know that besides the interest she had in dividing you and willoughby because her daughter is in love with him it seems she always hated his mother and that death itself is no barrier against malice like here is  do you think it probable or possible that this story may be entirely the effect of that malice  why faith no i own i do not you know  at least people tell me so who do know that it was whispered about a great many years ago and even said that everard was privately married to mrs willoughby but what signifies talking about it added he seeing her again change color  you have just been desiring me to say nothing about it george seems to me to have made up his mind about it he will marry his cousin and retrieve his estates as was his first plan and my fair celestina and he took her hand will look out for somebody else to transfer those affections to that he resigns  no sir said celestina withdrawing her hand hastily from him they are not i assure you so easily transferred  i am glad to hear it replied vavasour without being at all discomposed by her manner for then i hope this pedantic young fellow whom i find here traveling with you will not have the presumption to suppose he has any chance of obtaining them pray tell me  how comes he here with you is he any relation of the people you are with  this was a question it was impossible for celestina to answer ingenuously the piercing and enquiring eyes of vavasour inflamed and fierce from the late hours and free use of wine the preceding night were fixed on her face she changed countenance felt that she did and again her complexion altered the various emotions with which she was agitated consciousness that she must no longer think of willoughby as a lover yet could never admit another to that distinction consciousness too that montague thorold must appear in the eyes of the world to have succeeded to that place and anger that vavasour should thus presume on the confidence of willoughby to question her with a freedom he had otherwise no pretensions to all combined to affect to distress and to deprive her for a few moments of that presence of mind which from the strength and clearness of her understanding was usually at her command  vavasour who from the time he found willoughby must in all probability resign her made no doubt of succeeding to her affections who had no idea of the sensations which pressed on her heart from his total inability to feel them himself became irritated and impatient at the silence his own impetuosity had occasioned he sat eagerly reading on her countenance the emotions of her heart and interpreting them his own way again he repeated his question  how came young thorold with you is he related to these elphinstones  you must enquire of him celestina was on the point of saying but the fear least a quarrel between them should be the consequence of her so answering checked her she tried therefore to evade the question of what concern is it said she  how he came hither we were talking of mr willoughby pray tell me  is he aware that our supposed relationship is talked of does he know the pains lady castlenorth has been at to circulate the story  it is impossible for me to know that said vavasour as it really was it is much more in your way to tell me how this college boy came hither with you  i know no right you have to enquire about it answered celestina faintly because i cannot see that it is a concern in which you are at all interested  you will give me leave then to make my own conclusions or rather added he in a louder voice on seeing montague thorold enter the room rather to interrogate the gentleman himself  this was exactly what celestina had been most solicitous to avoid the impetuosity of vavasour the surprise and anger she saw flashing from the eyes of thorold her sleepless night and long agitated spirits the fear of she knew not what consequences from these two inflammable spirits and her inability to check or repress those over whom she had no pretense to assume any authority were together a combination of cruel circumstances which might have overcome a stronger mind than here is mrs elphinstone was dejected from situation and languid from recent sorrow of her own to her therefore celestina would in any case reluctantly have applied and now she could not leave the room to seek her without leaving together two men who seemed so highly irritated against each other that the first moment of her absence would probably bring them to extremities  to speak to vavasour was to address the winds or the sea she saw that he was hardly sober that he was incapable of feeling for her distress or of listening to any thing but his passionate impetuosity it was on thorold alone she had any hopes of prevailing but in the moment of her deliberation this hope seemed escaping her  before she could determine on what to do vavasour had in a manner at once contemptuous and hasty addressed himself to montague thorold and enquired how it happened that he was at york attending on mrs elphinstone and miss de mornay  how it happens sir said thorold is there then any thing so very extraordinary in it may i not be at york or at canterbury  yes replied vavasour when you are archbishop of either and then you will be for aught i know in your right place but at present i think you in the wrong one  what you think sir replied thorold is the last thing that ever can be of any consequence to me and if my actions are as i apprehend of as little to you i imagine we can find some pleasanter topic than either the one or the other on which to entertain this lady  he then approached celestina who was he saw ready to sink from her chair and softening his voice said  you are ill i am afraid  no replied she but i am alarmed and uneasy and i beg of you continued she lowering her voice i beg of you to keep your temper let mr vavasour say what he will  i cannot promise that said he in the same tone but i can promise never voluntarily to do or say any thing that shall give you a moments pain do not be so distressed i beseech you let me find mrs elphinstone you tremble you seem ready to faint  i am indeed replied she affected from numberless causes if you will be so good as to call mrs elphinstone i will be much obliged to you  thorold went immediately to obey her and vavasour approaching her cried  i see how it is that young fellow is to console you for the loss of willoughby your partiality to him i always suspected and am now too well convinced of it  well sir cried celestina assuming in some degree her usual spirit and admitting it to be so i do not really understand by what pretense you call me to an account for it  by my own long and ardent affection for you cried he of which however you may now choose to affect ignorance you cannot have been ignorant i sacrificed it to willoughbys prior claim and to your visible attachment to him but i am not humble enough to withdraw my pretensions in favor of such a raw boy as montague thorold  i am obliged to you sir answered celestina for the predilection you avow in my favor though it cannot command my affection it demands my sincerity and i therefore assure you that though i am now perhaps at liberty i have no intention of engaging myself again i shall hope to be allowed to consider both you and mr thorold as my friends while i absolutely decline any preference to either  the pride of vavasour was hurt extremely by this speech though he was not personally vain yet he had from his infancy been so accustomed to have his own way that opposition from any quarter was new and insupportable to him mrs elphinstone and thorold at this moment entering the room he for once checked himself and breakfast being ready he was invited to partake of it which however he declined but told celestina on retiring that he must desire to see her again alone in an hour  celestina now attempted to repress the various emotions with which she was agitated and to quiet the throbbings of her heart she sat down to the table and tried to eat but could not while montague thorold watching with eager fondness every turn of her countenance officiously tried to engage her to partake of the breakfast that was before her  as soon as she could however she withdrew and after a moments pause alone her scattered and oppressed senses were collected enough to bring before her all that had happened and tears which she had not hitherto been able to shed came to her relief  her reason too came to her assistance and strengthened the resolution she had formed after her first perusal of willoughbys letter but though she was able to decide on what she ought to do herself she saw many painful circumstances likely to be created by the violence of vavasour and the impossibility of prevailing either on him or on montague thorold to leave her and mrs elphinstone to pursue their journey with the others or what she would still have preferred of continuing it without the attendance of either  when the mind is oppressed with any heavy affliction the less serious evils which at other times it can repel or submit to are felt with painful impatience mrs elphinstone drooping and depressed from her past sufferings and future apprehensions could no longer interpose to check the impetuosity of two young men each of whom thought himself at liberty to attend on celestina while celestina herself who never meant to encourage either and whose heart was so recently wounded by the dread of having lost that protection on which she was wont with fondness to rely was yet more unequal to the exertion which was necessary to part these men who were determined to look upon each other as rivals or to keep them within the bounds of civility if they persisted in remaining together  anxious to proceed toward the house of cathcart and to put her children under the care of her brother while she herself tried to enter on some mode of life by which to procure them a subsistence mrs elphinstone became impatient of any farther delay while celestina though equally anxious to get forward trembled at the thought of a journey which she foresaw would produce a quarrel and perhaps a duel before they had proceeded three stages  sometimes she thought of leaving the whole party abruptly and going on as speedily as possible alone but besides her unwillingness to leave mrs elphinstone she foresaw that if she did this vavasour would follow and overtake her and thorold would hardly content himself with attending her friend while certain that vavasour was with her after much consideration therefore nothing seemed to remain but to endeavor to prevail on thorold to go forward without them than which nothing seemed much more unlikely to succeed unless it was the same attempt on vavasour she felt too a reluctance in asking a favor of thorold which he might interpret as encouragement she never meant to give him and was afraid that the assurances she must make him in regard to her total indifference toward vavasour might afford him reason to hope that toward him she would be less inexorable  it was necessary however immediately to make the essay and therefore sending for mr thorold she with trembling hesitation told him that the letters brought by mr vavasour had been decisive in regard to ending the intended alliance between her and mr willoughby but she had hardly uttered the word willoughby before the countenance of montague thorold was animated with all the warm hopes to which this intelligence gave birth she saw it with concern and with as much resolution as she could besought him to attend to her while with a faultering voice and her tears with difficulty repressed she went on  that i shall now never be the wife of willoughby is certain but do not misunderstand me i have determined never to be the wife of any other person i shall go for the rest of the winter to lady horatia howard and afterward retire to some village as remote as possible from that part of england where i once expected to pass my life this resolution is unalterable but though i never can return as you wish the favorable sentiments with which you have honored me my friendship my gratitude my esteem it is in your power to secure and    friendship gratitude esteem cried montague thorold can i be content with such cold words i who can never for an instant disengage my thoughts from you i who worship your very shadow and who cannot bear the thoughts of quitting you even for a moment oh celestina if ever the most pure and violent love deserved a return    forgive me cried celestina if in my turn i interrupt you do you not mistake your sentiments or by an abuse of terms call a transient liking by that name which ought to belong only to that refined affection of the heart which leads us to prefer the happiness of another to our own and to sacrifice every inferior consideration to the sublime pleasure of promoting that happiness  heaven and earth cried thorold impetuously and do i not feel that sentiment in all its purity for you would i not lay down my life to procure you any real  almost any imaginary good  prove it interrupted celestina prove it by obliging me in the request i am going to make a request in which i must not be refused and which before i make it you must absolutely promise to grant  i promise returned thorold who had at that moment no idea whither her request tended i promise to obey you even though you desired my death if the sacrifice i make has any merit in your eyes how cheaply would your approbation be purchased even by the loss of existence  all that is very absurd and very wild replied celestina what i ask you can easily do and ought to do without reluctance  name it cried he and see how well i can obey you  celestina then told him that vavasour fancying his friendship with mr willoughby gave him a right to attend her meant she feared to go on with her and mrs elphinstone to london and from the dialogues which have twice passed between you and him added she there is reason to apprehend that your continuing together may be attended with very unpleasant consequences neither mrs elphinstone or i have courage to encounter the sort of contention which may arise between you and to avoid the hazard of it allow us to thank you for all the trouble you have taken for us and now to bid you adieu till we meet again in devonshire  montague thorold who from the moment he understood her had listened with impatience now protested that the promise he had just given could not be binding in an instance that must be as injurious to his honor as cruel to his feelings why should you suffer this mr vavasour said he to force himself upon you while you drive me from you what is this chimerical claim that he derives from willoughby who has resigned his own and how poor and spiritless must i appear who having been permitted that of seeing you thus far on your journey consent to resign to another the honor of attending you to the end of it to another who assumes a right no better founded than my own and to whom i am to give place for no other reason but because he rudely demands it you would despise me madam and i should deserve to be despised were i capable of so mean a desertion  this was exactly what celestina feared but persisting in her resolution to escape the alarm to which she must be subject from vavasour and montague thorolds being together during the journey she told the latter very calmly that unless he consented to oblige her and to go forward under pretense of being obliged to return home that their acquaintance must here end for ever  even against this fear his reluctante to yield or to appear to yield the right of attending her to vavasour awhile supported him the dread too leaft vavasour should now succeed for himself and that he should see those hopes destroyed for ever which he so fondly cherished since willoughby was out of the question made him resist still more forcibly the injunctions celestina desired to lay upon him at length his fear of offending her his real love for her and the sight of her uneasiness her assurances that vavasour never would have any particular interest in her favor though at the same time she bade him understand that he had himself no better claim and his wish to show her how much he preferred her satisfaction to his own prevailed upon him to sacrifice his pride and his fears to her entreaties and making himself acquainted with the place where she was to be with mrs elphinstone in london where he obtained permission to attend her as soon as she arrived montague thorold though still reluctantly and with great compulsion on himself departed alone and on post horses pursued his way to london  having thus prevailed on thorold to depart celestina again sat down to recollect her fatigued spirits she had some hours before determined to write to lady horatia howard and accept of the invitation so repeatedly offered her as soon as she saw mrs elphinstone safe in the protection and assistance of cathcart who was to meet them in london  this letter therefore she wrote and forwarded and as neither the weather or any other circumstance was now likely to render their progress hazardous mrs elphinstone agreed that they would set out at a very early hour the next morning  the day however was of necessity to be ended where they were and it was very certain that vavasour would pass it with them he had ordered for them every thing they were likely to have occasion for in a style infinitely superior to what they would themselves have thought of and when they met at dinner he received them as his guests and when his natural vivacity was heightened by that sort of triumph that he felt on finding that thorold was gone his exulting spirits were such as to be cruelly oppressive both to mrs elphinstone and celestina  incapable of entering into their feelings he had no idea of repressing his own he fancied there no longer existed any obstacle to his project in regard to celestina and as that project had long been the first of his heart and had become doubly important from the opposition it had met with he concealed no part of the pleasure he felt at what he fancied the absolute certainty of its immediate accomplishment  this was conduct that was insupportably distressing to celestina he spoke without scruple of the resignation willoughby had made of her hand and seemed to have as little delicacy as to the occasion of it of an attachment to him abstracted from every idea of becoming his wife vavasour had no idea and celestina had no courage to urge it so entirely did his want of feeling and the proud certainty he showed of his own success overwhelm her all she could do was to entreat mrs elphinstone not to leave her with him and to assist her as much as possible in attempting at least to check that assuming manner for which neither her former friendship for vavasour nor the regard willoughby had for him could in her opinion offer any apology  fortunately however for both her and her friend two young men of fortune much acquainted with vavasour arrived at the inn early in the evening and seeing his servants enquired for him and were shown into the room almost as soon as dinner was over celestina and her friend took the earliest opportunity to withdraw and vavasours attention to his guests over their wine delivered them for the rest of the evening from his company  he had taken care however to inform himself of all that related to their journey the next day but eager as he was to have celestina in the chaise with him he was compelled to desist from the request he at first ventured to make on her representing the impossibility of her leaving mrs elphinstone to whom though vavasour heartily wished her once more in the hebrides he had at length the complaisance to offer his place in his own chaise as being more commodious than the hired ones to be found on the road and agreed on her acquiescence in that arrangement to follow himself in a hack chaise with his servant  the gentlemen who had passed the evening with him at the inn were not less fond of the pleasures of the table than he was himself and their orgies had been prolonged till it was no longer worth while for him to go to bed with a very little alteration of his dress therefore and with a great deal of wine still in his head he was ready in the morning to set out but such was his appearance and such his manners in consequence of his debauch the preceding evening that celestina was more than ever solicitous to avoid him and had it been possible for her to have thought of him before with the slightest degree of partiality his looks and his conversation of this morning would have filled her with terror and disgust  as she traveled on however by the side of her dejected friend who had no spirits for conversation she could not amid all the reflection on her own circumstances which filled her mind avoid considering with melancholy regret the situation of this young man who with some talents and many virtues was thus yielding to the wild current of passion and vice and destroying his constitution and his fortune before he knew the value of either she then with mournful recollection contrasted his character with that of willoughby who had once all his vivacity tempered with so much sweetness so much attention to the feelings of others who had all his generosity of spirit and openness of heart without any of his careless dissipation and whose brighter talents were not obscured by vice nor degraded by folly and as all his virtues all his amiable qualities were enumerated her heart felt all the acuteness of sorrow in remembering too that under their influence she had lost the hope of passing her life yet the cruel pain of the reflection that these hopes were now at an end was immediately mitigated when she considered that this she might perhaps still do as his sister and his friend but her reason however it began to recover its tone could never say any thing to her that for a moment taught her to reflect with pleasure or even with tranquillity on the thoughts of his being united to miss fitzhayman  on reperusing willoughbys letter which she had now acquired courage to study more minutely she saw with new uneasiness what in the first tumult of her spirits had escaped her or at least made but a slight impression  that he recommended her particularly to the care and protection of vavasour and that as he had probably intimated the same trust to vavasour himself she should find it very difficult to disengage herself from his attendance  the longer she dwelt on willoughbys expressions the more she apprehended he was but too well convinced that the whole story of their relationship did not originate with lady castlenorth she foresaw that while even the shadow of a doubt remained their union never ought to be thought of but having nobody with whom she could properly discuss the various and contradictory ideas on this bewildering subject that passed through her mind she looked forward with earnest impatience to the hour when she should receive the maternal counsel and soothing consolation which lady horatia howard alone was likely to afford her  the journey however was to be performed and though she carefully avoided during the two days that it lasted being alone with vavasour yet she suffered extreme pain from the increasing conviction that he presumed on willoughbys total resignation of her and openly declared that he thought himself a candidate for her favor whose fortune and pretensions of every kind rendered him secure of success  at length the party reached london and cathcart received his sister and her friend at the lodgings he had prepared for them on being informed of the time of their arrival  the meeting between him and mrs elphinstone was too affecting to the already depressed spirits of celestina she retired early to her own room having with difficulty prevailed on vavasour to quit her and there endeavored to acquire steadiness to talk over with cathcart the next morning the purport of willoughbys letter and then to take leave of him and her poor dejected friend as lady horatia howard had received with avidity the information of her intended visit to her and was to send her coach for her at one oclock on the following day  chapter vii the morning at length arrived and the friends who had so long found all the consolation their circumstances admitted of in being together were now to part uncertain when or if ever they were to meet again mrs elphinstone sinking as she was under oppression of many present forrows and future apprehensions yet found them all deepened by the loss of celestina who had so generously assisted her in supporting them and celestina felt that when to soothe the spirits and strengthen the resolution of her friend was no longer her immediate task she should dwell with more painful and more steady solicitude on her own singular and unfortunate situation  cathcart warmly attached as he was to both from gratitude and from affection had no power to speak comfort to either early in the morning he had met celestina and gone through willoughbys letter but though his mind sometimes strongly resisted the idea of that relationship of which it spoke he had nothing to offer against it and could only sigh over the incurable unhappiness with which he saw the future days of friends he so much loved would be clouded  silently they all assembled round the breakfast table but nobody could eat cathcart tried to talk of jessy of his house of his farm of his fortunate prospects and of his sisters two little girls whom he had taken home but there was not one topic on which he could speak that did not remind him of the obligations he owed to celestina and willoughby nor one idea which arose unembittered with the reflection that they to whom he was indebted for all his happiness were themselves miserable  about twelve oclock vavasour came into the room in his usual way enquired eagerly of celestina when she went to lady horatia howards and when he could see her there and without waiting for an answer to his enquiry told her that he had that morning met sir philip molyneux and that lady molyneux had been in town about a week every body who were related to willoughby was interesting to celestina and from lady molyneux she had always supposed more might be collected than from any other person but now her mind was too much oppressed and too much confused to allow her to distinguish her sensations or to arrange any settled plan for her future conduct toward lady molyneux she received vavasours information therefore with coldness and indeed her manners toward him were very constrained and distant which he either did not or would not notice rattling on in his usual wild way though he saw the dejection and concern of the party a circumstance that more than ever disgusted celestina who began some time before to doubt whether the credit which vavasour had for good nature was not given him on very slender foundations for to be so entirely occupied by his own pleasures and pursuits as to be incapable of the least sympathy toward others to be unable or unwilling to check for one moment his vivacity in compliment to their despondence seemed to celestina such a want of sensibility as gave her a very indifferent opinion of his heart  mrs elphinstone quitted the room to make the last preparations for her departure but cathcart who had fettled every thing before remained with celestina and vavasour he would have given the world to have passed these moments in conversation with her but the presence of a third person and especially of vavasour put an end to all hope he had of an opportunity of explaining to her with that tenderness and caution which the subject required some circumstances relative to willoughbys fortune which had lately come to his knowledge new embarrassments seemed threatening him and a law suit involving part of the property which belonged to alvestone estate seemed likely to increase these embarrassments while the mortgagees were gradually undermining the estate itself and the absence of the master increased the impatience and mistrust of those who had claims upon it  all this cathcart thought celestina ought to know yet in their first interview that morning he had not courage to tell her of it and now vavasour left him no chance of doing it for while he yet deliberated the coach sent by lady horatia howard stopped at the door and the moment was come in which he was to take his leave of her  he took her hand and kissed it with an air of grateful respect but he could only say  i shall write to you in a few days and i hope give you a good account of my sister and of jessy  i hope you will returned celestina faintly  and added he you will of course like to hear of all that passes material in our neighborhood  certainly i shall replied she adieu dear sir i cannot say much but you know what i feel for you all  vavasour had taken her hand to lead her down stairs but she disengaged it from him and said to cathcart as she gave it to him  let us go to your sister he led her to the door of the room where at that moment mrs elphinstone entered pale and breathless her eyes were heavy and fixed on celestina but she did not weep celestinas tears however were more ready and as she embraced her friend they choked the trembling adieu she would have uttered and fell in showers on her bosom the emotion was too painful and cathcart desiring to end it for both their sakes disengaged his sister gently from the arms of the trembling celestina while vavasour again seizing her hand hurried her down stairs and as he put her into the coach told her he should call upon her the next day she would have besought him not to do it as a liberty he ought not to take in the house whither she was going but before she could sufficiently recover herself to find words the coach was driven away and in a few moments she found herself at the door of lady horatia howard in parkstreet grosvenorsquare and it became necessary for her to collect her spirits to acquit herself as so much kind attention deserved  lady horatia received her with unfeigned pleasure and with a degree of maternal kindness that set her almost immediately at ease with herself she was put into possession of her apartment and bade to remember that it was here is as long as she would occupy it and that her time was always ways to be her own i am going out said lady horatia to dinner today i have a great notion you had rather dine at home celestina owned she had be it so then replied she and whenever you prefer being at home to going with me i shall be pleased at your using that freedom without which such a situation as i am able to offer you would be not only of no value but a species of slavery while she said this in the kindest manner celestina observed that she looked very earnestly at her eyes which were red with weeping and examined with a kind of mournful enquiry her features which bore traces of the concern she had felt in parting from her friends and having thus examined her countenance some time her own which was remarkably expressive assumed a look of surprise tempered with concern and then as if she checked herself she rang for her woman to receive orders about celestinas dinner and while they remained together she gave the conversation a more general turn  when celestina was alone she ran over in her thoughts the transactions of the last month and wondered what fate would do with her next but not of herself alone she thought willoughby unhappy and unsettled his mind thrown from its balance by disappointment his talents lost in the bewildering uneasiness of uncertainty and his temper injured by the corrosive anxieties of pecuniary inconvenience he who had such a mind such a heart such talents such a temper who deserved every happiness and yet had hitherto known none willoughby wandering about the world to obtain confirmation of a fact which when known would only complete his misery was an object from which the thoughts of celestina could never a moment escape and a thousand times she wished she had never been born since to her to whomsoever she owed her birth willoughby certainly owed his unhappiness  it was time to consider of obeying the injunction he gave her toward the close of his letter to write to him but on this subject she determined to consult lady horatia howard as well as to ask her advice in what way she should act in regard to vavasour whose importunities she dreaded yet from whose visits she knew not how to disengage herself  under such protection however she knew that much of the inconvenience she must in other circumstances feel from vavasours behavior would be obviated and that the sense as well as the situation of lady horatia would prevent that improper familiarity which when she was only with cathcart or mrs elphinstone whom he looked upon as inferior and as dependent it was too much his nature to assume  with more complacency she thought of montague thorold and always of his father with a degree of affectionate reverence as to the young man though her heart never admitted in regard to him the slightest tendency toward that sort of partiality which could ever grow into love yet she had received so many marks of real and ardent attachment from him she thought so well of his talents and so much better of his heart that she could never divest herself of solicitude for his welfare perhaps  for in what heart however pure does not some such weakness lurk  perhaps the stories she had heard of his former universal propensity to form attachments and which were intended to prejudice her against him had an influence on her mind of which she was herself unconscious and that her selflove though no human being ever appeared to have less was gratified by having thus fixed a man so volatile and unsteady though she never could nor ever had given him reason to suppose she could return the passion she had thus inspired  while there remained any hope of ever seeing willoughby such as he had once been she had felt an utter repugnance to suffer the assiduities of montague thorold but willoughbys apparent neglect of her for some time before she left the isle of sky and the little probability there now was that they could ever meet in peace since the receipt of his letter had gradually and almost insensibly accustomed her to the attentions of montague thorold and though she felt for him nothing like love she could not help being sensible of a great difference in her sentiments toward him and toward vavasour one seemed to live only to obey and oblige her the other presuming on the advantages of fortune or on those which willoughbys friendship gave him appeared rather to demand than to solicit her regard  rather to resent her neglect of his suit than court as a favor her acceptance of it and if celestina had any fault it was a sort of latent pride the child of conscious worth and elevated understanding which though she was certainly obscurely and possibly dishonourably born she never could subdue and perhaps never seriously tried to subdue it she felt that in point of intellect she was superior to almost every body she conversed with she could not look in the glass without seeing the reflection of a form worthy of so fair an inhabitant as an enlightened human soul and could she have been blind to these advantages the preference willoughby had given her so early in life would have taught her all their value  it is not the consciousness of worth that is offensive and disgusting but the tribute of respect that is demanded of others who have perhaps no such conviction and of whom it is therefore unreasonable and arrogant to expect that they will acknowledge what they cannot perceive nobody was ever yet eminently handsome in person or eminently brilliant in intellect who did not feel from self evidence that they possessed those advantages though many from the infirmity and weakness of their tempers fancy they exist where none but themselves can find any shadow of them  good sense one prominent feature of which is a due attention to the opinion and to the self love of the rest of the world will rarely suffer those who possess it to obtrude even real advantages on the notice of others and without good sense little distinction appears between the real bloom of youth and beauty and the factitious charms purchased at a persumers both are if not equally disgusting equally devoid of all that can make them estimable or valuable of this good sense celestina possessed such a share that conscious as she was of that superiority of which she was continually told no village girl had ever more unaffected simplicity of manners and while her mind was irradiated by more than common genius and her knowledge very extensive for her time of life she was in company as silent and as attentive to the opinion of others as if she had possessed only a plain and common understanding with no other cultivation than what a common boarding school education afforded  her pride therefore so moderated was rather a virtue than a blemish and taught her to value herself but never to despise the rest of the world  there was about her too much of that disposition which the french call amenete a disposition to please by seeming interested for others by entering into their joys and sorrows and by a thousand little nameless kindnesses which though they consisted perhaps only in attending patiently to a tale of sorrow told by a mourner of whom the world was tired or who was tired of the world or listening with concern to the history of pain and confinement related by the valetudinarian smiling at the fond enthusiasm of a mother when she described the wit or beauty of a darling child or admiring the plans which an improver had laid down for the alteration of his grounds were all so many testimonies of a good disposition in the opinion of those toward whom these little civilities were exerted that celestina had formerly had almost as many friends as acquaintance wherever she appeared in the circle where she was now to move more splendid even than that where mrs willoughbys kindness had placed her it was probable that under such introduction as that of lady horatia howard all the charms of her person talents and temper would be seen to the utmost advantage  unaccustomed as vavasour was to look far into consequences he had discerned this as soon as he heard of the invitation celestina had received and he foresaw so many impediments to the pursuit of his wishes as well from the severity and prudery which he had heard imputed to lady horatia as from the interference of rivals that he would very gladly have persuaded her against accepting it had he had any pretense to offer for his objections but having none and not daring to invent any he had confined himself to mutterings against prudish old cats and representing to celestina that she was going to confine herself as an humble companion to bear all the caprices of a superannuated woman of quality celestina heard him at first with concern from an idea that he had heard lady horatia misrepresented but when on his afterward repeating this conversation she found that he knew nothing of her character even from report and only described her in so unpleasant a light from his wish to deter celestina from finding an asylum in her house anger conquered her concern and even her complaisance and she besought him in very strong terms never again to name lady horatia howard to her unless he could prevail upon himself to remember that she deserved from her character rather than her rank the respect of every man and particularly of every gentleman  vavafour had desisted then from talking of her in this style but he was not at all more reconciled to the abode celestina had chosen where if he was admitted to see her at all it would probably be only in the presence of those who would be little affected with his professions of that love which every day became a greater torment to him and little dazzled by that fortune which he had to offer as the price of its return  celestina however to whom he had repeatedly said that he would visit her thought she could not too soon apprize lady horatia of her situation and the first hour they were alone together lady horatia expressed such a desire to know all that had passed in regard to willoughby since she saw her on her journey into scotland that celestina without hesitation but not without great emotion related it all and put into her hands the letters received from willoughby  lady horatia read them and attended with great interest to what celestina related of the sudden appearance of montague thorold and the avowed pretensions of vavasour and after deliberating some time she smiled yet not with a smile of pleasure and said  it appears my love as if you were only come to tantalize me for a moment with your company for beset as you are by these young men i see i shall never be able to keep you long  ah madam replied celestina neither mr vavasour nor mr thorold can excite a wish in me to quit your protection while it is convenient to you to afford it to me and for my first my most beloved friend my  what shall i call him  he talks not of returning to england and if he does    and if he does return interrupted lady horatia you must and rightly formed as your heart is you do i am sure understand that while the faintest mist of doubt hangs over you you ought never to meet him unless indeed one of you were married  allow me to ask madam said celestina in a tremulous voice allow me to ask your ladyship who were so well acquainted with mrs willoughby whether from any recollection of remarks made in her life time you have any persuasion as to the foundation of those doubts  you might have seen replied lady horatia from the purport of a letter i wrote to you while you were in scotland that i had even then heard rumors of the cause of your separation from willoughby which lady castlenorth had very industriously set forth i judged from what i then heard that if it was not true her art would be so effectually exerted that you would never discover the deception and that you must be rendered unhappy it was therefore i advised you to detach yourself as much as you could from what is childishly called a first love i thought that what mr willoughby was then said to be on the point of completing  his marriage with miss fitzhayman  was the very best thing he could do both for his own sake and yours for if it should be found you are related the very idea is attended with too much horror to be dwelt upon and even if it is a fabrication of lady castlenorths unless it can be clearly proved to be so your whole life might be embittered by it besides my dear celestina how could mr willoughby circumstanced as i understand he is in regard to money matters how could he afford to marry you  celestina sighed deeply from the recollection of the arrangements as to all those affairs which willoughby had so fondly made and to which she had so fondly listened then recovering herself she repeated her question which she thought lady horatia had evaded  but has your ladyship any recollection of circumstances in mrs willoughbys conduct or life that give you reason to believe this unhappy story may not be the fabrication of lady castlenorth  not from my own knowledge replied she for i was in italy with general howard who was then in an ill state of health at the time mr willoughbys father died and for two years afterward when i returned to england i was absorbed in domestic uneasiness and heard without attending much to them those gossipping stories which fly about for a week or a month till some newer scandal causes them to be forgotten yet i do recollect i own hearing some hints of mrs willoughbys partiality for mr everard and that they were supposed to be privately married but i accounted for it when i attended to it at all by recollecting that mrs willoughby was at the time of her husbands death a young and beautiful woman with a good fortune and an admirable understanding advantages which while they created envy and malignity in the minds of an hundred people who possessed nothing of all that among her own sex produced as many pretenders to her favor among the other every one of whom though some were men of rank and all of course eminent enough in their own eyes were dismissed by her on their first application with a polite but positive refusal these men were piqued and these women were spiteful and they together found out a reason for the unheard of refusal of a young and admired widow by supposing her attached to her sons tutor not one of them from the information of their own hearts being able to conceive it possible that she made this sacrifice to maternal tenderness and refused her hand to a second husband because she would suffer nothing to interrupt the attention she owed to the children of the first  you do not then believe said celestina eagerly  you do not then believe my dear madam that there is any truth in this odious story  pardon me answered lady horatia i did not say so  gracious heaven exclaimed celestina is it possible you can believe it  my dear young friend said she calmly i have lived so long in the world that though i do not hastily and on slight grounds believe such a report yet i should not wonder were it in the event to be verified  celestina who had always in her own heart opposed the idea of her being the daughter of mrs willoughby though she felt and submitted to the necessity of seeing willoughby no more while one doubt remained unsatisfied now changed color affected as well by the manner of lady horatia as by what she said she had not however courage to press her farther but spoke of the visit intended her by mr vavasour  i wish it were possible said she to convince him at once that i shall never listen to the proposal with which he is pleased to honor me as willoughbys friend added she and sighed i shall be always glad to see him but in any other light never    i think you wrong however replied lady horatia in wishing so hastily to dismiss him he is a man of family of fortune and as you allow not disagreeable in his person and for his morals they are not worse i suppose than those of other young men he is allowed i think to be generous good tempered and not to want sense if every idea of willoughby is at an end why not relieve yourself and him from a state of uneasy retrospection by receiving the addresses of one whom he cannot disapprove  are you in earnest lady horatia cried celestina  certainly i am replied she at least i venture very seriously to advise you not to dismiss vavasour so hastily but receive him as an acquaintance till you are sure you disapprove of him as a lover  dear madam resumed celestina were i capable of giving away my hand so lightly is mr vavasour a man who you think could make me happy  nay replied lady horatia if there is any body whom you prefer that is another point i only say that if you feel yourself perfectly disengaged i cannot think vavasour ought to be dismissed hastily perhaps half the young women in london would think a more desirable match could not offer  this conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a servant who announced the arrival of the person who was the subject of it and vavasour immediately entered the room  he condescended to pay to lady horatia more respect than he generally showed to those who were indifferent to him hers was however that sort of company in which he by no means found himself at case and his eagerness to entertain celestina alone once or twice broke through the restraint which he imposed upon himself  lady horatia who was candid and liberal saw in him only an unformed and unsteady young man whose morals and manners required nothing but time and good company to render estimable she saw the prejudice celestina seemed to entertain toward him as a mere prejudice and on his rising to depart gave him a general invitation to her house  celestina who knew the refinement of her mind and the delicacy of her taste was amazed at her seeming to approve him and when he was gone ventured to say  what does your ladyship think of mr vavasour  why really very well replied she he is very young and quite unformed but with those giddy manners and amid that unpolished conversation there is no want of understanding  celestina again sighed no answered she no want of understanding certainly for willoughby was not likely to select him for his friend had that been wanting but yet they were so unlike  so very unlike  that i have often wondered at their long and intimate friendship vavasour is so head long so impetuous so selfwilled and sometimes so boisterous while willoughby with more imagination more genius more strength of understanding is so calm so reasonable so attentive to every body    she was too much affected to proceed in the catalogue of his virtues a subject on which she had hardly ever touched before but stopped from the emotion she felt and lady horatia who saw and pitied the source of that emotion changed the conversation  vavasour flattered by the reception he had met with from the present protectress of celestina and more in love than ever in proportion as she was in his opinion infinitely handsomer now than ever was now very frequent in his visits while celestinas whole mind was occupied by the necessity she was under of writing to willoughby and the difficulty she was under how to answer with propriety such a letter as that she had received from him at length with many efforts and more tears the letter was written and approved of by lady horatia and celestina endeavored in compliance with the wishes of her friend and with more earnestness than success to dismiss from her mind some of its corrosive sensations and to enter if not with avidity at least with cheerfulness into that style of fashionable life which though she could not always enjoy she never failed to adorn  chapter viii vavasour had been with her every day since her arrival in town which was almost a week and montague thorold had never appeared while celestina at once wondered at his absence and rejoiced at it though perhaps her sensations were mingled with a slight degree of mortification for while she disdained every species of coquetry she yet felt humiliated by the sudden cessation of that attachment which he had taken such pains to convince her could not be destroyed even by despair  impatience however to hear of willoughby was still predominant in her mind and for this purpose she wished to see lady molyneux no acquaintance subsisted between her and lady horatia and therefore she determined to write and beg leave to wait on her old friend this she executed in a note to the following purport  miss de mornay being in town for a short time solicits permission to wait on lady molyneux at any time when her ladyship may be disengaged  this note was delivered to lady molyneux in company she read it and as if she had forgotten totally the claim celestina had upon her from their having been brought up together and from her mothers fondness for her she asked carelessly whether the messenger waited for an answer the servant replied that he did lady molyneux had formed an idea that celestina of whom she had not thought for many months was now wandering about the world in a dependent and inferior situation and might perhaps expect an invitation to stay with her which she had no inclination to give she therefore in a cold and careless way bade the footman tell the person who brought the message that being then engaged with company she could not write an answer but would take an opportunity of letting miss de mornay know when she should be at home she then entered again into conversation with her guests and it was not till the next day that she remembered having heard from celestina at all when seeing the note on her table as she was going to dress for the opera she gave it to her maid and bade her put her in mind to send an answer to it and fix the first morning she should be disengaged  celestina in the mean time received the verbal answer to her note with more concern than surprise she had not expected much kindness from matilda who during so many months had never once written to or enquired after her but she could not without internal anguish reflect that it was the daughter of her more than mother the friend of her orphan youth and the sister of willoughby who was thus insensible of all those feelings which swelled her heart when the scenes of that orphan youth and the pleasures of that infantine friendship were remembered  amid these painful reflections however there was one that gave her some degree of consolation she thought that lady molyneux could not either from any knowledge of her own or from the reports spread by lady castlenorth believe that any relationship by blood subsisted between them for she supposed it to be impossible for her in that case to treat with so much cold neglect a person whom she knew to be her sister on this therefore she dwelt as a circumstance favorable to the notion she most wished to entertain and as two or three days passed on without her hearing from lady molyneux her eagerness to enquire of her subsided into a strong belief that she knew nothing  vavasour assiduously attended every day at the house of lady horatia during this interval and contrived to obtain for himself some degree of interest in her favor the openness and candor of his temper was with her an apology for half his faults while his youth and natural vivacity obtained his pardon for the rest his fortune was splendid and his family ancient and respectable while his person was such as could hardly fail to please and his manners careless and wild as they were appeared to advantage in the eyes of lady horatia who had been disgusted by the coldness and apathy either real or affected of many of those young men of fashion who frequented her house  on celestina however the frequent opportunities she had of observing vavasour had a very opposite effect in her mind a standard of perfection had been early formed and every man she now saw was pleasing or otherwise as they resembled or differed from willoughby she continued therefore to treat vavasour with increasing coldness and saw with concern that lady horatia was every day more solicitous for his success  willoughby in the mean time continued to wander about europe without any fixed plan and merely flying from himself still anxious to gather information on the subject which had destroyed all the happiness of his life and having little hopes of obtaining any but by means of lady castlenorth he often conquered his reluctance and visited his uncle at a villa he now inhabited near naples where he was always received with pleasure and where save only on the point which alone interested him lady castlenorth seemed to descend from her natural character to endeavor by every means in her power to gratify and oblige him and her lord who really loved his nephew as much as his imbecility of mind allowed him to love any body and who saw in him and in his alliance with his daughter the only chance of perpetuating a family which was the great object of his pride became hourly more eager to see him and more gratified by his company  it has been observed that there are two reasons which equally operate in determining some people to marry  love and hatred and something resembling both these sentiments agitated the heart of miss fitzhayman of an involuntary preference to her cousin she had been sensible from the first moment she saw him and his indifference his preference of celestina and even his positively declining the honor of her hand had mortified without curing her of her partiality though resentment and disdain were mingled with the inclination she could not conquer and which neither his absence nor his coldness had prevented from gaining on her heart when she saw him again new force was given to this passion he was less handsome less animated but more interesting and more pleasing while his melancholy and dejection though created by another object gave him so many charms in the opinion of miss fitzhayman that her pride yielded to them and as it was now very certain that he had no attachment but to celestina whom since she fully believed their relationship she knew he never could marry she doubted not of being able to inspire him with an affection for her and in returning to england his wife of fulfilling at once her parents wishes and her own  lady castlenorth whose love of intrigue time had by no means diminished and whose arrogance had been deeply wounded by the failure of her original plan which she fancied willoughby would with so much eagerness have embraced was now doubly anxious to avail herself of the advantage she had gained by having prevented the intended union of willoughby and celestina pique and resentment operated upon her mind with even more force than attachment and regard would have on another besides in the marriage of her daughter with any man of superior rank and independent fortune she found great probability that her influence would be lessened and her government disclaimed but in uniting her daughter with willoughby whose fortune was in disorder and whose temper was remarkably easy she foresaw the continuation of her power and that she should neither see her daughter take place of her or escape from her influence  whatever was the wish of her friends the assiduous mrs calder officiously adopted and when she found how much lord castlenorth had set his heart on concluding the marriage between his daughter and her nephew she applied all her rhetoric to prove its advantages and all her art to secure it is success  willoughby was unconscious of the plans that were thus forming in the family of his uncle and did not think it possible that their pride would allow them to solicit again an alliance which he had once declined he therefore went to them without any apprehension that he was encouraging expectations he never meant to fulfill and had indeed no other design than to lay in wait for traces of that involved mystery which he still thought had been created by the intrigues and machinations of lady castlenorth  in art however she was so much his superior that the very means he adopted to obtain satisfaction was in her hands a means of bewildering more deeply she now affected the most perfect candor and whenever she saw him touching with a tender hand on the subject she appeared to feel for his uneasiness and ready to give him every satisfaction in her power  willing to avail himself of this apparent disposition in his favor he one day when he was sitting alone with lady castlenorth asked her whether she had now no traces of hannah biscoe the servant who alone seemed possessed of the circumstances into which he most wished to enquire lady castlenorth answered with great apparent ingenuousness that she did not exactly know as she had no connection at all with her but that if he wished to make any enquiry her woman should write out the directions to her relations which she did not herself recollect  willoughby eagerly seized on this offer and begged that these directions might be immediately written out for him lady castlenorth instantly called her woman and questioned her as to her recollection of the abode of the relations of this hannah biscoe the woman named what she knew her lady directed her to put it down and willoughby left the house flattering himself that he had at length obtained a clue which might lead him to escape from the labyrinth of error and mistake where he had so severely suffered  it was however by no means lady castlenorths plan to suffer willoughby to return to england in search of this woman whose direction she seemed so willing to give him and as from the eagerness and agitation he expressed on receiving this paper it appeared but too likely that he meditated going himself in order to preclude the possibility of his views being again frustrated she found that all her art would be necessary to prevent his escaping her  fortunately for her views lord castlenorth was seized a few hours afterward with one of those illnesses which had so often reduced him to the brink of the grave and the presence of his nephew which he so earnestly desired the generous and feeling heart of willoughby could not deny while he endured the cruellest restraint in staying and thought every hour an age till he could go himself to england and renew his hitherto hopeless research after the real situation of celestina  thus passed however a month after the arrival of celestina in london and then the arrival of an english gentleman at naples brought him her letter written in answer to that she received at york nothing could equal the impatience with which he had expected this letter but the pain he felt at reading it he learned by it that she was returning to london where he fancied so many objects would combine to soften her concern for their separation and he fancied the letter expressed too much calmness and that she submitted to the separation which he had himself indicated as too likely to be inevitable without feeling half that regret and anguish which he expected she would have described the reluctance she expressed to be left to the protection of vavasour made him believe his presence interfered with her preference to some other person  a preference of which the very suspicion threw him into agonies at the very moment his reason told him that he ought not to think of her for himself jealousy now added to the pangs of disappointed love and the letter which celestina had endeavored to word so as to calm and sooth him and to teach him to submit to that necessity of which he allowed the force seemed to him to breathe only indifference and to prove that she saw him without regret relinquish his claim to those affections which were already in possession of another  all his sufferings were confirmed and increased when a day or two afterward he had an opportunity of conversing with mr jarvis the gentleman who brought the letter and who was hastening to rome he had been often in company with celestina at parties where she attended lady horatia howard and believing as all the world now did that willoughby was certainly to be married to miss fitzhayman and that the marriage of celestina would be a subject of satisfaction to him he related without hesitation the reports he had heard of her being soon to give her hand to mr vavasour  to the amazement willoughby expressed at the first intimation of such a match jarvis who entirely mistook it is cause said  yes it is wonderful to be sure considering all we know of vavasour that he should seriously intend to marry  so acute was the pain which the intelligence willoughby had just received gave him that he could make no answer to this and jarvis fancying him out of spirits for some reason or other which he never thought of enquiring after soon after left him to meditate on what he had heard  there was room for meditation even to madness when he recollected a thousand circumstances that had till now appeared of no moment he was convinced that vavasour had long admired celestina he had himself resigned her or at least intimated that he dared not think of her and the person the fortune the impetuous ardour of vavasour which his agitated mind represented as irresistible now all crowded on his recollection and he doubted not but that before he could reach england celestina would have given herself away  yet with the horrid mystery unremoved on what pretense could he wish or even think of impeding a marriage with a man of whom his regard was evinced by his long friendship and who had so affluent a fortune as a lover he could himself no longer interfere as her relation he could not bear to consider himself and were he only such an alliance with vavasour could not be objected to on any reasonable grounds  the longer he reflected therefore on what he had heard the more unable he became to support his reflections and they concluded in a resolution to set out immediately for england a determination which he communicated to his uncle the same day who was affected by it even to tears  lady castlenorth had in conversation with mr jarvis heard the report of celestinas intended marriage and knew immediately how to account for the extreme uneasiness willoughby betrayed and his sudden resolution to depart for england when jarvis who proceeded immediately on his journey was gone she found an opportunity a few hours afterward to speak to willoughby on english news and the change of his countenance confirmed her conjectures this was an occasion not to be lost she ventured what she usually avoided to name celestina and to express her satisfaction that she was likely to be so well married after all the conversation there has been about this young person said she affecting to have a great deal of feeling for her i am very glad that the poor girl will be so well established a man of vavasours independent fortune can well afford to please himself and i doubt not but that you and lady molyneux must on every account rejoice at her change of name and that nothing more will be said of her origin though lady castlenorth affected to speak with sentiment and to sosten her voice her piercing and enquiring eyes were demanding from the countenance of willoughby that explanation which she knew it would give of his real sentiments and she saw the blood forsake his cheeks his lips turn white and tremble and a mingled expression of doubt fear anger and disdain marked on his features if i were certain madam said he that all the odious reports on which you who first promulgated them have invariably refused to satisfy me as you might do  if i were sure they were all true    if interrupted lady castlenorth can you then doubt their truth will you compel me to make by adducing those proofs a matter public which you ought on every account to wish might be buried in eternal oblivion  will i compel you madam yes surely i will if the means are in my power it is for this only i have been so much with you not to compel you indeed but in the hope of prevailing upon you if you really possess the evidence you have often meditated to give it me all without reserve  well cried lady castlenorth i have now given you a direction to the only person who is in possession of this evidence you might have procured it as long since as when i interfered to save you from the horrors of a marriage which must have rendered you and the object of your unhappily placed affection miserable for ever but then you flew from me and resented my friendship as if it had been an injury since that time it is not my fault if you have been unable to find this person whom i have never secreted and of whom i know little or nothing satisfied in having saved you from an abyss of guilt and misery i trusted to time and your own principles to convince you of the injustice your suspicions did me you have searched for prooss in those places where your mother is said to have been with her young charge tell me have you ever found any reason to believe the facts i told you of to be of my invention  to have been totally unfounded  willoughby was conscious he had not yet at the same moment he discovered that lady castlenorth had watched him and knew of the journies he had made to hieres and to other places vexed and angry not knowing what to think or whether he was imposed on by her superior cunning or was needlessly tormenting himself in pushing the enquiry farther he could not command the various uneasy sensations with which he was agitated and therefore abruptly leaving the room he hastened to his lodgings and gave directions for his immediate departure for england  he was concerned however for his uncle and returned in the evening to take leave of him he found him sitting with mrs calder who was reading to him a sort of catalogue raisonnee of the various ills to which the human body is subject and as they passed in melancholy review before him he stopped her to consult her on his own symptoms and to enquire of her whether she did not think such and such complaints were about to add to his bodily infirmities mrs calder who was always obliged to every body who fancied her skill enabled her to answer such questions was delighted with the opportunity this afforded her of exhibiting her knowledge to willoughby from whom she could never procure the smallest voluntary attention and the conversation became so irksome that having waited near an hour and seeing it not likely to end willoughby at length started up and approached to take his uncles hand when miss fitzhayman in all the languor of unhappy love swam into the room  on her entrance willoughby sat down again as being unwilling to have her suppose he rudely fled from her approach she put on an air of affected humility and looked as if she thanked him for even this slight mark of attention she gave a loud and deep sigh prolonged as much as possible her eyes robbed of their fire were turned mournfully upon him  you are going from us mr willoughby said she in a subdued and faint voice  he replied that business which could not longer be delayed made his return to england necessary  another deep sigh was all the ladys answer to this information but lord castlenorth cried  i am sorry to hear you say so george  very sorry i did hope that we might have all returned together as soon as my complaints subside a little as to business you ought to remember that all your money matters might be easily settled if you pleased  i thank you sir replied willoughby who saw whither the discourse would tend but those matters are the least of my concern  stay however one day said lord castlenorth that you may execute some business for me surely nephew you will oblige me so far  though every hours delay was death to him he at length agreed on his uncles repeated entreaties to stay four and twenty hours longer at naples and then leaving the room he was followed by the officious mrs calder who desiring leave to say half a dozen words to him alone he suffered her to show him into another room  she put on a most rueful countenance stroked her handkerchief plaited her ruffles and uttering an oh dear between a sigh and a groan she continued thus  my dear good sir i wish to have a little conversation relative to your situation in this dear worthy family for every member of which my poor heart bleeds  and yet madam interrupted willoughby impatiently there is perhaps hardly a family among your acquaintance who are in the opinion of the world so little objects of compassion  the world exclaimed the lady lord bless me what signifies the opinion of the world the world cannot see as i do into all their feelings there is your most excellent uncle as worthy a man as ever existed sinking poor good dear man under five complaints all incurable and denied alas the only satisfaction this world has to give him  seeing his darling daughter settled to his wishes which would smooth his path to heaven and leave him nothing but bodily pain  which is severe enough  nothing but bodily pain as i observed to contend with oh sir what heart felt satisfaction it must be to you what comfortable reflection for a good heart such as inhabits your breast no doubt  i say what delight it would be to you to hold forth the amiable hand that should  rock the cradle of reposing age and sooth the latter days of so excellent and worthy an uncle  the whine and the hypocritical grimace with which this speech was delivered would have conquered the gravity of willoughby at any other time but he now felt his disgust irritated by impatience amounting almost to rage but he repressed his feelings with difficulty unwilling by opposition to lengthen the conversation which mrs calder suffered not to languish but thus went on  ah dear what a melancholy reflection as i observed it is to consider that poor good man this is not likely to happen and instead of it this darling daughter this fine young woman heiress to such a noble fortune so beautiful so accomplished so elegant  undeniably the first match in england in point of rank and beauty and fortune  so lovely in person so amiable in mind so elevated in understanding  far alas from being happy sees her youth pass away in a hopeless passion which from her infancy she has been taught to cherish and which now her reason aided by her affronted pride tries in vain to repress oh mr willoughby mr willoughby the happiness that you refuse by how many would be courted the heart that you disdain to accept by how many would be adored dear creature when i see how thin she is grown and know the cause of it so well  when i hear her sigh and know how injurious it is to her dear delicate constitution i really sir  you will forgive my zeal  have looked upon you with amazement and have asked myself whether you have eyes  whether you have a heart    to what madam interrupted willoughby who could no longer endure her harangue patiently  to what does all this tend  tend dear sir replied mrs calder why certainly to open your eyes if possible to a sense of the happiness you are throwing away to prevail on you to answer the expectations of all your friends to consult your own interest and to become all you ought to be  you mean well i conclude madam answered willoughby by all this but you mistake greatly when you suppose that the alliance to which you allude would contribute to the happiness of any of the parties for whom you are interested i have no heart to offer miss fitzhayman and if the partiality which you represent exists any where but in your own imagination it would be ungenerous to encourage and unworthy to avail myself of it feeling as i do that i never can answer it as i am very willing to allow the young ladys merits deserve excuse me therefore if i entreat of you never to consider me as being likely to be more closely united with the family of lord castlenorth than i at present am and to declare to you that by persisting in pressing it my uncle will put it out of my power to testify for him that regard and affection which i really feel  willoughby then left the room and mrs calder piqued and mortified at the little success of her rhetoric went reluctantly to give an account to lady castlenorth by whom she had been employed of the ill success of her embassy  chapter ix willoughby notwithstanding every effort and every art made use of to detain him pursued his way to england but at paris the fatigue he had undergone and the anxiety which had so long weighed on his spirits combined to throw him into one of those fevers to which from his infancy he had been subject and for three weeks he was in the most imminent danger amid the wild ravings of the delirium that perpetually occurred during the severest paroxysms of the complaint he called incessantly on celestina and complaining that lady castlenorth had taken her from him entreated of his servant a man who had lived with him for some years to send for her that he might see her before he died this in the simplicity of his heart his faithful attendant would have done having no idea that any thing could be of more consequence than the wishes of his dear master for whose life he was so cruelly alarmed but when he asked him whither he was to send willoughby put his hand on his heart sighed deeply and replied either that he did not know or that it would be of no effect for that indifferent what became of him she had already refused to come to him and was gone to scotland with vavasour  when the violence of the disease subsided he ceased to name her and his servant afraid of renewing his recollection carefully avoided any hint of what he had dwelt upon during his delirious ravings slowly and with two relapses he recovered strength enough to proceed to calais but nine weeks had elapsed since the information he had received from vavasour and it was near three months after that time before he arrived in london  his first enquiry was after vavasour who was he found in staffordshire and his heart was relieved by the intelligence for he dreaded least he should have met him in london perhaps married to celestina his next was after his sister whom he still loved and in favor of whom he was willing to forget all the neglect he had experienced from her as well as the causes of displeasure given him by her husband  after celestina he feared to ask by a direct message to herself and he therefore sought somebody who could tell where she now was of which he concluded he should have intelligence from lady molyneux  lady molyneux attended his summons and while he embraced her with tears of fraternal fondness from a thousand tender recollections that crowded on his heart he saw her equally unmoved by their meeting and unconcerned at his illness of which he still retained melancholy proofs in his altered countenance and reduced figure he took an early opportunity of turning the discourse on celestina and saw with increased amazement that far from being interested in the enquiry which had occupied his whole thoughts so long matilda was perfectly indifferent about it or if he moved her a moment from the stillness of fashionable apathy she shrunk from the subject with something like disgust seemed afraid of the trouble of investigation and careless how it might terminate wishing rather to hear nothing about it than to hazard  not the tarnishing her mothers honor for to that she seemed insensible but the probability of being obliged to own for a sister one whom she had hitherto considered as a dependent and of seeing her brother from a point of honor undertake to provide for her as a relation avarice the heterogeneous child of selfish vanity was become a leading feature in the character of matilda she found so many uses for money in adorning and in indulging herself that she loved nothing so well except the adulation it procured for her and so much power has this odious passion to pervert the heart that instead of feeling concern in contemplating the sunken features and palid cheek of her brother she could not nor indeed did she attempt to check a half formed idea of the pecuniary advantage she should receive from his death  while such were her thoughts willoughby asked her when she had last seen celestina  oh replied she i have seen her only once in a room and that was by accident i was never at home when she called and i hate that old lady horatia howard that she lives with and so took no great pains to meet them when i returned her visit i have seen her though in public five or six times lately but the girl seemed to me so very much altered and to give herself such intolerable airs that i rather shunned than sought her  airs cried willoughby she must indeed be greatly changed if she deserves such censure but tell me matilda  what kind of airs  oh the airs of a beauty answered she which you first taught her to assume and which she has made a tolerable progress in since this old cat of fashion has taken it into her head to make such a fuss about her and since she has been surrounded with such a set of senseless boys there is your friend vavasour constantly one of her suit and there was a notion of his being fool enough to marry her but i fancy that was given out merely by her exorbitant vanity for i dare say vavasour knows better  the heart of willoughby sunk within him but he was unable to express what he felt and lady molyneux went on  however i have heard since i think that the girl has been addressed by another young fellow  one of the thorolds i think  whom i have lately seen with her which would be more suitable and more likely to be a match  you have seen her then often said willoughby in a faint and faultering voice  yes in public replied his sister but i have had no conversation with her lady molyneux then changed the conversation and soon afterward left her brother more unhappy than she had found him  he was by no means able to see celestina in his present state of wretched uncertainty yet to know that by traversing two or three streets he could once more behold her once more gaze on that lovely countenance and hear that voice so soothing so enchanting to his ears was to him a state of tantalizing misery from which he knew nothing could relieve him but detecting the falsehood of lady castlenorths report and this he could only hope to do by another journey into yorkshire in order to find that hannah biscoe to whom he now thought he had certainly obtained a direction and this he proposed doing immediately  celestina however surrounded by crowds of admirers celestina forgetting all the tenderness she once felt for him and rendering all his researches fruitless even if they proved to him that he might again plead for the renewal of that affection was an idea that unceasingly tormented him and so painfully did the intelligence affect him which lady molyneux had given that the ferment of his spirits produced a return of his fever in a slighter degree but still so as to confine him to his room where in a few days he received a visit from vavasour  vavasour was totally unconscious of the species of distress which willoughby suffered and since he himself had resigned her and agreed to complete his engagements with the family of castlenorth for so his conduct had been generally understood in england had no notion that the addresses of another and particularly of his friend could be otherwise than pleasing to him he began therefore without remarking the concern and coldness of willoughby imputing it only to his visibly deranged health to relate to him his own views in regard to celestina and to complain of her preference of montague thorold the devil take me said he if there is in england or in europe another woman for whom i would take a fifth part of the trouble which this bewitching girl has already given me curse me if i am not ashamed of myself when i think what a whining puppy she has made of me ten times i have left her and ten times have returned to prove to her that she might use me like a dog  miss de mornay said willoughby in a voice affected by the various sensations he felt  miss de mornay must be greatly changed sir if she is become capable of any improper levity toward any gentleman who professes regard for her at the same time you will recollect mr vavasour that she is mistress of herself and at liberty to reject those whose offers may not be acceptable to her from the experiments which you have been pleased to make though from our long friendship i should rather have expected you to have applied to me before you made them  from the experiments you have been pleased to make it seems clear that miss de mornay has no favorable intentions toward you and i would advise you by all means to decline the pursuit  may i perish if i do replied vavasour with all his usual impetuosity no george unless it can be made to appear that young thorold  that little curatizing fellow  without a shilling and with nothing but his impudence and scraps of plays to recommend him has better pretensions than i have curse me if i will give it up  this second intimation of celestinas encouraging the addresses of montague thorold was a second dagger in the sick heart of willoughby he dreaded an explanation which while it might serve perhaps to subdue all his fears as to vavasour might create others equally insupportable he could not however remain many minutes in the breathless agitation of such suspense and therefore said  i really dont know any thing about thorold i hardly recollect that there was such a man  what exclaimed vavasour not know him not know that she went immediately from alvestone to the house of that old priest his father  yes answered willoughby that i certainly knew for it was by my request that the elder mr thorold became her guardian  well nothing was so natural i suppose as for his reverence to delegate the trust to his son and as his deputy i suppose it was that he went with his ward to scotland and was her guardian all the time she was among the highlands and the islands  impossible cried willoughby he did not  could not have been there  he was by heaven exclaimed vavasour and when i met celestina with your letter at york i found that young fellow attending on her and mrs elphinstone but i was authorized by yourself to wait on her and i obliged him there to resign a post which when i think of his having so long filled and apparently with her approbation by all that is diabolical i could tear his puritanical soul out  nothing that willoughby had ever felt was equal to the anguish which pressed on his heart at this moment the coldness he fancied he had found in celestinas last letter was now accounted for and all the warmth of grateful praise with which in her former letters she had spoken of mr thorold was imputed to her growing affection for his son lost as she might be and probably was to him for ever before this intelligence unless he could content himself with that share of sisterly affection which was all she ought to bestow there was something so terrible to his imagination in her feeling a warm attachment to another that he could not think of it without horror nor conceal from vavasour the effect it had upon him his mildness of manners forsook him and speaking less like himself than like vavasour whose vehemence he seemed to adopt he cried in a voice that trembled with passion  how dared he pretend to celestina  he not only dared then interrupted vavasour but dares still and has contrived to get lady horatia howard to be of his party he has fascinated the old woman with his piety and his poetry and i see very plainly that the young one will throw herself away upon him unless you prevent it  may i perish cried he if i do not yet at that moment the recollection too forcibly occurred to him that he had no right to prevent it unless by urging a claim as her relation from which his soul recoiled so painfully acute were his present sensations that he was unable to breathe and without attending longer to the exhortations of vavasours who eagerly pressed him to interfere immediately he abruptly left the room and sent by his servant a message to vavasour saying he found himself so ill that he was gone to bed but should be glad he would call again for an hour in the evening  instead however of attempting to procure that repose which his increased fever required he went to the trunk where celestinas letters were deposited and with trembling hands taking them out he ran them over even from the first she wrote to him after their separation to the last which mr jarvis had delivered to him at naples  his apprehensive jealousy so powerfully awakened now taught him to fancy that from the moment of celestinas acquaintance with montague thorold her letters had become gradually cooller and that the last too plainly evinced her cheerful acquiescence to that reluctant and only conditional resignation which be had with so much anguish of heart been compelled to send her while he explained the cruel circumstances that had torn him from her and from happiness  the longer he dwelt on her letters the more this idea was strengthened and the more insupportable it became his illness originally occasioned by anxiety returned upon him and though without delirium his fever was nearly as high as when he was in so much danger at paris  he now determined to send to lady horatia howard and he attempted to write to her but he could hardly command his pen and found himself wholly unequal to the more difficult task of composing such a letter as could alone be proper he threw away the paper in despair and calling his servant ordered him to find out immediately some means of becoming acquainted with the servants of lady horatia howard and procure intelligence of what visitors were most at the house particularly if a mr thorold of devonshire was there often  the man hastened to enter on a task by no means difficult to him he contrived the same afternoon to introduce himself to one of the footmen of lady horatia at the porter house he frequented and learned that his mistress and her young friend of whom he spoke as of an angel were gone for a fortnight or three weeks on a visit into oxfordshire that mr vavasour used to be a good deal at the house when first lady horatia came to town that now he was much less frequently there but that mr thorold was there almost every day and read to the ladies whole evenings who since these reading parties at home went much less into public than they had done before  this intelligence distracted willoughby by redoubling every apprehension he had felt the man however was sent back for further information and bade to ask if mr thorold was of their party in their present journey and if there was any talk among the servants of an intended marriage between him and miss de mornay  in answer to these queries he had the mortification of hearing that montague thorold was to meet the ladies at oxford and that it was in the family generally understood that he was the accepted lover of celestina and highly approved by lady horatia  it was now that the corrosive jealousy that had long tormented him had a decided object and fixed with the most envenomed power on the heart of willoughby the impossibility of his interfering to prevent celestina giving herself to another while he himself remained in such a situation as the present and dared not even see her the little probability he saw of removing the doubts that distracted him and the apprehensions least if they were for ever effectually withdrawn celestina would rejoice that they were so the cruel idea of montague thorolds possessing that heart which he once knew to be all his own and the preference of that elegant mind of which he had with so much delight contemplated the improvement were thoughts that incessantly pursued and tormented him and he had no means of obtaining any information of the conduct of celestina or of her return to town but by his servant who was now employed whole days to gather from the domestics of lady horatia intelligence which when obtained served only to increase his misery  the anecdotes he gathered from his sister served too but to aggravate his distress yet when he saw her as he generally did once every day from whatever point the conversation sat out it always ended in questions about celestina and lady molyneux who had insensibly familiarised her mind to the idea of her brothers dying a bachelor in consequence of his early disappointment now saw with concern that his attachment to celestina though it prevented his marrying any other was yet so rooted in his heart that should he find as she believed he would the imagined relationship a mere fiction he would most undoubtedly return to her with more ardour than before they were parted and notwithstanding the embarrassed state of his affairs which every day became more serious would marry her and disappoint every view of fortune  increase of fortune  which her avaricious ambition foresaw might otherwise accrue to her  actuated therefore by very different motives she cooperated with lady castlenorth in endeavoring to divide him from celestina and while one was strengthening the barrier raised between them the other was trying to convince willoughby that he ought not to wish for it is removal  the means of doing this were she thought to keep him at a distance from celestina and to pique his pride by representing her as attached to another the first point was for the present secured by his illness and she took care so artfully to insinuate the second that aided as she was by the report of vavasour and by the continual repetitions of what he had seen on the journey from scotland that every hour the fatal impression sunk deeper into his heart and his reason or his reliance on celestinas affection had not sufficient power to resist it  thus passed five or six days after his arrival in london he endeavored to shake off his illness for by a journey into yorkshire which he could not till it was conquered undertake he could alone hope to obtain any satisfaction as to the original cause of their separation yet even from thence he now no longer dared to look forward to happiness which even while he was employed in attempting to regain it seemed escaping from him for ever  but that he might undertake something to relieve himself from the wretched state he was now in he put himself into the care of a physician and set about getting out of an illness he had hitherto neglected or rather indulged though very languid and with a great deal of fever still about him he went to lady molyneuxs and in a day or two afterward as he found himself better from change of scene and of place he accompanied her on some of her visits and called in at a card party where she told him she must show herself for a quarter of an hour the rooms were full and lady molyneux being notwithstanding her declaration that she should stay so short a time set down to a card table willoughby sauntered into one of the apartments where the younger part of the company were seated at a commerce table where the first person that met his eyes was celestina elegantly dressed and more beautiful than ever with myriads of charms playing round her face and cheerfulness and pleasure dancing in her eyes while on one side sat a young man whom willoughby immediately recollected to be montague thorold and on the other another gentleman who though he seemed to be more a stranger to her was evidently charmed with her and unable to keep his eyes from her face  fixed to the place where he stood unheeded among some other idle people who were looking on he remained gazing at her for several minutes his legs trembled so that it was with difficulty he supported himself and his heart beat as if it would break he debated with himself whether he should speak to her or retire unobserved but while he yet argued the point a smile and a whisper that passed between her and montague thorold determined him to fly from the torments he felt and which he found it almost impossible to endure another moment he stepped hastily away to find his sister and entreat her to go but so deeply was he affected that weakened as he was by illness he staggered and might have fallen had not the shame of betraying so much weakness lent him resolution to reach a chair where he sat a moment to recover breath and recollection  mortified tenderness and disappointed love gave him for an instant a sensation resembling hatred he fancied he could quit celestina never again to feel any interest in her fate but leaving her to the man she preferred strengthen himself against his fatal and till now invincible attachment by contemplating the fatal barrier which he had so long been trying to destroy and to believe that artifice rather than nature had placed between them of this cause of their separation no part had in fact been removed and he reproached himself for the absurdity folly and even vice of his present conduct having argued himself into what he thought a resolution to feel no longer for celestina he hurried to lady molyneux and told her that if her game was not nearly at an end he must leave her and go home in a chair as he found himself unable to bear the heat of the room  his sister answered that she was only settling her winnings and would attend him in a moment if he would wait for her he agreed to do so and going to the door that led out of that into the next room he leaned against the side of it turning his eyes as much as possible from the apartment where celestina was  lost in the painful sensations inflicted by distracting jealousy and bitter regret which he yet struggled to stisle he distinguished not the objects all to him uninteresting that moved before him a crowd of young people however who had just risen from their table were pressing into another room where refreshments were distributed he moved a little to make way for them when he saw close to him and even borne against him by her companions celestina herself her face was at first turned from him for she was speaking to montague thorold who was on the other side but finding herself crouding against somebody she turned to apologize for the rudeness she was guilty of when the well known figure the well known face of willoughby emaciated and pale as they were instantly struck her an involuntary and faint shriek testified the impression they made and willoughby who caught the weak sound of her distressful voice was at first by an irresistible impulse hurried to her assistance but seeing the arm of montague thorold supporting her and his countenance expressing all the interest he took in her emotion heimputed that emotion to her consciousness of her attachment to her new favorite and darting at her a look of impatient reproach he forced himself through the crowd and without looking back sat down breathless and trembling by lady molyneux who was that moment coming forward to meet him  the agitation of poor celestina could not be concealed nor could she for a moment or two escape from the enquiring eyes of those who remarked it as soon however as she could disengage herself from the throng she sat down hardly daring to enquire whether what she had seen was real or visionary she had returned from oxfordshire with lady horatia only the evening before and knew nothing of willoughbys being in england while in addition to the amazement the sight of him occasioned his apparent ill health impressed her with concern and the displeasure with which he surveyed her with terror  montague thorold who had seen willoughby and whose eyes were never a moment away from celestina knew at once the cause of her distress he followed her little less affected than she was herself to a sopha where she had thrown herself and asked her in a faint and tremulous voice if he should fetch her any thing she answered if you please so low that he scarce distinguished what she said but stepping a few paces from her he took a glass of lemonade from a servant and brought it to her she took it and carried it to her lips almost unconscious of what she did while montague thorold leaned over the arm of the sopha on which she sat and watched the emotions of her countenance with all the solicitude he felt strongly painted on his own  at the same moment willoughby appeared leading lady molyneux through the room the first objects that he saw as he approached the door were celestina and montague thorold but having once seen them he turned hastily from them and seeming to give all his attention to his sister he disappeared  celestinas eyes followed him with a look of inexpressible amazement and concern she seemed to be in a fearful dream and when she no longer saw him her eyes were fixed on the door through which he had gone out she heeded no longer what montague thorold said to her but sat with a palpitating heart and oppressed breath till lady horatia after twice speaking to her roused her from her half formed and confused reflections by reminding her it was time to go  she followed in silence where lady horatia led and at the coach door wished montague thorold good night for the only distinct sensation she felt was a wish for his absence but lady horatia who was immediately going home desired him to return and sup with her which without knowing what he did he consented to though too conscious while he did it that celestina had rather be without him for as he handed her into the coach he felt her tremble so that she could hardly support herself and he heard the deep sigh burst from her heart as if it would break  lady horatia had not seen willoughby and had no idea of celestinas sufferings she talked therefore in her usual way of the people they had seen and of some books that had been recommended to her till observing that celestina who usually bore her part in the conversation did not answer she enquired if she was not well  pretty well i thank your ladyship replied celestina but i am uncommonly fatigued tonight and have the head ach this answer satisfied lady horatia who continued to address herself to montague thorold till they arrived in parkstreet where celestina would immediately have gone to her own room so unfit was she for conversation and so unable to sustain it but lady horatia ordering her woman to bring a remedy for the head ach of which celestina had complained and that had before been of service to her she rather than alarm her kind benefactress sat down near the supper table to wait for it  but so great an effect had the violent though short perturbation of her spirits had on her countenance that lady horatia immediately perceived it the head ach cried she in surprise and taking celestinas hand my dear you have surely something worse the matter with you than a common head ach  pray dearest madam replied celestina pardon me if i am utterly unable to say what is the matter tomorrow i shall be better and i know you will forgive me till then  the manner in which she uttered these few words as trembling and faint she advanced toward the door alarmed and surprised lady horatia she saw however by the countenance of montague thorold that he could explain the cause of celestinas uneasiness she therefore suffered her to depart and immediately made the enquiry of him  he instantly informed her of what he had seen and with no favorable description of the looks and manner of willoughby which had indeed appeared to him to be extremely cruel and insulting toward celestina lady horatia with whom willoughby was no favorite and who extremely disliked his sister lady molyneux saw his conduct in the same point of view as thorold represented it and after some conversation on the subject said that though she was much concerned for the shock celestina had received yet that upon the whole it might perhaps be better for her that this circumstance had happened for now said she i think she will possessing as she does so much proper pride be convinced that even if the story coming from lady castlenorth has no foundation as i myself suppose it has that still she ought not to indulge her early prejudice in favor of a man who whatever he may have pretended or she may have believed never intended to act honorably by her and now not only deserts but insults her  thorold heartily assented to this opinion and sat down to supper with a heart somewhat relieved from the extreme uneasiness which the emotion of celestina on the appearance of willoughby had given him still however he could not eat he could not converse but as soon as he could disengage himself he took leave of lady horatia and full of anxiety and trembling least all the hopes he had of late so fondly cherished should be blasted he returned to his lodgings  chapter x celestina in retiring to her own room had hoped to recall her scattered and oppressed spirits and clearly recollect all that had befallen her but the angry the disdainful look which that countenance wore where she had been accustomed to see only the smiles of approbation or the tenderly anxious looks of love was the image still most prevalent in her mind joined to the painful idea of the ruined constitution of him whose life was ever dearer to her than her own  the cruelty of his being in london of his going into public without ever having seen or wrote to her sunk deeply into her heart ah willoughby exclaimed she is it thus we meet again after such a parting is this the end of all your assurances that you would ever be my friend that you would learn to consider me as your sister if we were indeed related alas is it thus then you throw me off entirely and seem sorry to remember that you ever saw me a flood of tears followed this cruel reflection but after weeping some time her pride came to her relief she remembered the haughty neglect with which lady molyneux had treated her and doubted not but that her influence with willoughby had prevailed on him to expel her for ever from that place in his regard which the very reasons on which he resigned her as his wife ought to give her as a defenseless and unhappy orphan dependent on his family she recollected now but too well the reserve and disdain the look of mingled anger and scorn which willoughbys features spoke as she saw him the second time leading out his sister and her mind dwelt on the expression of his eyes as they first met here is when though he must have seen how much she was surprised and affected by the sight of him he flew from her without one consoling word though it was evident she could hardly support herself  all is over then cried she that tender friendship which would have been the consolation of my life is at an end every tie that from our infancy united us is broken and i have now no reliance but on the kindness of those who are comparatively strangers ah is it generous thus to discard me without even trying to soften the blow but go cruel capricious man go and enjoy with your opulent heiress all that affluence can give go and become callous and insensible to all those noble sentiments that once animated your bosom which once rendered you so deservedly dear to me they are gone willoughby selfish cruel unfeeling and insolent is not the willoughby to whom my heartwas devoted why therefore should i be thus wretched about him why let his proud malignant sister triumph in knowing that i am mortified and unhappy let me try to drive his too painful remembrance from me or at least to remember him only as the son of my beloved benefactress  at the mention of that revered name however all her newly acquired resolution forsook her the memory of her tender her first friend was so intimately connected with that of willoughby himself that her tears flowed for both and against the unkindness of the latter neither her pride nor her reason could sustain her  a sleepless night succeeded to this conflicting evening and it was not till toward morning that celestina determined to write to willoughby entreating him still to allow her that place in his friendship which no fault of here is had she thought forfeited and assuring him that whatever might be her destiny her regard for him was unchangeable though she would never intrude upon him with it her tenderness conquered her resentment and the idea of what she owed to the son of her early friend whatever might be his conduct toward her came in aid of that long rooted tenderness and produced the resolution which she meant to execute in the morning having thus determined her mind gradually became more tranquil and her spirits being quite exhausted she sunk into slumber  but the fainter though still painful ideas of the evening before pursued her and after tormenting her with numberless wild terrors she fancied that she saw willoughby with the same menacing look he wore the preceding night with a dagger in his hand approaching and threatening her to plunge it into a heart which was he said perfidious and ungrateful and had been the means of driving him to guilt and despair  from an image of such horror she wildly started and awaking found lady horatia howard sitting by her bed side holding one of her hands and gazing on her with great concern  with the most soothing voice she spoke to celestina and endeavored to quiet the excessive agitation of her spirits her reasonable and gentle arguments had their desired effect and celestina ashamed of appearing insensible to the solicitude of such a friend summoned all her resolution to her aid and was able in about an hour to attend the breakfast table with something like composure her cheeks however had still that crimson glow which the perturbed state of her mind had given them her eyes were heavy with tears which in despite of all her efforts continued to fill them when the image of willoughby pale and thin with anger flashing from his eyes and contempt trembling on his lips again arose in her imagination lady horatia looked at her with more than her usual tender complacency for it was when her fine open countenance expressed pensive sorrow that she was from her then particularly resembling the regretted brother of lady horatia to her more than usually interesting  before the breakfast table was removed montague thorold was introduced he was extremely dejected and hardly able to return the compliments of lady horatia who was always glad to see him and who had undoubtedly given him all her interest with celestina and more encouragement to pursue his suit than was perhaps strictly prudent since celestina though she could not avoid him though she never could prevail upon herself to behave to him with unkindness and though his talents and conversation and perhaps that sort of respectful idolatry by which few women can help being gratified however they may wish to repress it were in some degree pleasing to her had yet repeatedly declared to lady horatia and to montague thorold himself that she felt not and was persuaded she never should feel for him that tender preference without which she never would marry this declaration they both imputed to that affection for willoughby which the uncertainty of her own situation continued to nourish persuaded as they both were that willoughby had promised to become the husband of miss fitz hayman which every body but celestina had long believed lady horatia doubted not but that the merit and attachment of montague thorold the similarity of their taste celestinas regard for his father and the easy competence which with him she could possess and which she often declared was the condition of life she would prefer would altogether induce her to reward his ardent affection with her hand as soon as it became certain that willoughby either from interested motives or from conviction of their too near relationship absolutely and for ever relinquished all pretensions to it she was therefore glad that the accidental meeting which had so much affected celestina was likely to hasten this period and far from seeing it in the unfavourable light thorold himself did she told him as soon as celestina left the room that for him no circumstance could be more favorable  lady horatia had long since transferred entirely to montague thorold those good wishes which she had at first expressed toward vavasour his great fortune his handsome figure and his apparent affection for celestina had for some time interested her for him and she imputed his extravagant vivacity and even his violent irregularities to his youth and unchecked habits of gratification before her vavasour had at first so far restrained the intemperate sallies of his ungovernable temper that she was for some time disposed to think well of his heart and his understanding but soon finding that this semblance of moderation availed him not and that he gained nothing on the inflexible heart of celestina he became tired of it and relapsed into such a wild way of talking and of boasting of actions still wilder that lady horatia was no longer able to excuse him and though she still received him at her house with civility she entirely approved of the resolution celestina had made never to listen to him as a lover  it was just at that period that montague thorold who on celestinas first arrival in town had not availed himself of the permission he had obtained to see her came to solicit of lady horatia that indulgence and accounted for his absence by relating a long illness his father had just escaped in which as mrs thorold was absent with one of her daughters he had himself been his only and constant attendant you know said he to celestina how much i love my father and how well he deserves that i should love him and you will easily imagine what must have been my anxiety when for so many nights and days i saw him experience the most excruciating tortures and knew his life to be in the most imminent danger even the reigning the triumphant passion of my heart  my love my adoration of celestina was suspended in the pain and solicitude i suffered for my father  his looks which were greatly changed since celestina saw him before witnessed how severe this pain and solicitude had been and celestina not only forgave but esteemed him the more for that neglect which had at first given her a slight degree of mortification from that time he had constantly visited at the house of lady horatia and from his power of amusing her by reading and conversation he was become so great a favorite that he had no rival in her good opinion but celestina herself it was at her request he had met them at oxford and gone with them to bath and bristol celestina who saw but too plainly that all this was but feeding a passion already fatal to the repose of a young man whom she highly esteemed had in vain remonstrated with lady horatia on the subject who answered that her presence was a sufficient protection and that as to his love he would not indulge it the less for being refused the opportunity of speaking of it to this doctrine celestina could not assent but in her situation to diffent was of little effect and all she could do to counteract the effects of this indiscreet indulgence of lady horatia toward montague thorold was to declare to him very solemnly whenever he introduced the subject of his love which was whenever they were alone that though her esteem and regard for him were very great she never could think of him otherwise than as her friend and when he answered that content with that esteem and regard he should be the happiest of mankind to be permitted by time and tenderness to win her love she very frankly assured him that the sentiments which were once here is for willoughby though toward him they might be at an end could never she was well assured be transferred to another  montague thorold however young sanguine and violently in love was not easily discouraged while the favor of lady horatia the wishes of his father and the complacency and kindness with which notwithstanding her repeated declarations celestina treated him all contributed to cherish a passion which insensibly absorbed his whole soul every action every sentiment every look of celestina at once increased and justified this excessive passion and he lived now only to think of her when he was absent or gaze on her with adoration when she was present whenever he knew she was to be at any public place information which he was very assiduous and very successful in obtaining thither he went also and though unless he was invited he never introduced himself into the parties she was with he contrived so to place himself as to be able to see her and was content  the extreme dejection with which he had on the last morning entered the house of lady horatia all fled before her assurances that the meeting between willoughby and celestina however she might for a little time be affected by it would prove of advantage to him elated more than ever by hope he left lady horatia having obtained leave to meet them at the opera whither they were going that evening  but with poor celestina it was very different hope had now wholly forsaken her yet still she clung even to despair when it gave her an excuse for dwelling on the beloved and regretted name of willoughby  she took out of her dressing box a locket in which his hair was interwoven with that of his mother and of his sister and which she had been used when a child to wear round her neck she looked at it a moment and remembered a thousand circumstances that brought the tears again into her eyes she kissed it she put it to her heart and that soft heart melting at the tender images this slight memorial presented to it the resentment which her pride had made her feel the evening before was forgotten while unable to bear the thoughts of having seen the last of willoughby of his having taken an accidental but eternal leave of her with anger and scorn she determined instantly to execute her purpose formed the evening before and with a trembling and uncertain hand wrote as follows  do not think dear willoughby that the unfortunate celestina means to intrade upon you with her complaints or to trouble you after the present moment with even her name but when those recollections which she cannot all at once subdue press upon her heart she finds it impossible quite impossible to submit to take of you an eternal farewell without entreating that though we never meet again we may part in peace with each other  i might indeed urge to you willoughby that if the account you gave me of our supposed relationship be realized it ought not to excite your anger but to give me a claim to your protection if my heart did not i know not why revolt from the idea of being so nearly your relation i might on that score claim your protection and your pity i might be permitted surely to love you as my brother since alas whether you permit it or no i must still love you  but with an affection so disinterested and pure that be my situation in regard to you what it may i feel nothing for which i ought to blush  you look very ill willoughby you look unhappy and on me you looked unkindly i do not ask to see you since my accidentally meeting you was evidently painful to you but i ask to have a few lines from you to tell me that you are not ill that you are not unhappy and that your once loved celestina is not become hateful to you believe me i shall rejoice in your happiness wherever found do not then refuse to assist me in obtaining  not happiness for that is no where to be found for me  but in obtaining that degree of content and resignation which may enable me to go through life without regretting the hour that i ever received it this willoughby is in your power and you must be greatly changed indeed if you refuse when you can so easily grant the last request that ever will be preferred to you by the unhappy but ever grateful and affectionate  celestina de mornay parkstreet grosvenorsquare march         though by no means satisfied with her letter when she had finished it she despaired of pleasing herself better she therefore sealed and sent it away by one of the footmen to the house of lady molyneux as she knew no other address to willoughby the servant returned in about half an hour and told her that mr willoughby was not there but that he had sent in the letter and received a message that it should be taken care of and delivered to him  she had flattered herself that if not a kind at least an immediate answer would put an end to that almost insupportable state of anxiety which she had been in ever since she saw him if he wrote to her with kindness it would she thought soothe and console her if he treated her by letter with as much coldness and disdain as he did during their short interview she hoped that resentment would support her and that though her pride might be wounded her affection would torment her less  she was now however to wait  perhaps a whole day in anxiety and what was more dreadful be compelled to sustain this anxiety under the appearance of calmness if not of cheerfulness for lady horatia who had made an engagement with some of her friends to go to the opera whither she seldom went herself on purpose to gratify celestina by hearing a new and celebrated performer did not seem at all disposed to relish the proposal she had ventured to hint at breakfast of being left out of the party of the evening and though she was generally very desirous that celestina should in all such matters follow her own inclinations yet there were times when she seemed to expect some sacrifices to be made to her  her grateful heart was extremely sensible of all the kindness of lady horatia who from having taken her into her protection quite a stranger was now so attached to her that her happiness seemed her first object having no very strong affection for her only surviving brother who was a man immersed in politics and without pretense to natural affection and having been torn early in life from a man she loved and married by her father to one toward whom she was indifferent having since followed her three children who alone had reconciled her to her lot to their early graves her heart had become insensible to what are commonly called friendships and she had for some years rather sought to amuse than to connect herself but the graces of celestinas mind the sweetness of her disposition and the goodness of her heart had so won upon her that the apathy of wearied sensibility which she had so long been in gradually gave place to an affection almost as tender as she could have felt had she been her mother and this affection created by merit was strengthened by the resemblance which continually struck her between celestina and her younger brother who lost his life in america the loss which among all her misfortunes she most severely lamented  her increasing tenderness for celestina made her often reflect with uneasiness on her situation and very earnestly wish to see her married she was very sensible that her own life was not a good one for early calamity had shaken her constitution and brought on in the early autumn of her days the infirmities of old age and she knew that after having taken her as her daughter and accustomed her to share all the indulgencies which her own rank and income procured it would be a very painful reverse of fortune were she to leave her in the narrow circumstances in which she found her to save much out of her jointure had never been her wish and was hardly now in her power her own fortune in default of children returned to her brother and all she had to dispose of was about two thousand pounds this she gave by a will made in the fourth month of their being together to celestina and with this and what she before had she thought that celestina might if married to montague thorold enjoy through life that easy competence which was the utmost of her ambition the embarrassed circumstances of willoughby which the good natured world had always exaggerated and which lady horatia had considered as irretrievable his very expensive place at alvestone which she knew it required a large fortune to keep up the doubtful birth of celestina whom she always fancied too nearly related to him and some prejudice against him merely because he was the brother of lady molyneux whom she so very much disliked all combined to raise in the mind of lady horatia a desire to impede every step toward the reunion of celestina and willoughby and to promote her alliance with montague thorold near whose residence wherever it was she proposed to take a house in summer and to have them frequently with her in winter at her house in town  though she had not disclosed all her intentions celestina yet knew enough to be deeply sensible of the uncommon generosity of her friend and the whole study of her life was to show that she was so she made it a rule never to oppose the wishes of lady horatia whenever they were clearly expressed and therefore it was that she had often contrary to her own judgment and to her own inclinations suffered the assiduities of montague thorold and seemed to the world to give him that encouragement the ill effects of which she endeavored to counteract by ingenuously declaring to him the impossibility of her ever making the return he expected to his affection  too certain that lady horatia would be disappointed if not displeased if she declined on this evening to go out and not having courage to tell her the step she had taken in regard to writing to willoughby she was compelled to struggle with her uneasiness and to attempt concealing if she could not conquer it but every rap at the door which seemed to be that of a servant made her tremble and while sitting at work before dinner she could not help going to the window several times nor listening to every sound that she heard in the hall time wore away and her impatience increased and at length grew so evident that lady horatia remarked it what is the matter my dear enquired she do you expect any one  celestina conscious that she was betraying herself and fearing least she should be blamed for what she had done of which she began already to repent as too humiliating blushed at this question so deeply that had not lady horatia been intent at that moment on her work her suspicions must have been heightened celestina however not immediately answering she repeated her question  do you expect any body twenty reasons might have been given for her seeming anxiety and twenty people might have been named as likely to call but not one of all these occurred to celestina who was little practiced in dissimulation she therefore answered faintly no and in hopes of turning lady horatias attention from her and of hiding what she felt she proposed finishing the perusal of a poem which montague thorold had began to read the preceding morning  do so said lady horatia  celestina took up the book and began but had no idea of what she was about and of course read so extremely ill and so unlike her usual manner that lady horatia looking at her very earnestly said surely celestina  surely something is the matter  no indeed madam replied she nothing except perhaps some slight remains of nervous agitation from the circumstances of last night  try my dear to conquer that replied lady horatia and think of regaining the composure you possessed before which such a circumstance fairly considered ought not to destroy  celestina sighed and to avoid the necessity of giving an answer went on with the book before her she had hardly however read ten lines when a servant brought in a letter and gave it her she turned paler than death as she took it and the book fell from her hands  lady horaria whose attention was now fixed upon her eagerly asked from whom was the letter celestina had by this time read it for it was only a note from a young friend for whose painting she had promised to give some pattern she put it down it is only from miss clayton madam said she about the patterns i am drawing for her  dear child cried lady horatia and is all this trembling and anxiety this faultering and solicitude about miss claytons patterns celestina i am afraid you are not ingenuous with me surely i deserve that you should be so  celestina felt that this accusation of want of confidence and the claim made to it were equally just the measure she had adopted at the risque of displeasing her best friend had produced nothing but some hours of anguish and would end probably in the conviction that willoughby despised and contemned her for it was now five oclock and it was very improbable that he should not in all the hours that had intervened since she wrote have been at his lodgings or have had time to acknowledge the receipt of her letter this mortifying reflection and the consciousness that she ought to have consulted lady horatia quite overwhelmed her she was pale and silent a moment and then recovering her voice with difficulty said  i believe i have acted so foolishly so improperly that i hardly dare hope you will forgive me  lady horatia expressing her uneasiness and surprise celestina in a tremulous voice told her what she had done pity rather than anger was created by the recital certainly my dear child said lady horatia had you consulted me i should have advised you against writing to mr willoughby situated as you both are no advances should have come from you if he is convinced that you are so related to him as to make every thought of you beyond such as that relationship authorizes guilty and odious he should surely on his coming to england have sent to you if he was unwilling to see you and have behaved with humanity and brotherly tenderness though love were for ever out of the question if he is not convinced of it how will you account for his conduct but by supposing that influenced by pecuniary motives or by caprice he is desirous of forgetting all his former affection for you and yet has not that generous openness of character which would urge him to quit you handsomely  to the truth of these remarks celestina had nothing to object but their justice cruelly depressed her and her sick heart recoiled from the idea of being obliged to appear in public again she ventured very gently to insinuate a wish to be left at home that evening if you are really ill you shall said lady horatia but otherwise i hope you will go  i am not really ill replied celestina if your ladyship means only bodily suffering but my spirits my mind    for the maladies of those interrupted lady horatia there is no remedy more sure than change of scene and variety of amusement and believe me dear celestina  believe me and i have suffered much from the maladies of the mind they only grow by indulgence if we would conquer we must contend with and not encourage them  you will suffer much less tonight if you are in a circle of friends who love and admire you than in brooding at home over the defection of one who if he ever did certainly does not now deserve you  i beg therefore that you will go  celestina unaccustomed to dispute any wish of her friend yielded with as good a grace as she could to her remonstrances and with a heavy and aching heart went to finish her dress  the hour of going out arrived and celestina found montague thorold and a mr howard a relation of lady horatias ready to attend them  as there was no escape she endeavored to assume the semblance of tranquillity and to talk with them on indifferent matters but the idea that willoughby had left london without seeing her or being still in it disdained to answer her letter and utterly refused to notice her hung so heavy on her heart that she could with difficulty support herself while the protracted state in which she had been since the preceding evening occasioned such a ferment in her blood that her cheeks were of a feverish crimson and the languid luster of her fine eyes never appeared to greater advantage  deep sighs which she tried in vain to suppress stole from her heart and mr howard rallied her upon them with that sort of commonplace wit which is so usual and so irksome where there is real uneasiness to contend with while montague thorold answered every sigh of hers by one yet deeper of his own and watched every turn of her countenance with trembling solicitude  lady horatia was to join another party at the opera and celestina was in hopes that by obtaining a seat in one of the last rows in the box she should be excused from the task of seeming to give any attention either to the performance or the people around her  this therefore she contrived to do and montague thorold placed herself by her  her thoughts were engrossed wholly by willoughby  and by the cruelty of his refusing to answer her letter she saw not the objects about her she attended not to the humble and plaintive voice of thorold who now and then spoke to her when lady horatia howard turning to her bade her remark that into the opposite box had just entered lady castlenorth and her daughter  celestina instantly saw them and as instantly concluded that willoughbys conduct toward her was owing to his being on the point of marriage with miss fitzhayman  she had hardly felt her heart sink under this cruel idea before willoughby himself appeared and lady castleworth making room for him he sat down between her and her daughter  a look from the penetrating eyes of lady horatia howard made celestina turn away her head but she then met the anxious and enquiring eyes of montague thorold and again sought refuge in looking toward the pit  hardly knowing where she was and not daring again to trust herself with the sight of the group placed immediately opposite to her willoughby saw her not and after a while her eyes in despite of the pain she felt sought him again  his countenance did not wear expressions of bridal felicity  he was she thought paler and thinner than the night before and on his brow some corrosive sorrow seemed to hang but miss fitzhayman gay and animated talked to him incessantly and both she and her mother endeavored to engross his attention by a flow of conversation  he listened to them  but celestina fancied with more politeness than pleasure  he smiled but she thought his smiles were the smiles of complaisance and not of content still however his appearance in public with them was enough to convince her that his marriage was not far off her heart sunk at this sad certainty for though she had long since endeavored to wean her mind from the hopes of ever being his she had still too keen recollections of that time when it was the first wish of both their hearts and she was prepossessed with an idea she hardly knew why that with miss fitzhayman he would be miserable  that they had been parted by the artifice of lady castleworth she now more than ever suspected but how willoughby could be cheated into such a belief and if he was why he should entirely throw off as a relation her whom as the chosen mistress of his heart he had so fondly cherished she could not comprehend or could she in any way reconcile his conduct with that manly and liberal spirit which had so eminently marked his character  as she gazed on his face as on that of a stranger  the husband of miss fitzhayman  that face which she had been accustomed to contemplate with so much tenderness and when she considered that lost to her for ever she now dared no longer look up to him as a friend whom she had once hoped to find through life her fond and generous protector her reflections became too bitter and had she not feared that her going out would have attracted his eyes toward her and known that montague thorold would have attended her which she desired to avoid she would have returned home  for her sufferings were almost insupportable  she hoped however to escape without his seeing her and shrunk back as much as she could pretending that her headache made the light particularly uneasy to her montague thorold though knowing too well the real source of her uneasiness was yet as anxious as she was that willoughby might not see her and favored her concealment as much as he could  toward the end of the opera however willoughby who seemed very weary of his seat left it to speak to somebody he saw in the pit  celestina saw him very near the box where she sat and became so faint that she was afraid she must have sunk from her seat  but her sufferings still increased when a moment afterward mr howard who sat next to her called to him and got up to speak to him  in answering his question willoughby turned toward him  his eyes immediately fell on celestina and montague thorold close beside her  an expression of mingled anger and scorn rose instantly in his countenance he abruptly broke off his conversation with mr howard and walked away  in a moment celestina saw him rejoin lady castlenorth and miss fitzhayman  she saw him affect to enter into conversation with them but that it was all effort his eyes once or twice were turned toward her but immediately withdrawn as if they had met a basilisk and after a very few minutes she saw by his manner that he complained of the heat of the house pleaded indisposition and left them  celestina overwhelmed with sensations too much to be borne began to think the opera never would end and that lady horatia who saw her distress had never before had so little compassion at length it was finished and as montague thorold handed her to the coach she besought him not to stay supper if lady horatia should ask him for i must in that case stay you know to entertain you and really i am so unwell that it is cruelty to expect it of me gratified by the power of obeying her even when her wishes were contrary to his own and full of hope that this last struggle between her lingering love for willoughby and the certainty of his having left her for another would terminate in his own favor thorold promised to be wholly governed by her and took his leave at the door  well celestina said lady horatia as soon as they were alone you are now i think convinced that willoughby is like most other men capricious and unfeeling  what was his conduct tonight but the most insulting that it was possible to assume and after receiving a letter too from you which you consess was couched in the tenderest and most submissive terms which as a gentleman he ought to have answered had you never had any claim whatever upon him  i hope and believe however that such conduct will have the happiest effect  that of weaning you for ever from that excessive partiality which from early prejudice you always appeared to me to think it a merit to cherish if he quitted you as he pretended on account of the doubts raised in his mind by that sorceress lady castlenorth why does he not those doubts being now certainties own you as his sister and become your protector as relation why if they are not ascertained does he poorly shrink from the enquiry and evade under such paltry pretenses the engagements which you would surely release him from if told that he no longer wished to accomplish them  celestina tried to speak but could not articulate and lady horatia whose indignation against willoughby seemed to increase by indulgence went on  let me conjure you then my dear celestina to exert that large share of reason with which you are endowed and expelling from your mind all that has passed try to look forward to happier prospects  to prospects unclouded by doubt and undarkened by the gloomy apprehensions of being despised by the family of your husband and of being reproached as having embarrassed his fortune time and reason the assiduous tenderness of a man who really adores you will conquer all remains of regret and you will by degrees learn to think of willoughby and of all the events of your early life with the most perfect indifference  celestina thought that was impossible  but altogether unable to enter into the argument she could only sigh and in a tremulous voice entreat to be permitted to retire saying that in the morning she should have she hoped more resolution and have got the better of the agitation of her spirits sleep however refused to visit her  the image of willoughby cruel and capricious as he was incessantly haunted her having been long used to study his countenance she understood all its expressions and when she had courage to fix her eyes on him during the opera no turn of it escaped her all the comfort she could derive to herself from those observations was believing that his attention to miss fitzhayman was forced and that the solicitude with which she herself was avoided arose rather from some remains of tenderness than from total indifference surely said she if he felt nothing for me he would not fly from me but treat me with polite indifference or with that candor and openness of heart which used to be so natural to him he would avow his designs and give his reasons for them for he knows that be his intentions or his motives what they may i shall never reproach him but whatever i may feel for myself rejoice if he can find happiness  thus the real affection of her heart for willoughby counteracted the effect of that native pride and dignity of soul which under other circumstances would have supported her and even of his quitting her without finding that unanswerable reason for it which was once supposed to exist she thought rather in sorrow than in anger  the morning came joyless and uninteresting to her  she expected nothing but a repetition of common irksome occurrences with the suspense and misery of not hearing from willoughby  lady horatias remonstrance  montague thorolds silent but assiduous attendance  company whom she wished not to see  or parties abroad that could afford her no pleasure  the day and another and another wore away and still no letter from willoughby arrived  the forlorn hope which she had till now fondly cherished that he still retained a lingering preference for her in his heart now faded away and an almost certain conviction succeeded that he not only quitted her for ever but disclaimed her even as a friend and gave her up in silent contempt without either offering her the protection of a relation or feeling for her the regret which the loss of a pleasant acquaintance would once she thought have given him  she repented she had concealed the letter she had written from lady horatia howard and while she was conscious that she ought to have no reserves toward her she felt that in her present anxious state of suspense it would be some consolation to talk it over with her friend but far from soothing her with hope and attempting to account for the silent neglect of willoughby by any means that might palliate its cruelty lady horatia exhorted her more earnestly than ever to call off her thoughts from a man who was considered in every light so unworthy to possess them and she urged more earnestly than she had ever yet done her wishes that the tender and generous attachment of montague thorold might be immediately rewarded  though to the necessity of giving herself to another celestina could by no means agree yet she felt that she must either learn to think with more calmness of her eternal separation from willoughby or sink under it  for such pain as the undecided wretchedness of the last two or three days had given her human nature could not long sustain she promised lady horatia that she would endeavor to regain her tranquillity but besought her for a day or two to excuse her from mixing with company and that in the mean time nothing might be said to montague thorold to give him more encouragement than he had already received from the looks of willoughby when he had seen her with him and from his present disdainful silence she supposed that he believed her engaged to him and either resented her having entered into such an engagement without consulting him or still felt some pain in believing she had given herself to another  of which she could not help owning there was every appearance from their being so frequently together and from the report which had gone forth which her protectress had not only left uncontradicted but had rather encouraged of montague thorold therefore she now thought with concern and disquiet as being partly the cause of the uneasiness she suffered from the certainty which every hour in its flight confirmed that willoughby had taken leave of her for ever  end of the third volume
