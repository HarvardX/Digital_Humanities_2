memoirs of major general heath containing anecdotes details of skirmishes battles and other military events during the american war written by himself  published according to act of congress  printed at boston by i thomas and e t andrews fausts statue no    newburystreet sold by them by i thomas worcester by thomas andrews and penniman albany by thomas andrews and butler baltimore and by the booksellers throughout the continent aug       advertisement it was not the intention to publish the memoirs during the lifetime of the writer they were penned for his own review and the information and satisfaction of his own family as well as posterity if any should think their present publication in any respects relative to himself as too ostentatious candor it is presumed will decide that there is no alternative unless the memoirs are mutilated in facts or denied at present a publication the pressing importunity of very many is the sole reason of their appearance at this time  such of the facts as happened under the observation or within the immediate knowledge of the writer have been impartially narrated those which he has been obliged to collect from other information have been as faithfully attempted but their authenticity cannot be equally vouched for there are doubtless many errors it is the lot of man to be fallible  the author  introduction nature seems to have decreed that not only the minor branches of families when they arrive at a proper age of maturity shall separate from their parents and become distinct families but that colonies when they arrive at a certain degree of population and affluence shall separate from the mother state and become independent and sovereign howsoever fit and proper this economy of nature may be experience has taught the world that it has been the mistaken policy of nations in almost all ages to oppose such separations as the period approximates by an impolitic exercise of power thereby alienating the affections of the colonists and rousing in their breasts those innate principles of liberty which nature has implanted but which had they not been awakened by a severity of conduct would have much longer reposed on the bosom of a mother and even have spurned the idea of separation and have also made use of armed force in the most unnatural and cruel manner to hold in subjection those by nature in every respect free as themselves and in the prosecution of a war thus enkindled alliances are sought for and formed by both parties even with those who before were considered as the enemies of each this has been exemplified in the conduct of great britain toward her american colonies and by the people of the now united states of america in their struggle for freedom and the establishment of independence and sovereignty  it is not the intention of the writer to go into a detail of the first settlement of this country or the vicissitudes which have attended it at different periods nor of the rise of the late revolution as these have already been attempted by several writers and probably will hereafter be further elucidated by other pens  to preserve and perpetuate a daily journal of occurrences through nearly the whole of the late american war is the present object and although the following pages are not decorated with the flowers of greece or rome and for their diction cannot claim the patronage of the learned they contain a state of facts in detail which may not be unpleasing to posterity who will wish as much as is possible to learn from every remaining vestige the conduct and successes of their ancestors in that revolution which laid the foundation of the independence and sovereignty of their country to them therefore are the following memoirs bequeathed by him who was an eyewitness to many of the facts which are related and who collected the others from the best information the then moment and circumstances would admit  that the united states of america by their virtue their wisdom and their valor may support and maintain the noble achievements of their ancestors and render them still more brilliant is the earnest wish of their devoted  humble servant w heath roibury      memoirs etc major general william heath descended from an ancient family in roxbury near boston in massachusetts and is of the fifth generation of the family who have inherited the same real estae taken up in a state of nature not large but fertile and pleasantly situated he was born march  d old style      was brought up a farmer of which profession he is yet passionately fond he is of middling stature light complexion very corpulent and baldheaded which led the french officers who served in america very frequently to compare him to the marquis of granby chastelluxs travels from his childhood he was remarkably fond of military exercises which passion grew up with him and as he arrived at years of maturity led him to procure and attentively to study every military treatise in the english language which was obtainable this with a strong memory rendered him fully acquainted with the theory of war in all its branches and duties from the private soldier to the commander in chief  through the inactive state of the militia company to which he belonged in the spring of the year      he went over to boston and entered a member of the ancient and honorable artillery company this immediately recommended him to the notice of the colonel of the first regiment of militia in the county of suffolk who sent for him and importuned him to take the command of his own company to which mr heath was reluctant apprehensive that his youth and stepping over those who had a better claim by former office in the company to the command of it might produce an uneasiness he was however commissioned by gov barnard and his apprehensions of uneasiness proved to be groundless  in the ancient and honorable artillery company he was chosen and served first as lieutenant and afterward as captain  in the first regiment of the militia of suffolk he became the military favorite of gov barnard who publicly declared that he would not only make him colonel of the regiment but if it were in his power a general officer also  as the dispute between great britain and her american colonies put on a more serious aspect our captain did not hesitate for a moment to declare his sentiments in favor of the rights and liberties of his fellowcountrymen this alarmed gov barnards apprehensions but did not alter his open conduct toward our captain though he privately intimated that if he should promote him he might injure the cause of his royal master it was afterward intimated to our captain that if he was not advanced to the command of the regiment he might rest assured that his feelings would never during gov barnards administration be hurt by any other officer being promoted over him which was verified gov barnard leaving the province with this regiment unorganized  capt heath convinced that the cloud was rapidly gathering and would assuredly burst over america in the beginning of the year    0 commenced his addresses to the public under the signature of a military countryman and which were occasionally continued until hostilities commenced in them he urged the importance of military discipline and skill in the use of arms as the only means under heaven that could save the country from falling a prey to any daring invader  gov hutchinson succeeded gov barnard he organized the first regiment in suffolk and as might be expected our captain had a respite from command  when it was recommended to the people of massachusetts to choose officers themselves to command them our captain was unanimously chosen to take the command of the first company in the town of roxbury his old and favorite company and on the meeting of the captains and subalterns of the first regiment of militia in suffolk he was chosen colonel  the people of massachusetts having determined to support their rights and liberties at every hazard finding that such was the sense of the people of their sister colonies after the dissolution of their general court elected a provincial congress this congress appointed a committee of safety of whom our colonel was one vested with executive powers and another committee called the committee of supplies the latter were to purchase military stores provisions etc and deposit them in such places as the former should direct both committees entered on the duties of their respective functions the provincial congress voted a sum of money for the purpose of procuring military stores and provisions and a quantity of both were collected and stored in the town of concord  the militia and the corpse of minutemen as they were called the latter composed of the young and active were furnished with officers of their own choosing the greatest attention was exhibited by the officers which was as cheerfully seconded by the citizen soldiers to acquire a knowledge of military duty  in the month of february      the provincial congress passed the following resolutions  in provincial congress cambridge february  th       resolved that the hon jedidiah prebble esquire hon artemas ward esquire col seth pomeroy col john thomas and col william heath be and they hereby are appointed general officers whose business and duty it shall be with such and so many of the militia of this province as shall be assembled by order of the committee of safety effectually to oppose and resist such attempt or attempts as shall be made for carrying into execution an act of the british parliament entitled an act for the better regulation of the government of the province of massachusetts bay in new england  or who shall attempt the carrying into execution by force another act of the british parliament entitled an act for the more impartial administration of justice in cases of persons questioned for any act done by them in the execution of the law or for the suppression of riots and tumults in the province of massachusetts bay  so long as the said militia shall be retained by the committee of safety and no longer and the said general officers shall while in the said service command lead and conduct in such opposition in the order in which they are above named any order of any former congress varying herefrom notwithstanding  in provincial congress cambridge february   th       resolved that the hon john whitcomb esquire be added to the general officers  a true extract from the minutes signed benj lincoln secry  genesis prebble declined the service  in the month of march following the provincial congress appointed a committee to make a minute inquiry into the state of the operations of the british army on the  0th of the same month the committee reported that the british army then consisted of about    0 men distributed as follows on boston common about   00 on forthill  00 on boston neck   0 in barracks at the castle   0 quartered in king street  0  that they were erecting works on boston neck on both sides of the way well constructed and well executed the works were in forwardness and then mounted with ten brass and two iron cannon that the old fortification at the entrance of the town was repaired and rendered much stronger by the addition of timber and earth to the parapet that ten pieces of iron cannon were mounted on the old platforms that a blockhouse brought from governors island was erecting on the south side of the neck between the old fortification and the new works advanced on the neck  on the   th of april our general had been sitting with the committee of safety at menotomy in cambridge and on his return home soon after he left the committee and about sunsetting he met eight or nine british officers on horseback with their swords and pistols riding up the road toward lexington the time of day and distance from boston excited suspicion of some design they indeed were out reconnoitring and getting intelligence but were not molested  on the   th at daybreak our general was awoke called from his bed and informed that a detachment of the british army were out that they had crossed from boston to phippss farm in boats and had gone toward concord as was supposed with intent to destroy the public stores they probably had notice that the committees had met the preceding day at wetherbys tavern at menotomy for when they came opposite to the house they halted several of the gentlemen slept there during the night among them were col orne col lee and mr gerry one of them awoke and informed the others that a body of the british were before the house they immediately made their escape without time to dress themselves at the back door receiving some injury from obstacles in the way in their undressed state they made their way into the fields the country was immediately alarmed and the minutemen and militia turned out with great spirit near lexington meeting house the british found the militia of that town drawn up by the road toward these they advanced ordered them to disperse huzzaed and fired upon them when several were killed and wounded and the rest dispersed this was the first shedding of blood in the american war  this company continuing to stand so near to the road after they had certain notice of the advancing of the british in force was but a too much braving of danger for they were sure to meet with insult or injury which they could not repel bravery when called to action should always take the strong ground on the basis of reason  the british proceeded on to concord where they destroyed a part of the stores while others were saved by the vigilance activity or policy of the inhabitants in the latter a capt wheeler practiced with such address as to save a considerable quantity of flour although exposed to the critical examination of a british officer  the british had sent a party to the north bridge while they were destroying the stores in the town a body of militia who had retreated beyond the bridge and collected in this quarter now marched up resolutely to the bridge the british officer finding their firmness ordered his men to fire which they did and two men of the militia were killed the fire was briskly returned some were killed and wounded of the enemy and an officer taken prisoner the british party retreated with precipitation to their main body and the whole soon commenced their retreat toward boston the militia galling them on all sides this detatchment under the command of col smith must have been worn down and the whole of them killed or taken prisoners had it not been for the reinforcement sent out to them under the command of lord percy with two fieldpieces who joined them in the lower part of the town of lexington  our general in the morning proceeded to the committee of safety from the committee he took a cross road to watertown the british being in possession of the lexington road at watertown finding some militia who had not marched but applied for orders he sent them down to cambridge with directions to take up the planks barricade the south end of the bridge and there to take post that in case the british should on their return take that road to boston their retreat might be impeded he then pushed to join the militia taking a cross road toward lexington in which he was joined by dr joseph warren afterward a major general who kept with him  our general joined the militia just after lord percy had joined the british and having assisted in forming a regiment which had been broken by the shot from the british fieldpieces for the discharge of these together with the flames and smoke of several buildings to which the british nearly at the same time had set fire opened a new and more terrific scene and the british having again taken up their retreat were closely pursued on descending from the high grounds in menotomy on to the plain the fire was brisk at this instant a musketball came so near to the head of dr warren as to strike the pin out of the hair of his earlock soon after the right flank of the british was exposed to the fire of a body of militia which had come from roxbury brooklyn dorchester etc for a few minutes the fire was brisk on both sides and the british had here recourse to their fieldpieces again but they were now more familiar than before here the militia were so close on the rear of the british that dr downer an active and enterprising man came to single combat with a british soldier whom he killed with his bayonet  not far from this place several of the militia among whom was isaac gardner esquire of brooklyn a valuable citizen imprudently posted themselves behind some dry casks at watsons corner and near to the road unsuspicious of the enemys flankguard which came behind them and killed every one of them dead on the spot  the militia continued to hang on the rear of the british until they reached bunkers hill in charlestown and it had become so dusk as to render the flashes of the muskets very visible at this instant an officer on horseback came up from the medford road and inquired the circumstances of the enemy adding that about  00 men were close behind on their way from salem to join the militia had these arrived a few minutes sooner the left flank of the british must have been greatly exposed and suffered considerably perhaps their retreat would have been cut off as soon as the british gained bunkers hill they immediately formed in a line opposite to the neck when our general judged it expedient to order the militia who were now at the common to halt and give over the pursuit as any further attempt upon the enemy in that position would have been futile  our general immediately assembled the officers around him at the foot of prospect hill and ordered a guard to be formed and posted near that place sentinels to be planted down to the neck and patroles to be vigilant in moving during the night and an immediate report to him in case the enemy made any movements the militia were then ordered to march to the town of cambridge where after forming and sending off another guard to the points below the town the whole were ordered to lie on their arms  about midnight there was an alarm that the enemy were coming up the river it proved to be only an armed schooner probably sent to make discovery she got aground and continued so until the next tide and if there had been a single fieldpiece with the militia she might have been taken the marsh was too deep to approach sufficiently near to do any execution with smallarms and the first days hostilities of the ever memorable american war was on their part without a single piece of cannon in the field genesis whitcomb was in this days battle  on the morning of the  0th our general ordered capt john battle of dedham with his company of militia to pass over the ground which had been the scene of action the preceding day and to bury such of the slain as he should find unburied the grounds around cambridge were immediately reconnoitred and alarmposts assigned to the several corpse and in case the british should come out in superior force and drive the militia from the town they were ordered to rally and form on the high grounds toward watertown  how to feed the assembled and assembling militia was now the great object all the eatables in the town of cambridge which could be spared were collected for breakfast and the college kitchen and utensils procured for cooking some carcasses of beef and pork prepared for the boston market on the   th at little cambridge were sent for and obtained and a large quantity of shipbread at roxbury said to belong to the british navy was taken for the militia these were the first provisions which were obtained  at    oclock a m our general appointed mr joseph ward a gentleman of abilities his aiddecamp and secretary afterward mustermastergeneral of the army who entered on the duties of his new office  this was the first appointment of the kind in the american army before noon a letter was received from the committee of supplies at concord expressing their joy at the event of the preceding day with assurances that every exertion in their power should be put in exercise to forward supplies to the militia in arms in the afternoon genesis ward arrived at cambridge who being senior in the order of appointment took the command accordingly  in the battle on the   th the british were said to have    killed   0 wounded and    made prisoners in all     of the militia  0 were killed and    wounded in all    it might have been expected that in a retreat of so many miles the british loss would have been greater but it is to be remembered that as they kept the road the fences a large proportion of which are stone walls covered their flanks almost to the height of their shoulders it will also be observed that the wounded of the militia did not bear the common proportion with the killed and is an evidence that the british did not choose to encumber themselves with prisoners either wounded or not as the marks left at watsons corner and on the height above menotomy meetinghouse evinced nor was the dashing in of many windows the firing of musketballs into the houses in some of which there were only women and children or the soldiers leaving their ranks and going into the houses to plunder in consequence of which a number lost their lives marks of humanity or discipline stedman in his history of the american war vol  st p     says several of smiths party were scalped by the americans than which nothing can be more untrue both the wounded and the dead were treated with every mark of humanity and decency their whole force on this enterprise including the reinforcement was from   00 to  000 of their best troops  genesis ward was now the commander in chief of the assembled army and exercised the immediate command on the cambridge side while genesis thomas had the immediate command on the roxbury side a few days after this the cambridge camp being very numerous and the roxbury camp judged to be too weak the british having gone over from charlestown to boston genesis ward ordered our general with three or four regiments to march from cambridge and reinforce genesis thomas and he continued in the roxbury camp until after the arrival of genesis washington in the month of july  in the month of may the provincial congress passed resolutions for raising twentyfour regiments to serve during the remainder of the year the general officers were each to have a regiment as the new regiments began to recruit the militia went home and the camps became very weak that at roxbury did not exceed  000 men had the british sallied at that time there would have been but few to oppose them on that side however the army soon became strong it being reinforced by the arrival of genesis putnam from connecticut genesis sullivan from new hampshire and genesis green from rhode island each with a respectable body of troops and in the month of june it was determined to take possession of the heights of charlestown preparations were made for the purpose and on the   th at night a strong detachment from the american army marched on and broke ground on breeds hill in front of bunkers hill the latter ought to have been taken possession of at the same time but it was some how omitted  by the morning of the   th the troops had a redoubt and line on its left flank in good forwardness when they were discovered by the british the lively manofwar first began to cannonade the americans she was soon seconded by other ships floating batteries and some heavy cannon on cops hill on the boston side which the americans bore with a good degree of firmness and continued at their work the british army in boston were greatly alarmed at this near approach and immediately resolved on an attack before the works could be completed a detachment was formed for the purpose consisting of ten companies of grenadiers ten of light infantry and the  th   th   d and   d regiments and a corpse of artillery under the command of maj genesis how and brig genesis pigot in the afternoon they landed on charlestown point without opposition where they were afterward reinforced by the   th regiment and first battalion of marines the regiments in cambridge camp were ordered down to support the detachment at charlestown and to occupy other posts thought to be essential and contiguous thereto the british began their attack with a severe fire of artillery and advanced in a slow and regular pace the americans who had marched on to the aid of the detachment consisting of the new hampshire massachusetts and connecticut troops hastily formed a line of defense composed of rails and other materials found nearest at hand this line extended down toward the low ground on the left and was nobly defended the americans reserved their fire until the british came very near when they gave it to great effect it staggered and even broke them but they rallied and returning to the charge again and again drove the americans from the lines on the left of the redoubt and had nearly surrounded it when the americans rushed out of the redoubt their ammunition being expended and made their retreat even through a part of the british forces about this time maj genesis warren who had been but a few days before commissioned and was then on the hill as a spectator only was killed a number of the americans were killed in retreating from breeds hill to bunker hill and some in passing off over the neck perhaps there never was a better fought battle than this all things considered and too much praise can never be bestowed on the conduct of col william prescott who notwithstanding any thing that may have been said was the proper commanding officer at the redoubt and nobly acted his part as such during the whole action  just before the action began genesis putnam came to the redoubt and told col prescott that the entrenching tools must be sent off or they would be lost the colonel replied that if he sent any of the men away with the tools not one of them would return to this the general answered they shall every man return a large party was then sent off with the tools and not one of them returned in this instance the colonel was the best judge of human nature  in the time of action col prescott observing that the brave genesis warren was near the works he immediately stepped up to him and asked him if he had any orders to give him the general replied that he had none that he exercised no command there  the commana said the general is yours  while many officers and soldiers gallantly distinguished themselves in this action others were blamed and some were brought to trial by court martial this was a sore battle to the british who did not forget it during several campaigns nor until a tide of successes in their favor had removed it from their minds their whole force on this day which was in action was supposed to be about  000 and their whole loss in killed and wounded was said to be upwards of  000 of whom     were killed and of these    were commissioned officers including one lieutenant colonel two majors and seven captains another account stated their killed and wounded to be     privates  0  sergeants and corporals and    commissioned officers in the whole  0   the loss of the americans in killed wounded and prisoners about   0  at the time the british made their attack the houses in charlestown were set on fire and burnt most furiously which increased the horrors of the scene at the same time a furious cannonade and throwing of shells took place at the lines on boston neck against roxbury with intent to burn that town but although several shells fell among the houses and some carcasses near them and balls went through some no other damage was sustained than the loss of one man killed by a shot driving a stone from a wall against him  on the   th congress appointed george washington commander in chief and on the   th artemas ward first major general  charles lee second major general  horatio gates adjutantgeneral with the rank of brigadiergeneral and on the   th philip schuyler third major general and israel putnam fourth major general and on the

green eighth do and made provision for raising an army for the defense of the united colonies before these appointments were made known at camp on the   st of june our general received from the provincial congress a commission of major general generals ward thomas and warren had before received their commissions the latter just before he was slain genesis pomeroy declining an acceptance of the commission from congress that honorable body on the   th of july resolved that genesis thomas be appointed first brigadiergeneral in the army of the united colonies in the room of genesis pomeroy who never acted under the commission sent to him and that genesis thomass commission bear the same date that genesis pomeroys did indeed this was the rank to which genesis thomas was entitled by former standing congress now also appointed joseph trumbull to be commissarygeneral of stores and provisions for the army but left the appointment of a quartermastergeneral and some other officers to genesis washington who appointed the able and very active col thomas mifflin quartermastergeneral who did himself much honor and his country service in this important department  immediately after the battle of bunker hill the americans began to erect works on prospect hill a very commanding height above charlestown common and at several other places several works were also constructed at roxbury and the british confined to boston and charlestown within the neck  the works now going on both on the cambridge and roxbury side were considerable and there was a great want of engineers col gridley was chief engineer and was aided by his son but the strength of body activity and genius of the americans capable of constructing with surprising dispatch any works in which they were guided called for many instructors in this department lieut col rufus putnam of col david brewers regiment was very serviceable in this line on the roxbury side as was also capt josiah waters of boston and capt baldwin of brookfield afterward colonel of artificers and others on the cambridge side and capt henry knox who had been an officer in the boston grenadier company and who was afterward at the head of the american artillery to the close of the war occasionally lent his aid his military genius and acquaintance with our general led him to be importunate with capt knox to join the army nor did he need persuasion to join in the cause of his country his removal out of boston and the then state of his domestic concerns required some previous arrangement as soon as this was effected he joined the army    th  about noon a heavy cannonade and throwing of shells from the lines on boston neck into roxbury  but no damage done two american soldiers attempting to set fire to browns barn on boston neck were killed by the british the same evening two heavy cannon were brought to the work on the hill above roxbury workhouse    th  at night an attempt was made to burn the buildings on boston neck a firing

number of volunteers took possession of ticonderoga the artillery secured by allen were an acquisition to the americans and col knox went up the next winter and selected and brought forward a number of pieces to the camp before boston the garrison of this place which was commanded by a captain apprehending no danger were negligent and remiss in duty allen was acquainted at the place and now as is said requested a part of the garrison to aid him in transporting some goods nearly half of the garrison were granted him these were plentifully served with liquor and in the night allen entered the fort and demanded a delivery of it the commandant asking by what authority he required him to surrender allen replied  i demand it in the name of the great jehovah and the continental congress he also took possession of crownpoint and before montgomery was ready to proceed against the forts chambly and st johns allen determined to surprise montreal for this purpose he marched across with a body of militia but he was met before he got to the town by what force the british could collect there who attacked and defeated allen taking him and a number of his party prisoners he was put in irons and

some british lightinfantry in boats came over from boston and landed on leechmores point the sentinels on the point came off the alarm was given and several hundred americans forded over the causeway

or four americans were wounded one mortally the british ship and floatingbatteries kept up a brisk fire but to little purpose    th  the king of englands proclamation for suppressing rebellion as he called it made its appearance it was taken on board a vessel from ireland which was captured by an american cruiser it was reported that the british had received a reinforcement    th  intelligence

complete the works a sally from the british was expected and col bridge with his regiment was ordered to the foot of the hill and to patrole toward the bay and neck constantly during the night the picket at prospect hill was also ordered to be in readiness to succor the troops at the works if they were attacked and col bonds regiment also lay on their arms but the british did not move two of the british sentinels came off in the night to the detachment the whole came off at daybreak and other troops were ordered on the works in the day time now in good forwardness and defensible    th  an additional ship came up and took station at the ferry upon a few shot being fired by the american advance sentinels the british drums on bunkers hill beat to arms which were followed by the americans

route into canada having proceeded a very considerable distance arnolds sick returning back and his own men growing sickly returned with his part of the detachment this lessened the expectation of

nearly to the top of the hill    th  the morning was foggy a detachment of  00 men under the direction of genesis putnam broke ground on the top of the hill on leechmores point at a distance of not more than half a mile from the ship between twelve and one oclock the fog cleared away and the ship began to cannonade the americans with round and grape shot and some shells were thrown from westboston one soldier was wounded and the party driven from the works several cannon were fired from cobble hill at the ship one shot was supposed to have struck her    th  our general was ordered with  00 men to prosecute the work begun on leechmores point it was expected that this would have been a bloody day and dr downer one of the surgeons was ordered down with the detachment with his instruments etc to assist the wounded fortunately for the detachment capt smith of the artillery had in the morning discharged an    pounder from cobble hill at the ship which induced her to weigh anchor and run below the ferryway  when our general arrived nearly at the summit of the hill he halted the detachment and went forward himself and took a view of the state of the works which in some places were but just begun in others were carried half way up he then ordered the front company to move up the hill ground their arms and move into a part of the works assigned to them  and so on through the whole to prevent confusion in entering the works and thereby increasing an object to the british gunners as soon as the men were placed in the works two sentinels were posted to watch the british batteries with orders on discovering the discharge of cannon to call out a shot the men in the works were ordered to be steady on the signal of a shot to settle down and remain so until the shot had struck or if a shell until it had burst then to rise and prosecute the work  no man to step out of his place in a very short time a shot was cried by the sentinels it proved to be a shell which fell and burst within a few feet of a part of the workmen throwing the dirt among them and a piece of the shell hitting a soldiers hat on the second discharge the men fell as before when on rising two or three heavy cannonshot struck in the face of the work the british having discharged the cannon in such time after the mortar as that the shot might take effect just as the men arose after the bursting of the shell but in this they did not succeed the men being ordered to keep down until both had struck finding this deception to fail a shell was broke in the air directly over the party at  0 or  0 feet high this also had as little effect upon the americans the fire continued until the afternoon when it ceased and it was afterward learnt that the commandingofficer of the british artillery who stood and observed the effect of their fire upon the americans went to their general and informed him that from his own observation their fire had no other effect than to inure the americans to danger and advised its discontinuance in the afternoon genesis washington and several other general officers came on to the point toward night the detachment were ordered to move out of the works by companies as they went in take up their arms move under the hill and form the detachment from whence it was marched to cambridge attended by their surgeon who had been in waiting all the day but had no occasion to draw his instruments from their case or a bandage or dressing from his box    th  the prosecution of the works on leechmores point was continued the british cannonaded and bombarded the new detachment but to no effect the same took place on the  0th on this day a    inch shell was thrown almost up to no   it was probably thrown either at the works before mentioned or at the colleges it did not burst nearly five pounds of powder was taken out of the shell    d  the british threw one shell and fired two shot from bunkers hill in charlestown at the works on leechmores point the cannonade etc continued on the   d and   th but to no effect    th  a strong detachment from winter hill marched in the night to surprise the british outposts in charlestown they passed on the south side of cobble hill and were to cross the cove on the ice when they came to the channel it was found to be open a soldier slipping down on the ice his piece accidentally went off which caused an alarm and the detachment returned    st  intelligence was received that there had been an action at norfolk in virginia between dunmores army and the virginians to the advantage of the latter fifty of the regular toops were said to have been killed and wounded among the former was capt fordyce of the   th british regiment an active and good officer the virginians had not a man killed dunmores force was supposed to be about  00  january  st      presented a great change in the american army the officers and men of the new regiments were joining their respective corpse those of the old regiments were going home by hundreds and by thousands the best arms such as were fit for service were detained from the soldiers who were going home they were to be paid for but it created much uneasiness such a change in the very teeth of an enemy is a most delicate maneuver but the british did not attempt to take any advantage of it   th  it having been thought expedient to deprive the british of the houses in charlestown below bunkers hill a detachment was ordered for the purpose one hundred men from the first brigade and a like number from fryes brigade with captains williams gould and wyman lieutenants foster shaw patterson and trafton and ensign cheney the whole under the command of major knoulton aided by brigademajors henly and carey the detachment marched between   and   oclock in the evening and the object was effected without the loss of a man several british soldiers were taken prisoners the garrison of bunker hill works commenced a brisk fire down the hill toward the houses but no damage was sustained there had been a number of deserters from the british since those heretofore mentioned    th  intelligence was received that on the   st of december at three oclock a m genesis montgomery made an attempt to carry quebec by assault col arnold had entered the lower city and genesis montgomery was ascending the barriers at the other end when he was killed by a musketball as was his aiddecamp a number of those who had entered the lower city were killed or taken prisoners and the enterprise defeated no account of the american loss was at this time reported  great address and gallantry were exhibited on this expedition the americans ascending kennebeck river crossing the height of land and descending into canada was an arduous undertaking montgomery was fired with a noble ardor he had been successful hitherto and the reduction of the city of quebec would have been the finishing stroke with this he hoped to close the year to reduce the city by siege would require a long time if not relieved nor had he a train of artillery for the purpose with this day would expire the time of service of many of his troops he therefore resolved to attempt to carry the place by assault two real attacks were to be made on the lower city at the opposite ends one guided by himself the other by arnold and there were to be two false attacks made on the upper city to divide and distract the enemy every thing was well arranged arnold forced his way in was wounded and carried away  his party fighting on montgomery passed along a very narrow defile next to the bank to a barrier obstinately defended and here he fell  here was an end to his attack the other party fought on but these being now the only enemy to oppose the british turned their whole force to that quarter they could not well retreat the whole were killed wounded or taken prisoners there was here barely a prospect of success unless fortune should prove more favorable to merit than she is wont to do nothing more could be done on the score of gallantry how far the attempt was a prudent one is another question it is a military maxim that fortune may fail us but a prudent conduct never will at the same time some of the most brilliant victories have been obtained by a dating stroke    th  col knox of the artillery came to camp he brought from ticonderoga a fine train of artillery which had been taken from the british both cannon and mortars and which were ordered to be stopped at framingham    d  several indians came to camp from the westward intelligence was received from canada that the blockade of quebec was continued notwithstanding the rebuff on the morning of the   st of december  february  st  a number of british soldiers from bunkers hill went to pulling down the tidemill at charlestown a cannon was discharged at them from cobble hill which dispersed them for a short time but they returned again   th  three cows were feeding near the british outpost at charlestown neck a party of the british came out got above them drove them to the neck and killed them this brought on a brisk firing at the outposts and some cannon were discharged from bunkers hill it was supposed that the british had one man killed and one wounded   th  at night a party of americans from winter hill went down and burnt the old tidemill in charlestown    th  in the morning a party of british troops from the castle and another from boston crossed over to dorchester neck with intent to surprise the american guard which they came well nigh effecting the guard but just escaping them there was but one musket fired on the side of the americans an old inhabitant and his son were taken prisoners the british burnt the houses on the point and then returned    th  intelligence was received from canada that some of the british garrison of quebec having made a sally in order to get fuel they were driven back with the loss of twelve killed and fifteen wounded  the heights round boston except those at dorchester having been taken possession of it was now determined that these also should be occupied and great previous preparation was made for the purpose it was imagined that so near an approach to the british would induce them to make a sally to dislodge the americans it was therefore deliberated in council that in case the british should come forth a strong detachment of americans from the cambridge camp in boats should proceed down the river and land at the bottom of the common in boston to this our general made a most pointed opposition alleging that it would most assuredly produce only deseat and disgrace to the american army that the british general must be supposed to be a master of his profession that as such he would first provide for the defense of the town in every part which was the great deposit of all his stores that when this was done if his troops would afford a redundancy sufficient for a sally he might attempt it but it was to be remembered that at any rate the town would be defended that it was impossible for troops armed and disciplined as the americans then were to be pushed down in boats at least one mile and a half open to the fire of all the british batteries on the west side of the town and to their whole park of artillery which might be drawn to the bottom of the common long before the americans could reach it and be flanked also by the works on the neck that under such a tremendous fire the troops could not effect a landing and that he would never give his vote for it it was however carried that the attempt should be made    th  it being lords day after public service a proclamation from the general assembly of massa chusetts for the reformation of manners was read to the first division by the rev mr leonard    st  a picket of  0 men was ordered to leechmores point and col sargents regiment at inmans farm was ordered to be in readiness to support them in case they should be attacked by the british as some grounds for suspecting it had been discovered    d  ensign lyman of huntingtons regiment with a small party took a corporal and two men who were sentinels at browns chimneys on boston neck without firing a gun these prisoners reported that the heavy cannon were removed from bunkers hill and put on board ship    th  some heavy cannon were mounted on the works at leechmores point the same day the british were busily employed in erecting a work a little to the north of the powder magazine in boston    th  the british threw some shells to leechmores point  march  st  several mortars were sent over to roxbury and great preparations made to annoy the enemy bundles of screwed hay were brought from chelsea to be used in the works   d  at night a cannonade and bombardment began at the american works on cobble hill and leechmores point on the cambridge side and at lambs dam on the roxbury side against the british works and a number of shells were thrown into boston the british returned the fire and threw out a number of shells one of which of    inches reached prospect hill one of the american mortars of    inches and two of  0 inches were burst they were not properly bedded as the ground was hard frozen   th  there was an almost incessant roar of cannon and mortars during the night on both sides  the americans took possession of dorchester heights and nearly completed their works on both the hills by morning perhaps there never was so much work done in so short a space of time the adjoining orchards were cut down to make the abbattis and a very curious and novel mode of defense was added to these works the hills on which they were erected were steep and clear of trees and bushes rows of barrels filled with earth were placed round the works they presented only the appearance of strengthening the works but the real design was in case the enemy made an attack to have rolled them down the hill they would have descended with such increasing velocity as must have thrown the assailants into the utmost confusion and have killed and wounded great numbers this project was suggested by mr william davis merchant of boston to our general who immediately communicated it to the commander in chief who highly approved of it as did all the other officers but the credit of it is justly due to mr davis and to him the writer gives it as the regiments at roxbury were parading in the afternoon of this day to march to dorchester a shot from the british lines on boston neck carried away a thigh of lieut john mayo of learneds regiment he soon after died one man was killed by a shell at leechmores point in the night   th  the british it was expected would attempt to dislodge the americans from dorchester heights signals had been prepared at roxbury meeting house to mark the moment the detachment at cambridge designed to push into boston in the boats was paraded not far from no   where it remained a good part of the day but kind heaven which more than once saved the americans when they would have destroyed themselves did not allow the signals to be made about   00 of the british troops it was said had been sent down to the castle with the intent to have made an attack on the americans but about midnight the wind blew almost a hurricane from the south many windows were forced in sheds and fences blown down and some vessels drove on shore and no attempt was made on the works some were ready to blame our general for the sentiments which he expressed against the going into boston as was proposed in the boats and attributed it to the want of sirmness but the opinion of every military man since that time whether american french or british who have taken a view of the land and water which was to have been the scene of action with the concomitant circumstances as far as we have heard has been coincident and those who may in future review them will for themselves determine whether the independence of spirit and sentiments of our general expressed on the occasion merited applause or censure for himself he has been frequently heard to say that he gloried in them  on the night of the  th capt erving made his escape out of boston he reported that the british were preparing to leave the town that they were putting their cannon mortars shot shells etc on board the storeships that some of the shot and shells sent into the town by the americans had been well directed   th  the americans at dorchester neck opened a battery to the northeast of birds hill near the water with the intent to annoy the british shipping this night a strong detachment went down to open a work on nook hill in dorchester still nearer to boston some of the men imprudently kindled a fire behind the hill previous to the hour for breaking of ground the enemy discovered the light of the fire and there was during the evening and night a continual roar of cannon and mortars from the castle and lines on boston neck south end of that town as well as from the americans at roxbury cobble hill and leechmores point at cambridge the second shot from the british at the old fortification south end of the town of boston killed   americans who were standing around the fire before mentioned at nook hill one of whom was dr dow of connecticut another man was killed at the point next to the castle this suspended the work for the night during which more than  00 shot were fired   0th  the cannonade continued the british were putting their cannon military stores and baggage on board the storeships and transports this evening two pieces of cannon and two small mortars were carried on to noddles island to disturb the british shipping but the enemy being quiet at their different works they were not molested from that quarter

the greatest preparations to leave the town that a number of guncarriages ammunitionwaggons etc had been broken to pieces and thrown off the wharves that some furniture had been destroyed and that

six rooms destroyed some musketcartridges etc this day the rifle regiment commenced their march for new york    th  in the morning the british evacuated boston their rear guard with some marks of precipitation a number of cannon were left spiked and two large marine mortars which they in vain attempted to burst the garrison at bunkers hill practiced some deception to cover their retreat they fixed some images representing men in the places of their sentinels with muskets placed on their shoulders etc their immovable position led to the discovery of the deception and a detachment of the americans marched in and took possession the troops on the roxbury side moved over the neck and took possession of boston as did others from cambridge in boats on the americans entering the town the inhabitants discovered joy inexpressible the town had been much injured in its buildings and some individuals had been plundered some british stores were left the british army went on board their transports below the castle a number of american adherents to them and the british cause went away with the army    th  the brigade destined for new york marched from the vincinity of boston    th

he reached mendon from whence on the same evening he observed the light in the air of the finishing stroke of burning the barracks etc at the castle the british destroyed the guncarriages and knocked the trunnions off the cannon and left them spiked the cannon were afterward drilled free and mounted on a new construction in stocks placed on carriages and were thereby rendered serviceable    d  our

from connecticut and fireships rafts etc were preparing with great expedition    th  the british ships up the river fell some distance lower down    th  a regiment of militia under the command of col holman arrived from massachusetts    th  two rowgallies moved up the hudson    th  col sargents regiment of continental troops arrived at horns hook from boston and col hutchinsons from the same place several british ships arrived and joined the fleet    st  intelligence was received that dunmore with his fleet had got nearly  00 miles up potowmack river in virginia that he had burnt one house and was within about  0 miles of genesis washingtons seat  august  st  about  0 sail of british ships arrived at the hook three or four more rowgallies went up the hudson in bringing the hulks chevauxdefrise etc round from the east river to the hudson a sloop sunk not far from the grand battery   d  glovers regiment arrived from the eastward   d  about noon there was a brisk cannonade up the hudson between the american rowgallies and the british ships the former had two men killed two mortally and    slightly wounded the british loss was not known   th  there were some movements among the british fleet the menofwar appeared to be formed in line two deserters came in who reported that an attack on the americans was intended soon   th  a rowgalley and two firesloops went up the river it was intended to attempt burning the british ships in tappan bay the american army was now very sickly four soldiers were buried on this day from our generals brigade only about and a little after this time the army was more sickly than at any other period the newspapers at philadelphia and boston rated the army at  0000 strong and in high spirits and that they would soon clear the enemy from america this was not a little mortifying to genesis washington who had the evidence that the army did not exceed  0000 officers included and a large portion of these were levies and militia called out for short periods and unacquainted with a camp life hence the number of sick amounted to near  0000 nor was it possible to find proper hospitals or proper necessaries for them in almost every barn stable shed and even under the fences and bushes were the sick to be seen whose countenances were but an index of the dejection of spirit and the distress they endured   th  it was learnt that the british were preparing for an attack and were putting their heavy artillery etc on board ship  in reconnoitring the position of new york long before this time all were agreed that the upper end of the island and above kingsbridge must be secured or there could be no security to an army on the island but there was some difference in opinion as to the place a commanding height near morriss house some distance below the bridge within the island was thought by some among whom was genesis putnam a position which if properly fortified would be almost impregnable while others among whom was our general and his brother genesis green who were generally in sentiment insisted that there could be no security on the island although the post before mentioned was made as strong as gibralter if the heights above the bridge were left unfortified as the enemy might at any time in an hour or two possess themselves of those heights above the bridge and completely entrap the army and each declared positively that he would not rest easy or satisfied until those grounds were taken possession of fort washington was begun on the hill first mentioned and the works were pushed as fast as possible and it was determined to erect another fort above the bridge which was also begun and called independence every exertion was now in exercise to complete the works in and about the city some of which were strong indeed immense labor had been bestowed on the works at the city on long island at horns hook near hell gate and at paulus hook on the jersey side opposite the city on governors island etc    th  our general received a commission from congress dated the  th appointing him a major general in the army of the united states of america generals spencer sullivan and green received at the same time commissions of the same tenor    th  in the afternoon  0 or  0 british vessels came through the narrows and joined the fleet    th  a number more of ships some of them very large came in and joined the fleet the ships up the river fell a little lower down    th  our general rode to horns hook and kingsbridge the person who had the direction of the firevessels requested him to be a spectator on the bank of the river of an attempt intended to be made on that night to burn the ships attended by genesis clinton and several other officers they waited on the bank until about midnight but no attempt on the ships was made and they returned disappointed    th  our general was again requested to be a spectator on the bank of the river the approaching night with the most positive assurances that he should not be again disappointed he accordingly went attended as on the preceding time and took a proper position on the bank the night was pretty dark they soon found that the galleys and firevessels were silently moving up with the tide after some time and almost immediately after the sentinels on board the british ships had passed the word all is well two of the firevessels flashed into a blaze the one close on the side of the phoenix the other grappling one of the tenders to appearance the flames were against the side of the phoenix and there was much confusion on board a number of cannon were discharged into the firevessel in order to sink her a number of seamen ascended and got out on the yardarm supposed to clear away some grapplings the firevessel was along side as was judged near ten minutes when the phoenix either cut or slipped her cable let fall her foretopsail wore round and stood up the river being immediately veiled from the spectators by the darkness of the night the tender burnt down to the waters edge and was towed to the shore by the americans out of which was taken one iron sixpounder two threepounders one twopounder ten swivels a caboose some gunbarrels cutlasses grapplings chains etc the rose and the other two tenders remained at their moorings but it was said that one of the tenders was deserted by her crew for a time several of our galleys were said to have been inactive otherwise a very considerable advantage would have been reaped the americans sustained no loss or injury saving one man who in communicating fire to one of the vessels got considerably burnt in the face hands etc    th  the commander in chief having ordered our general to take the command of the troops and posts at the north end of the island and above kingsbridge within which command fell the forts washington and independence and a number of other works he took the command accordingly    th  very early in the morning the wind being pretty fresh and it being very rainy the ships and tenders which were up the river got under sail and ran down keeping as close under the east bank as they could in passing our works they were however briskly cannonaded at fort washington and the works below were several times struck but received no material damage they joined their fleet near statenisland    th  it was made pretty certain that the british were upon the point of making an attack somewhere by an express which our general received from genesis washington at half past   oclock a m of the   d he was pleased to communicate that by intelligence which he had received the enemy had intentions of making attacks on long island up the north river upon bergen point elizabethtown point amboy etc perhaps so many places were mentioned in order to divide the force of and distract the americans on this morning however they landed near gravesend bay on long island about  000 men col hand with his rifle corpse retreating moderately before them and destroying some wheat which would fall into their hands the british advanced as far as flatbush where they halted six american regiments were sent over as a reinforcement genesis sullivan had the command on the island    th  there were some skirmishes on long island but nothing very material    th  a number of the enemys ships fell down toward the narrows it was supposed with intent to land more troops on long island    th  in the morning a brisk cannonade on long island for some time the british had thrown up some works at flatbush from which they fired at the americans    th  early in the morning two ships and a brig came to anchor a little above frog point our general immediately detached col graham with his regiment to prevent their landing to plunder or burn before he arrived several barges full of men landed on new city island and killed a number of cattle two companies of the regiment immediately on their arrival ferried over to the island the enemy carried off one man and    cattle  the remainder of the cattle were secured  on the same day there was a most bloody battle on long island between the americans and the british the british by a long circuitous march in the night of the   th with a part of their army found the left of the americans not so well secured as it ought to have been and they had an opportunity to reach ground which gave them great advantage while it equally exposed the americans in the strong grounds toward flatbush there was here also another circumstance of ground which now proved very disadvantageous to the americans there was a considerable marsh into which a creek ran and on which there was a mill known by the name of mgowens at the mill there was a passway over but unluckily when some of the americans had retreated by this mill for they were soon routed by the british who formed an attack almost in a semicircle it was set on fire this would have been a politic step had all the americans on the other side in that quarter previously passed but those still beyond the creek were now driven to almost desperate circumstances they could not pass at the head of the creek for the british column which made the circuitous movement were in possession of the ground on the left consequently many were here killed or taken prisoners and numbers perished in attempting to get over the creek some of them sticking in the mud those who escaped retreated to the american works the british sustained a considerable loss in killed and wounded and a subaltern and    men were taken prisoners but the american loss was far greater in killed wounded and prisoners among the latter were genesis sullivan and lord sterling several field pieces were also lost at evening the british army encamped in front of the americans  on the morning of the   th there was a skirmish between the americans and british which terminated rather in favor of the former the same night the british began to open works at the distance of about  00 yards from the american works on the left genesis washington wrote to our general to send down to the city all the boats that could be spared from kingsbridge and fort washington intimating that he might possibly find it necessary at night to throw over more troops to long island this order was immediately complied with and the boats sent down while the real intention of their use was fully understood    th  the ships in the east river fell down to hunts point on the same night the americans evacuated long island bringing off their military stores provisions etc some heavy cannon were left in this retreat from the island and which was well conducted an instance of discipline and of true fortitude was exhibited by the american guards and pickets in order that the british should not get knowledge of the withdraw of the americans until their main body had embarked in the boats and pushed off from the shore which was a matter of the highest importance to their safety the guards were ordered to continue at their respective posts with sentinels alert as if nothing extraordinary was taking place until the troops had embarked they were then to come off march briskly to the ferry and embark themselves but somehow or other the guards came off and had got well toward the landingplace when they were ordered to face about march back and reoccupy their former posts which they instantly obeyed and continued at them until called off to cross the ferry whoever has seen troops in a similar situation or duly contemplates the human heart in such trials well know how to appreciate the conduct of these brave men on this occasion    st  in the forenoon the british appeared at newton where they pitched a number of tents governors island was evacuated the preceding night by the americans it was now evident that the next object of the enemy would be to get the city and it was equally so that they would land somewhere on the island without it this night several of the regiments of genesis misslins brigade of our generals division lay on the hills toward new york and genesis clintons brigade on their arms the same evening hands she is magaws broadheads and miless battalions joined our generals division some of these corpse had suffered greatly in the action on long island  september  st  the british appeared to be encamped in several places on long island they had run a ship in between nutten island and red hook   d  they ran a ship past the city up the east river she was several times struck by the shot of a    pounder which was drawn to the rivers bank major crane of the artillery was wounded in the foot by a cannon shot from this ship it was now a question whether to defend the city or evacuate it and occupy the strong grounds above every exertion had been made to render the works both numerous and strong and immense labor and expense had been bestowed on them and it was now determined that the city should be obstinately defended   th  genesis washington came up and dined at our generals quarters the same day a detachment of the artillery with one    pounder three    pounders three   pounders and a howitzer joined the division the enemy were plundering cattle on long island now fully in their possession   th  our general ordered a chain of videtts and sentinels to be formed at morrissania hunts and frogs point etc the british were pressing a great number of teams on long island  their headquarters were at bedford   th  the militia on long island were ordered to muster to raise recruits for the king the general officers of the american army were in council at headquarters in new york the british were now erecting a work nearly opposite to ours at horns hook and the distance not great   th  the british opened their battery against horns hook fort the fire was briskly returned the americans had one man killed and two wounded   th  in the morning there was a brisk cannonade on both sides at horns hook the american artillery was so well plied that the british ceased firing the british were said to be encamped in three divisions one at newton which was headquarters one at flushing and one at jamaica   0th  the british landed a number of troops on montresors island    th  the british continued to cannonade and bombard our fort at horns hook and to land more troops on montresors island    th  the cannonade continued against our fort at horns hook and the british were moving their troops toward the east river this day col wards regiment of connecticut troops removed from burditts ferry and joined our generals division the general officers were in council a former resolution to defend the city was rescinded with three dissentients    th  four british ships one of which was a twodecker ran by the city up the east river the cannonade and bombardment at horns hook continued this evening col chester with five regiments joined our generals division    th  the british sent three or four ships up the north river as far as greenwich the cannon and stores were removing from new york during the night    th  about noon the british landed at keppss bay they met with but small resistance and pushed toward the city of which they took possession in the afternoon they availed themselves of some cannon and stores but their booty was not very great here the americans we are sorry to say did not behave well and here it was as fame has said that genesis washington threw his hat on the ground and exclaimed are these the men with which i am to defend america but several things may have weight here  the wounds received on long island were yet bleeding and the officers if not the men knew that the city was not to be defended maj chapman was killed and brig maj wyllis was taken prisoner a few others were killed wounded and taken prisoners the americans retreated up the island and some few who could not get out of the city that way escaped in boats over to paulus hook across the river the house in the fort at horns hook was set on fire by a shell and burnt down the fort was afterward abandoned    th  a little before noon a smart skirmish happened on the heights west of haarlem plain and south of morriss house between a party of hessian yagers british lightinfantry and highlanders and the american riflemen and some other troops which ended in favor of the latter the troops fought well on both sides and gave great proof of their marksmanship the americans had several officers killed and wounded among the former lieut col knoulton of the connecticut line and capt gleason of nixons massachusetts regiment two excellent officers and maj beech of one of the southern regiments a brave officer was among the latter this skirmish might have brought on a general action for both armies were then within supporting distance of the troops which were engaged  it now became an object of high importance to calculate if possible where the british would make their next attempt and here the general officers were divided in opinion a part of them imagined that the british would first endeavor to make themselves masters of the whole of new york island and that therefore the reduction of fort washington and its dependencies would be their object others supposed that they would make a landing either at morrissania hunts or frogs point which eventually would produce as certain a reduction of the works on the island with very little loss to the british it was therefore determined in council to guard against both and for this purpose  0000 men were to be retained on the island at and near fort washington our generals division was to be augmented to  0000 men and a floating bridge was to be thrown across haarlem creek that these two bodies might communicate with and support each other as circumstances might require and majorgen green was to command the flying camp on the jersey side of the hudson which was to consist of  000 the different arrangements took place accordingly    th  the remains of lieut col knoulton were interred with military honors the same day a troop of militia light horse arrived from connecticut others and many of the militia were on their way to join the army    th  genesis parsonss and scotts brigades and the brigade commanded by col dudley sargent joined our generals division and she is magaws hasletts atlees and broadheads battalions were ordered away the british army encamped between the american army and the city  a picket from our generals division of   0 men constantly mounted by relief at morrissania from which a chain of sentinels within half gunshot of each other were planted from the one side of the shore to the other and near the water passage between morrissania and montresors island which in some places is very narrow the sentinels on the american side were ordered not to presume to fire at those of the british unless the latter began but the british were so fond of beginning that there was frequently a firing between them this having been the case one day and a british officer walking along the bank on the montresors side an american sentinel who had been exchanging some shots with a british sentinel seeing the officer and concluding him to be better game gave him a shot and wounded him he was carried up to the house on the island an officer with a flag soon came down to the creek and called for the american officer of the picket and informed him that if the american sentinels fired any more the commandingofficer on the island would cannonade col morriss house in which the officers of the picket quartered the american officer immediately sent up to our general to know what answer should be returned he was directed to inform the british officer that the american sentinels had always been instructed not to fire on sentinels unless they were first fired upon and then to return the fire that such would be their conduct as to the cannonading of col morriss house they might act their pleasure the firing ceased for some time but a raw scotch sentinel having been planted one day he very soon after discharged his piece at an american sentinel nearest to him which was immediately returned upon which a british officer came down and called to the american officers observing that he thought there was to be no firing between the sentinels he was answered that their own began upon which he replied he shall then pay for it the sentinel was directly after relieved and there was no firing between the sentinels at that place any more and they were so civil to each other on their posts that one day at a part of the creek where it was practicable the british sentinel asked the american who was nearly opposite to him if he could give him a chew of tobacco the latter having in his pocket a piece of a thick twisted roll sent it across the creek to the british sentinel who after taking off his bite sent the remainder back again   0th  the commander in chief maj genesis putnam and some other officers came up to our generals division and rode round the camp which by the return given in on the next day consisted of      but of these there was      sick present and   0  sick absent  on the morning of the   st between one and two oclock the light of a great fire was discovered to the southward which proved to be at new york when a considerable part of the city was consumed    d  two seamen belonging to the la brune a british ship of war which lay near montresors island deserted and came to our generals quarters and informed him upon examination that the british had then but a few men on the island stating the number that the piece of cannon which had been put on the island was taken back again on board the la brune that there were a number of officers at the house in which there was a considerable quantity of baggage deposited etc our general supposed that these troops might be easily taken and having called the general officers of his division together took their opinion who all coincided with him in sentiment he then communicated his intention to the commander in chief who gave it his approbation two hundred and forty men were destined for this enterprise the command was given to lieut col michael jackson of the massachusetts line with majors logan and  whose name cannot be recollected of the new york troops they were to embark on board three flatboats covered by a fourth with a detachment of artillery with a light threepounder in case it should be found necessary in retreating from the island the mode of attack was settled and every circumstance secured to promise success they were to fall down haarlem creek with the ebb the time was so calculated that the young flood was to be so much made at the break of day as to cover the flats at the island sufficiently for the boats to float matters being thus settled our general ordered the two sailors to be brought in he then told them that in consequence of their information an enterprise against the british troops on montresors island was to take place that night that he had ordered them to be kept in safe custody until the next morning when if their declarations respecting the state of the british on the island proved to be true he would give them a passport to the back country whither they wished to go but in case their information was false he would order them hanged immediately as spies that he gave them the opportunity if they had made a wrong statement to him then to correct it they both answered with perfect composure that they would cheerfully submit to the condition major thomas henly was now one of our generals aidsdecamp he importuned that he might go with the detachment he was refused and told that he had no business there that he could exercise no command he grew quite impatient returned again to the generals room and addressed him pray sir consent to my going with the party  let me have the pleasure of introducing the prisoners to you tomorrow all his friends present advised him not to go the general finally consented the troops at the hour assigned embarked our general informed them that he with others would be spectators of the scene from a certain point near haarlem creek notice had been given to the guards and pickets on the york island side not to hail the party as they went down unfortunately the lower sentinel had not been so instructed he was nearly opposite to the point where our general was to be and just at the instant when he arrived had challenged the boats and ordered them to come to the shore from the boats they answered lo we are friends the challenge was repeated the answer was we tell you we are friends  hold your tongue a bounce into the water was heard and instantly maj henly came wading to the shore stepped up to our general catched him by the hand and said sir will it do our general holding him by the hand replied i see nothing to the contrary to which henly concluded by saying then it shall do he waded back to his boat and got in the sentinel called again if you dont come to the shore i tell you i will fire a voice from some one in the boats was pull away the boats went on and the sentinel fired his piece the boats reached the island almost at the moment intended just as the glimmer of the dawn was discoverable the three fieldofficers were in the first boats their intention on the moment of landing was for the two seconds in command to spring the one to the right and the other to the left and lead on the troops from the other two boats which were to land on each side of the first boat the fieldofficers landed and the men from their boat the enemys guard charged them but were instantly driven back the men in the other two boats instead of landing lay upon their oars the british seeing this returned warmly to the charge the americans finding themselves thus deserted returned to their boat but not until lieut col jackson received a musketball in his leg and maj henly as he was getting into the boat one through his heart which put an instant end to his life the boat joined the others and they all returned having in the whole about    killed wounded and missing maj henly deeply regretted had only one of the other boats landed her men the success would have been very probable but the two would have insured an execution of the whole plan in the opinion of all concerned the delinquents in the other boats were arrested and tried by court martial and one of the captains cashiered  on the night of the   d the british got possession of the works at paulus hook the americans had previously taken off all the cannon and stores on the afternoon of the   th the remains of maj henly were interred by the side of lieut col knoulton on new york island with military honors    th  the militia which had come out from the western parts of the state of connecticut were discharged    th  the general officers were in council with a committee of congress sent to make inquiry into the condition of the army and agree upon the necessary augmentation    th  the council set again the same day maj genesis sullivan who had for some time been a prisoner with the british came to headquarters the american prisoners which were taken in canada were sent round by water and landed at bergen point new jersey where they were set at liberty genesis thompson was among them    th  seven recruits for maj rogerss corpse raising for british service were taken going to long island and sent in    th  there was an unusual movement of boats from long island to montresors island and an attack was soon expected   0th  the moving over of boats to montresors island continued the same day a frigate went through hell gate and came to anchor about  0 oclock a m near the la brune at    oclock she came to sail and stood to the eastward just at evening another ship came up and the next morning  october  st was at anchor in the channel between haarlem and bamans or eldridges island   d  the brigadiergenerals of our generals division were in council and several new works were laid out among others a redoubt on the hill above williamss bridge our general in reconnoitring his position accompanied by col hand below the camp of the rifle corpse being apprehensive that the british might land on frogs neck took a view of the causeway between westchester and the point upon the neck which runs between these two is a tidemill and a plank bridge at the mill at the west end of the causeway the side of the american army was at this time a range of cordwood as advantageously situated to cover a party to defend the pass as if constructed for the very purpose after taking a full view our general directed col hand immediately upon his return to his camp to fix upon one of the best subaltern officers and    picked men of his corpse and assign them to this pass as their alarmpost at all times and in case the enemy made a landing on frogs neck to direct this officer immediately to take up the planks of the bridge to have every thing in readiness to set the mill on fire but not to do it unless the fire of the riflemen should appear insufficient to check the advance of the enemy on to the causeway to assign another party to the head of the creek to reinforce both in case the enemy landed and that he should be supported col hand made his arrangements accordingly   th  the brig and tenders in the east river came down and cast anchor near the la brune frigate and the roebuck and phoenix sailed up the north river and joined the other ships which lay at anchor there   th  there were some movements among the british and a party appeared to be very busy at work a little below haarlem the same night the americans left the heights of bergen they were upwards of  000 strong they retreated as far back as burditts ferry   th  orders were given for throwing up a new work on haarlem creek below the wood at morrissania   th  genesis lincoln came to camp he had come from massachusetts with a body of militia this was the first of his joining the main army the same day the british were putting over horses from horns hook to long island and fixing their pontoons   th  early in the morning three ships two of  0 guns and one frigate with two or three tenders stood up the north river they were briskly cannonaded from fort washington and fort constitution they however passed our works and the chevauxdefrise the american galleys small craft and two large ships standing on before them the two ships were ran on shore near phillipss mills and two of the galleys near dobbs ferry the enemy took possession of the two galleys and got them off a boat landed a number of men who plundered a store stove the casks and then set the store on fire and left it the americans soon extinguished the fire  our general ordered col sargent with  00 infantry  0 light horse capt horton of the artillery with two    pounders and capt crafts with a howitzer to march immediately with all possible expedition to dobbs ferry the enemy took a schooner loaded with rum sugar wine etc and sunk a sloop which had on board the machine invented by and under the direction of a mr bushnell intended to blow up the british ships this machine was worked under water it conveyed a magazine of powder which was to be fixed under the keel of a ship then freed from the machine and left with clockwork going which was to produce fire when the machine had got out of the way mr bushnell had great confidence of its success and had made several experiments which seemed to give him countenance but its fate was truly a contrast to its design  our generals division was formed in line with its advance reserve flankguards and artillery all in order of battle when they were moved down over the different grounds which it was supposed might be the scene of action some of this ground was very broken and there were many fences these afforded frequent opportunities for the troops to break off and form for the pioneers to open avenues etc and for the whole to become acquainted with every part of the ground and the best choice of it if suddenly called to action   0th  one of the ships which was ran aground was got off by the americans col sargent returned having left   0 men to watch the motions of the british up the river    th  there was a considerable movement among the british boats below this afternoon genesis washingtons pleasureboat coming down the river with a fresh breeze and a topsail hoisted was supposed by the artillerists at mount washington to be one of the british tenders running down a    pounder was discharged at her which was so exactly pointed as unfortunately to kill three americans who were much lamented the same day several of genesis lincolns regiments arrived two of which were posted on the north river    th  early in the morning  0 or  0 british boats full of men stood up the sound from montresors island long island etc the troops landed at frogs neck and their advance pushed toward the causeway and bridge at westchester mill col hands riflemen took up the planks of the bridge as had been directed and commenced a firing with their rifles the british moved toward the head of the creek but found here also the americans in possession of the pass our general immediately as he had assured col hand he would do ordered col prescott the hero of bunker hill with his regiment and capt lieut bryant of the artillery with a   pounder to reinforce the riflemen at westchester causeway and col graham of the new york line with his regiment and lieut jackson of the artillery with a   pounder to reinforce at the head of the creek all of which was promptly done to the check and disappointment of the enemy the british encamped on the neck the riflemen and yagers kept up a scattering popping at each other across the marsh and the americans on their side and the british on the other threw up a work at the end of the causeway capt bryant now and then when there was an object saluted the british with a fieldpiece  in the afternoon  0 or  0 sail of vessels passed up and came to anchor off frogs point the same evening genesis mdougals brigade joined our generals division    th  the brigade formerly under the command of our general when he was brigadier joined his division the division now became very strong the general officers of the army were this day in council at our generals quarters    th  our general with the generals under his command reconnoitred the enemy at frogs neck afterward the general officers of the army reconnoitred the various grounds the same day maj genesis lee was ordered to the command of the troops above kingsbridge now become the largest part of the american army but genesis washington had desired him not to exercise the command for a day or two until he could make himself acquainted with the post its circumstances and arrangements of duty a great number of sloops boats etc were passing the sound eastward just at dusk  probably conveying ammunition provisions etc to the troops at frogs point    th  five sailors came off from the la brune they informed that there was a large body of the british on frogs point and that an attack might be soon expected the scattering fire across the marsh continued and now and then a man was killed    th  two works were discovered on frogs neck nearly finished the general officers of the army rode to reconnoitre the ground at pells neck etc and it was determined that the position of the american army should be immediately changed the left flank to be extended more northerly to prevent its being turned by the british    th  wadsworths and fellowss brigades came to kingsbridge the british shipping etc continued moving eastward    th  the regiment at westchester causeway had been relieved by another the officer on command there this morning sent up an express to our general informing him that the british were opening an embrasure in their work at the end of the causeway and that he apprehended they intended under a cannonade from this to attempt to pass our general ordered one of his aids to gallop his horse to the officer commanding the brigade near volentines the nearest to westchester and order him to form his brigade instantly arriving himself by the time the brigade was formed he ordered the officer to march with the utmost expedition to the head of the causeway to reinforce the troops there himself moving on with them when the troops had advanced to about half the way between the head of the creek and the post at the head of the causeway another express met him informing him that the whole british army were in motion and seemed to be moving toward the pass at the head of the creek upon this the brigade was ordered to halt the whole to prime and load and the rear regiment to file off by the left and march briskly to reinforce the americans at the pass at the head of the creek at this instant genesis washington came up and having inquired of our general the state of things ordered him to return immediately and have his division formed ready for action and to take such a position as might appear best calculated to oppose the enemy should they attempt to land another body of troops on morrissania which he thought not improbable our general immediately obeyed the order  the wind was now fresh at southwest the british crossed to the other side of frogs neck embarked on board their boats crossed over the cove landed on pells neck and moved briskly upwards three or four of the american regiments advanced toward them and took a good position behind a stone fence when the british had advanced sufficiently near they gave them a pretty close fire which checked them and even obliged them to fall back but being immediately supported they returned vigorously to the charge the action was sharp for a short time but the americans were soon obliged to give way to superior force shepards reads baldwins and glovers regiments had the principal share in this action the americans had between  0 and  0 men killed and wounded among the latter col shepard in the throat not mortally although the ball came well nigh effecting instant death the loss of the british was not known but must have been considerable they advanced almost to new rochelle and halted the american army extended its left  a number of boats went down toward new york it now became necessary immediately to quit the position in the neighborhood of kingsbridge the british being in the rear of the left of our army and it is not a little unaccountable that they did not attempt to stretch themselves across to the hudson which might have been done with great ease they only moved higher up on the other side of the little rivulet brunx which was generally fordable the white plains were fixed upon for the next position of the american army a strong garrison was to be left at fort washington and our general was to leave one of his regiments to garrison fort independence    st  at about   oclock p m our generals division moved from above kingsbridge having besides their light fieldpieces two heavy iron twelvepounders about   oclock in the evening they passed genesis lincolns quarters on volentines hill where the commander in chief was to spend the night our general waited upon him to know if he had any particular commands for him the commander in chief only advised to send forward one of his regiments to occupy the road coming from wards bridge nearly to whose farm the british had now advanced left apprised of his moving they should annoy his right flank which if it had been daylight would have been open to their view but before the column reached this cross road it was learnt that col jonathan brewers regiment of artificers who were pretty strong and well armed were to pass the night at the entrance of the road leading to the bridge before mentioned the division reached chadertons hill to the south of white plains at   oclock in the morning of the   d having marched all night the instant our general ascended the hill he noticed to appearance many flashes resembling the flash of the pan of a musket on the other side of the lot on which he immediately ordered a captain with a party to discover what it was who returned that he could not make discovery of any thing these were indeed the flashes of discharged muskets at some distance the height of ground having decoyed the appearance of the distance lord sterling who was before in this vicinity with his brigade had formed an enterprise against maj rogerss corpse the old indian hunter in the last french war who had now engaged in the british service with his corpse now lay on the outpost of the british army near marroneck the enterprise was conducted with good address and if the americans had known exactly how rogerss corpse lay they would probably have killed or taken the whole as it was    prisoners  0 muskets and some other articles were taken the major conformably to his former general conduct escaped with the rest of his corpse this was a pretty affair and if the writer could recollect the name of the commandingofficer with pride and pleasure he would insert it he belonged to one of the southern lines of the army and the whole of the party were southern troops  the same day our general moved his division and took post on the high strong ground to the north of the courthouse genesis sullivans division reached the plains in the course of the succeeding night in the position of white plains our generals division was on the left of the line on his left was a deep hollow through which ran a small brook which came from a millpond a little above on the east side of this hollow was a very commanding ground which would enfilade the division the top of this high ground was covered with wood to this hill he ordered col malcolm with his regiment of new york troops and lieut fenno of the artillery with a fieldpiece directing them to take post in the skirt of the wood at the south brow of the hill the ground from our generals left to the right descended gradually a very considerable distance and then gradually ascended up to the plain and still on to the right to more commanding ground on this was the american army formed the line running nearly from northeast to southwest there were some strong works thrown up on the plain across the road and still to the right of it chadertons hill was a little advanced of the line and separated from it by the little rivulet brunx a body of the americans were posted on this hill headquarters were on the plain near the cross roads our generals division had only slight works for musketry    d  a cannonade was heard toward the hudson the same evening col tylers huntingtons and throops regiments of general parsonss brigade and of our generals division moved and took post at the head of king street near rye pond genesis lees division had not yet got up to the army    th  at   oclock a m a firing of smallarms was heard to the southward it was a skirmish between  00 men of genesis lees division and   0 hessians   0 of the latter were killed and two taken prisoners the british continued moving up but with great caution their rear scarcely advancing when they came to encamp again much further than where the advance had moved from  they advanced in two columns    th  eight american regiments were ordered to be ready to march in the approaching night genesis putnam was to command them and they were intended to make an attack on the enemys advance if it should appear to be practicable the same morning one    pounder at dobbs ferry drove the british manofwar off that place from her station    th  genesis lees division jointed the army in ascending some of the hills on the road this division encumbered with many wagons was obliged to halt and double the teams in open view of the british and at no considerable distance who did not attempt to disturb them which had they done the loss of the cannon wagons etc could not have been avoided the troops would have bent their march unencumbered toward the hudson but the wagons etc must have been left two or three british soldiers and a hessian were taken prisoners and sent in    th  in the forenoon a heavy cannonade was heard toward fort washington thirteen hessians and two or three british soldiers were sent in on this day from the american camp to the westsouth west there appeared to be a very commanding height worthy of attention the commander in chief ordered the general officers who were off duty to attend him to reconnoitre this ground on this morning when arrived at the ground although very commanding it did not appear so much so as other grounds to the north and almost parallel with the left of the army as it was then formed yonder says majorgen lee pointing to the grounds just mentioned is the ground we ought to occupy let us then go and view it replied the commander in chief when on the way a lighthorseman came up in full gallop his horse almost out of breath and addressed genesis washington  the british are on the camp sir the general observed  gentlemen we have now other business than reconnoitring putting his horse in full gallop for the camp and followed by the other officers when arrived at headquarters the adjutantgeneral read who had remained at camp informed the commander in chief that the guards had been all beat in and the whole american army were now at their respective posts in order of battle the commander in chief turned round to the officers and only said gentlemen you will repair to your respective posts and do the best you can our general on arriving at his own division found them all in the lines and from the height of his post found that the first attack was directed against the americans on chadertons hill the little river brunx which ran between the american right and this hill after running round its north side turned and ran down on the east and southeast the british advanced in two columns at this instant the cannonade was brisk on both sides directed by the british across the hollow and brunx against the americans on the hill and by them returned almost at the same instant the right column composed of british troops preceded by about  0 light horse in full gallop and brandishing their swords appeared on the road leading to the courthouse and now directly in the front of our generals division the light horse leaped the fence of a wheatfield at the foot of the hill on which col malcolms regiment was posted of which the light horse were not aware until a shot from lieut fennos fieldpiece gave them notice by striking in the midst of them and a horseman pitching from his horse they then wheeled short about galloped out of the field as fast as they came in rode behind a little hill in the road and faced about the tops of their caps only being visible to our general where he stood the column came no further up the road but wheeled to the left by platoons as they came up and passing through a bar or gateway directed their head toward the troops on chadertons hill now engaged when the head of the column had got nearly across the lot their front got out of sight nor could the extent of their rear be now discovered the sun shone bright their arms glittered and perhaps troops never were shown to more advantage than these now appeared the whole now halted and for a few minutes the men all sat down in the same order in which they stood no one appearing to move out of his place the cannonade continued brisk across the brunx a part of the left column composed of british and hessians forded the river and marched along under the cover of the hill until they had gained sufficient ground to the left of the americans when by facing to the left their column became a line parallel with the americans when they briskly ascended the hill the first column resumed a quick march as the troops which were advancing to the attack ascended the hill the cannonade on the side of the british ceased as their own men became exposed to their fire if continued the fire of smallarms was now very heavy and without any distinction of sounds this led some american officers who were looking on to observe that the british were worsted as their cannon had ceased firing but a few minutes evinced that the americans were giving way they moved off the hill in a great body neither running nor observing the best order the british ascended the hill very slowly and when arrived at its summit formed and dressed their line without the least attempt to pursue the americans the loss on the side of the americans was inconsiderable that of the british was not then known the british having got possession of this hill it gave them a vast advantage of the american lines almost down to the center    th  the british began to throw up some small works on the hill of which they had got possession the americans were drawing back and a position was to be taken on the high strong grounds before in the rear of a part of the army the left of our generals division was not to move but the remainder of his division and all the other divisions of the army were to fall back and form nearly east and west about this time col lasher who belonged to our generals division and who had been lest with his regiment to garrison fort independence near kingsbridge sent an express who passed the enemy in the night to know what he should do the regiment growing weak and sickly our general applied to the commander in chief to know his pleasure who directed that the colonel should give notice to col magaw who commanded at fort washington that he might take away the cannon stores etc and that col lasher after destroying the barracks huts etc should join the army which he soon effected this day   prisoners were sent in and the americans were now throwing up some strong works on the high grounds   0th  the british remained upon the ground they had taken    st  the british continued as before throwing up a work etc at night the americans evacuated their works on the plain near late headquarters setting fire to several barns and one house which contained forage and some stores that could not be removed  november  st  in the morning the british advanced with a number of fieldpieces to the north of the road near late headquarters a heavy column appearing behind on the hill ready to move forward and commenced a furious cannonade on our generals division which was nobly returned by capt lieut bryant and lieut jackson of the artillery our generals first anxiety was for col malcolms regiment on the hill to the east of the hollow on the left lest the enemy should push a column into the hollow and cut the regiment off from the division he therefore ordered maj keith one of his aids to gallop over and order col malcolm to come off immediately with lieut fennos artillery but upon a more critical view of the ground in the hollow at the head of which there was a heavy stone wall well situated to cover a body of troops to throw a heavy fire directly down it while an oblique fire could be thrown in on both sides he ordered maj pollard his other aid to gallop after keith and countermand the first order and direct the colonel to remain at his post and he should be supported a strong regiment was ordered to the head of the hollow to occupy the wall the cannonade was brisk on both sides through which the two aidsdecamp passed in going and returning at this instant genesis washington rode up to the hill his first question to our general was h is your division he was answered they are all in order have you said the commander in chief any troops on the hill over the hollow he was answered malcolms regiment is there if you do not call them off immediately says the general you may lose them if the enemy push a column up the hollow he was answered that even in that case their retreat should be made safe that a strong regiment was posted at the head of the hollow behind the wall that this regiment with the oblique fire of the division would so check the enemy as to allow malcolm to make a safe retreat the commander in chief concluded by saying take care that you do not lose them the artillery of the division was so well directed as to throw the british artillerymen several times into confusion and finding that they could not here make any impression drew back their pieces the column not advancing the british artillery now made a circuitous movement and came down toward the american right here unknown to them were some    pounders upon the discharge of which they made off with their fieldpieces as fast as their horses could draw them a shot from the american cannon at this place took off the head of a hessian artilleryman they also left one of the artillery horses dead on the field what other loss they sustained was not known of our generals division one man only belonging to col pauldings regiment of new york troops was killed the british made no other attempt on the americans while they remained at white plains the two armies lay looking at each other and within long cannonshot in the night time the british lighted up a vast number of fires the weather growing pretty cold these fires some on the level ground some at the foot of the hills and at all distances to their brows some of which were lofty seemed to the eye to mix with the stars and to be of different magnitudes the american side doubtless exhibited to them a similar appearance on this day our general ordered three redoubts with a line in front to be thrown up on the summit of his post so constructed that the whole of them could make a defense and support each other at the same time if attacked these to the enemy in whose view they fully were must have appeared very formidable although they were designed principally for defense against smallarms and perhaps works were never raised quicker there were the stalks of a large cornfield at the spot the pulling these up in hills took up a large lump of earth with each the roots of the stalks and earth on them placed in the face of the works answered the purpose of sods or facines the tops being placed inwards as the loose earth was thrown upon them became as so many ties to the work which was carried up with a dispatch scarcely conceivable  the british as they say had meditated an attack on the americans which was only prevented by the wetness of the night be this as it may our general had ordered his division at evening rollcall to be at their alarmposts which they every morning manned whilst at this place half an hour sooner than usual he had then no other reason for doing this than the near position of the enemy and the probability that they would soon make an attack but the commander in chief must have made some other discovery for after our general was in bed col carey who was one of the aidsdecamp of genesis washington came to the door of his marque and calling to him informed him that the whole army were to be at their alarmposts the next morning half an hour sooner than usual and that he was to govern himself accordingly our general replied that he had fortunately given such orders to his division at evening rollcall he therefore neither got up himself nor disturbed any other of his division stedman mistakes greatly in his history where in vol i page     he asserts that the americans evacuated their lines on the morning of the first and retired across the croten river to northcastle setting fire in their retreat to all the houses on white plains the americans did not quit their strong position at the back of white plains until the british had retreated toward kingsbridge as far as dobbs ferry and had there encamped as is fully shown in these memoirs    d  the sentinels reported that during the preceding night they heard the rumbling of carriages to the southeastward and it was apprehended that the british were changing their position   th  the british sentinels were withdrawn from their advanced posts it was apprehended that they meant a movement the american army was immediately ordered under arms at   oclock p m the enemy appeared formed on chadertons hill and on several hills to the westward of it several reconnoitring parties who were sent out reported that the enemy were withdrawing about    oclock this night a party of the americans wantonly set fire to the courthouse dr grahams house and several other private houses which stood between the two armies this gave great disgust to the whole american army and drew from the commander in chief the following paragraph in his orders of the  th it is with the utmost astonishment and abhorrence the general is informed that some base and cowardly wretches have last night set fire to the courthouse and other buildings which the enemy left the army may rely upon it that they shall be brought to justice and meet with the punishment they deserve  the british were moving down toward dobbs ferry a detachment from the american army was sent out in the morning to harass their rear but could not come up with them   th  several deserters came in from the enemy they reported that they were removing toward new york the reconnoitring parties discovered them encamped near dobbs ferry they were foraging grain and hay and driving in the cattle two storeships had run up past fort washington   th  the enemy continued encamped at and below dobbs ferry a new disposition of the american army was now to take place the southern troops were to cross over into the jersies genesis lee with his own spencers and sullivans divisions were to remain to secure and bring off the stores and were then to follow into the jersies our general was ordered to march with his division to peeks kill   th  the division moved from near white plains and the same night halted at northcastle   0th  in the afternoon the division reached pecks kill genesis washington arrived at the same place about sunset it was this day learnt that genesis carletons army in canada after pushing the americans in that quarter from post to post until they arrived at ticonderoga just made their appearance before that place and then retired toward quebec    th  the commander in chief directed our general to attend him in taking a view of fort montgomery and the other works up the river lord sterling generals james and george clinton genesis mifflin and others were of the company they went as far up the river as constitution island which is opposite to westpoint the latter of which was not then taken possession of but the glance of the eye at it without going on shore evinced that this post was not to be neglected there was a small work and a blockhouse on constitution island fort montgomery was in considerable forwardness    th  the commander in chief directed our general to ride early in the morning with him to reconnoitre the grounds at the gorge of the highlands and on his return gave him the command of the troops and posts in the highlands on both sides of the river with written instructions to secure and fortify them with all possible expedition making a distribution of his troops to the different posts and at about  0 oclock a m genesis washington crossed over the river into the jersies    th  our general made a disposition of the troops under his command to their several destinations col huntingtons and tylers regiments to the west side of the hudson to sidnums bridge on ramapaugh river to cover the passes into the highlands on that side prescotts wards and wylliss regiments of parsonss brigade as were the other two regiments to the south entrance of the highlands beyond robinsons bridge genesis george clintons brigade to the heights above peeks kill landing genesis scotts brigade with the three regiments of genesis parsonss brigade genesis james clinton with the troops under his command were at the forts up the river the british moved down near to kingsbridge  on the   th the british made their attack on fort washington genesis knyphausen with a heavy column of hessians advanced by kingsbridge they were discovered by the americans from the high grounds north of fort washington as the day broke and cannonaded from the fieldpieces placed at this advanced post the hessian column divided into two the right ascending the strong broken ground toward spittendevil creek the left nearer to the road toward the gorge the first obtained the ground without much difficulty but the americans made a most noble opposition against the latter and for a considerable time kept them from ascending the hill making a terrible slaughter among them but the great superiority of the assailants with an unabating firmness finally prevailed their loss was greater here than at any other place meanwhile the british crossed haarlem creek in two different places charged and finally routed the americans on that side and possessed themselves of the strong post of laurel hill on the other side of the road from fort washington and not very distant from it lord percy at the same time advancing with the troops under his command on the island toward the fort on that side the americans now generally driven from their outworks retired to the fort which was crowded full a single shell now dropping among them must have made dreadful havoc  genesis washington was now a spectator of this distressing scene from the high bank at fort lee on the opposite side of the hudson and having a wish to communicate something to col magaw the commanding officer at fort washington capt gooch of boston a brave and daring man offered to be the bearer of it he ran down to the river jumped into a small boat pushed over the river landed under the bank ran up to the fort and delivered the message  came out ran and jumped over the broken ground dodging the hessians some of whom struck at him with their pieces and others attempted to thrust him with their bayonets  escaping through them he got to his boat and returned to fort lee the british had summoned col magaw to surrender and were preparing their batteries to play on the fort when col magaw thought it best to surrender the post which he did accordingly between two and three thousand men becoming prisoners the loss in killed and wounded on the american side was inconsiderable but the loss in prisoners was a serious blow indeed the prisoners were marched to new york where being crowded in prisons and sugarhouses many of them being militia from the jersey flyingcamp who had been sent over to reinforce the garrison and were unused to a soldiers life much less to the poisonous stagnant air of a crowded prison they fell sick and daily died in a most shocking manner it was common on a morning for the carmen to come and take away the bodies for burial by loads  o ye officers of the provost to whatever nation or people you belong when the unfortunate of your fellowmen are thus committed to your charge clothe yourselves with humanity and soothe distress as far as in your power for by this you will secure a better reward than your present wages and you who have the honor to command armies when your victories have filled provosts and prisons think it not beneath you to visit the prisons that with your own eyes you may see the state of your prisoners for such visits the great captain of your salvation has said shall be considered as made to himself while it also gives you a name among men closely allied to that of the conqueror the truly brave are always humane  elated with the easy reduction of fort washington the british determined to cross into the jersies and attack genesis washington on that side  on the   th lord cornwallis with a strong body of the british forces landed at closter landing on the jersey side above fort lee the garrison of which were obliged to leave that post and some cannon stores and provisions which could not be removed fell into the hands of the enemy   0th  just at evening an express which our general had sent down to genesis washington before he had any knowledge of what had happened returned with a most alarming account of what he had seen with his own eyes viz that the americans were rapidly retreating and the british as rapidly pursuing the adjutantgeneral read wished to write to genesis lee but he had neither pen ink or paper with him the lighthorseman had a rough piece of wrappingpaper in his pocket and the adjutantgeneral had an old pencil bringing these two together he wrote to genesis lee  dear general we are flying before the british i pray  and the pencil broke he then told the lighthorseman to carry the paper to genesis lee and tell him that he was verbally ordered to add after i pray you to push and join us the lighthorseman when he arrived at our generals was both fatigued and wet he requested that one of his brother horsemen might proceed to genesis lee but he was told that no other could discharge the duty enjoined on him by the adjutantgeneral and that genesis lee might wish to make many inquiries of him he was therefore refreshed and pushed on genesis lee instead of moving his division or any part of it wrote our general by the returning express the following letter  camp nov   st      dear general i have just received a recommendation not a positive order from the general to move the corpse under my command to the other side of the river this recommendation was i imagine on the presumption that i had already moved nearer to peeks kill there is no possibility of crossing over dobbs ferry or at any place lower than kings ferry which to us would be such an immense round that we could never answer any purpose i must therefore desire and request that you will order  000 of your corpse under a brigadiergeneral to cross the river opposite the general and wait his further orders as soon as we have finished a necessary job i will replace this number from hence which job will i believe be finished tomorrow  i am dear general yours signed charles lee  genesis heath  upon receiving this letter from genesis lee for our general did not receive the least hint from genesis washington to move any part of the troops under his command by the express who brought the order to lee he took up his instructions from genesis washington to see if he might dare to make any detachment upon which he wrote genesis lee the following answer to his letter  peeks kill nov   st       0 oclock at night dear general i am now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of this date the former of which i had answered early in the evening with respect to the latter upon having recourse to my instructions i find they are such as not to admit of moving any part of the troops from the posts assigned to me unless it be by express orders from his excellency or to support you in case you are attacked my instructions among other things are as follow your division with such troops as are now at forts montgomery independence and constitution are to be under your command and remain in this quarter for the security of the above posts and the passes through the highlands from this place and the one on the west side of hudsons river unnecessary it is for me to say any thing to evince the importance of securing the land and water communication through these passes or to prove the indispensable necessity of using every exertion in your power to have such works erected for the defense of them as your own judgment assisted by that of your brigadiers and engineer may show the expediency of you will not only keep in view the importance of securing these passes but the necessity of doing it without delay not only from the probability of the enemys attempting to seize them but from the advanced season which will not admit of any spadework after the frost which may daily be expected sets in  lose not a moment therefore in choosing the grounds on the east and west side of the river on which your intended works are to be erected let your men designed for each post be speedily allotted  etc   after instructions so positive and pressing you will readily agree that it would be very improper in me to order any of the troops from posts to which they are so expressly assigned and from business which in his excellencys view is so very important add to this their present disposition is such that to collect any thing near the number you mention would occasion as great delay and cause many of them to march nearly as far as if sent immediately from your quarter  i am dear general with esteem yours respectfully signed w heath  genesis lee  this did not seem to satisfy genesis lee who wrote our general the following  camp nov   d      sir by your mode of reasoning the generals instructions are so binding that not a tittle must be broke through for the salvation of the general and the army i have ordered glovers brigade to march up toward peeks kill to put the passage of the highlands out of danger but i intend to take  000 from your division with me into the jersies so i must desire that you will have that number in readiness by the day after tomorrow when i shall be with you early in the forenoon  and am sir your most obedient servant signed charles lee  maj genesis heath  to which our general returned the following answer  peeks kill nov   th      sir be my mode of reasoning as it may i conceive it to be my duty to obey my instructions especially those which are positive and poignant and that to deviate from them even in extreme cases would be an error though perhaps an error on the right side  i can assure you sir that i have the salvation of the general and army so much at heart that the least recommendation from him to march my division or any part of them over the river should have been instantly obeyed without waiting for a positive order  my conduct must be approved or censured as i adhere to or depart from my orders and as it is my duty i shall strictly abide by them until they are countermanded in such manner as will justify a deviation from them to him who instructed me and to the world  i shall be happy in being honored with your company tomorrow  and am with respect and esteem your obedient humble servant signed w heath  genesis lee  after the foregoing was sent off our general reflected for a moment that as circumstances alter cases genesis washington being now pressed and the army with him but feeble he might possibly wish for some aid from his division he therefore sat down and wrote him a short letter stating in what manner he had disposed of the troops under his command and wishing to know his pleasure whether any part of them should join him enclosing copies of the letters he had received from genesis lee and of his answers the express was directed to make the utmost dispatch out and returning which he effected on the   th several days before genesis lee got up to peeks kill bringing with him the following letter from secretary harrison  newark nov   th      dear general i am directed by his excellency to acknowledge his receipt of your letter of yesterday and to inform you the disposition of the troops mentioned in your former letter has his approbation  in respect to the troops intended to come to this quarter his excellency never meant that they should be from your division he has wrote genesis lee since so fully and explicitly upon the subject that any misapprehensions he may have been under at first must be now done away he will most probably have reached peeks kill before now with his division and be pushing to join us no new event has taken place  i am sir very respectfully your most obedient servant signed r h harrison  maj genesis heath    st  a heavy cannonade was heard toward amboy    d  col tupper who was down near tappan got up to kings ferry he brought off the two    pounders which were at dobbs ferry and a quantity of provisions the same evening our general ordered the washington galley to take station at kings ferry    th  our general gave orders for clintons and scotts brigades to hold themselves in readiness to march to the jersey side    th  scotts brigade was ordered over to haverstraw and col tylers regiment then at ramapaugh river to march down to tappan to secure and bring off the provisions which were at that place    th  capt treadwell of the artillery with a threepounder was ordered to move over the river and join genesis scotts brigade it was learnt that many of the inhabitants of new jersey especially in the neighborhood of hackensack were swearing allegiance to king george taking letters of protection etc    th  mr livingston came from congress to advise with our general on measures to obstruct the river the same day capt harrod brought off from tappan a considerable quantity of pearlash beeswax oil etc    th  two of the regiments of genesis clintons brigade were ordered to move to fort constitution in order to attempt the forming of obstructions in the river near polipins island   0th  just before dinner genesis sullivan arrived at our generals quarters and in the afternoon genesis lee arrived he called at the door when our general waiting upon him requested him to alight he asked if he could have a cup of tea and was answered that he should have a good one upon coming into the house before he sat down he wished to speak in private which being instantly granted he told our general that in a military view or to use his own words exactly in point of law you are right but in point of policy i think you are wrong i am going into the jersies for the salvation of america i wish to take with me a larger force than i now have and request you to order  000 of your men to march with me our general answered that he could not spare that number he was then asked to order  000 to which he replied that the business might be as well brought to a point at once  that not a single man should march from the post by his order genesis lee replied that he would then order them himself he was answered that there was a wide difference between the two that genesis lee was acknowledged by our general to be his senior but as he had received positive written instructions from him who was superior to both he would not himself break those orders if genesis lee was disposed to counteract them its being done by him could not be imputed to any other person and that he knew the commander in chief did not intend any of the troops should be removed from that post  having expressed it not only in his instructions but also in a letter just received from him on the letter being shown to genesis lee he observed the commander in chief is now at a distance and does not know what is necessary here so well as i do  asked if he might be favored with the returnbook of the division major huntington the deputy adjutantgeneral was directed to hand it genesis lee ran his eye over it and said i will take prescotts and wylliss regiments  and turning to major huntington said you will order those two regiments to march early tomorrow morning to join me our general turning to the major said issue such orders at your peril and then turning to genesis lee addressed him sir if you come to this post and mean to issue orders here which will break those positive ones which i have received i pray you to do it completely yourself and through your own deputy adjutantgeneral who is present and not draw me or any of my family in as partners in the guilt genesis lee replied it is right col scammel do you issue the order which he did and huntington communicated it to the regiments who were now posted at the gorge of the mountains near robinsons bridge afterward called the continental village matters carried thus far our general turned to genesis lee again sir i have one more request to make and that is that you will be pleased to give me a certificate that you exercise command at this post and do order from it prescotts and wylliss regiments lee replied i do not know that i will comply with your request genesis clinton who was present observed genesis lee you cannot refuse a request so reasonable upon which genesis lee wrote as follows  peeks kill dec  st      for the satisfaction of genesis heath and at his request i do certify that i am commanding officer at this present writing in this post and that i have in that capacity ordered prescotts and wylliss regiments to march  signed charles lee maj genesis   genesis lee stepping out on the piazza observed to an officer genesis heath is right early the next morning the regiments moved from their cantonment toward peeks kill but before they had reached it genesis lee now ready to pass into the jersies rode up to our generals door and calling him observed upon further consideration i have concluded not to take the two regiments with me  you may order them to return to their former post this conduct of genesis lees appeared not a little extraordinary and one is almost at a loss to account for it he had been a soldier from his youth had a perfect knowledge of service in all its branches but was rather obstinate in his temper and could scarcely brook being crossed in any thing in the line of his profession genesis lee took with him into the jersies some as good troops as any in the service but many of them were so destitute of shoes that the blood left on the rugged frozen ground in many places marked the route they had taken and a considerable number unable to march were left at peeks kill the time of service for which genesis scotts brigade was engaged to serve expired when the whole except about  0 went home notwithstanding the generous encouragement offered them by their state new york if they would continue one month longer   d and  d  genesis lees troops were passing the ferry genesis carleton having returned into canada a number of genesis gatess regiments were now moving to reinforce genesis washington  their van as far as morristown  the enemy as far as brunswick   th  intelligence was received that on the  th about sunset  0 sail of ships of war and transports passed in the sound toward new england our general immediately sent off expresses to genesis washington gov trumbull mr bowdoin at boston the convention of new york etc   th  three regiments viz greatons bonds and porters arrived off the landing from albany on their way to genesis washington matters now looked serious in jersey the british were extending themselves in all directions and the inhabitants obliged to become passive if not worse genesis gates had ordered the troops moving from the northward to rendezvous at goshen   th  our general wrote genesis lee that the troops were moving on from the northward and as genesis gates had not yet overtaken them some of the commandingofficers appeared to wish for orders how to proceed genesis washington it was said was as far as trenton  lee the preceding night as far as pompton a flag schooner came up from new york to obtain leave for some families to go in a parson inglish was on board orders were given to treat the flag with politeness and at the same time with proper precaution and the business was laid before the convention of the state  the same day genesis clinton with two british and two hessian brigades with a squadron of ships under the command of sir peter parker took possession of rhode island without the loss of a man the americans quitting the island without making any opposition rhode island was a great acquisition to the british for quarters forage and a safe harbor but lessened their ability for other more important operations in the field  on the evening of the  th our general received orders from the commander in chief to move over the hudson with parsonss brigade and to move on so as to give protection to the country and vigor to the cause in jersey   0th  a little after noon parsonss brigade marched down to kings ferry the greatest alertness having been discovered by both officers and men on the occasion    th  about eleven oclock a m our general left peeks kill and proceeded for the jersies on crossing kings ferry gave orders for the flag to be detained from returning until further orders the troops crossed the ferry and marched as far as col hays at haverstraw huntingtons and tylers regiments were ordered to advance from ramapaugh bridge to paramus our general received a letter from genesis lee in answer to the one he wrote on the  th from peeks kill as follows  chatham dec  th      dear general i am very much obliged to you for your welcome tidings and have only to beg that you will direct the regiments you speak of to march without loss of time to morristown i sent an express to you last night from the general ordering your division over the river which i confess for my own part i am heartily sorry for as i think we shall be strong enough without you and new england with your district will be too bare of troops i am in hopes here to reconquer if i may so express myself the jersies it was really in the hands of the enemy before my arrival  adieu dear sir signed charles lee  maj genesis heath  the foregoing letter appears very different from the former ones    th  early in the morning the troops took up their line of march from haverstraw and before sunset reached tappan    th  sent out a reconnoitring party toward hackensack to get intelligence etc this day genesis lee was taken prisoner near chatham by a party of light horse commanded by col harcourt lee took quarters at a small distance from his troops an inhabitant gave notice of it to col harcourt who was out reconnoitring near that neighborhood and who had the address to take and carry him off    th  our general held up every appearance of moving to paramus and sent off his baggage under escort to that place and between    and    oclock marched briskly for hackensack having sent orders for huntingtons and tylers regiments to move from paramus at the same time buskirks regiment was at hackensack bridge the preceding day where they did duty and it was expected they were still at the same place to surprise and take them was the object but it was found that buskirks men had moved the preceding day to bergen in order to draw new arms the town was completely surprised not having an idea that any but british troops were near them one british soldier and  0 or  0 of their adherents were taken a number of arms etc and at the wharf several vessels loaded with hay etc on the point of sailing for new york a brig had come to sail in the morning and run some distance down the river and came to anchor an officer with a party was sent down to take her and bring her up but the wind was so strong ahead that it could not be effected the officer was then directed to destroy the vessel as she had a large quantity of forage on board destined for new york but it was said there were some valuable articles on board which might be taken out and brought up in the boats the orders were varied accordingly with directions that in case the enemy advanced before the business was completed to set the brig on fire the boats brought up one load but on returning to the brig they discovered a body of the enemy advancing when the brig was abandoned without being set on fire the enemy immediately took possession of her among the articles taken out was a large chest of plate this was conveyed to peeks kill and delivered to the deputy quartermastergeneral and when the british afterward destroyed the public stores at that place the chest of plate was removed by the quartermaster into connecticut where afterward genesis parsons in behalf of the officers and soldiers of the division filed a libel in the maritime court and the officer who boarded the vessel filed one in his own behalf on trial the court adjudged the plate to the latter although he boarded the vessel in obedience to express orders about  00 barrels of flour which had been abandoned by the americans when they retreated before lord cornwallis were recovered and sent off and about  00 arms were also secured with a quantity of rum gin etc in the evening as two or three american officers were walking along the street a gentleman who was an inhabitant came up to them and expressed his joy on the arrival of the troops supposing they were british the officers immediately conducted him to our general and on entering the room informed him that they came to introduce a friend who had joined them in the street and who was able to give some important information our general expressed a high satisfaction and wished to know what information he could give he replied that he heard there was a large body of rebels collecting up above them he was asked if in case these rebels should advance any assistance could be afforded by the people of the town and whether they could be depended on he answered there were a considerable number and that they might be depended on he was asked whether there was not a number in the town who were in favor of the rebels he answered that there was but that they had seized and sent off the principal ones among them and that now the others dared not show themselves the joke was thus going on when col prescott who stood near him holding his hat in his hand in which there was a red cockade at that time a mark of the distinction of rank the gentleman fixed his eye upon it and his countenance immediately fell he was then told that those whom he termed rebels were now in possession of the place and had now received his information he was ordered into custody    th  all the wagons in the vicinity were collected and the flour and other stores moved off to paramus reconnoitring parties were sent out to a distance to observe the motions of the enemy    th  the effects were generally removed and about noon the reconnoitring parties reported that the enemy were advancing on both sides of the place they were soon after discovered by the guard at acquackanuck bridge a little before sunset the troops left the town a strong rearguard was ordered to remain on the high ground back of the town until after dark to light up a number of fires and then to move on after the troops just before the division left the town genesis george clinton attended by some light horse joined the division    th  reconnoitring parties were sent out on all the roads    th  intelligence was received that some of the jersey militia had had a skirmish with a body of british troops under genesis leslie near springfield both parties retired of the militia several were killed and wounded  the convention of new york greatly alarmed at the removal of our general with the continental troops from the important passes of the highlands sent a request to genesis washington desiring that they might be ordered back again to insure dispatch they offered the express extra pay the commander in chief was pleased to grant their request and ordered our general to return to peeks kill and reoccupy his former positions  our general having received certain information that buskirks regiment was at or near bergen woods it was determined to strike them for this purpose on the evening of the   th about   oclock genesis parsons with   0 continental troops and genesis clinton with a like number of the militia of new york marched from paramus church and a covering party of  00 men was ordered to tappan  about   oclock the next morning the detachment reached bergen and completely surprised the enemys guard making    men prisoners the regiment was alarmed and a pretty brisk skirmish ensued the enemy were collecting and it was judged best for the detachment to come off having been so far victorious   0th  about   oclock p m the detachment returned to paramus having in the short interval of time marched out and returning upwards of  0 miles they brought back with them besides their prisoners    new firelocks   horses and one wagon having sustained the loss of one man the enemy were supposed to have had several killed    st  orders were given for the troops to be ready to march early the next morning the gentleman who was taken into custody at hackensack chagrined almost to death had been spending his time like april in weeping and lowering and much intercession having been made for his release our general told him that in case he would faithfully perform a piece of secret service allotted to him he should be released this he performed with punctuality and consequently was set at liberty    d  the troops marched from paramus round by the side of kakaat to clarkstown which they reached about sunset    d  the troops took up their line of march crossed the hudson and arrived at peeks kill    th  gave permission for the flag to return to new york having on board the families of mr inglish moore etc    th  it was learnt

retired to the other side of the mill creek and as soon as it was dark ordering a great number of fires to be lighted up to deceive the enemy stole a march and at   oclock next morning attacked three regiments of the enemy who were posted at princetown routed them driving them from two small redoubts the enemy lost in killed wounded and taken prisoners about  00 the american loss was inconsiderable except in the brave genesis mercer of virginia who fell in this action greatly regretted in this maneuver and action genesis washington exhibited the most consummate generalship and the british were struck with consternation ambuscade surprise and stratagem are said to constitute the sublime part of the art of war and that he who possesses the greatest resource in these will eventually pluck the laurel from the brow of his opponent the stratagems of war are almost infinite but all have the same object namely to deceive  to hold up an appearance of something which is not intended while under this mask some important object is secured and be a general never so brave if he be unskilled in the arts and stratagems of war he is really to be pitied for his bravery will but serve to lead him into those wily snares which are laid for him   d  thirtyseven recruits going to rogers taken the preceding night were brought in and our general ordered out capt graham at    oclock at night to intercept another gang   th  genesis lincoln arrived from massachusetts he had come on with a body of militia   th  it was learnt that on the  st inst genesis putnam took a large quantity

loss of between  0 and  0 killed and upwards of  00 taken prisoners together with   pieces of cannon and all their baggage the americans had   men killed the same day col sparhawks regiment of militia from massachusetts with two fieldpieces marched for kings ferry on their way to the jersies   th  our general received the following letter from genesis washington  pluckemin jan  th      sir we have made a successful attack upon princeton general how advanced upon trenton we evacuated the town and lay at the other side of the mill creek until dark then stole a march and attacked princeton about   oclock in the morning there were three regiments quartered there the killed wounded and prisoners taken amounted to about  00 the enemy are in great consternation and as the present affords us a favorable opportunity to drive them out of the jersies it has been determined in council that you should move down toward new york with a considerable force as if you had a design upon the city that being an object of great importance the enemy will be reduced to the necessity of withdrawing a considerable part of their force from the jersies if not the whole to secure the city i shall draw the force on this side the north river together at morristown where i shall watch the motions of the enemy and avail myself of every circumstance you will retain  000 of the militia coming on from the new england governments for the expedition you will act with great precaution but avail yourself of every favorable opportunity of attacking the enemy when you can do it to advantage  genesis lincoln must cross the north river and come on with the remainder of the militia to morristown leave a sufficient guard at the highlands  you will also have as many boats collected together or in such a manner as you may always avail yourself of them if it should be found expedient for your troops or any part of them to cross the north river at dobbs ferry or any other of the landings  i am etc signed geo washington  genesis heath  preparations for the before mentioned movement were immediately put in train the militia and volunteers were coming in   th  genesis parsons went down to king street   th

the southward and reached northcastle just before sunset where he found part of four regiments had arrived and genesis scotts militia of new york had moved down to wrights mills    th  our general moved to king street to mr claps  about  000 militia had arrived and genesis lincolns division marched to tarrytown on this day the commander in chief in another letter had intimated that genesis lincoln instead of moving on to join him should stay on the east side of the hudson and join in the expedition    th  the connecticut volunteers marched from king street to new rochelle and genesis scotts brigade to stephen wards plenty of provisions were arriving a deserter came in from the enemy and gave an account of their situation and numbers    th  at night the three divisions began to move toward kingsbridge gen lincolns from tarrytown on the albany road generals wooster and parsonss from new rochelle and eastchester and genesis scotts in the center from below white plains the several distances and rate of marching were so we calculated that on the   th just before sunrise the three divisions although so far apart arrived at the outposts of the enemy almost at the same instant genesis lincolns on the heights above col van cortlands woosters at williamss and scotts on the back of volentines our general who moved with the center division knew that volentines house was the quarters of one of the guards he did not know but it might be defended as he approached it he ordered capt lieut bryant to advance a fieldpiece to the advanceguard and if there was any opposition from the house to cannonade it immediately he then ordered   0 men from the head of the column as it was moving on to incline to the right and by a double step to push into the hollow between the house and the fort to cut off the guard who were at the house in case they should run toward the latter at this instant two lighthorsemen who had been sent out by the enemy as the day broke to reconnoitre the vicinity came unexpectedly at the descent of a hill plump upon the head of woosters column they attempted to turn about but before it could be fully effected a fieldpiece was discharged at them one of them was pitched from his horse and taken prisoner the other galloped back to the fort holloing as he passed the rebels the rebels this set all the outguards and pickets running to the fort leaving in some places their arms blankets tools provisions etc behind them those who fled from volentines and the negro fort were fired at as they ran but none were killed one who could not run so fast as the rest was taken prisoner ten muskets were taken at volentines house the guard above van cortlands was as completely surprised as the others where genesis lincoln took about  0 arms some blankets etc etc the left and center divisions moved into the hollow between volentines house and the fort from whence our general immediately sent a summons to the commandingofficer of the fort to surrender the commandant of the fort and a considerable part of the garrison being hessians the summons held out to these generous terms the answer which was verbal was a refusal to surrender a detachment with two fieldpieces was ordered to move to the south of the fort to a hill above haarlem creek not far from the new bridge when the detachment arrived at this place a battalion of hessians appeared drawn up on the side of the hill just within kingsbridge and back of hyatts tavern our general ordered the artillery to cannonade them immediately the first shot just cleared the right of the battalion nearly a platoon settling down as the shot passed them which entered the bank close behind them the second shot passed about the center of the battalion when to the amount of a grand division settled down which was an evidence that they would not stand much longer one of the pieces was ordered to be drawn lower down the hill on which the battalion quitted their ground and marched off as fast as they could without running to get behind the redoubt and hill at the bridge receiving one shot more as they were turning round the point it was not suspected that the enemy had any cannon in the redoubt within the bridge but they now began to cannonade the artillerymen who had descended the hill who had to draw up their piece as fast as possible which they effected without any loss but received three or four shot quite among them before they could reach the top of the hill  this success at the outposts flew through the country and was soon magnified to a reduction of the fort and capture of the garrison it reached genesis washington long before the official account and he had communicated the report to congress hence a double disappointment when the true state of facts was received    th  the enemy cannonaded from the fort and killed one american as the guards were relieving at the negro fort it was determined to make an attempt to cut off the battalion within kingsbridge early the next morning by passing a strong detachment over spittendevil creek on the ice which however was not now very strong but the weather was cold one thousand were detached for the purpose but the weather having grown warm in the night the ice was judged by the unanimous opinion of all the general officers on the ground to be too hazardous on the morning of the  0th to venture the attempt on this day there was a cannonade on both sides and the enemy on the island side were thrown into much confusion our general observing that when the enemy within the island were cannonaded across haarlem creek they sheltered themselves behind the little hill near the bridge next to spittendevil creek on this afternoon he rode round on to tippits hill which was in its rear and found that a fieldpiece drawn up on that side would leave the enemy no hiding place    st  a cannonade on both sides in the afternoon a fieldpiece was hauled up to tippits hill and the enemy were cannonaded both in front and rear they were thrown into the utmost confusion some secured themselves in their redoubt others under the banks some lay flat on the ground and some betook themselves to the cellars so that in a short time there was no object for the gunners the weather had now grown very moderate    d  there was a pretty smart skirmish with the enemy near the fort this day our general ordered a number of chandeliers fascines etc to be made and having nothing but light fieldpieces with him in order to keep up an appearance of a serious design on the fort he sent to northcastle where was a field brass   pounder and some howitzers to bring forward the former and one of the latter    d  a smart skirmish took place just before dusk in the broken ground near the south side of the fort an ensign and one man belonging to the new york militia were killed and five wounded the loss of the enemy unknown as it was close under the fort    th  excessive stormy genesis lincolns division who were in huts in the woods back of col van cortlands were obliged to quit their ground and move back into houses where they could find them some of them as far as dobbs ferry with the loss of a great many cartridges from the badness of the boxes the fall of rain was so great as to cause a great fresh in the brunx the water running over the bridge by williamss    th  early in the morning the enemy made a sally toward delaneys mills where they surprised and routed the guard wounding several but not killing or taking any of them and a regiment near that place quitted their quarters emboldened by this success about  0 oclock a m they made a powerful sally toward volentines instantly driving the guards and pickets from the negro fort and volentines house pushing on with great impetuosity keeping up a brisk fire the balls passing at williamss house sufficiently strong to do execution the retreating guards threw themselves into the old redoubt on the north side of the road to the west of the bridge on which the enemy immediately lined a strong stone wall a few rods distant to the southwest two regiments of the militia being at this instant formed in the road near williamss and the horses in the limbers of the fieldpieces our general ordered capt bryant to ford over the bridge with his piece and the militia to follow and cover the artillery when capt bryant had ascended almost to the top of the hill to prevent his horses being shot he unlimbered and the men took the dragropes but the ascent of the hill was such that they were obliged to drag the piece almost within pistoshot before the ground would admit the plece to be so depressed as to bear on the enemy the moment this was effected a round shot opened a breach in the wall four or five feet wide a second shot in less than a minute opened another when the enemy sled back to the fort with the greatest precipitation of the americans two were killed and a number wounded    th  the brass   pounder and howitzer were brought up and ordered to open upon the fort on the third discharge of the former she sprang her carriage nor were there any live shells for the howitzer there being none at northcastle nor was a regular cannonade or bombardment of the fort ever contemplated every attempt was now made by feint and otherwise to draw the enemy out of the fort a detachment was sent down to morrisania to light up a great number of fires in the night to induce the enemy to suppose that a body of americans were collecting at that place with a design to cross on to new york island at or near haarlem and to heighten this several large boats were sent for and brought forward on carriages the british guard on montresors island were so much alarmed at this as to set the buildings on fire and flee to new york a brigade of the british were said to have moved toward fort washington and orders had been sent to rhode island for a detachment to be sent from thence    th  there was the appearance of a severe snowstorm coming on when all the general officers on the ground viz besides our general lincoln wooster scott and ten broeck were unanimously of opinion that the troops ought to move back before the storm came on to places where they could be covered from the inclemency of the weather as there was no artillery to batter the fort and from first to last they were unanimously opposed to any idea of an assault or storm of the sort with the militia and the principal object being now to secure and bring off or destroy the forage which could be as well done where the troops could have covering as to harass them in the open fields by multiplying guards or their being constantly exposed in the scattered houses to be surprised and cut off for these several reasons the troops were ordered as soon as it grew dark to move back genesis lincolns division to dobbs ferry and tarrytown genesis woosters to new rochelle and genesis scotts to white plains the guards to remain at their posts and alert until the troops were all moved off and then to form rear guards on the several roads following the troops to whom they respectively belonged all of which was performed in good order in a very heavy fall of snow   0th  the storm cleared up when    ships   brig   schooners and   sloops came too between heart and city islands they were from the eastward and were supposed to have troops on board the troops on this expedition as it was called were in a very hazardous situation and had continued in it from the morning of the   th to the evening of the   th they were entirely a body of militia except a few artillerymen so apprehensive of this being a critical situation was the commander in chief in the year    0 when genesis sir henry clinton menaced the french army at rhode island and had embarked his troops on board transports for the purpose of proceeding to that place and genesis washington had determined to move down toward kingsbridge to induce sir henry to give up his design by menacing new york our general being then at rhode island with the french army genesis washington wrote him on the   st of july from robinsons house in the highlands  among other things you know the critical situation in which this army will be in a position below this was undoubtedly a very just observation but if the commander in chief with the whole american army in    0 well armed and highly disciplined should so justly judge at the distance of  0 miles from the spot what shall we say of those brave militia men who continued in the position itself for more than ten days in the midst of winter  whenever an enterprise is to be attempted in the teeth of an enemy it should be a dash and away    st  a cordon of troops was ordered to be formed to extend from dobbs ferry to maroneck  february  st  foraging being now the object a large number of teams were sent out toward maroneck and upwards of  0 loads of forage were brought off twelve more ships   of which were of  0

orders from genesis washington for him to take the command of the eastern department genesis ward having applied for leave to resign the command meaning to retire from the service he therefore turned back and rode into boston  this year      formed an important era in the annals of america congress had determined to make great exertions to drive the british troops from america for this purpose they had ordered    battalions to be raised in the united states    of which fell to the share of massachusetts besides the foregoing    battalions they also ordered the raising of    others called the additional battalions and of these three were raising in massachusetts viz jacksons lees and henleys besides armands legion artificers etc the arming equipping and sending on the recruits  furnishing the recruiting officers with bounty moneys  and the forwarding on immense quantities of all kinds of military stores for massachusetts might now be called the great magazine of military stores of the union partly on account of her own resources managed by the indefatigable industry of her board of war  and the arrivals of public stores here and at portsmouth called for the utmost

intimating that on the morning of the  st inst the enemys fleet which lay at amboy sailed down round that town and that the troops who lay encamped opposite to the town struck their tents and marched off the enemy were also advancing on the lake with their fleet toward ticonderoga a detachment of soldiers for col m jacksons regiment marched for the northern army   th  capt cluston arrived from france with powder arms etc for the state he had also made a successful cruize    th  intelligence was received that the americans evacuated ticonderoga on the  th at night a great many stores etc were lost the british no sooner arrived before ticonderoga than they were discovered on mount hope this steep and rugged hill was thought to be inaccessible by the americans at least with artillery and therefore notwithstanding its nearness to the works and overlooking of them in part it was not taken possession of but they should have recollected what had been said by the late king of prussia as to such positions  that where a goat can go a man may go and where a man can go artillery may be drawn up the british were no sooner seen on this hill where the wily phillips of the artillery is said to have ascended than they saw an additional reason for quitting the post this was a sore and heavy loss to the americans but in the issue proved a more certain and earlier overthrow of all burgoynes army yet so exasperated were the people at that time that had the commanding general st clair been immediately brought to trial he would have stood but a poor chance he was afterward tried and acquitted with honor the british took possession of the works and pushed on rapidly after the americans taking and destroying every thing that fell in their way brig genesis frazer with the light troops pursued with great ardour and on the  th came up with a body of the americans commanded by the brave col francis of massachusetts a warm action ensued the americans were worsted the colonel was slain and many other officers and soldiers killed wounded and taken prisoners this flew through the country like a shock of electricity and roused the people to noble exertions genesis st clair joined genesis schuyler at fort edward after a fatiguing retreat on the  0th a most conspicuous piece of gallantry was exhibited at rhode island maj genesis prescott having the command of the british troops at that place col barton of providence formed a resolution to surprise and take him he accordingly proceeded to the island with a party of chosen men in two boats with muffled oars taking with him a negro man whose hard head was nearly as efficacious as a beetle to burst a door and on this night with great address evading the british waterguards passed down the west side of the island and landed near a hollow ground and instantly pushed for the house of a mr overing where the general quartered the sentinel at the door was seized the house entered and demand made whether the general was there and finding that he was and the apartment the door was burst open and the general and his aiddecamp seized and told that they must go off instantly the general asked if he might put on his clothes the colonel answered very few and very quick sir the colonel returned to his boats and repassed the waterguards which the general had much confidence would have released him for on passing the last he observed to the colonel sir i did not think it possible you could escape the vigilance of the waterguards this was a brilliant affair and congress duly rewarded col barton for his distinguished address and gallantry    th  an express arrived from genesis washington with information that the british were preparing their transports for the embarkation of their troops from staten island were fixing births for the light horse etc but their destination could not be developed they had pushed into the jersies as if designing to march to philadelphia and then turned back as has been mentioned from amboy and now were preparing to embark and we shall anon see more of their maneuvers and deceptions    th  a number of americans who had left the northern army when it retreated as is generally the case on similar occasions came to boston they were immediately taken up and confined to be sent back again the best method in like cases    th  at evening an express passed through boston on his way to philadelphia with dispatches which had been brought to portsmouth n h by a vessel in    days passage from france it was said that there was great probability of an immediate war between france and england    st  by intelligence from peeks kill it was learnt that on the preceding wednesday  0 pieces of cannon were shipped for albany that a division of the american army was opposite to fishkill and that general washington was moving toward kings ferry with the main army said to be  0000 strong with near  00 wagons and having a number of flatbottomed boats on carriages etc    th  count polaski a polish nobleman came to boston and dined at headquarters  august  st  information was sent from cape ann that a fleet of vessels said to be near  00 had been seen from the high lands standing to the northward this caused some alarm the guards at the magazines etc were doubled   th  intelligence was received that genesis washington was moving with the main army toward philadelphia and had detached genesis glover with his brigade to join the northern army an account was received that there had been a skirmish on wood creek between a party of the americans and the enemy to the advantage of the former   th  intelligence was received that the american northern army had fallen back to saratoga about this time a party of the enemy landed on boston neck so called in rhode island they were driven off without doing much damage the same day intelligence was received that on the   d of the preceding month the british fleet sailed from sandy hook and had arrived off the capes of delaware   th  intelligence was received that the british fleet sailed out of the capes of delaware on the   st alt standing to the eastward this induced genesis washington to retrograde the main american army toward the north river    th  there was a report that the northern army had fallen back to stillwater one sixth part of the militia in a number of the counties of massachusetts were ordered to be detached and marched immediately to reinforce the northern army    th  intelligence was received that the british fleet had returned again to the capes of delaware col johnson and st ledger were advancing with a body of the enemy toward fort schuyler on the mohawk river  about this time a miss mcrea said to be a beautiful young lady and in all the innocence of youth her father warmly engaged on the side of the british and she on the very point of marriage with a british officer on some dispute between two indians as to which of them she of right belonged as a captive she was most inhumanly massacred the act was probably as abhorrent to the british as to the americans but they ought not to have engaged the savages in their cause as they might well have known their ungovernable temper and disposition for blood for this was not the only instance a british officer sending his waiter to a spring for some cool water in a few minutes an indian came in with the scalp of the waiter smoking in his hand  st ledger having gone up the mohawk to reduce fort schuyler genesis burgoyne determined to send out another strong detachment on his left toward bennington the command of this detachment was given to lieut col baum a hessian and col breyman with another detachment was ordered to cover and support baum these were met by the brave genesis stark who gave them a complete overthrow on the morning of the   th    officers and near  00 men were taken prisoners with   light fieldpieces nearly  000 arms a quantity of baggage etc the americans were said to have had about    men killed the loss of the enemy in killed was judged to be nearly  00 fort schuyler was closely besieged by st ledger and the brave col harkimer with the tryon county militia was marching to its relief st ledger learning his advance drew off a large part of his besieging troops to meet and give him battle before he got near the fort the battle was obstinate and the militia behaved with great bravery but were at length defeated their brave colonel and many of the militia were slain it was said that the action lasted   or   hours matters now appearing more serious in this quarter genesis arnold marched with a sufficient detachment to raise the siege as soon as st ledger learnt his approach he sent off some indians as if friends to meet arnold and inform him that st ledger had received a strong reinforcement and advised arnold to halt and wait for a reinforcement himself  then abandoned the siege with precipitation leaving his tents standing his baggage artillery etc behind him thus were both burgoynes wings effectually clipped  september  st  intelligence was received that after much maneuvering howes fleet came to anchor in chesapeak bay on the   st ult consisting of near  00 sail and it was expected he would soon land his troops the   th genesis washingtons army was on full march to meet how and then within   miles of philadelphia a valuable cargo arrived safe from spain among other articles a large number of shoes hose blankets shirts cordage duck etc   d  intelligence was received that genesis howes army had landed at the head of elk a detachment from genesis sullivans division a little before this time made an excursion on to statenisland and brought off several hundred prisoners and a large quantity of baggage the american loss was said to be about  0 including officers   th  four hundred and one prisoners taken near bennington by genesis stark were escorted to boston they consisted of british brunswick and canadian troops   th  capt harden arrived at boston in a connecticut state ship of  0 guns he brought in with him a jamaica packet which he took during his cruize it was said the packet had a large sum in specie on board and a mr shirley and family on their passage to england the last accounts stated both genesis washingtons and the northern army to be near the enemy and important news might be momently expected    th  col lees regiment moved into boston   0th  the disagreeable news was received that on the   th inst a severe action took place between genesis washingtons and howes armies near the brandywine which ended rather in favor of the latter who remained masters of the field the british here as in several other instances had recourse to stratagem they held out the appearance of an intention of forcing their way at chads ford which genesis kniphausen menaced with a heavy column of hessians while the british column by a long circuitous march reached the forks of the river and there secured a safe passage genesis washington was pretty early apprized of this movement and immediately took measures for strengthening his right by ordering some troops from his left after the action had become pretty warm on the right and the british had got the advantage kniphausen passed chads ford and although the troops who were still on the left behaved well they were by no means sufficient to resist the heavy column of hessians it is said that after the hessian grenadiers had crossed the ford they halted at the foot of the hill below the americans under a warm fire and with great deliberation changed their hats for their heavy brass caps which were carried by a loop on a button at the hip and then ascended the hill from which the americans were obliged to retire here the brave capt bryant of the artillery who had before several times distinguished himself under the eye of our general received a musquetball in the bottom of his belly a brother officer carried him off the field but he died of the wound genesis washington seconded by his officers did every thing in their power to check the british and a part of the american army took a position which probably saved the army from a total defeat perhaps the american army were more or less more generally engaged in this action than in any other during the war the american loss was considerable in killed and wounded and a number of pieces of brass field artillery were lost the british also suffered pretty severely in killed and wounded  the next night genesis gray made with much secrecy an attack on a body of americans under the command of genesis wayne the bayonet was chiefly made use of and it proved but too efficacious against the americans who suffered considerable loss in killed and wounded genesis washington retreated first to philadelphia and then left the city the british army a few days afterward advanced to germantown and on the   th a detachment of their army took possession of philadelphia    d  genesis washingtons orders for sending forward colonels lees henleys and jacksons regiments were received by our general    th  several prizes were sent in by a privateer brig belonging to col sears    th  intelligence was received that on friday the   th instant there was a warm and bloody action between genesis gatess and burgoynes advanced troops which lasted until dark the troops behaved with the greatest bravery on both sides col morgans light corpse and eleven other american regiments were more or less engaged of the americans   lieutenant colonels coburn and adams   captains   subalterns and    noncommissioned officers and privates were killed and     wounded theloss of the enemy was very considerable and much greater than that of the americans on the   th the day preceding the foregoing battle col brown made an excursion in the enemys rear to lake george made     of the enemy prisoners retook  00 americans he also took near  00 batteaux several large gunboats an armed sloop etc  took possession of the french lines so called at ticonderoga and summoned fort independence to surrender    th  col crafts regiment of state artillery marched out of boston with   light fieldpieces and an eightinch howitzer toward providence on a secret expedition as it was called    th  intelligence was received that several valuable prizes had been sent into dartmouth  october  d  intelligence was received that on the   th genesis du condray was drowned in the schuylkill he rode into the ferryboat at one end but was not able to command his horse who went out at the other end of the boat plunging into the river this officer as before mentioned was engaged to come to america to take the command of the artillery but whatever may have been his talents the artillery was so well commanded that the placing a foreign officer over them in such a manner and whose rank would also have soared above many other officers in the line would most certainly have produced a convulsion in the army had it been persisted in this circumstance prevented the danger the same day col lees regiment marched for the main army   th  col h jacksons regiment encamped on boston common and the next day about noon marched out of town for the army the regiment although small made a good appearance about the same time that the regiment marched out of town upwards of  00 british and canadian prisoners taken near lake george by col brown marched in   th  it was learnt that a body of the enemy said to be about  000 were moving from new york toward peeks kill genesis washington after he left philadelphia encamped near a place called skippack creek about    miles from germantown    th  at   oclock a m an express arrived from genesis gatess army with an account that on tuesday the  th inst a smart action took place between the right of genesis burgoynes army and the american left when the enemy were repulsed drove back to their works and then forced from them three fieldofficers   captains  0 subalterns   quartermastergeneral and   0 privates were taken prisoners besides  00 taken in the hospital    pieces of brass cannon   twelve and   six pounders   ammunitionwaggons  00 tents  00 barrels of flour and a large quantity of baggage were trophies of victory one hundred of the enemy lay dead on the ground the american loss although not exactly known was said not to be more than  0 killed and  00 wounded among the latter generals arnold and lincoln both in the leg the former but slightly it was problematical whether the latter was wounded by a british or american soldier genesis frazer an enterprising officer of the british was mortally wounded and died of his wounds    th  intelligence was received that a body of the british from new york in about  0 transports had proceeded up the hudson they had made several landings below and at peeks kill on monday the  th inst they crossed over and landed on the west side of the river and marched along the hills toward fort montgomery and its dependencies this fort was tolerably situated on the bank of the hudson to annoy shipping going up the river and the works were pretty good on that side but were not so nor fully completed on the back side and the right flank was commanded by higher ground on the south and near the fort on the other side of pooplops creek the mouth of which was near to the south side of the fort on this higher ground and near to the small deep pond a strong redoubt called clinton was erected it was equally essential that this redoubt should be taken as a reduction of the fort the british therefore moved against this redoubt while another column by a more circuitous movement fell in the rear of fort montgomery they were met in the defiles where the skirmishes were sharp but they continued to advance to the redoubt which was nobly defended and before which they sustained very considerable loss a number of their slain were afterward drawn out of the pond where they had been thrown for concealment but soon carried it and afterward fort montgomery the garrison principally made their escape in the dusk of the evening among them were gov clinton and his brother who was a brigadiergeneral also they made their escape in a very hazardous manner and the latter was wounded after the reduction of fort montgomery the americans evacuated fort constitution and the blockhouse on constitution island opposite to west point the latter was not yet fortified and the two new frigates congress and montgomery which lay in the river were set on fire by the americans and burnt the enemy afterward proceeded up the river and burnt esopus their object was if possible to form a junction with burgoyne or open a water communication to albany and spies passed between them    th  two or three of the enemys cruizers appeared in the bay but a few leagues from the light while the british army lay encamped at germantown genesis washington resolved to attack them this was a brave design and the success of the first onset at about   oclock a m of the  th inst after the americans had marched all the night was equal to the design for the british where the attack was first made were almost instantly pushed from their ground and were falling back panic struck on their other troops when lieut col musgrove had the presence of mind to throw several companies into a strong stone house houses at all times and especially those of stone and brick under a judicious conduct admit of a good defense and at this time probably proved the means of the americans losing an advantage which no one can tell how far it might have been pushed when an enemy is routed and panic struck are flying before the assailants the best if not the only way is to follow them if the ground will admit of it close at their heels taking care not to fall into ambuseades thus the panic of fear continues to multiply but if the pursuers stop and especially if those who were flying hear a firing behind them but not upon them they conclude that their own troops in turn have gotten an advantage or at least are holding their pursuers at bay this immediately recovers them from their panic they will next return to the charge and will be more likely to make an obstinate resistance than before they were at first routed while their return to the charge will greatly damp those who before considered themselves almost in the grasp of victory hence what took place at germantown was no wonder the fogginess of the morning was unfortunate for the americans but the british taking possession of the stone house and defending it was the most unfortunate circumstance the loss on both sides was considerable on the side of the americans brig genesis nash and on the side of the british brig genesis agnew were among the slain but although this attempt was not crowned with victory it caused the british to have a more reverential opinion of genesis washington whom they now found dare to attack their whole army even in a chosen position of their own perhaps it was best that the action closed as it did had the americans made their way far into the long street of that town probably many other houses would have been occupied in the same way the buryingyard with a strong wall was lined with troops by the enemy and the position in which their army lay was calculated for their wings closing in to much advantage at any rate the battle must have been very bloody and situation and circumstances were in favor of the british after the british were in possession of philadelphia they had much to do in order to get possession of the delaware and remove the obstructions which had been formed in it there were also several works to be reduced among others a fort on mudisland and a pretty strong work at red bank    d  highly important and most interesting intelligence was received that on the   th inst genesis burgoyne and his whole army surrendered under convention they were to be marched to then eighbourhood of boston and from thence sent to england upon the receipt of this news the cannon on fort hill were discharged and joy was seated on every brow    d  at   oclock p m the cannon on fort hill and on the heights of dorchester were discharged and also on board the ships in the harbor in the evening our generals quarters the house of the late hon mr russel was beautifully illuminated the following is the number of troops which surrendered to maj genesis gates and the state of genesis burgoynes army after he left canada  under the convention british      foreign     canadians etc sent back to canada  00 staff        prisoners taken at different times 00 sick and wounded    deserters 00 lost at bennington   0 killed since the   th of september 00 killed and taken at ticonderoga    total       the brass ordnance taken were as follows     pounders     pounders     pounders    pounders    inch mortars   howitzers total    exclusive of those taken at bennington  thus were the british totally disappointed in this quarter the troops intended to form a junction on the hudson were as high up as poughkeepsie and genesis burgoyne informed our general after he arrived at boston that on the evening after he had proposed to genesis gates to surrender in case he could obtain honorable terms which were to be settled the next day a spy came in to him from the troops down the river stating how far they had got up and what steps were next to be taken on which he genesis burgoyne assembled his officers more generally than usual in councils and stated to them the circumstances and situation of both armies and whether consistently with fair principles of honor they could break off the negotiation for an honorable convention or not when it was the unanimous opinion of every officer present that they could not but in a situation like his at that moment danger at hand is more powerful on the mind than the hope of relief at a distance the troops who were up the river returned down  the capture of genesis burgoyne and his whole army who were now on their way to boston opened a new important and delicate field for our general this army in which there were many officers of military erudition and some of refined and courtly manners who had a high opinion of national honor and prowess and who in consequence of the convention which they had formed had their spirits by no means depressed as those who are compelled to surrender at discretion  were sure to lay a heavy task on his shoulders as soon as he was notified that these troops were coming under his direction he set himself in earnest to prepare for their reception the barracks at prospect and winter hills were directed to be put instantly in order the council was applied to to aid in the procurement of quarters from the citizens for the officers nor was this an easy task the families of the citizens generally wanting the room in their respective houses rendered it difficult to obtain so many quarters as were necessary for so great a number and extended the limits of the parole very considerably the council were disposed to do every thing in their power and gave orders accordingly whenever they were necessary a heavy duty was also falling on the quartermasters department as it respected quarters and also fuel the latter of which had been rendered scarce in the vicinity by the american army having been here in      and the enemys cruizers prevented its being brought from the eastern country but the exertions of col chase who was deputyquartermastergeneral and the assistants and conductors in his department and of col davis who was deputybarrackmaster and who in the procurement of fuel was indefatigable a comfortable supply was obtained before the arrival of the troops at cambridge our general had digested and drafted a parole and several articles for the government of the troops in quarters these he had drawn in as an article in the parole and the honor of the officers in this way was pledged for their observance of the articles which rendered the government of them much easier being thus bound to govern themselves with propriety or infringe their paroles knowing that many things in minutiae would be to settle which would be tedious in an epistolary way as soon as general burgoyne had arrived at cambridge our general sent over one of his aid decamps to invite genesis burgoyne to dine with him the next day bringing with him his two majorgenerals phillips and reidesel an elegant dinner was prepared and many other gentlemen invited among whom were generals glover of massachusetts and whipple of new hampshire who were at the capture and had commanded the escort etc from saratoga to cambridge  november  th  our general sent one of his aids to accompany genesis burgoyne and the other officers into boston by the way of roxbury they arrived some time before dinner as was intended that business might be considered the parole was shown to them and the articles for their government in quarters with which they were well pleased but here a discovery was first made of something which they wished to retain while in our country and which our general would never for a moment allow genesis phillips turning to our general observed sir you well know the disposition of soldiers and that they will more or less in all armies commit some disorders suppose you should delegate to genesis burgoyne the power of seeing your orders executed our general replied that he knew the disposition of soldiers and also the necessity of order and discipline that he was not only willing but expected that genesis burgoyne and every other officer would exert themselves to keep order that for this purpose among themselves and for internal order and obedience he might command and punish as might appear to be necessary but in no case to attempt capital punishment but as to the exercise of his own command and enforcement of his own orders when necessary was a jurisdiction which genesis burgoyne must not expect to exercise while here genesis burgoyne smiled and genesis phillips turned it off by saying i only meant it for your easement sir  before dinner was done so great was the curiosity of the citizens of both sexes and of all ages and descriptions to get a peep at genesis burgoyne that the streets were filled the doors windows the tops of the houses and fences crowded genesis burgoyne had asked our general if he would indulge him to go out of town by the way of charlestown which was instantly granted when he was ready to depart our general told him that he should accompany him to the ferry and a procession was formed the american gentlemen mixing with the british the streets were so crowded that it was difficult getting along but not a word or a gesture that was disrespectful when arrived opposite to the provincehouse genesis burgoyne turned round to the other generals and observed there is the former residence of the governor when some person on the side of the street and in a tone fully to be heard added and on the other side is the ridingschool alluding to the old south meeting house having been put to that use in      but the general who must have heard it made no reply but soon after observed sir i am astonished at the civility of your people for were you walking the streets of london in my situation you would not escape insult when arrived at the ferryways the crowd were down to the waters edge but when the boat put off there was not the least indecency or wry countenance discovered  o my dear countrymen how did this your dignified conduct at that moment charm my very soul such conduct flows from a greatness of mind that goes to conquer a world  col keith was appointed deputyadjutantgeneral and maj swasey townmajor    th  the council were still deliberating on the subject of quarters and determined to do every thing in their power but some individuals were refractory    th  genesis hancock arrived in town and was saluted by the discharge of the cannon of the fort park etc    d  intelligence was received of the repulse of the enemy before the redoubt at red bank on the   d ult this redoubt or fort had a garrison by no means sufficient properly to man the whole work the commanding officer had therefore wisely lessened it by running a parapet with a ditch across the area of the fort but had left the work entire in its largest extent a body of chosen troops were sent to reduce this work under the command of the hessian col donop a brave and good officer in order if possible to get some idea of the work he sent his summons for the fort to surrender by a very capable adjutant but the commandant of the fort took care to have him stopped without the work and where he had no opportunity to see more than the ditch and parapet on that side the commanding officer refusing to surrender an assault was made the assailants at the head of the column bringing in their hands a sufficient number of short fascines to fill the ditch where they meant to pass which was well done and the parapet was mounted but to their disappointment and surprise they now found there was another ditch and parapet to pass and in the face of a dreadful fire too which made great slaughter a number of them however advanced into the second ditch and began to remove the frizes on the berme but these were generally killed in the ditch and such as were not killed or wounded obliged to quit the outer work their loss in killed and wounded was great among the latter col donop mortally he was taken after the action near the fort and brought in an ensign had made his way over the second ditch had got on to the frizes and lay close against the base of the parapet until the action was over and then got up and surrendered observing that he thought his position the only safe one for had he attempted to put his head above the parapet he knew his brains would have been instantly blown out or if he had attempted to recross the ditch he should have been shot in the back besides this severe check the british met with considerable opposition and loss at other places before they got full and peaceable possession of the river particularly at mud island they lost the augusta manofwar and suffered other naval damage  genesis washington being now considerably reinforced with a part of the northern conquering army advanced to white marsh about    miles from philadelphia where he encamped in a strong and well chosen position genesis how apprehensive that this movement indicated a design upon philadelphia determined to move out and either invite genesis washington to a general action or if he found him vulnerable to attack him in his own position accordingly on the evening of the  th of december he marched with the british army and on the next morning took post on chestnut hill in front of the american right genesis washington knowing the goodness of his position wisely continued in it nor dare genesis how attack him the latter then changed his ground to a new position opposite to the american left and center but neither dare he attack either of these several skirmishes took place as is usual in such cases in one of which brig genesis irwin on the american side was wounded after several days spent in this way how was obliged to return without effecting any thing to the no small injury of his army who had suffered much from the inclemency of the season indeed nothing is more destructive to an army than winter campaigns after this genesis washington moved the american army to valley forge on the schuylkill about    miles from philadelphia where he took a position as wisely chosen as the other and where the army erected huts for the winter  we now return to take up our chain of events    d  a french ship with dry goods from france by the way of st peters arrived at boston  genesis burgoyne had not yet signed the parole he pretended to delay until their quarters were fully furnished although he had every assurance that it should be done as fast as circumstances would possibly admit on this day therefore our genesis wrote him the following letter  headquarters boston nov         sir two weeks have now elapsed since i had fully expected that the officers would have signed their paroles they have during this time been enjoying in a great measure the liberty of the limits intended to be assigned to them without pledging their honor by parole which is not only contrary to the established custom of nations but contrary to the eleventh article of the convention whatever objections might at first be made to giving the parole must now be done away by the fullest evidence that proper quarters shall be provided and which in a very considerable degree is already done i must therefore in the most explicit terms insist that the officers who wish and expect to be permitted on parole agreeably to the convention do sign it tomorrow this is so reasonable that i expect there will be no further hesitancy and i still assure your excellency that no endeavors of mine shall be wanting to fulfill the convention and to treat the officers with politeness and generosity  i am etc signed william heath  to lieut genesis burgoyne    th  genesis burgoyne and the other officers of the convention signed

officer or soldier or other person as above mentioned of the said army shall hereafter be found in arms against these states in north america during the present contest he may be convicted of the offense and suffer the punishment in such case inslicted by the law of nations  that maj genesis heath be directed to take the parole in writing of the officers according to the convention and transmit authenticated copies of such paroles to the board of war  extract from the minutes signed charles thomson secy  upon the foregoing being communicated to genesis burgoyne and he called upon to have the said descriptive lists made out accordingly he wrote our general the following letter  cambridge nov  0      sir i received a paper dated headquarters boston nov  0th purporting to be founded upon express orders from the honorable continental congress which paper i return as inadmissible because extending to matters in which the congress have no right of interference  a list of the names and rank of every commissioned officer and the numbers of the noncommissioned officers and soldiers may be necessary to you sir for the purpose of fulfilling the convention in quartering officers and the regular delivery of provisions fuel etc such lists shall be prepared at your request but before any other lists can be granted i must be assured of the purposes for which they are intended and the word order must neither be mentioned nor implied  i have the honor to be etc signed j burgoyne lieut genesis  to maj genesis heath  to the foregoing our general wrote an answer as follows  headquarters boston nov         sir yours of yesterday is before me and although you might at first imagine that the hon continental congress have no right of interference in matters of the convention yet i conclude upon further reflection you must be convinced that as that body are the representatives of that people who are to reap the advantages or disadvantages of the convention and as all continental officers are acting by virtue of their authority and under their direction they assuredly have a right of interference and to give such orders to their officers as they may think proper for the full completion of the convention and for the safety and good of the people  the paragraph of my orders of the  0th inst respecting the troops of the convention is founded in reason and justice being designed only to ascertain the officers and soldiers who were comprehended in the convention that in case any of them contrary to their faith and honor should hereafter be found in arms against these states in north america during the present contest they may be convicted of the offense and suffer the punishment in such case inflicted by the law of nations i must therefore insist that you furnish me with proper lists of names and descriptions for the purpose before mentioned as soon as may be  the other lists of the names and rank of the commissioned officers and number of noncommissioned officers and soldiers so essentially necessary for the several purposes of regularity with quarter masters and commissaries and which should be frequently renewed as circumstances may vary should long ere this have been exhibited some days since i directed my deputyadjutantgeneral to call for them and i expect they will be sent in without delay for the purposes above mentioned  i shall at all times endeavor to found my orders on the principles of honor reason and justice and not to infringe those delicate principles in others but my orders for the purposes of order and regularity must be obeyed by every man and all bodies of men placed under my direction and fully determined i am that offenders shall not pass with impunity  i am etc signed w heath maj genesis  lieut genesis burgoyne    d  genesis burgoyne wrote an answer to the foregoing but he now acknowledged a further extent of the supreme power than in his former letter but still at least obliquely denied the right of their interference with the convention troops who were under express stipulations until they quitted the country and that no new conditions could be imposed upon them and asserting that no such requisitions were laid upon the american prisoners in canada and concluding that if it could be found that such had been required by the british in any case he would submit to it about this time an officer who had been a prisoner in canada returned to boston on parole and gave information that he and others had complied with similar injunctions before they came away upon this being communicated to genesis burgoyne he found that he had got to the end of his tether of evasion he did not attempt to dispute more but observed that he supposed if it was done any time before the troops departed it would answer the purpose our general found that nothing could be done by force for were he to attempt of himself to have the lists taken every thing might be evaded except the size and complexion he therefore laid the matter before congress with the copies of what had passed congress took the matter into consideration and president laurens wrote our general an approbation of his conduct and not to push the matter as congress would take a more extensive view of the business concluding his letter i have in conclusion to assure you sir that congress repose the utmost confidence in your address and abilities for conducting with propriety this important business in which on one side the faith and honor of these infant states are to be preserved and on the other the magnanimity and resolution of congress to be exemplified  december  congress had received some intimations that an application would be made to them for leave for the troops of the convention to embark at some other place than boston they therefore on the  st of december passed a resolution that no other place than that stipulated in the convention viz boston should be admitted a few days after genesis burgoyne applied as was suspected but to no purpose  congress also passed resolutions that all the assistance of provisions and other necessaries furnished to the troops of the convention should be paid for in specie or replaced in quantity and quality       january  genesis burgoyne had now got himself into a very serious entanglement he had not only refused and then delayed to give descriptive lists of the troops of the convention but some time before viz in the month of november had written a letter to genesis gates complaining that the troops had not been furnished with quarters as they had a right to expect and among other things a paragraph as follows  while i state to you sir this very unexpected  i entirely acquit maj genesis heath and every gentleman of the military department of any  to the public faith engaged in the convention they do what they can but while the supreme powers of the state are unable or unwilling to enforce their authority and the inhabitants want the hospitality or indeed the common civilization to assist us without it the public faith is broke and we are the immediate sufferers  this was unreasonable as it respected both the civil power and the people for the former did every thing in their power unless they had turned the citizens out of their houses to have let the convention officers in which was not to be expected nor could it be supposed that the citizens would turn their familles themselves into the streets but congress considered the conduct of genesis burgoyne and these and other of his expressions on the occasion as calling for serious consideration they therefore investigated the whole in all its latitudes and the president of congress wrote our general that as it was a matter of high importance and ired deep deliberation it would probably occu some days before the resolutions would be comed but that in case the fleet arrived before the papers were sent to him to forbid the embarka  genesis burgoyne had received intimations that a fleet of transports were about to come round for the troops and that the june frigate was to wear a flag for his particular accommodation this he mentioned to our general and wished to know if the frigate might come up into the harbor our general had no apprehensions of any danger from a frigate entering the harbor but apprehended that some people might think that he was not sufficiently vigilant in case he allowed it he therefore told genesis burgoyne that the frigate could not come up into the harbor and hinted to him the taking one of the most convenient transports in the fleet for the purpose and he might do as he pleased when he got off this touched genesis burgoyne exceedingly who wrote a letter to our general in which was the following paragraph  as to your allotment of a convenient transport for my passage if it was from yourself i am to thank you sir for a sort of insult which the most haughty man of office would be ashamed of in any other country however as i am determined every transaction concerning this convention shall be notorious and beyond the powers of subterfuge to explain away i have directed the frigate together with the transports to come round and it will then be for you sir to prohibit the entry of boston harbor to any ships bearing a flag of truce and declaring they are sent for the express purpose of conveying to great britain any part of the troops of the convention  signed j burgoyne  maj genesis heath  to which our general wrote the following answer  headquarters boston jan        sir your excellencys favor of yesterday came duly to hand and i must confess i was not a little surprised at some expressions in it  as by the convention transports only are stipulated to receive the troops i submit to you sir whether a hint if you were even sure that it came from myself that you should take a convenient one rather than introduce a frigate which is neither expressed or implied in the convention merits those epithets which you are pleased to bestow on me  i have ever aimed to treat you with politeness and the plighted faith and honor of my country require me to pay strict attention to the convention on their part of course when transports arrive to receive the troops they will enter the harbor and if you can find by the convention that a frigate is to enter for the particular reception of yourself she will not be prohibited but if it is rather uncommon for ships of war to bear flags of truce and if consenting to it in the present case should appear to be rather an act of politeness and generosity than otherwise i leave you to your own reflections whether you have made choice of the most happy expressions to obtain it  signed w heath  lieut genesis burgoyne  genesis burgoyne some how communicated to viscount how the subject of the frigate who wrote genesis burgoyne the following letter some time after but before the transports came round  eagle rhode island feb        sir i am much concerned to find by your letter i had the honor to receive from you on the return of capt piper that you have suffered so greatly in your health but i hope that a speedy removal to a milder climate will contribute to your effectual recovery  the transports have only been delayed to take the precautions necessary for their safe passage at this season of the year as it is not to be expected that the frigate ordered for your reception though carrying a flag of truce and restricted from every act of hostility in consequence whilst attending this service should be admitted within the port of boston the commander capt jacobs will be to land a letter under the same sanction for giving you notice of his arrival off the entrance of the port he will wait to be favored in your answer with notice of the time you may expect to embark on which occasion i trust you will find every facility that your impaired state of health may require  signed how   thus did the admirals opinion perfectly coincide with that of our generals  but congress had passed a resolution on the  th day of january upon principles clearly expressed in a report of a committee upon which the resolution was founded  that the embarkation of lieut genesis burgoyne and the troops under his command be suspended till a distinct and explicit ratification of the convention of saratoga shall be properly notified by the court of great britain to congress  our generals correspondence with genesis burgoyne respecting the frigate etc was transmitted to congress and the president soon after wrote him   the house appeared to be pleased with your conduct in every respect relative to that officer  genesis burgoyne applied to congress for leave to go to europe himself but congress did not then think proper to grant his request although this denial must have been very painful to the general he did not express himself or write any thing in the least improper he observed to our general that he was sorry for that not only his health urged his departure but that every day he was detained here gave his enemies at home an opportunity for piercing the wound of his reputation the deeper  but col kingston was not so prudent as the general a packet of letters which genesis burgoyne wished to send to genesis how was sent to our general for inspection among these was one from col kingston to lord harcourt in which after observing that fortune had not shown them the smooth side of her face yet they thought their misfortunes honorable proceeded that he genesis burgoyne was not well but you know his firmness but i think the insincerity of france bigotry of spain or the vindictive portuguese situated as he is would not have sought for means unnecessarily to detain him this insult to the authority of the country induced our general to detain this letter and he notified genesis burgoyne of it adding that while it was his wish to gratify the officers as much as possible in writing to their friends he expected they would be cautious and prudent in their manner of expression when the american deputyadjutantgeneral gave the letter from our general to genesis burgoyne and he had read it he observed i told col kingston that genesis heath would not let that letter pass he should have done more  forbid his making the attempt  another serious matter took place about this time col henley who had the immediate command at cambridge a brave and good officer but warm and quick in his natural temper having ordered some prisoners who were under guard turned out that he might examine them one of them treated him as he judged with much insolence upon which he pricked him with a sword or bayonet genesis burgoyne immediately presented a complaint against col henley charging him with barbarous and wanton conduct and intentional murder as appears in the following letter  cambridge jan  th      sir a report has been made to me of a disturbance that happened at the barracks on wednesday afternoon for which i am much concerned and though the provocations from your people which originally occasioned it were of the most atrocious nature i was willing the offender on our part should be properly punished but col henley not content with that made prisoners of eighteen innocent men and sent them on board a guardship as alleged by your order it is not only a duty to my situation to demand the immediate discharge of these men together with a satisfactory apology but i also mean it as an attention to you sir that i give you an immediate opportunity to disavow so unjustifiable a proceeding as committing men to the worst of prisons upon vague report caprice and passion  insults and provocations at which the most placid dispositions would revolt are daily given to the officers and soldiers of this army regular decent complaints are received by your officers sometimes with haughtiness sometimes with derision but always without redress these evils flow sir from the general tenor of language and conduct held by col henley which encourages his inferiors and seems calculated to excite the most bloody purposes  for want of sufficient information and not bringing myself to believe it possible that facts as related by common report could be true i have hitherto declined taking public notice of this man but upon positive grounds i now and hereby formerly accuse col henley of behavior heinously criminal as an officer and unbecoming a man of the most indecent violent vindictive severity against unarmed men and of intentional murder i demand prompt and satisfactory justice and will not doubt your readiness to give it whenever you will inform me that a proper tribunal is appointed i will take care that undersiable evidence shall be produced to support these charges  i am etc signed j burgoyne   to which our general returned the following answer  headquarters boston jan  0th      sir yours of yesterdays date i received the last evening what provocations you allude to as having been offered by my troops i am at loss to determine the insults and abuses which they have received i will venture to say unless i have been most grossly misinformed are unparalleled and whether you are willing or unwilling sir offenders shall no longer pass with impunity  if it can be made to appear that any of those soldiers sent to the guardship by my orders are innocent they shall be released from their confinement but with respect to such as have been guilty of violating my standing orders of the garrison instead of disavowing or making any apology for the consinement of such be assured that i do most explicitly avow it and as i have before observed to your excellency in a former letter of which you may be assured i shall at all times endeavor to found my orders on the principles of honor reason and justice and not to infringe those delicate principles in others so also be assured sir that such my orders shall be obeyed by every officer and soldier placed under my direction and such as have the hardiness to transgress them shall abide the consequences  i have been informed of late that some have hinted that such of your troops as break my orders ought to be tried and punished by your orders even the mention of such a thing i conceive to be to use your own words in a late letter with a little variation a sort of insult that a man of military erudition in any country would be ashamed of as being repugnant to every idea of military discipline and from my opinion of your military knowledge i cannot admit that you ever hinted it  to convince you that it is my fixed determination to inquire into all abuses whether committed by my own troops or those of the convention whilst they remain within my department i have ordered col henley under arrest and appointed a court of inquiry whereof brig genesis glover is president to examine into the grounds of your complaint on wednesday next at  0 oclock a m at cambridge and if any complaints have heretofore passed unredressed it is because they have not been laid before me you hinted to me when i had the pleasure of seeing you last at cambridge that one of my officers had been enticing some of the troops of the convention to enter our service i then informed you that if you would send the complaint i would immediately bring the officer to trial you promised to do it but i have not yet received it i now call upon you to exhibit that charge or any other that you have to make against any officer under my command for practices of that kind or any other being with yourself fully determined that all my conduct respecting the convention shall be notorious and beyond the powers of subterfuge to explain away complaints of most enormous abuses have lately been made to me one of the conduct of a number of officers on the evening or night of the   th of december at bradishs tavern others of prisoners being rescued from the guards  sentinels abused and insulted on their posts  passes counterfeited and others filled up in the most affrontive manner and of late several highway robberies committed in the environs of the garrison  one the last evening in which a gentleman was robbed of between   and  00 dollars and a watch the robberies i do not charge to your people as it is unknown who were the perpetrators but there are several reasons to suspect it all these sir tend not only to exasperate the troops but to enrage the inhabitants of the country who view such abuses as unsufferable i therefore call upon you to exert your endeavors to suppress all abuses as far as is in your power  i am etc signed w heath  lieut genesis burgoyne  col henley was ordered under arrest and col lee to take the command at cambridge and the general

such place as the president shall appoint  brigadiergeneral glover president  col m jackson col nixon col lee col h jackson members  all persons concerned to attend the court  genesis burgoyne found fault that a court of inquiry only was appointed and not a court martial he was answered that this was frequently the case that it did not preclude the latter and where an officer of rank and in particular one who had the immediate command was the object this previous step was both justifiable and proper the court of inquiry met and gave in their opinion and in the general orders of january   th the following was announced   the court whereof brig genesis glover was president appointed by the orders of the  0th inst to inquire into the grounds of a complaint exhibited by lieut genesis burgoyne against col henley late commanding officer of the american troops at cambridge  after mature consideration are of opinion that from the evidence offered on the side of genesis burgoyne against col henley it will be most for the honor of col henley as well as for the satisfaction of all concerned that the judgment of a court martial should be taken on his conduct during his command

be discharged from his arrest  the general approves the opinion of the court thanks them for their unwearied endeavors to investigate the truth and orders col henley to reassume his command at cambridge immediately  the general thinks it to be his duty on this occasion to observe that although the conduct of lieut genesis burgoyne as prosecutor against col henley in the course of the foregoing trial in his several speeches and pleas may be warranted by some like precedents in british courtsmartial yet as it is altogether novel in the proceedings of any general court martial in the army of the united states of america whose rules and articles of war direct that the judgeadvocategeneral shall prosecute in the name of the united states and as a different practice tends to render courtsmartial both tedious and expensive  he does protest against this instance being drawn into precedent in future   th  a british soldier at cambridge stabbed one of the american guard    th

however with propriety and pleasure intimate that your conduct toward the british general and his dependents receives the continued approbation of congress if i may be permitted to make this conclusion from the general sentiments of members    d  just before noon genesis lincoln arrived in boston from albany his leg was recovering fast but he was still very lame and was conveyed from place to place on a moveable bed with handles which was fixed on the runners of his sleigh with a canopy and curtains and was convenient also to remove into the house etc in this was blended ingenuity and convenience    th  intelligence was received that the british transports destined to take away the troops of the convention had arrived at holmess hole and the next day march  st that they had

every occasion to extend the utmost generosity to the gentlemen of the army yet to allow letters to pass unopened would be betraying the trust reposed in me therefore any idea of granting such an indulgence cannot be admitted  if any advantage in the economy of expense to the government of great britain may be derived from landing any overplus of provisions from the fleet for the use of the troops of the convention i have not the least objection to it but wish you would ascertain the matter as soon as possible  i rest assured that whilst your vessels enjoy perfect security under the

london laden with clothing for the united states    th  a detachment of col henleys regiment marched out of boston for the army    th  general burgoyne having again applied to congress for leave to go to england himself they now gave him liberty this was joyous to the general and he wrote our general that he had assured himself that there would be nothing thrown in the way on his part and wished for his passports the president of congress in his letter to our general by the same express informed him that it was late in the evening when the resolve granting genesis burgoyne leave to depart passed and nothing was said respecting the settlement of the accounts before his departure but that it was fully his opinion that the former resolve should be strictly observed for congress had before resolved that neither he nor the troops of the convention should depart before the accounts were settled and paid our general therefore told general burgoyne that this must first be done and that then he should meet with no delay on this he hesitated and then asked how the accounts were to be settled he was answered  strictly conformable to the resolves of congress he then asked if congress could be serious in their resolution requiring in specie the same sum which they had expended in paper money our general replied that he supposed that honorable body were serious in all their resolutions he then replied that this was unjust for the odds was double and appealed to our general to say whether he thought it just himself our general answered that as an executive officer it was not for him to judge or determine whether the orders of his superiors were just or not general burgoyne replied that was true he was then told that if he did not choose to pay for the supplies the act allowed him to replace them in quality and quantity and this seemed to remove his objections after further discussion the two generals pledged their faith and sacred honor to each other in which they both had the fullest confidence that general burgoyne should proceed to rhode island accompanied by such officers as our general might think proper to send to whom general burgoyne should pay in specie the amount of the supplies furnished in the quartermasters department and that he should forward in vessels bearing flags provisions of the different species they had received within a certain number of days stipulated that no advantage should be taken by delay occasioned by stress of weather that a box of gold as a pledge for any deficiencies in the provisions should be deposited with our general the balance of which after the full settlement of the accounts to be paid to the senior officer of the troops of the convention  april  d  general burgoyne came into boston and dined at headquarters and before he took leave of our general observed i know your situation sir and the difficulty of obtaining many foreign necessaries you may want or wish if you will give me a memorandum on my arrival in england i will with great pleasure forward them to you our general thanked him for his politeness but was careful not to mention any choosing rather to suffer with his fellowcountrymen the necessities

and that the english ambassador had returned to england   0th  the british made an excursion to tiverton and littlecompton and did some damage  our general concluded with genesis pigot a system for the future supply of the troops of the convention by sending provisions from rhode island this mode tended to the increase of provisions in the states and to the easier supply of our own troops the plan was submitted to congress who were pleased to honor it with their approbation which they expressed in the following resolution  in congress may   d      resolved that congress approve of maj genesis heaths conduct relative to the proposals made by maj genesis pigot for supplying with provisions the troops who surrendered prisoners under the convention of saratoga  that the president be directed to inform maj genesis heath that congress expect that all assistance afforded to the enemy in unloading storing or transporting provisions for the support of the convention prisoners be paid for in solid coin agreeably to the spirit of their resolution of the   th of december last  the convention troops complained exceedingly of this discrimination in payment because it was notorious that there was a considerable difference between paper money and specie indeed at first view it seems scarcely reconcilable on the principles of justice and equity but when the grounds on which the resolve of the   th of dec      is predicated are considered it seems to place the matter in a different light  it is expressed as follows   in congress dec  th      whereas sir william how commander in chief of his britannic majestys forces has required that provisions should be sent in for the subsistence of the american prisoners in his possession and for the purchase of such necessaries as they may stand in need of and has prohibited the circulation of the money struck by the authority of these states within such parts of the country as are at present subjected to his power whereby great difficulties have occurred in relieving the distresses of the american prisoners and whereas large sums of continental bills of credit have been counterfeited and issued by the agents emissaries and abettors of sir w how   resolved that the accounts of all provisions and other necessaries which already have been or which hereafter may be supplied by the public to prisoners in the power of these states shall be discharged by either receiving from the british commissary of prisoners or any of his agents provisions or other necessaries equal in quantity and kind to what have been supplied or the amount thereof in gold or silver at the rate of four shillings and sixpence sterling for every dollar of the currency of these states and that all these accounts be liquidated and discharged previous to the release of any prisoners to whom provisions or other necessaries shall have been so supplied  extract from the minutes signed c thomson  by the foregoing it appears that the british were allowed to replace any and all the supplies which were furnished to them and in that way might make all the savings in their power and certainly they ought to be checked if they attempted to destroy that currency on which the states had solely to rely for the prosecution of the war which had been forced upon them by this same power  june   th  a british officer was shot by an american sentinel on prospecthill the officer attempting to pass contrary to the standing orders the sentinel was immediately relieved and put under guard and as soon as the official account of the event was received by our general he wrote the following letter to genesis phillips  headquarters boston june           oclock p m sir i am this moment informed that an officer of the convention has been shot

immediately upon my receiving the disagreeable report the last evening that an officer of the convention had been shot by an american sentinel and that the sentinel was confined i ordered him to be closely kept so and the coroner of the county of middlesex to be certified that a jury of inquest might be summoned to sit on the body of the officer decency and the utmost attention in any country could not have done more a few minutes after i had dispatched the officer with the foregoing orders i received your letter couched in such terms that i am at a loss what epithets to give it were it even certain that the shooting of the officer was an act of the most deliberate wilful murder why should you charge these free independent states with a bloody disposition and with rebellion and this state in particular as void of every principle of justice although i ever had and still have a personal regard for you and wish in every respect to treat you with the utmost generosity yet that duty which i owe to the honor and dignity of the united states will not allow me to pass unnoticed such expressions as are contained in your letter and i cannot put any other interpretation upon them than that they are a violent infraction of your parole most sacredly given i do conceive it to be my duty and i do hereby restrict you to the limits of your house gardens and yard and to the direct road from your quarters to the quarters of the troops of the convention on prospect and winter hills expecting from you a parole for propriety of conduct within those limits which if you refuse i shall be under the necessity of ordering you to narrower limits until i can obtain the pleasure of the honorable the congress touching this matter to whom i shall transmit your letter and crave their directions  as to your demand of liberty for an officer to proceed to sir henry clinton with a report of this murder as you are pleased to express yourself i have only to reply that as soon as the coroner has taken an inquisition in which all the evidence respecting this unhappy affair will be contained i shall transmit a copy thereof to congress and i shall have no objection to your sending a copy also to sir henry clinton by way of the headquarters of his excellency general washington if his excellency should approve of it together with any just and decent representations which you may think necessary to make on this occasion or any other after i have examined such letters but as to an officers going to sir henry clinton it is altogether unnecessary  so you will please to excuse my refusal of it  i am sir your obedient servant signed w heath major general p s i shall not at this time comment on the indelicate manner in which your letter is addressed    maj genesis phillips  i william phillips major general and senior officer of the troops under the restrictions of the convention of saratoga do promise and engage on my word and honor and on the faith of a gentleman to remain in the quarters now assigned to me in cambridge in the state of massachusetts bay and at no time to exceed or pass the limits of the gardens and yards adjoining and belonging to said quarters except in the road by the nearest and most direct route from my said quarters to prospect and winter hills and the limits of said hills within the chain of sentries  until it shall be permitted or ordered otherwise by the continental general commanding in this state his excellency general washington or the honorable congress of the united states of america and that i will not directly or indirectly give any intelligence to the enemies of the said united states or either of them or do or say any thing in opposition to or in prejudice of the measures and proceedings of any congress for

sir you will immediately repair to cambridge and wait upon maj genesis phillips present him the letter addressed to him after he has read the letter present the parole if he signs it well if he refuses you will please to inform him that in consequence of the indecent dishonorable and highly insulting expressions in his letter of yesterday against the honor and dignity of the free sovereign and independent states of america and in prejudice of the measures and proceedings of the honorable the congress  as it is my duty so it is my express orders that he the said maj genesis phillips be restricted to the limits of his house yards and gardens beyond which he is not to pass until it be otherwise ordered and that you immediately plant and continue by relief so many sentries as may be necessary to prevent his exceeding those limits you will give orders that the sentries so planted observe a strict decorum and soldierlike behavior avoiding insult and behaving with becoming dignity after which you will wait on the next senior officer and acquaint him of genesis phillips being confined  i am sir your most obedient servant signed w heath maj genesis  lieut col pollard dep adj general  the same day genesis phillips wrote our general as follows  cambridge june           oclock p m sir lieutenant brown of the   st regiment who was shot yesterday by an american sentinel died about midnight in the last night  i am informed some person whom you have sent to examine the body is now doing it and as i suppose every inspection of that sort will be over by tomorrow i would propose to bury the corpse tomorrow evening i am to desire to know if you have any objection and whether you have any particular intentions relating to the body of the murdered officer if it is to be allowed christian burial i would wish to deposit it in the vault appropriated for strangers in the protestant church at cambridge in this case i am to desire you will give the necessary permission for this purpose and allow a sufficient number of men from the barracks to assist in carrying down the corpse from the barracks to the church  as i am totally ignorant to whom it may be necessary to apply for leave to open the church it obliges me to give you this trouble and i hope if permission is granted that it may be done so fully as will prevent the sanguinary people of this country from insulting and treating with indignity the dead body of the unfortunate officer who in their rage revengeful tempers and barbarity they have put to death  i am sir your most obedient humble servant signed w phillips  maj genesis heath  to this letter the following was returned  headquarters boston june         sir yours of yesterday afternoon was handed to me the last evening i most sincerely regret the unfortunate death of lieut brown  as i apprehend the coroner has taken his inquisition or will do it this morning which is in conformity to the laws of the land in that case made and provided for the sole purpose of investigating the truth of facts  you not only have my permission but request that every mark of respect may be paid to the corpse of the deceased and you have my permission also for such a number of noncommissioned officers and privates to attend as may be necessary to bear the corpse from the funeral house to the place of interment  i do not know under whose direction the church at cambridge now is but i have given orders to maj hopkins and the townmajor to afford every kind of assistance in their power and to inquire who has the direction and to obtain permission i have also given orders that decency be exhibited by our troops during the time of procession of interment which the solemnity of so mournful an occasion points out as the duty of rational beings and from the universal respectful behavior of the people of this country on such occasions you may be sure that not the least insult will be offered  i am sir your most obedient servant signed w heath  maj genesis phillips    th  genesis phillips wrote another letter as follows  cambridge june   th      sir i shall not animadvert upon or answer any part of your letter of yesterday except what relates to your meaning to restrict me to my house garden and yards and to the direct road from my quarters to the quarters of the troops of the convention on prospect and winter hills and requiring my signing a new parole for my propriety of conduct within those limits  when by the treaty of convention of saratoga the officers were to be admitted on parole it was clearly intended that a liberal interpretation was to be given of that agreement and to use your own words generous limits were to be granted i will not deny that the limits have been sufficient  i apprehend sir that under no sense or explanation of the treaty the officers were to be denied intercourse with the soldiers  indeed there is an article particularly on that point and by restricting me to my quarters allowing me only the passage to the barracks by the direct road you would certainly have restricted me as you have done several other officers from whom you have taken the benefit of their parole allowing for the distinction of my rank having obtained a quarter instead of a barrack it seemed therefore a very extraordinary proposal made to me that i should sign a parole under a restriction which deprived me of any advantage arising from my giving one according to the article on that subject in the treaty of convention of saratoga and on this consideration i refused it  you have sir made me a prisoner in my quarters under a guard and i am perfectly at ease about it  shall bear it sir and any other violence of power which may happen to me with more patience than you may suppose i am very regardless about insults or injuries done me personally  i feel only and then severely when any are offered to the troops i command  but sir you attempt at much more than restricting my person for in a paper sent me this day being your instructions to lieut col pollard dated june         you direct him after he has planted sentinels around my quarters that he is to wait on the next senior officer and acquaint him of general phillips being confined i am to inform you sir that bearing the kings commission i shall consider myself senior officer of the troops of the convention and every officer of them will obey my orders as far as their present situation will allow you may confine my person but cannot have power to take from me my military place nor my connection with the convention troops  it is too extravagant an idea to suppose you capable of so little can it be in the power of an individual to deprive me of the commission i hold that were these colonies really acknowledged independent and sovereign states it would not be in the power of their government to deprive an officer of another nation of his military commission how far soever they might stretch and extend their power over his person but sir i must be allowed to declare that until the colonies are acknowledged by great britain to be independent sovereign states i cannot view them in any other light than that in which they are considered by great britain  as you will not allow me to send an officer to sir henry clinton i must request to take advantage of your express for sending my report and representations to him and i will beg to know when i must send you my letters  i am sir your most obedient humble servant signed w phillips  maj genesis heath  to which the following answer was returned the next day  headquarters boston june  0      sir another of your favors of yesterday was handed to me this morning you may be assured that the reason of my restricting you to your quarters the day before yesterday was personally no agreeable service duty to the honor and dignity of my country made it indispensably necessary apprehending that so great a restriction from your former limits as i pointed out might be construed by you a dissolution of your parole i thought it necessary and also reasonable that you should give a new one i wished that you might retain your quarters and at the same time have a free intercourse with the troops who are quartered at a distance from you this distance is so considerable that a parole is necessary i acknowledge that by the convention you are to be admitted on parole and this parole is for propriety of conduct under such admittance but that parole being forfeited by misconduct ceases to be and confinement in proportion to the offense no breach of the convention but fully justifiable upon every principle of reason and justice  it was never in my idea to take away your commission or dissolve your connection with the troops of the convention but while under confinement your power of acting might with propriety be suspended so far as respected the transacting of public business between myself and you but personal regard has prevented my going that length any further than to notify the next officer of your confinement  i do not insist that you as an officer in the british army are obliged to view the free independent and sovereign states of america in any other light than they are acknowledged by the government whose service you are in but under your present situation and circumstances i do insist that you shall not openly insult the honor and dignity of these sovereign states with impunity  i am sir your obedient servant signed w heath major general  maj genesis phillips  middlesex ss an inquest taken at cambridge within the said

have received the honor of yours of the   d by capt nevers  the day before yesterday one of our sentinels posted at the foot of prospecthill shot a lieut richard brown of the troops of the convention for not stopping when repeatedly challenged as he was riding out of the lines with two women the orders given to the sentinels being not to allow any officer without sidearms or noncommissioned officer private soldier woman or child without a written passport to pass the chain of sentries immediately upon my receiving the report of the officers being shot and that the sentinel was confined i gave orders for his being kept so and notice to be given to the coroner of the county of middlesex that a jury of inquest might sit on the body for the investigation of the truth of facts at the same time i wrote to maj genesis phillips  i do myself the honor to enclose copy thereof no   a few minutes after i received a paper from him no   the next morning i again wrote him no   and a parole no

phillips consequent upon the death of lieut richard brown of the troops of the convention  extract from the minutes charles thomson secretary  the whole of the foregoing correspondence was published by order of congress and our general was informed that it was left for him to conduct toward the british general as to the continuance of his arrest as he might judge the honor of the united states required genesis phillips continuing to exhibit the same temper or it rather growing upon him he was continued in his arrest until the troops of the convention were ordered to be removed to charlotteville in virginia it has before been observed that the officers had certain articles prescribed to them for their government in quarters and that these were drawn into the parole and subscribed by them if any abuses took place a court of inquiry was directed to investigate the complaints and report to our general thus giving the accused officers an opportunity to exculpate their conduct if it was in their power and no officer could wish more than our general to treat them with generosity and indulgence as far as was compatible with good order and discipline but notwithstanding the fairness of this mode of procedure genesis phillips forbid the officers appearing before any court so appointed and on the   th ult mr bibby the deputyadjutant general to the troops of the convention came into a court of inquiry and declared the following which in order to have the whole together we now retrospect  maj genesis phillips will not permit any officer under his command to be brought before a court of inquiry of the american troops for the purpose of scrutinizing their conduct but if any complaints are lodged against any british officers and maj genesis heath shall desire their conduct to be inquired into maj genesis phillips will give such orders as are customary in such cases among the british troops  by order of maj genesis phillips  signed those bibby dep adj genesis monday may         the same day genesis phillips sent a letter to our general expressive of the same sentiments to which the following answer was sent to him  headquarters boston may         sir your favor of yesterday came to hand the last evening and i must confess contained matter novel and surprising to me what ideas of a copartnership in command you have entertained i cannot tell from the beginning i have found a disposition in the senior officer of the convention to assume the right and authority of trying and punishing offenders for breaches of my orders this i ever have and ever shall view in no other light than that of insult as such i represented it to his excellency lieut genesis burgoyne whose good sense and thorough knowledge of discipline led him in a letter to me of the   th jan to yield the matter in the following words i do not mean to deny that you have a right to take justice into your own hands indeed it is a subject concerning which having heretofore said and wrote very fully i shall not at this time dwell long upon as to agreement or copartnership in command it is absurd in military command there must be one supreme head at present the honorable congress have honored me with the command of this department and i imagined that no officer within its limits would dare dispute it  my orders as i have repeatedly heretofore declared shall ever be founded on the principles of honor reason and justice and not to infringe those delicate principles in others so i again declare that such my orders shall not be broken or disputed by any officer or soldier placed under my direction with impunity the matter of command is no hidden mystery the usage and customs of nations are known the celebrated vattel puffendorff and grotius with whose writings i dare say you are acquainted elegantly explain how an army that submits to another whether the conditions are more or less honorary to themselves are to conduct whilst they remain within the limits of the victors camp or jurisdiction of their country but i shall not spend time to reason on a subject which would reflect dishonor on myself to allow even to be disputed therefore to sum up all in few words  that as i am determined to treat the troops of the convention with strict justice and generosity so i am determined that all offenders against my standing orders of the garrison shall be brought to proper punishment that i will not allow the senior officer of those troops to try or punish for any offense against my orders and that the truth may at all times be properly investigated i shall from time to time when occasion requires appoint courts of inquiry for that purpose and such as presume to dispute or counteract them i shall duly notice  i am etc signed w heath major general  maj genesis phillips  genesis phillips finding that he could not get any thing by assault he next tried his skill in attempting to sap with the policy of friendship he therefore wrote another letter of the same date under the name of  private  monday may   th      sir i have this morning written to you a letter upon public matters i will now assure you that i am sorry that my earnest desire of preserving a communication of intelligence between you and i does not meet your consent and i will lament that you will attend to the sudden reports you receive so fully and act upon them without that goodhumoured attention to me which i had hoped and have endeavored should subsist between us you and i are nearly of an age  i will not dispute understandings with you but i certainly am an older soldier and must necessarily know the customs of armies allow me to assure you the manner with which things are taken up sometimes deviates from military rule it is a fixed custom to go from the head downwards and when an ensign offends against order the general does not condescend to altercate with him but sends his orders his desire or his opinion to the commanding officers and in your sending messages to young officers it injures your own consequence and certainly hurts mine believe me that i am strict against any breach of orders and will never suffer it to pass uncensured i allow the two officers have behaved ill and i will punish them but the getting the countersign was an effect of good humor and simplicity in an american soldier let me once more request of you to recollect your own situation and it will put mine in a clear view to you whenever you have reports against any of our troops let me know them and i will give instant attention to them but you will i am sure immediately feel that sending a threat to two officers that you would send them on board a prisonship and never informing me wherefore was not strictly conformable to good humor or good discipline  i am with a very hearty desire of preserving harmony and order and with much personal regard  yours etc signed w phillips  maj genesis heath  to which the following answer was returned  headquarters boston may         sir having in my other letter of this date answered yours of yesterday i now reply to your favor of the same date which you are pleased to style private i can assure you sir that no person living wishes to act with good humor more than i do or would take more pains to cultivate harmony and a good understanding but in the present case you must not expect that i shall allow myself either by frowns or flatteries to give up the dignity of command reposed in me  i wish i am determined to extend every act of generosity toward the officers of the convention which is compatible with the safety and honor of my country i shall not take up matters suddenly or proceed rashly unless circumstances shall render it unavoidably necessary and although you may be possessed of a greater share of understanding than i am and an older soldier  yet i have endeavored to acquire a knowledge of my duty and the customs of armies and nations i am not conscious of any deviations from those rules or customs in general adopted by them  the general who commands is undoubtedly the fountain of power and all orders should descend from him through the proper officers until they are communicated to the lowest order of the army and that commander who disputes with or threatens young officers undoubtedly lessens his consequence and will soon become contemptible in the eyes of an army nothing of this was in the late transactions that i know of having received a report of the conduct of the two officers i ordered them to be confined to their quarters and appointed a court of inquiry to examine into the grounds of the complaint that i might have a clear understanding of the affair and order accordingly in all cases where you or the troops of the convention are immediately corcerned in the orders i have always directed that you should be served with a copy as to any threatenings being sent to the two officers of confining them on board a guardship i know nothing of it  the main difficulty seems to arise from your apprehension that you are to try and punish all offenders against my orders here sir notwithstanding your knowledge and age in soldiery you much mistake and cannot support those your pretensions by any rule or authority civil or military the moment you piled your arms and marched off the ground you became subject to the standing orders of the victor and in every jurisdiction through which you marched or where you remain are subject to all the orders and laws of the place and such as violate them are obnoxious to punishment the law and custom of nations explicitly tell us who are to try and punish and although i do not in the least doubt your ready disposition to inquire into and even to punish offenders against my orders  yet when you attempt it it is such an indignity offered to my authority that you may be assured it ever will raise my resentment and if it did not i am confident that yourself at least hereafter and all military men would despise me for my insensibility in a word sir cultivate those principles of obedience to orders among the officers in your situation recommended and inculcated by the custom and usage of nations and dictated by reason  and you may depend that i shall exert myself to make your situation as agreeable as possible and you may be also assured that i never shall require that of the troops of the convention which in the opinion of the just and wise in any country shall reflect dishonor on them with the strongest desire to cultivate and maintain harmony and to treat you with respect and with much personal regard  i am etc signed w heath  maj genesis phillips  the same feelings which had great weight in the beginning of the war continued for some time namely that great britain was one of the greatest and most powerful nations in the world in arts and in arms while the americans were yet their colonies young weak and but barely civilized ignorant of the world and especially so of arts and of arms hence we see it so frequently breaking out until experience had taught them a different opinion there was frequently as in the atmosphere placid intervals but whenever any cross wind happened to blow and there is no season or circumstances without them then instantly appeared those ideas of selfsuperiority and contempt for the americans which was the true cause of many uncomfortable hours mankind have the same passions the difference lies in some riding with a double curb while others give the reins  this convention business was a heavy task for our general and the whole subject would form an entertaining volume of itself we are now circumscribed by our limits and have only given a small specimen for mankind to form an opinion for themselves in all the letters or conversation which was had on the occasion we find scarcely a reflection cast by our general on the british nation the cause in which they were engaged or against any who were fortunate or unfortunate but a uniform desire to make those placed under his orders as comfortable as circumstances would admit at the same time an unshaken determination a perseverant watchfulness with decent language to defend the cause and honor of his own country by arguments supported by the customs and maxims of the civilized world the hundreds of letters on file are all proofs of this and in many instances it was politely acknowledged  the two following letters of different dates are some of the specimens  major harnage had his lady with him  cambridge october  0th      sir with great pleasure i acknowledge the favor of your obliging letter and mrs harnage joins me with capt hawker in returning you our sincere thanks for your kind representation of us and

ever acknowledged  believe me sir with respect your obliged humble servant henry harnage  maj genesis heath  cambridge june  0      sir being this moment informed that you are about to quit boston i must beg leave previous to your departure to trouble you with these our acknowledgments for the civility and attention you have been pleased to show us and to assure you that mrs harnage capt hawker and myself shall ever retain a due sense of all favors by which you have kindly endeavored to alleviate and make easy the restraints and disagreeable circumstances that unavoidably attend our present situation  we hope you will mention us to the gentleman who is to succeed to the command in the eastern department  wishing you all personal happiness i remain with respect sir  your most obedient and obliged humble servant henry harnage  the hon maj genesis heath    th  a spanish xebeck and a french cutter arrived at boston with dispatches from their respective courts which were forwarded to congress   0th  certain intelligence was received that the british had left philadelphia  july  th  intelligence was received that a warm action happened on the   th ult between genesis washingtons and genesis clintons armies near monmouth courthouse in the jersies genesis clinton having taken the resolution to move from philadelphia to new york through the jersies commenced his movements accordingly encumbered with an immense train of stores and baggage which occupied some miles in length and these are the greatest encumbrance to a general on a march of danger from an attack of his opponent to which he can be exposed  genesis washington was no sooner apprised of this intention and movement of the british general than he made his arrangements accordingly crossed the delaware and pushed detached corpse forward to obstruct the advance gall the flanks and fall on the rear of the enemy while he moved on with the body of his army by the   th genesis clinton had got on as far as monmouth and genesis washingtons detached troops were on his flanks and close on his rear here the british general took a wise resolution to make a stand with a part of his best troops while he pushed on his baggage through the difficult defiles under the careful and experienced hand of genesis kniphausen  genesis washington acting with equal skill and equal bravery made every arrangement which the moment called for on the morning of the   th he ordered maj genesis lee to attack the enemys rear himself moving on briskly to support him but to his surprise as he advanced on he met lees troops retreating and the enemy impetuously pursuing here was genesis washington seen in all his splendour for this critical situation is the orb in which he shines the brightest he rallied the retreating troops he inspired them by precept and by example and the misfortune of the morning was considerably retrieved  the americans fought bravely and so did the british after hard fighting in a most intense hot day when scores died of the heat and drinking too freely of cold water when they could find it both armies remained on the ground the americans determined to recommence the action early on the next morning but genesis clinton finding that his baggage had struggled pretty well through the defiles and had got tolerably well advanced took the advantage of the cool of the night to slip off unperceived by the americans and got to ground where he was safe some sharp words took place between genesis washington and maj genesis lee as the one advanced and the other retreated which issued in the arrest trial and suspension of the latter genesis washington reported to congress that the americans buried of the british   officers and     privates among the former the hon col monckton who was a brave and experienced officer and that there were a few prisoners the american loss killed   lieutenant colonel   major   captains   lieutenants   sergeant    rank and file  wounded   colonels

 bombadier were killed  one captain   sergeant   corporal   gunner and  0 matrosses wounded  one matross missing  six horses killed and two wounded both generals undoubtedly have much credit for their conduct in this action genesis clintons object being to reach new york with his baggage etc obtained this victory with the loss which he sustained genesis washingtons conduct was well calculated for victory on his side and how far he would have succeeded had it not been for the misfortune of the morning none can tell this misfortune began by exposing the american advanced troops in line on the side of the field where they were cannonaded by the british who at the same time wisely exposed only their artillery to that of the americans it is to be remembered that men may be led on to action in the face of a cannonade before which they will not stand the point of decision is in the mind while advancing although galled by the fire of their opponents the dead and wounded are left behind them as they fall and the troops feel an ardour for arriving in a few minutes at a point where they can use their own arms to retaliate for the injury they sustain but when men are placed open to the fire of the artillery of their enemy at such a distance as to prevent the use of their own arms in their defense the dead and wounded fall and lie among them or are drawn away and every groan they make is heard the troops soon conceive that they are placed as marks to be shot at while the greater policy of the enemy keeps their column or line out of the rake of their cannon the mind gives way and retreat will be inevitable this was experienced in this instance and the fairest hopes of a noble onset in a few minutes blasted and these were some of the best troops in the army too it was here that the firm col wesson had his back peeled of its muscles almost from shoulder to shoulder by a cannonball the confidence of the troops could not be fully recovered until they saw the presence of their beloved general    th  intelligence was received that the count destaing had arrived with the fleet under his command off the capes of delaware the fleet consisted of    sail of the line and   frigates off the coast of virginia they took a privateer fitted out of new york of    guns  a ship bound from new providence to london  recaptured a french snow laden with dry goods and drove a

their light infantry finding their way through the path in the swamp bringing of them on the flank and in the rear of the americans where they were not expected or not guarded against proved their overthrow a few shots on the flank or rear of an enemy serves to disconcert them more than a heavy fire in the front the point of decision here lies not in the force but in the mind a company of  0 men cannot fire more shots in the same given time on the flank or in the rear than they could in the front but these few shots will have more effect on the minds of the enemy than the fire of a whole regiment in their front the americans were vastly inferior in numbers to the british and must at any rate have been forced from the ground but the british lightinfantry passing through the swamp was

oclock p m our general received orders from genesis washington to march with the two connecticut brigades by the way of crom pond toward bedford the next morning although rainy the first brigade marched to the village    th  the storm ceasing the tents although as wet as water could make them were struck and the troops took up their line of march reaching amiwalk about sunsetting a report having been spread in the fore part of the day that the enemy were at or near pines bridge our general ordered the baggagewaggons under proper escort to file off to the left and pursue a road running parallel with the one on which the column was moving thereby keeping the column between the enemy and the wagons both arrived on the ground of encampment within a few minutes of each other the troops lay on their arms without pitching their tents the enemy continued their depredations at the sound and burnt some houses at norwalk    th  at   oclock a m the troops took up their line of march and reached ridgefield where they halted for the night the next morning our general sent off all the tents and other baggage to danbury and took up his line of march toward stamford when he ascended the high grounds in sight of the sound the enemys fleet was observed under sail standing off and on between stamford and long island about    oclock two deserters from genesis clintons army came to our troops they had left the british army two or three hours before at which time the enemy were on the point of making a movement the corpse of guides and pioneers being then assembled at genesis clintons quarters this called for the exercise of discretion the troops on board the transports with genesis tryon if the whole should land were far inferior to the force with our general but the main british army with general clinton was by far superior to his if the whole of the americans had marched down to stamford clinton by five or six hours forced marching might have crossed his rear and have cut him off from a communication with the highlands he therefore resolved to march forward to the cross roads one of which went directly to the british army another to stamford and in his rear to the highlands here he took a position in order of battle and detached col starrs and meigs rments with one fieldpiece to stamford whose proach toward the town in open view would prevent tryon from landing or in case he did with superior force the detachment might be surrounded in this situation the troops remained until dusk and then took a more advantageous position for the night the whole lying on their arms in order of battle early on the morning of the   th our general received information that the shipping had gone down toward new york he therefore moved and took a strong position between ridgefield and bedford sending out patroles of horse and foot on all the roads this movement toward the sound quieted the minds of the people and saved stamford and other towns from destruction  while the attention of both the grand armies and of the adjacent country was turned toward the sound the great washington ordered general wayne to strike at stoney point with the lightinfantry which lay not far distant from that post this was done with great promptitude the works being carried by assault and the whole garrison made prisoners of war with all the artillery ammunition stores etc this was a most brilliant affair  in advancing to the assault the front of the american column led with unloaded arms relying solely on the use of the bayonet as they approached the works a soldier insisted on loading his piece  all was now a profound silence  the officer commanding the platoon ordered him to keep on the soldier observed that he did not understand attacking with his piece unloaded he was ordered not to stop at his peril he still persisted and the officer instantly dispatched him a circumstance like this shocks the feelings but it must be considered how fatal the consequence would have been if one single gun had been fired scores would have lost their lives and most probably defeat have been consequent and therefore this was the lesser evil  on the morning of the   th signal guns were heard in the sound toward new york at intervals from two oclock until daylight genesis clintons army moved to milesquare  stoney point having been taken with so much eclat to the american arms genesis washington determined an attempt on verplanks point on the east side of the hudson and opposite to stoney point for this purpose maj genesis how with two brigades and some   pounders on traveling carriages was ordered to proceed by the way of peeks kill throw a bridge over the creek move on to the point and open batteries against the enemys works while a cannonade and bombardment was kept up across the river from stoney point    th  at about  0 oclock a m our general while out reconnoitring received by an express from genesis washington orders to move as expeditiously as possible to peeks kill where he would find genesis how with two brigades our general was to take the command of the whole and carry into effect the orders which had been given to genesis how our general returned immediately to the troops and at    oclock began his march toward peeks kill  marched until dusk    miles when the troops halted and laid down to rest on the side of the road the dragoons not unsaddling their horses at   oclock the next morning the troops resumed their march and in the afternoon our general received information from genesis how by express that genesis clinton was on full march with his whole army toward verplanks point an answer was returned at what point the troops then were and that they were marching as fast as the men could endure and would continue so until they reached him when the troops had advanced a little to the westward of drakes farm col movian came up from genesis how with information that a part of clintons army were then above the new bridge on croten river pushing for the point and that he w retreating from the point as fast as possible on this our general ordered genesis huntington with his brigade and two fieldpieces to push forward as fast as the troops could march and keep in breath and take a position on the high ground to the south of peeks kill which commands the road to the point and also that to the new bridge on croten river and ordered a regiment to file off to the right and secure the pass over the hills between drakes and peeks kill and also ordered the flankguard on the left to be reinforced and to send out small flankguards still further from its flank the troops moving on with the utmost expedition to the ground which genesis huntington had been ordered forward to secure every moment that passed was expected to announce the commencement of an action between the advanced or flanking parties of the two armies but it did not take place at this moment genesis washington having learnt how matters stood and that possibly genesis clinton might attempt to push into the highlands sent an express to our general to move into the highlands immediately which was done just after dark the troops passing the night on bald hill it was generally the opinion that if our general had not been at hand to advance in the manner he did that genesis clinton by a forced march of his light troops backed by his army would have got in the rear of genesis how before he could have possibly gained the road at peeks kill and between his army and a sally from the garrison of verplanks point inevitably cut off the whole our troops at stoney point cannonaded and bombarded the enemys works at verplanks during  whole day and until near midnight the post  evacuated and the washington galley was  up  th  the troops moved from bald hill pars brigade to robinsons huntingtons and pattersons to nelsons nixons to the gorge of the mountains  on the morning of the  0th the british army

advanceguard consisting of a sergeant and   men who behaved well and meant to reach the main body in season but were prevented by the horse and all taken prisoners the enemys horse soon appeared in

up to his hips two of the enemys horse turned into his track after him and gaining fast upon him he asked them if they would give him quarter they replied yes you dog we will quarter you this was twice repeated when mayhew finding them inflexible determined to give them one shot before he was quartered and turning round discharged his piece at the first horseman who cried out the rascal has

the harbor where they could have had sea room remained in the bay the enemy sent a naval force to the relief of the post which arrived and found the american shipping in the river who immediately ran up as far as they could where the whole were destroyed and the militia and seamen left to find their way home through the woods this was an unfortunate affair to massachusetts whose privateers before were numerous able and active and greatly annoyed the enemy and had it not been for this blow would have been of great public benefit by depriving the enemy of many of their provision vessels and of increasing provisions in our own country congress at first seemed to decline bearing the expense as they had never been consulted respecting the expedition but they finally consented to a reimbursement  congress ordered that  00 men in the pay of the united states should cover and protect the eastern country the ensuing summer    th  the gentlemen of boston gave a ball to the french

the   th exhibited a most extraordinary phenomenon the wind in the morning was southerly a moderate breeze the sun shone a little after it was up but was soon clouded there was some thunder and moderate showers a little after  0 oclock the clouds exhibited a yellowish cast and every object seemed to present a brassy hue it soon after began to grow dark which gradually increased between eleven and twelve it became necessary to light candles to do household business the darkness increased until near one oclock p m the inhabitants dining by candlelight about one the darkness began to decrease and went off gradually as it came on between three and four p m the usual light was restored the evening although the moon was at the full was remarkably dark and there was a sprinkling of rain  the people were in great consternation this phenomenon in the opinion of our general although he has no pretensions to astronomy was produced by opposite winds forcing together a vast body of smoke and vapors the air had been smoaky for some days before which from the light state of the atmosphere as they accumulated ascended forming from top to bottom such a body as to cause the darkness and yet so open were the particles as to admit the suns rays so far as to cause the brassy appearance had the atmosphere been heavy the vapors would probably have condensed and rain in torrents would have ensued some observations made by our general some years since the foregoing on the darkness in canada and which on the afternoon of the preceding day he noticed at roxbury and remarked thereon afford strong collateral evidence that the foregoing opinion was not wholly unfounded  as the learned and curious wish to ascertain as far as possible the true cause of the phenomenon we throw in those rough materials which our observation at the time collected that they may be shaped by those of greater skill for the information and satisfaction of an enlightened public those called the dark days in canada were the  th   th and   th of october      but the greatest degree of darkness was on sunday the   th when the darkness was so great as to render the use of candles necessary in the churches and families it is said to have been as dark as a dark night  on the  th at roxbury in massachusetts the wind was at southeast and then at southwest the day fair cool and pleasant  the   th the prevailing wind was easterly the day was cloudy and foggy about   oclock p m it was uncommonly dark and there was an opposite wind from the southwest there were several hard claps of thunder at a distance and a few drops of rain toward evening the sun was visible but appeared very red and the clouds exhibited a brassy complexion so similar to the dark day in may    0 as to be noticed and compared in the evening the wind was southerly  the   th which was the dark day in canada the wind there at opposite points n e and s w was at roxbury s w the day was fair warm and pleasant from which it seems to be obvious that the body of smoke and vapor with which the atmosphere was fraught on the   th which pervaded a region which comprehended canada and a part of new england at least was by the strength of the southwest wind in the night forced northward and being still opposed by the northeast wind pressing on the other side produced the accumulation of smoke and vapor which occasioned the darkness and if the northeast wind had prevailed against the southwest the darkness would probably have been in new england    st  capt latouch returned from his cruize he ran into penobscot bay and cast anchor firing several signal guns two british sloops of war which were at anchor upon the approach of the hermeone came to sail and ran up the river capt latouch lay at anchor until he took a

the intelligence necessary to direct their operations i have already sent forward doctor craik to take up proper houses for hospitals and to make some previous arrangements in that department but i

immediately to providence and upon their arrival present yourself to them letting them know that they may command your services  i would wish you to endeavor in conjunction with the governor to establish a market between the fleet and army and country and be careful that our allies are not imposed upon in the prices of articles which they may find necessary this is a point recommended in the

out to apprize the french and point them to another port several works and batteries next to the harbor were mantled with cannon    d  the british fleet were cruizing off all the day and rather nearer than they were the preceding day eighteen or nineteen sail were counted eight or nine of which appeared to be of the line the french squadron kept their former station in the harbor and in the most

from genesis washington  robinsons house july       0 dear sir i arrived here last night having met your favors of the   th and   th at paramus where the army then lay immediately upon hearing that the transports with the troops which had been some days on board had sailed eastward i put the army in motion again they will cross the ferry to day and will be joined by the troops from hence i propose moving as rapidly as possible down toward kingsbridge which will either oblige the enemy to abandon their project against rhode island or may afford us an opportunity of striking them to advantage in this quarter if sir henry clinton has carried with him the number of men reported eight thousand and with less than which i think he would scarcely risk an attempt upon count rochambeau reinforced by the militia  i entirely approve of the measures you have taken for calling in aid and have the strongest hopes that if sir henry should venture upon an attack that he will meet a reception very different from what he expects you know the critical situation in which this army will be in a position below and how much depends upon constant intelligence of the motions of the enemy i shall direct relays of expresses the whole way between this army and you to convey intelligence in the most expeditious manner the nearest express to you will be upon tower hill and genesis green advises that you should keep two whaleboats to communicate with him by southferry so long as that passage shall be safe and if that should be interrupted by bissells harbor  signed geo washington ps i wish the count de rochambeau had taken a position on the main  g w     the militia came in with great spirit they were formed into brigades and every disposition made for instant and vigorous defense at every point where it was supposed an attempt might be made the batteries were strengthened a very strong one erected on roseisland and redoubts on coastersisland the strong works on buttshill pushed avenues across the fields by the shortest routes were opened from the encampment of the french army to those points where their instant presence was judged necessary and such marks fixed at small distances from each other as to prevent any mistake in the route either by day or night indeed no one precaution was omitted or probable advantage of ground or situation neglected had sir henry made the attempt which he menaced he would undoubtedly have met a warm reception but for some reason or other he gave up his design and the militia were again sent home perhaps on no occasion did the militia discover more ardour in pressing to the field or more regularity when there than at that time which was every where testified by the inhabitants  our general had expressed a wish to the commander in chief to join the main army that he might enjoy that command to which he was at that time entitled viz the right wing to which genesis washington in a letter dated august  d replied  as to your coming on to the army immediately i shall leave it entirely to yourself to act in the affair as you please your command is and will always be ready for you however if you find your presence where you are necessary and that it will contribute to the accommodation of our allies and to the cultivation of harmony matters about which i am very anxious it may possibly be more eligible for you to remain longer as we shall not probably have any instant active operations but as i have already said do in the matter as you like and as circumstances may decide  and in a subsequent letter some days after he observed as to your wishes to join the army as i observed before your aid may be very material to the count and as we have no prospect of immediate active operations i would rather wish you to remain with him longer i thought it essential in the first instance that there should be an officer of rank sent to him and a variety of reasons concurred to induce me to believe that you would answer the important objects i had in view as well at least as any i could choose i have not been disappointed in the least in my expectation and the count himself judges your continuing very essential and expressed himself in the following manner upon the subject several days ago i shall keep with me if you think proper genesis heath whose ardour spirit and activity are absolutely necessary to me for these several considerations i wish you to reconcile yourself to remaining with him a while which will be the more easy when you consider that you will be fully advertised whenever we are in a situation to attempt any thing offensive on a great scale and will have your command  the british ship of war the galetea appeared off dartmouth the british fleet went to gardners bay

army and request that you will do it you will come to headquarters yourself the route through litchfield will be the most eligible for you on account of security and you may direct your baggage to halt at fishkill for your further orders i write to the count de rochambeau by this conveyance and i trust that your coming away now will not be attended with any material inconvenience to him  i cannot conclude without informing you of an event which has happened here which will strike you with astonishment and indignation  maj genesis arnold has gone to the enemy he had had an interview with major andre adjutantgeneral of the british army and had put into his possession a state of the army of the garrison at this post of the number of men considered as necessary for the defense of it a return of the ordnance and the disposition of the artillery corpse in case of an alarm by a most providential interposition major andre was taken in returning to new york with all these papers in genesis arnolds handwriting who hearing of the matter kept it to himself left his quarters immediately under pretext of going over to west point on monday forenoon about an hour before my arrival then pushed down the river in the barge which was not discovered till i had returned from westpoint in the afternoon and when i received the first information of mr andres capture measures were instantly taken to apprehend him but before the officers sent for the purpose could reach verplanks point he had passed it with a flag and got on board the vulture ship of war which lay a few miles below he knew of my approach and that i was visiting with the marquis the north and middle redoubts and from this circumstance was so straitened in point of time that i believe he carried with him but very few if any material papers though he has a very precise knowledge of the  of the post the gentlemen of genesis arnolds  i have the greatest reason to believe were not privy in the least degree to the measure he was carrying on or to his escape  signed g washington   genesis arnolds panic was so great when he found that the plot was discovered that he called out for a horse any horse that first came to hand if it were a waggonhorse upon the horses being brought the general mounted and instead of passing to the landing by the usual path he rode down a steep bank where it seemed impossible for a horse with a rider to get down without being unhorsed  when arnold had passed verplanks point and had got under the guns of the vulture he told corporal larvey who was cockswain of the barge that he was going on board the ship and that he should not return that if he larvey would stay with him he should have a commission in the british service to this larvey who was a smart fellow replied that he would be d  d if he fought on both sides the general replied that he would send him on shore arnold then told the barge crew that if any or all of them would stay with him they should be treated well but if they declined staying they should be sent on shore one or two staid the rest with the cockswain were sent on shore in the ships boat the barge was kept larvey for his fidelity was made a sergeant he thought he had merited more that he ought to have had as much as arnold promised him he continued uneasy until at his repeated request he was allowed to leave the army  maj andre on his return toward new york fell in with three young men below the lines john paulding david williams and isaac van vert they did not at first know that andre was a british officer and he was at a loss whether they were british refugees or staunch americans there was consequently a little finesse exhibited on both sides but at length it was fully discovered who andre was he then attempted to bribe the young men by offering them a large sum of money but their fidelity was too great to be purchased they brought him up and delivered him to the americans where he was tried sentenced and hanged as a spy the british general on the river endeavored to save his life first by threats and then by persuasions but all was in vain maj andres behavior until the time of his execution was becoming an officer and a gentleman and such in his last moments as drew tears from many eyes but it must be remembered that he who consents to become a spy when he sets out has by allusion a halter put round his neck and that by the usage of armies if he be taken the other end of the halter is speedily made fast to a gallows  congress pleased with the conduct of john paulding david williams and isaac van vert passed a resolution on the  th of october directing that  00 dollars in specie should be annually paid to them during life and that a silver medal descriptive of their fidelity with the thanks of congress should be presented to each of them  the situation of the british army and other circumstances at the moment andre was detected were such as render it highly probable that if he had not been taken the most serious consequences to the american cause would very soon have taken place  october  st  the next day after our general received the letter from genesis washington he took a most affectionate leave of the french officers and left newport to prepare to go on to the army his waggonhorses were out in the country at a distance these were to be brought in shod etc and other preparations to be made which prevented his leaving providence until the afternoon of the  th when he was attended out of town by a number of officers and other gentlemen before he left providence he bid count rochambeau another farewell by letter to which an answer was forwarded on after him as follows  newport oct       0 my dear general i have received the letter that you honored me with from

to rhode island taking the lower road through connecticut many of the soldiers who had gone through the smallpox joined their regiments the next day of  00 who had been inoculated four only had then died at this time provisions were growing very scarce at westpoint and the prospects daily growing more alarming the magazines in forts clinton putnam and some other of the most important works had reserves of the best provisions which were not to be touched that in case the enemy by any sudden movement should invest them and cut off the communication with the country the garrisons might be enabled to hold out until other troops or the militia of the country could march to the relief of the besieged but unfortunately the scarcity of provisions had become so great that even these reserves were broken in upon and some of them nearly exhausted when after some other representations our general addressed the following letter to genesis washington  westpoint may        dear general i am honored with yours of the  th and  th to which i shall duly attend  i hoped i should not have been compelled again to represent our situation on account of provisions but supplies of meat have not arrived  all the irish beef in the store has been gone for some days  we are at last forced in upon the reserves that in fort clinton has all been taken out this day  the pork which was ordered to be reserved is all issued except about    barrels  the boats are now up from below for provisions with representations that they are out the reserves will be gone in a few days if relief does not arrive and hunger must inevitably disperse the troops if the authority of our country will not order on supplies i will struggle to the last moment to maintain the post but regard to my own character compels me to be thus explicit  that if any ill consequences happen to this post or its dependencies through want of provisions i shall not hold myself accountable for them  i have the honor to be etc signed w heath  his excellency genesis washington  to which the commander in chief wrote the following answer  headquarters newwindsor may  th      dear sir distressed beyond expression at the present situation and future prospects of the army with regard to provisions and convinced with you that unless an immediate and regular supply can be obtained the most dangerous consequences are to be apprehended  i have determined to make one great effort more on the subject and must request that you will second and enforce my representations to and requisitions upon the new england states by your personal application to the several executives and even assemblies if sitting as i suppose they will be in the course of this month  from your intimate knowledge of our embarrassed and distressed circumstances and great personal influence with the eastern states i am induced to commit the execution of this interesting and important business to you and wish you to set out on this mission as early as may be convenient  signed geo washington  maj genesis heath  on the next day our general received the following letter of instructions from the commander in chief viz  headquarters newwindsor may  th      dear sir you will be pleased to proceed immediately to the several eastern states with the dispatches addressed to the governors of connecticut rhode island massachusetts bay and the president of new hampshire on the subject of supplies for the army the present critical and alarming situation of our troops and garrisons for the want of provisions is from the nature of your command so perfectly known to you and your personal influence with the new england states is so considerable that i could not hesitate to commit to you a negotiation on the success of which the very existence of the army depends  the great objects of your attention and mission are  st  an immediate supply of beef cattle  d  the transportation of all the salted provisions in the western parts of connecticut and massachusetts and  d  the establishment of a regular systematic effectual plan for feeding the army through the campaign unless the two former are effected the garrison of fort schuyler must inevitably that of westpoint may probably fall and the whole army be disbanded without the latter the same perplexing wants irregularities and distress which we have so often experienced will incessantly occur with eventual far greater evils if not final ruin  with regard to the particular mode of obtaining and transporting supplies i will not presume to dictate but something must now be attempted on the spur of the occasion i would suggest whether it would not be expedient for a committee from the several states consisting of a few active sensible men to meet at some convenient place in order to make out upon a uniform and great scale all the arrangements respecting supplies and transportation for the campaign in the mean time to avoid the impending dissolution of the army the states must individually comply precisely with the requisitions of the quartermaster and commissary upon them  as the salted provisions which have been put up for the public in the eastern states except in the western parts of connecticut and massachusetts cannot at present be transported to the army you will obtain accurate official returns of the quantity that has been procured in the respective states at what places and in whose charge it actually is and if it should not all be collected and lodged in the deposits that have been pointed out you will urge this immediately to be done and that the provisions should be repacked stored and taken care of in such a manner as to prevent the hazard of its being tainted or lost by the approaching hot season  i omit entering into the detail of particulars which it may be necessary to state to the respective executives or legislatures if in sitting to enforce the present requisition because you are as well acquainted with the circumstances of our distress the prospects before us and the only resources from whence we can derive relief as it is possible for you to be previous to your departure you will obtain from the quartermastergeneral and commissary with the army the proper estimates of supplies and transportation to be required of the several states together with all the light and information concerning their department which may be requisite to transact the business committed to you  after having delivered the dispatches with which you are charged and made such further representations as you may judge necessary you will not cease your applications and importunities until you are informed officially whether effectual measuares are or will be taken to prevent the army from starving and disbanding what supplies in general and particularly of beef cattle may certainly be depended upon to be delivered at fixed regular periods monthly or weekly at the army during the whole campaign when you shall have seen this business put upon the surest footing and in the best train of execution which you will endeavor to have effected as early as possible you will be pleased to report to me without delay the success of your proceedings  i heartily wish you success and a pleasant journey and am etc  signed g washington ps i wish attention may be paid to learn what quantity of rum is in store at what places and in what manner it may be forwarded in transportation the arrangements should be made with the states so as to have the articles brought entirely through to the army without having them

received from the commander in chief the dispatches addressed to the several executives of the new england states and in the afternoon crossed the hudson on his journey eastward on his reaching fishkill he found that governor clinton of new york was making every exertion in his power for the relief of the army  that he had issued impress warrants to take flour and other provisions where they could be found etc    th  he arrived at hartford where he found the legislature in session the dispatches to governor trumbull were immediately presented to him with an earnest request for speedy relief this venerable patriot gave assurance of his immediate attention and exertions and accordingly laid the dispatches from genesis washington before the legislature who also discovered the same noble patriotism they inquired into the state of their treasury and finding it was destitute of money except a sum appropriated to another purpose they ordered this money to be taken and directed col champion one of their number a gentleman remarkable for his knowledge in the state of provisions in all the towns skill in purchasing and expedition in forwarding immediately to purchase and forward on to the army   0 head of beef cattle and  000 barrels of salted provisions from their stores and resolved to make every other exertion in their power to comply with the requisitions of the commander

assurances that the state of rhode island would adopt every measure recommended by the commander in chief our general left greenwich the same day and arrived at his house in roxbury on the evening of the   th and the next day waited upon gov hancock at boston and presented the dispatches with which he was charged the new legislature of massachusetts were to convene on the last wednesday of the month gov hancock gave the fullest assurances that in the interim the executive would do every thing in its power for the immediate relief of the army by directing the several contractors of provisions in the state to forward all in their power with the utmost expedition    st  intelligence was received at boston that the state shipofwar the protector of    guns commanded by capt williams

surprised by a body of the enemys horse supposed to be about   0 dragoons and that the colonel maj flagg two subalterns and    men were killed and several wounded col green was a brave and intrepid officer and his loss was much regretted the colonel had taken post above and near to croten river at a place where the river was fordable to prevent the enemy passing up by this ford to ravage the country he had practiced the greatest vigilance in guarding this ford in the night time taking off the guards after sunrise apprehending that the enemy would never presume to cross the river in the day time but the enemy having learnt his mode of doing duty on the morning of the   th effected his overthrow by crossing the ford soon after the guards had come off and surrounding their quarters before they had an idea of any enemy being near them in this situation the utmost exertion could not then avail them    d  our general left roxbury on his way to new hampshire arrived at exeter on the

heard before a committee of both houses on the subject of his mission the zeal and patriotism of the several executives and legislatures of the new england states to relieve and ply supply the army with provisions were so conspicuous on this occasion that it is not possible to say which or whether any one of them exceeded the other each was for making every exertion in its power and to ensure success to their resolutions they all fell in with the recommendation of the commander in chief and appointed committees to meet in convention to digest and systemize the business the committees met accordingly at providence in rhode island and were so fortunate in their arrangements that the most ample supplies of meat were afterward furnished for the main army and a surplus of  00 head of beef cattle weekly sent on after genesis washington toward virginia until he ordered a discontinuance of that supply as will appear in the sequel while the new england states were thus intent in supplying meat for the army the state of new york was equally assiduous in furnishing flour and forage   th  intelligence was received by a vessel from the west indies that the count de grass with a french fleet of upwards of  0 sail of the line had arrived in that quarter the same day there was a confirmation of this news and that the fleet with troops on board was seen coming this way  the same day

was made to change their position this was unfortunately taken by genesis greenes army for a retreat and the whole army retreated accordingly genesis green had    men killed his retreat was about   or

time and swam on shore relating what had happened he also reported that the savage was several times hulled by our shot and must have suffered considerable loss the late skirmish near kings bridge was occasioned by the american armys moving down in order to give the french officers a view of the british outposts near the bridge a number of americans were killed and wounded by long shot from the yaugers of the enemy who kept up a popping fire whenever they could reach our troops    th  our general arrived at the army which was encamped at phillipsburgh in two lines the park of artillery in the center of the second line accounts had been received from the southward that the enemy had no footing in georgia except savannah nor in south carolina except charleston the position which the american army now occupied was between the lines the preceding campaigns consequently the roads and commons as well as the fields and pastures were covered with grass while the many deserted houses and ruined fences depicted the horrid devastations of war the french army under genesis rochambeau was encamped at a small distance on the left of the americans in one line    th  a forage was made toward phillipss conducted by col scammel it was said that some of the british troops had returned from the southward to new york and that those in virginia were collected at portsmouth  august  on

three ships and a galley lay in the river between fort washington and spittendevil creek the enemy did not make any movements the morning of the  th about   oclock the army was awakened by the firing of cannon at dobbs ferry it appeared that   of the enemys gunboats had come up as high as the ferry probably to endeavor to seize some vessels or boats on finding that they were discovered they fired four cannon but to no effect four cannon were discharged at the boats from the battery on which they went down the river two days before delancys corpse ventured as far above kings bridge as phillipss  news was received that the great french financier neckar had resigned and that monsieur fleury had been appointed in his room  capt saltonstall formerly of the frigate warren who was dismissed the service on account of his conduct in the penobscot expedition about this time behaved most gallantly in a privateer on a cruize against the enemy  the american army at this time continued in the same

the army a french frigate arrived about this time at rhode island supposed to have brought news of the approach of the count de grass a few nights before genesis schuyler came very near being taken and carried off from his house in albany  in the general orders of the   th the army was directed to hold itself in the most perfect readiness to march on the shortest notice    th  it was whispered that the count de grass with    sail of the line besides frigates with a number of land forces on board might soon be expected on our coast and these with the squadron under the command of the chevalier de barras would make a fleet of    sail of the line a force probably superior to any the british could assemble in these seas  under prospects so flattering the commander in chief determined to strike the enemy a capital blow in some quarter to strike at their very root in new york was a most disirable object but the situation of new york with long island and statenisland and the adjacent country was such as would require a very large army to effect a complete investiture and give a proper security against the sallies of the enemy which from situation might be easily and frequently made  that such an army must be composed in a very considerable degree of militia to whom the continuing long in camp had often been found disagreeable and the french were not without apprehensions that if their fleet entered the harbor of new york and became warmly engaged with the british ships and batteries in the course of those maneuvers which it might be necessary to make some of their heavy ships through the want of a competent knowledge of all parts of the bay might get aground or be damaged while all these inconveniences would be avoided in case lord cornwallis with the british army in virginia were made the object and his capture would be almost certain while the american main army might be left in sufficient strength to act on the defensive against sir henry clinton and effectually cover the important posts in the highlands of new york    th  general washington was pleased to communicate to our general in confidence his intentions at the same time intimating to him that he should give him the command of the main army during his absence the whole of the french army with the two regiments of new jersey first regiment of new york col hazens regiment col olneys regiment of rhode island col lambs regiment of artillery and the light troops under the command of col scammel were detached for the expedition against lord cornwallis and the army under his command at yorktown in virginia    th  some of the corpse began to move toward the serries the next day the commander in chief was pleased to honor our general with the following  to  general heath sir you are to take command of all the troops remaining in this department consisting of the two regiments of new hampshire ten of massachusetts and five of connecticut infantry the corpse of invalids sheldons legion the  d regiment of artillery together with all such state troops and militia as are retained in service of those which would have been under my own command  the security of westpoint and the posts in the highlands is to be considered as the first object of your attention in order to effect this you will make such dispositions as in your judgment the circumstances shall from time to time require taking care to have as large a supply of salted provisions as posfible constantly on hand to have the fortifications works and magazines repaired and perfected as far as may be to have the garrison at least in all cases kept up to its present strength to have the minutes plans and arrangements for the defense and support of this important post perfectly understood and vigorously executed in case of any attempt against it ample magazines of wood and forage are to be laid in against the approaching winter the former should be cut on the margin of the river and transported to the garrison by water the latter ought to be collected from the country below the lines in the greatest quantities possible and deposited in such places as you shall judge proper  the force now put under your orders it is presumed will be sufficient for all the purposes above mentioned as well as to yield a very considerable protection and cover to the country without hazarding the safety of the posts in the highlands this is to be esteemed as it respects the friendly inhabitants and resources of the country and extremely interesting object but when compared with the former of a secondary nature the protection of the northern and western frontier of the state of new york as well as those parts of that and other states most contiguous and exposed to the ravages and depredations of the enemy will claim your attention but as the contingencies which are to be expected in the course of this campaign may be so various unforeseen and almost infinite that no particular line of conduct can be prescribed for them  upon all such occasions you will be governed by your own prudence and discretion on which the fullest confidence is placed  although your general rule of conduct will be to act on the defensive only yet it is not meant to prohibit you from striking a blow at the enemys posts or detachments should a fair opportunity present itself the most eligible position for your army in my opinion will be above that is on the north side of the croten as well for the purpose of supporting the garrison of west point annoying the enemy and covering the country as for the security and repose of your own troops  waterburys brigade which may be posted toward the sound sheldons corpse the state troops of new york and other light parties may occasionally be made use of to hold the enemy in check and carry on the petitguerre with them but i would recommend keeping your force as much collected and compact as the nature of the service will admit doing duty by corpse instead of detachments whenever it is practicable and above all exerting yourself most strenuously and assiduously while the troops are in a camp of repose to make them perfect in their exercise and maneuvers and to establish the most perfect system of discipline and duty the good of the service and emulation of corpse will i am persuaded prompt the officers and men to devote their whole time and attention to the pleasing and honorable task of becoming masters of their profession the uncertainty which the present movement of the army will probably occasion with the enemy ought to be increased by every means in your power and the deception kept up as long as possible it will not be expedient to prevent the militia which were ordered from coming in until the arrival of the count de grass or something definite and certain is known from the southward and even these circumstances may but of this you will be advised render it advisable to keep the enemy at new york in check  prevent their detaching to reinforce their southern army or to harass the inhabitants on the seacoasts  the redoubt on the east side of dobbs ferry is to be dismantled and demolished the platforms to be taken up and transported up the river if it can be conveniently done the blockhouse on the other side to be maintained or evacuated and destroyed as you shall judge proper the waterguards and other precautions to prevent surprise you will be pleased to take into your consideration and regulate in such a manner as you shall judge most expedient you will be pleased to keep me regularly advised of every important event which shall take place in your departments  given under my hand at headquarters near dobbs ferry this   th day of august      signed geo washington p s by the act of congress of the  d of oct    0 a return is to be made to them annually on or before the first of september of the troops belonging to the several states that requisitions may be made for completing the same this you will please to have done by the troops under your command  the preservation of the boats is a matter of very great importance to which you will attend let all the new boats and such others as are not absolutely necessary and allotted to the service of the garrison be hauled up and put under the care of a guard so that the person to whom they are committed shall be accountable for every boat  the abuses committed by people belonging to commissioned whaleboats on long island ought to be inquired into and suppressed especially as congress have ordered those commissions to be revoked  g w       th  about noon his excellency genesis washington left the army setting his face toward his native state in full confidence to use his own words with a common blessing of capturing lord cornwallis and his army while our general was left to watch sir henry clinton and guard against those attempts which it was probable he would make to succor cornwallis direct or by making such other movements as might tend to induce genesis washington to give up his object or to avail himself of some important posts in his absence sir henry clinton was consequently on the rack to devise something which should effect this purpose a stroke at the posts in the highlands connecticut new jersey albany and philadelphia was contemplated against all this had our general to guard  let impartiality judge and candor

others col ledyard captains saltonstall and richards the enemy in three assaults on the fort on groton side of the river were repulsed but on the fourth attempt carried it the militia collecting in greater numbers with some pieces of artillery the enemy retreated on board their shipping part of the american shipping in the harbor were scuttled and some were run up the river in governor trumbulls letter the enemy were charged with behaving in a wanton and barbarous manner and that of between  0 and  0 men who were killed   only were killed before the enemy entered the fort and the garrison had submitted that on col ledyards delivering his sword reversed to the commanding officer who entered the fort the officer immediately plunged it in the colonels body on which several soldiers bayoneted him it is also asserted that upon the foregoing taking place an american officer who stood near to col ledyard instantly stabbed the british officer who stabbed the colonel on which the british indiscriminately bayoneted a great number of americans  this expedition was commanded by arnold the british loss was very considerable in killed and wounded among the former was major montgomery arnold himself continued on the new london side and while his troops were plundering and burning was said to have been at a house where he was treated very politely that while he was sitting with the gentleman regaling himself the latter observed that he hoped his house and property would be safe he was answered that while he arnold was there it would not be touched but the house except the room in which they were was soon plundered and found to be on fire during the plunder of the town the british as is always the case in a plunder were in great confusion setting their arms against trees and fences while they were collecting and carrying off their plunder in this situation they might have been easily defeated nor would it have been the first time that an army in possession of victory lost it in this way hence by the articles of war if any officer or soldier shall leave his post or colors to go in search of plunder he is liable to suffer death for the offense  it is not meant to exculpate or to aggravate the conduct of the enemy on this occasion  but two things are to be remembered first that in almost all cases the slaughter does but begin when the vanquished give way and it has been said that if this was fully considered troops would never turn their backs if it were possible to face their enemy secondly in all attacks by assault the assailants between the feelings of danger on the one hand and resolution to overcome it on the other have their minds worked up almost to a point of fury and madness which those who are assailed from a confidence in their works do not feel and that consequently when a place is carried and the assailed submit the assailants cannot instantaneously curb their fury to reason and in this interval many are slain in a way which a cool bystander would call wanton and barbarous and even the perpetrators themselves when their rage subsided would condemn but while the human passions remain as they now are there is scarcely a remedy

fortysix loads of forage were brought off from below the lines mr rivington published another account of the naval engagement between the fleets on the   th he acknowledged that several ships were much damaged and that two which had come from the west indies leaky were more so after the engagement that in particular the terrible was so much damaged as occasioned the taking out her guns etc and setting her on fire after which the fleet returned to the hook finding it impracticable to succor lord cornwallis it was said that the troops which had embarked about  000 had debarked on staten

genesis green thought it advisable to call off his troops which was done and the wounded brought off except such as were under the fire of the house four brass sixpounders having had their horses killed were also lest near the house in possession of the enemy this was somewhat similar to what took place at germantown battle and now very probably saved the british from a total defeat the close

by the french troops and soon carried with but little loss the possession of these redoubts gave the allied army in a great measure the command of the other works of the enemy who on the   th beat a

between the troops under the command of col willet and maj ross  col willet having advanced until he had arrived near maj ross detached maj rowley of massachusetts with a body of militia by a circuitous movement to get in the rear of the enemy with orders that as soon as he heard the firing in the front to fall on them maj rowley performed his maneuver accordingly and as soon as col willet judged that the major had gained the rear of the enemy he made a vigorous charge on their front when they immediately gave way and to all appearance the colonel was nearly in the grasp of victory when all at once without any visible occasion the levies came to a stand and then immediately began to fall back the enemy facing about and charging vigorously the colonels brass fieldpiece and ammunition tumbrel fell into the hands of the enemy and a rout seemed to be taking place when maj rowley not knowing what had taken place in the front commenced a brisk attack on the enemys rear this instantly threw them into confusion the levies rallied in the front and fought with redoubled bravery the fieldpiece and tumbrel were retaken and the enemy put to a most complete rout and pursued until the levies militia and some oneida indians who were with col willet were worn down with fatigue it was not possible to ascertain the number of the enemys slain for to use the words of the reporting officer unless the swamps and rivers in which they fell were to report the killed it was impossible to make a return of them major butler so frequently a troublesome partizan officer on the frontiers was killed by the indians as he was passing a river fiftytwo prisoners were taken and brought in and major ross went off in a direction into the woods where he and his troops must have suffered extremely for provisions etc  of the levies and militia with col willet   lieutenant and    rank and file were killed   captain   lieutenants and  0 rank and file were wounded   captain   lieutenant and   privates missing thus were the designs of the enemy also frustrated in the north  the corporation of the city of albany were so much impressed with the seasonable and effectual exertions made by our general to save their city from destruction that they sent him the following very polite address  albany october         sir threatened as this city and the frontiers of the state have been with destruction from an enemy who forgetting the rights of humanity and the customs of war adopted by civilized nations have hitherto waged it with all the spirit of the most savage barbarism  we cannot reflect but with pleasure and gratitude on the alacrity with which you have pursued the intentions of the commander in chief in affording with so much dispatch a competent support to oppose the enemy permit us therefore to render you our unfeigned thanks and to assure you that the corporation of the city of albany can never be unmindful of your attention and we entertain not the least doubt but that similar sentiments influence every inhabitant who has experienced the advantage of your generous exertions  we are sir with the greatest respect and esteem your most obedient humble servants  by

under arms in one line the artillery interspersed with the brigades to which it was attached at    oclock the army was reviewed by the general at one a grand feudejoy was fired after which all the officers dined together at a table spread in the field and formed a great square where great festivity and social mirth prevailed the soldiery had an extra boon on the occasion and to crown the whole in the midst of the joy around the table an officer approached our general and informed him that at the request of the prisoners in the provost who were pretty numerous he was desired to represent that their hearts expanded with joy on account of the glorious victory obtained by their illustrious commander in chief  that they lamented they could not express it with their comrades in arms but that they did it heartily in their confinement and solicited the generals goodness in an order for something to cheer their spirits this was instantly done with an additional order to the officer of the provost guard to set every prisoner in confinement at liberty the promulgation of this order drew a shout of approbation from the whole body of the officers at the table and probably had a better effect on the discipline of the army than a continuation of confinement and exemplary punishment of the culprits could have produced the general order of the day directed that as soon as the feudejoy is over the arms ammunition etc are immediately to be put in perfect order for instant action all guards pickets and sentinels to be vigilant and alert on their posts which notwithstanding the joy of the day was strictly observed  on this occasion there were rejoicings in all parts of the united states one instance seems to be worthy of notice the company collected had determined to burn genesis arnold in effigy for his treachery at westpoint just as they were going to commit the effigy to the flames one of the company observed that one of arnolds legs was wounded when he was fighting bravely for america that this leg ought not to be burnt but amputated in which the whole company agreed and this leg was taken off and safely laid by  november  d  at night the escort with the southern mail

more beef cattle from the northward for this army should there be a greater quantity of cattle sent from the new england states than the daily consumption of your army shall require i would wish the surplus might be salted if practicable at some convenient place on the north river otherwise it will be necessary for you to give orders to the agents and commissaries to prevent their sending more

men who were out burning coal and two others who were over at tarrytown fishing and destroyed some seines it was learnt from the northward that the enemy were repairing and building boats at st johns

the general officers and officers commanding brigades and regiments met at our generals quarters in consequence of orders from the commander in chief to give an opinion what measures ought to be adopted in consequence of the horrid and brutal murder of a capt huddy who had commanded a blockhouse at toms river in the jerfies and had been taken prisoner by the enemy and carried to new york where he was closely confined under guard and in the sugarhouse and on board a vessel in irons and then carried over to bergen in the jersies and hanged by the refugees a capt lippincot directing the execution this was done under the pretense that capt huddy had been concerned in the death of one philip white although white was killed by the guard from whom he endeavored to make his escape and capt huddy was at the same time a prisoner with the enemy huddy was left hanging on a tree with the following label fastened on his breast up goes huddy for philip white this wanton and cruel act so exasperated the inhabitants of new jersey that they drew up a petition signed by a vast number of respectable citizens claiming of genesis washington as the military guardian of their country the obtainment of justice for this horrid act or retaliation in case justice was refused indeed painful as the idea of retaliation must be to the feelings of humanity it seemed now to be the only preventative of more horrid murders genesis washington with his wonted prudence and talent for investigation free of all bias ordered the officers to assemble as before mentioned and directed our general to state to them the occasion of their being convened and then the following questions shall there be retaliation for the murder of capt huddy on whom shall it be inflicted and how shall the victim be designated the officers assembled were forbidden to converse on the questions submitted to them each one was to write his own opinion seal it up and address it to the commander in chief by this mode of procedure all the influence which some officers might have on others was prevented and the spontaneous feelings of every individual officer collected col humphries and col trumbull of the generals family attended the council and every direction of the commander in chief was most strictly observed it was found that the officers were unanimous in their opinion that retaliation ought to take place that it should be inflicted on an officer of equal rank viz a captain not under convention or capitulation but one who had surrendered at discretion and that in designating such an one it should be done by lot the commander in chief was pleased to approve of the opinion of the officers and wrote to the british commander demanding justice for the wanton murder of capt huddy informing the british general at the same time that if justice was not obtained retaliation would most assuredly take place at the same time arrangements were put in train for retaliation the names of several british officers of equal rank and circumstances were thrown together and a fair and impartial lot was drawn when young capt asgill was taken he was of a noble family his father was dead and on him were the fond hopes of his mother lady asgill placed indeed a more affecting scene than this can scarcely open an innocent young man doomed to suffer for the wanton offense of another which deed no doubt his soul despised and the tender breast of a mother rent in twain on the fate of her darling son nor were the feelings of the great washington unmoved on this occasion they were too manifest not to be observed and could only be curbed by the invariable resolution in every exigence to exhibit the administrator of justice it was months before this tragic business closed and that the reader may have the whole narrative together it will be carried forward to such periods as will render a return back to the proper chain of events necessary  genesis sir guy carleton who had come into the command in chief at new york wrote to genesis washington assuring him of the fullest satisfaction  sir guy ordered a court martial for the trial of capt lippencot who was charged with the murder of capt huddy the court martial had set and given in their proceedings to genesis carleton who wrote a letter to genesis washington requesting a passport for chief justice smith to repair to the headquarters of the american army in order to lay before the commander in chief the proceedings of the court martial with other documents which he sir guy had no doubt would give full satisfaction  upon genesis washingtons receiving the letter from sir guy carleton he informed our general that he should not consent to or give a passport to mr chief justice smith to come up with the proceedings of the court martial on lippencot but that he would send him genesis heath down to col phillipss near kings bridge to meet such officer of equal rank as sir guy carleton might think proper to send out to meet him with the proceedings of the court martial etc and on the  0th of july the commander in chief wrote to our general as follows  headquarters  0th july      dear sir for your information and that you may know the object of your mission i enclose to you a transcript of my letter to sir guy carleton which is herewith committed to your care to be forwarded as soon as possible  before the time of your going to phillipss house i shall have the pleasure of seeing you or conveying to you in writing my sentiments more fully on the subject of your meeting  with great regard etc signed g

will have the honor of meeting an officer of equal rank of your excellencys appointment at the house of mr phillips on the  th day of august next at that time genesis heath will receive from your officer the proceedings of the court martial on capt lippencot for the murder of capt huddy together with such other documents as you shall think proper to communicate  the assurance which your excellency has given me of the fullest satisfaction in this matter is as pleasing as it is interesting  your excellencys propositions contained in your letter of the  th have been communicated to congress and are now under the consideration of that honorable body as soon as i am favored with their determination your excellency may be assured i will do myself the honor to communicate it  i have the honor etc signed g washington  sir guy carleton  by his excellency george washington esquire general and commander in chief of the forces of the united states of america to maj genesis heath sir his excellency sir guy carleton having requested a passport for chief justice smith to repair to the headquarters of the american army in order to lay before me the proceedings of a court martial on the trial of capt lippencot for the murder of capt huddy with other documents and explanations which he says he has no doubt will give full satisfaction  i do therefore from an earnest desire to proceed with candor and deliberate justice appoint you to meet an officer of equal rank at the house of col phillips on monday the  th instant or at any other time or place which you may think more convenient for the purpose of receiving the proceedings and documents above mentioned with such explanations in writing as he may think proper to communicate the papers you shall receive you will transmit to me as soon as your business is concluded together with a report of your proceedings therein  given at headquarters this  d day of august      signed g washington by his excellencys command  the following instructions accompanied the foregoing commission  to maj genesis heath sir having desired you to meet an officer from sir guy carleton for the purpose mentioned in your appointment and authority you will proceed to execute said business in the course of which you may inform the officer you meet that as i have no connection with or control over any person in the line in which mr smith walks as the question before us is in my opinion purely of a military nature and reduceable to this single point whether the perpetrator of the wanton and cruel murder of huddy is to be given up or a british officer to suffer in his place that i could see no propriety or necessity in an interview with the chief justice  if you should find that the design of sir guy carleton is to procrastinate this business to envelope it in as much intricacy and difficulty as possible or that he means to justify it by recrimination and law cases thereby attempting to avert our purposes of retaliation you may assure him unless you shall judge it expedient to leave me more at liberty if not explicitly at least by strong insinuation that he will miss his aim and that my deliberate and dispassionate proceedings in this case are intended to give him as he now has had full time to determine whether the guilty person or an innocent officer shall be made the subject of retaliation  you will be particularly cautious that whatever passes in the conference you are to have which is to be considered as official be committed to writing that no omissions or misconceptions may be plead hereafter and you will inform the officer in explicit terms if you find the matter is not likely to end as justice dictates and we could wish that all oral conversation will be excluded from the official report of these proceedings now or any share in the account of them hereafter or the recital of them will be considered as unfair and an evident departure from that line of rectitude which we wished to pursue for an unbiassed world to judge by  if notwithstanding my letter to sir guy carleton requesting his appointment of an officer of your rank to meet you on this business he should send mr chief justice smith you may at your discretion either receive the proceedings of the court and such other documents as he is merely the bearer of without going into any explanation with this gentleman or refuse the whole as the circumstances of the moment shall dictate to you or if this gentleman should be an attendant on the officer aforementioned you may refuse to admit him at your conference in the first case you may either return with the proceedings etc or you may write sir guy carleton that you will wait a given time for an officer agreeable to the purport of my letter to him of the  0th of last month  given at headquarters newburgh august  d      signed g washington   in the afternoon of the same day our general received the following letter from the commander in chief  headquarters august  d      dear sir by the contents of sir guy carletons letter which came enclosed in yours of this day i find it is unnecessary for you to proceed to phillipss house disappointed in not obtaining a passport for mr chief justice smith to come out he will not he says trouble an officer of your rank to be the bearer of a bundle of papers only but adds they shall be sent out in the ordinary course of conveyance your letter to col trumbull covering the new adopted system of issues etc is received  signed g washington  maj genesis heath  not long after the proceedings of the court martial on capt lippencot for the murder of capt huddy were sent out lippencot was acquitted by the court and it appeared that the british commanders in chief both sir henry clinton and sir guy carleton disapproved the act it seemed that a kind of board of directors who had a subordinate direction of the refugee operations were some how concerned in this business and that argument and some artifice were necessary to smooth it over however genesis washington painful as his task was was not to be diverted from justice or retaliation but execution was suspended lady asgill learning the unhappy situation of her darling son with much policy and equal success applied to the count de vergennes then prime minister of france who spread the matter before the king and queen indeed it was a subject that needed no extra coloring to fix it on the mind of humanity the king and queen listened to the request and congress was addressed in a representation that the french as well as american arms were victorious at york and that the former seemed to have some share in the prisoners and hinted that it would be pleasing to the french court if young asgill was pardoned  which congress complied with and although reparation for the wanton murder of capt huddy was not fully obtained yet it is highly probable that the firm and determined conduct of genesis washington on the occasion put a final stop to any further repetition of the kind  sir guy carleton was probably the greatest general which the british had in america during the war and it was fortunate for the americans that he was so long kept within the limits of canada in him were combined many of those great qualifications which form the general  when sir guy visited the american prisoners in consinement in canada he addressed them with all the tenderness of a father he observed to the young prisoners that he did not blame them it was the fault of the designing men of their country that had led them into difficulty that he would not hold them in consinement but would send them home to their fathers and friends see here the soothing art that could not fail to cool the ardour of the young warrior in the cause of his country  to genesis waterbury of connecticut when he show him his commission sir guy observed  your commission is from the proper authority of your colony connectieut had not changed her form of government you are no rebel sir you shall go home to your family  soon after sir guy carleton came into the command at new york a connecticut soldier who had been a prisoner came out to our army and requested a pass to go home informing that he had given a parole to sir guy not to serve again during the war but he was ordered to join his regiment which disappointed the soldier exceedingly genesis washington ordered the commissary of prisoners to credit the british for one man exchanged and informed sir guy that this practice would not be allowed many soldiers were at that time very uneasy in the american army  had a conduct of this sort been allowed many soldiers on the outposts and otherwise might have gone to the enemy have pretended they were taken and have come out under parole and have gone home to the unspeakable injury of the army but it was nipped in the bud  only one other having come out in the same way before it was put a stop to  we now return to take up the chain of events from which we digressed  the  0th of april two prisoners of war taken near kingstreet were sent up by major oliver    st  a serjeantmajor deserted and came out he reported that an enterprise was contemplating at new york and a number of large boats were collecting at turtle bay    th  two deserters came in from the adamant manofwar of  0 guns which lay in the east river against new york admiral digbys flag was then hoisted on board the centurion the seamen on board the ships very sickly  the latter end of april the duke of cumberland packet capt dashwood arrived at new york in six weeks from england with the march mail by which it was learnt that the debates in the british parliament on the american war grew more and more interesting that a motion had been made by genesis conway for bringing in a bill empowering the king to make peace with america  the beginning of may the british eruizers were very successful against the americans eleven sail of vessels from philadelphia were taken and carried into new york with near  000 barrels of flour  may  th  this evening exhibited the most extraordinary aurora borealis ever before seen by those who observed it   th  it was learnt that the merchants of edinburg at a meeting on the  th of the preceding january declared and published their sentiments and wishes for a peace with america and a renewal of friendship it was also further learnt that it was the prevailing sense of the british house of commons as a first step to an accommodation with america to change the mode of carrying on the war and to act only on the defensive on the continent and that the person who should advise to offensive operations against the americans should be considered as an enemy to the king and nation at the same time france and holland appeared to be making great preparations for a vigorous campaign   th  symptoms of a dangerous mutiny were discovered in the connecticut line it had been conducted with so much address as to have been nearly matured before it was divulged under the pressure of real or supposed grievances the soldiers of the whole line had determined at revelle the next morning to have marched from their cantonment with arms etc complete for fishkill were they were to take a number of fieldpieces and such ammunition and provisions as might be necessary and then proceed to hartford and there demand of their new general assembly that justice which they supposed was their due just as the officers were going to bed a faithful soldier who was waiter to an officer came into his room and told the officer that he could not go to rest until he divulged to him an event which would assuredly take place the next morning at break of day and that every thing was then in readiness for it  and laid open the whole secret the matter was immediately communicated to the principal officers of the line and several soldiers were seized and confined and one suffered the whole design was frustrated mutiny is a most horrid ofsence in an army which without strict order and discipline is but a rope of sand on the other hand human nature can bear but to a certain degree and no further hence any trial of human nature beyond such a degree is impolitic and unjustifiable of this line it may with strict justice be said that their whole conduct through the war was highly meritorious   th  a stop was put to the inoculation with the smallpox   th  a prisoner was sent up and a deserter came in   th  news was received that there had been a total change of the british

france at least  000 men a day were employed under the direction of the engineers and other artists in constructing a most superb arbor decorated with every emblem and device descriptive of the occasion and the alliance between france and america which ingenuity could invent and perhaps for any thing of the kind constructed in the field was never surpassed    st  the birth of the dauphin of france was celebrated by the american army an elegant dinner was provided by order of the commander in chief of which the officers of the army and a great number of ladies and gentlemen invited from the adjacent country partook thirteen toasts were drank announced by the discharge of cannon at evening there was a grand feudejoy opened by the discharge of    cannon three times repeated the feudejoy being fired in the dusk had a pleasing appearance to the eye as well as the ear and was so ordered for that purpose the army was not formed in line but each brigade was drawn up in front of its own cantonment or camp on both sides of the river and thus were in a circle of several miles circumference in the center of which the commander in chief and the spectators were placed after the feudejoy there was an exhibition of fireworks etc  june  d  information was received that the island of newprovidence and its dependencies were taken by the spaniards on the   th of the preceding may

the army after which the chaplains with the several brigades will render thanks to almighty god for all his mercies particularly for his overruling the wrath of man to his own glory and causing the rage of war to cease amongst the nations  although the proclamation before alluded to extends only to the prohibition of hostilities and not to the annunciation of a general peace yet it must afford the most rational and sincere satisfaction to every benevolent mind as it puts a period to a long and doubtful contest  stops the effusion of human blood  opens the prospect to a more splendid scene  and like another morning star promises the approach of a brighter day than has hitherto illuminated this western hemisphere on such a happy day  a day which is the harbinger of peace  a day which completes the eighth year of the war it would be ingratitude not to rejoice it would be insensibility not to participate in the general felicity  the commander in chief far from endeavoring to stifle the feelings of joy in his own bosom offers his most cordial congratulations on the occasion to all the officers of every denomination  to all the troops of the united states in general and in particular to those gallant and persevering men who had resolved to defend the rights of their invaded country so long as the war should continue for these are the men who ought to be considered as the pride and boast of the american army and who crowned with wellearned laurels may soon withdraw from the field of glory to the more tranquil walks of civil life  while the general recollects the almost infinite variety of scenes through which we have passed with a mixture of pleasure astonishment and gratitude  while he contemplates the prospects before us with rapture  he cannot help wishing that all the brave men of whatever condition they may be who have shared in the toils and dangers of effecting this glorious revolution of rescuing millions from the hand of oppression and of laying the foundation of a great empire might be impressed with a proper idea of the dignified part they have been called to act under the smiles of providence on the stage of human affairs for happy thrice happy shall they be pronounced hereafter who have contributed any thing who have performed the meanest office in erecting this stupendous fabric of freedom and empire on the broad basis of independency who have assisted in protecting the rights of human nature and establishing an asylum for the poor and oppressed of all nations and religions  the glorious task for which we first flew to arms being thus accomplished  the liberties of our country being fully acknowledged and firmly secured by the smiles of heaven on the purity of our cause and the honest exertions of a feeble people determined to be free against a powerful nation disposed to oppress them and the character of those who have persevered through every extremity of hardship suffering and danger being immortalized by the illustrious appellation of the patriot army  nothing now remains but for the actors of this mighty scene to preserve a perfect unvarying consistency of character through the very last act to close the drama with applause and to retire from the military theater with the same approbation of angels and men which have crowned all their former virtuous actions  for this purpose no disorder or licentiousness must be tolerated every considerate and welldisposed soldier must remember it will be absolutely necessary to wait with patience until peace shall be declared or congress shall be enabled to take proper measures for the security of the public stores etc as soon as these arrangements shall be made the general is confident there will be no delay in discharging with every mark of distinction and honor all the men enlisted for the war who will then have faithfully performed their engagements with the public the general has already interested himself in their behalf and he thinks he need not repeat the assurances of his disposition to be useful to them on the present and every other proper occasion in the mean time he is determined that no military neglects or excesses shall go unpunished while he retains the command of the army  the adjutantgeneral will have such workingparties detailed to assist in making the preparation for a general rejoicing as the chief engineer with the army shall call for and the quartermastergeneral will also furnish such materials as he may want the quartermastergeneral will without delay procure such a number of discharges to be printed as will be sufficient for all the men enlisted for the war he will please to apply to headquarters for the form  an extra ration of liquor to be issued to every man tomorrow to drink perpetual

to dobbs ferry to meet genesis sir guy carleton four companies of lightinfantry marched this morning for that place to do the duty of guards sir guy was to come up the river in a frigate   d  in the forenoon the commander in chief and gov clinton with their suites etc went down the river   th  it was learnt that several vessels had arrived at boston from europe halifax etc with merchandise in consequence of which the price of goods had much fallen and the inhabitants of the eastern states were fitting out a great number of fishing vessels   th  it was said that       american prisoners had died during the war in the prisons and on board the prisonships at new york a surprising number and evidences that if their treatment was not severe they were too much crowded or not properly attended to in other respects those who have seen know and others can easily conceive that where men are closely confined in great numbers in prifonships or in gaols that without frequent airing and cleansing the air in such places becomes putrid and poisonous and produces almost certain death how much care then ought to be exercised by every humane commander in the appointment of provost officers to be assured that those whom they appoint are not only firm and resolute necessary qualifications in such officers but that they also are considerate and humane and that such commanders themselves take care to know and if necessary correct any abuses which may exist such conduct toward the confined and distressed would add a laurel to the heros brow equal to the triumphs of victory and more lasting for if the merciful man be merciful even to his beast how much more ought a great and brave man to feel for the unfortunate of his own species   th  at evening the commander in chief returned to headquarters having had an interview with genesis sir guy carleton    th  the commander in chief went for poughkeepsie a letter from genesis sir guy carleton to gov clinton had rendered an interview between the governor and the commander in chief necessary    th  at evening the commander in chief returned to headquarters    th  the army about this time were badly supplied with provisions and much uneasiness was discovered both by the officers and soldiers    st  it was learnt that congress had passed a resolution to furlough the men engaged for the war this mode appeared to be marked with policy in several respects  june  d  the general orders of the day announced that the men engaged for the war should be immediately surloughed with a proportion of the officers they were to be discharged as soon as the definitive treaty arrived they were to be marched home in divisions those men that remained engaged for other periods were to be formed into complete corpse the officers to agree who should stay and in cases where they could not agree seniority was to decide   d  the maryland battalion was put under orders to march to the southward   th  the maryland battalion marched from the cantonment the same day the general officers and officers commanding regiments and corpse in the cantonment on hudsons river having by their committee for that purpose appointed prepared an address to the commander in chief  it was accordingly presented in the words following   sir it is difficult for us to express the regret we feel at being obliged again to solicit your excellencys attention and patronage next to the anguish which the prospect of our own wretchedness excites in our breasts is the pain which arises from a knowledge of your anxiety on account of those men who have been the sharers of your fortunes and have had the honor of being your companions through the various vicissitudes of the war nothing therefore but necessity could induce us to a representation which we know must give you concern  your excellency has so intimate a knowledge of the condition of the army as to render a particular delineation unnecessary as you have been a witness of our sufferings during a war uncommon in its nature and unparalleled in many circumstances attending it so you are now sir no less a witness of the unequal burden which has fallen upon us from the want of that provision to which from our assiduous and unremitting services we conceive we are entitled having recently expressed our sense of what was due to our distress having repeated to your excellency the confidence we had that our accounts would be liquidated the balances ascertained and adequate funds provided for payment previous to our being dispersed or disbanded having seen with pleasure the approbation which congress gave our reliance it is with a mixture of astonishment and chagrin that we view the late resolve of congress by which the soldiers for the war and a proportionate number of officers are to be furloughed without any one of those important objects being accomplished and to complete the scene of woe are to be compelled to leave the army without the means of defraying the debts we have necessarily incurred in the course of service or even of gratifying those menials in the pittance which is their due much less to carry with us that support and comfort to our families of which from our long military services they have been deprived no less exposed then to the insults of the meanest followers of the army than to the arrests of the sheriff  deprived of the ability to assist our families and without an evidence that any thing is due to us for our services and consequently without the least prospect of obtaining credit for even a temporary subsistence until we can get into business  to what quarter can we look we take the liberty to say sir only to your excellency and from the sincerity of our hearts we do it no less from a persuasion of the efficiency of your further efforts in our favor than from the kind assurances you have been pleased to give us of your support  to your excellency then we make our appeal and in the most solemn manner from that abhorrence of oppression and injustice which first unsheathed our swords from the remembrance of the common dangers through which we have passed and from the recollection of those astonishing events which have been effected by our united efforts  permit us to solicit your further aid and to entreat that the order of the  d instant founded on the act of congress of the   th of may last may be suspended or varied in its operation so far as that no officer or soldier be obliged to receive a furlough until that honorable body can be apprized of the wretched situation into which the army must be plunged by a conformity to it that your excellency will endeavor to prevail on congress  nay that on the principles of common justice you will insist that neither officer nor soldier be compelled to leave the field until a liquidation of accounts can be effected till the balances are ascertained certificates for the sums due given including the commutation of half pay to the officers and gratuity of  0 dollars to the soldiers and till a supply of money can be furnished sufficient to carry us from the field of glory with honor to ourselves and credit to our country we still wish to believe that that country to which we have been so long devoted will never look with indifference on the distresses of those of her sons who have so essentially contributed to the establishment of freedom the security of property and the rearing of an empire  in the name and behalf of the generals and officers commanding regiments and corpse in the cantonment on hudsons river  i have the honor to be with the highest respect your excellencys most obedient servant w heath maj genesis president june  th       to the foregoing address genesis washington was pleased to return the following answer viz  headquarters june  th      sir before i make a reply to the subject of the address of the generals and officers commanding the regiments and corpse of this army presented by yourself yesterday i entreat that those gentlemen will accept my warmest acknowledgment for the confidence they have been pleased to repose in me they may be assured it shall never be abused and i beg they will be persuaded that as no man can possibly be better acquainted than i am with the past merits and services of the army so no one can possibly be more strongly impressed with their present ineligible situation feel a keener sensibility at their distresses or more ardently desire to alleviate or remove them but it would be unnecessary perhaps to enter into a detail of what i have done and what i am still attempting to do in order to assist in the accomplishment of this interesting purpose let it be sufficient to observe i do not yet despair of success for i am perfectly convinced that the states cannot without involving themselves in national bankruptcy and ruin refuse to comply with the requisitions of congress who it must be acknowledged have done every thing in their power to obtain ample and complete justice for the army and whose great object in the present measure undoubtedly was by a reduction of expense to enable the financier to make the three months payment to the army which on all hands has been agreed to be absolutely and indispensably necessary to explain this matter i beg leave to insert an extract of a letter from the superintendant of finance dated the   th ult  it is now a month since the committee conferred with me on that subject and i then told them no payment could be made to the army but by means of a paper anticipation and unless our expenditures were immediately and considerably reduced even that could not be done our expenditures have nevertheless been continued and our revenues lessen the states growing daily more and more remiss in their collections the consequence is that i cannot make payment in the manner first intended the notes issued for this purpose would have been payable at two four and six months from the date but at present they will be at six months and even that will soon become impracticable unless our expenses be immediately curtailed  i shall cause such notes to be issued for three months pay to the army and i must entreat sir that every influence be used with the states to absorb them together with my other engagements by taxation  three days ago a messenger was dispatched by me to urge the necessity of forwarding these notes with the greatest possible expedition  under this state of circumstances i need scarcely add that the expense of every day in feeding the whole army will increase very considerably the inability of the public to discharge the debts already incurred at least for a considerable time to come  although the officers of the army very well know my official situation that i am only a servant of the public and that it is not for me to dispense with orders which it is my duty to carry into execution yet as furloughs in all services are considered as a matter of indulgence and not of compulsion  as congress i am persuaded entertain the best disposition toward the army  and as i apprehend in a very short time the two principal articles of complaint will be removed  i shall not hesitate to comply with the wishes of the army under these reservations only that officers sufficient to conduct the men who choose to receive furloughs will attend them either on furlough or by detachment the propriety and necessity of this measure must be obvious to all it need not therefore be enforced and with regard to the noncommissioned officers and privates such as from a peculiarity of circumstances wish not to receive furloughs at this time will give in their names by    oclock tomorrow to the commanding officers of their regiments that on a report to the adjutantgeneral an equal number of men engaged for three years may be furloughed which will make the saving of expenses exactly the same to the public  i cannot but hope the notes will soon arrive and that the settlement of accounts may be completed by the assistance of the paymasters in a very few days in the mean time i shall have the honor of laying the sentiments of the generals and officers commanding regiments and corpse before congress they are expressed in such a decent candid and affecting manner that i am certain every mark of attention will be paid to them  i have the honor to be with great esteem sir your most obedient servant signed geo washington  maj genesis heath  the two preceding papers were enclosed in the following letter from the commander in chief to his excellency the president of congress  headquarters newburgh june        sir i have the honor to enclose to your excellency the copy of an address to me from the generals and officers commanding regiments and corpse together with my answer to it these enclosures will explain the distresses which resulted from the measures now carrying into execution in consequence of the resolution of the   th of may but the sensibility occasioned by a parting scene under such peculiar circumstances will not admit of description  the two subjects of complaint with the army appear to be the delay of the three months payment which had been expected and the want of a settlement of accounts i have thought myself authorized to assure them congress had and would attend particularly to their grievances and have made some little variation respecting furloughs from what was at first proposed the secretary at war will be able to explain the reason and propriety of this alteration  while i consider it a tribute of justice on this occasion to mention the temperate and orderly behavior of the whole army and particularly the accommodating spirit of the officers in arranging themselves to the command of the battalions which will be composed of the three years men permit me to recall to mind all their former sufferings and merits and to recommend their reasonable requests to the early and favorable notice of congress  i have the honor to be etc   a little before this time the officers of the army beginning to realize that the dissolution of the army was drawing nigh and wishing to perpetuate that friendship which numerous hardships sufferings and common dangers had inspired in their breasts  resolved to form themselves into a society by the name of the cincinnati several meetings were had for the purpose and an institution was digested and completed and although our general presided at one of the meetings and cheerfully at the request of his brother officers transmitted copies of the institution covered by a letter to the officer commanding the southern army and to the senior officers of the respective state lines from pennsylvania to georgia  yet he had serious objections to the institution as it stood and refused for some time to sign it he wished as much as any one in the army to perpetuate the happy friendship cemented in the breasts of the officers by an eight years common danger and sufferings but he thought this would be best done by simply forming a society to meet annually in their respective states for the purpose of a social hour and to brighten the chain of friendship with a fund for the relief of the unfortunate of their brethren but he was opposed to any idea of any thing that had any resemblance of an order or any insignia or badge of distinction asserting that it would only serve to mark them in an unfavourable light with their fellowcitizens but the prevailing opinion of the officers was otherwise our general was finally induced to sign the institution from the following consideration  but not until all the officers were appointed and he nearly ready to leave the army conversing with an officer of rank who was of the same opinion with him they parted in the resolution not to sign the institution but the next morning the officer called upon him and observed that one consideration not before mentioned had occurred to him viz that it might happen in the days of their posterity in case they did not sign that the descendant of one who was a member might happen to fall in company with the descendant of one who was not that the latter on observing the badge might inquire what it was and what its intention upon its being answered that it was the insignia of a society of which his ancestor who served in the american army during the revolution was a member  the other might reply my ancestor too served during that war but i never heard any thing of such a badge in our family to which it might probably be answered it is likely your ancestor was guilty of some misconduct which deprived him of it upon this our general broke out  i see it i see it and spurn the idea which led him to sign the general institution and he subscribed to the state fund     dollars being one months pay as was stipulated in the institution he however never met with the society although no one has cherished a warmer affection for every member of the army after the revolution in france finding that the insignias of distinctions were doing away it led him anew to review the distinction which the badge of the society to which he belonged if not in fact yet in appearance seemed to exhibit and brought to mind all his former objections which induced him to write to the secretarygeneral to erase his name from the institution but that his subscription to the fund should remain so long as it was applied to the purpose for which it was given  the relief of the unfortunate   th  in the forenoon the jersey line marched from the cantonment to their own state where they were to be disbanded the same day the first new york regiment made a present of their standards and band to governor clinton they were escorted to poughkeepsie by the lightinfantry company of the regiment   th  the men for the war belonging to the maryland new jersey new york and new hampshire lines having marched from the cantonment a division of the massachusetts men marched on this day   th  a division of the suffolk and worcester furloughed men marched for their own state and so on a division each day until the whole had marched   0th  our general was general of the day in the after orders of the commander in chief on this day it was expressed  the strength of the army in this cantonment being considerably diminished by the number of men lately furloughed the order of the   th of april directing a general fieldofficers and quartermaster to be of the day and also a regiment to parade every day for duty is dispensed with for the present there will be one fieldofficer and an adjutant of the day and the guards only will form on the grand parade at   oclock in the morning it is here a little remarkable that our general by whose orders and under whose direction the first guard in the american war mounted at the foot of prospect hill on the evening of the   th of april      after the battle of that day should happen in the course of service to be the last general of the day in the american main army on the  0th of june      to inspect turn off and visit the guards at the first period the roads were full of militia pressing toward boston to

din of war ceases the olivebranch of peace is displayed the toils and fatigues of the field are drawing to a close a part of the army have already mingled with their fellowcitizens and others will probably ere long join them  maj genesis heath being about to leave the army and this being the last opportunity which will remain in his power to express that affection for his brother officers and soldiers which more than eight years service has established in his breast he cannot depart without leaving his best wishes for the health prosperity and happiness of those whose lot it is a little longer to continue in the field  invoke every blessing on them and bid them an affectionate farewell    d  the massachusetts regiments marched to westpoint  the morning of the   th our general was to commence his journey homeward but the commander in chief wished him not to proceed until the afternoon on his arrival at headquarters colhumphries one of the aidsdecamp of the commander in chief gave him a sealed letter observing to him to read it at his leisure on opening it in general washingtons own handwriting it was as follows  private headquarters june   th      dear sir previous to your

furloughed on or about the  0th grew very mutinous refused to obey orders entered the city of philadelphia seized some public stores surrounded the place where congress and the supreme court of the state were sitting and made several demands and occasioned some consternation which caused a representation to the commander in chief the continental regiments were to be put under marching orders immediately it was judged inexpedient to call out the militia  at about   oclock p m our general took his leave of his beloved general and commenced his journey for massachusetts and arrived at his house in roxbury on the first day of july at   oclock p m where he gave evidence that an eight years military life had not divested him of the feelings or manners of a citizen  october  0th  it was
