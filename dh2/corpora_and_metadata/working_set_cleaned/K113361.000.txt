fleming and sold by him and the other booksellers in edinburgh and at london by a miller r baldwin d wilson and t durham booksellers mdcclxiv  to the right honorable james douglas earl of morton lord aberdour etc knight of the most noble order of the thistle clerk register for the kingdom of scotland etc etc my lord i know not how the public may receive the ensuing work but sure i am they will not fail to applaud my judgment in the choice of a patron eminent for encouraging every undertaking that may tend either for the honor or interest of his country allow me therefore the honor to put the peerage of scotland under your lordships protection and to subscribe myself  my lord your lordships most obliged most devoted and most obedient servant robert douglas  preface the necessity of publishing a new peerage of scotland and the utility of it is acknowledged by all the compiler of this present work has attempted it upon a more regular and accurate plan than has hitherto appeared how far he has succeeded the world must judge but if the most assiduous application for many years if a painful enquiry into the public records and ancient chartularies if an unwearied search after every degree of knowledge necessary for carrying on so arduous a task if these have any merit or deserve the favor of the public the author flatters himself this work on perusal will not be found deficient neither has he relied solely upon his own skill he acknowledges with the utmost gratitude the obligations he lies under to walter macfarlane esquire of that ilk for the generous and benevolent communication of that treasury of scotch antiquities of which he is possessed nor have the keepers of the public archives been wanting in contributing all in their power to forward the design  but notwithstanding all that has been done there doubtless may and will be mistakes such are unavoidable in a work of this kind though the author hopes they will not be found numerous as all manner of pains has been taken to avoid them as well by the labor bestowed upon the compilation as by putting it in the power of every peer to correct or add to the history of his own family by sending him a manuscript copy some time before publication they producing sufficient documents in support of any alteration made and where the history of any particular family in this work varies either from former authors or from received family opinions care has been taken to justify the difference of sentiment by undoubted authorities quoted on the margin  any inaccuracies that may be in point of language it is hoped the reader will overlook it must be owned that has not been so much attended to the chief and principal point the author had in view and the great object of his attention being in a plain and distinct manner to deduce the history of each family from its origin to the present generation and to ascertain their genealogy and chronology by undisputed documents this it is hoped is done and nothing further is pretended such escapes or omissions as have been discovered in particular families since they were printed off are carefully inserted in the addenda at the end of the peerage  it will probably be observed by our readers that certain chartularies and other vouchers quoted on the margin are said to be penes macfarlane though the originals are actually in the possession of others but as that great and ingenious antiquary in his valuable collection has authenticated copies of all these documents the author was obliged to quote those copies when he had not access to the originals  it is thought proper here also to inform our readers that in engraving the arms of the nobility as prefixed to this work the order is followed in which they are ranked in the roll made up at the union parliament in   0  and   0  which has been looked on as an authentic roll ever since  it is acknowledged that according to our printed proposals there should have been added a short system of heraldry etc but as this volume has swelled to a much greater bulk than was expected that treatise must be reserved for the second part of this work the baronage or an account of the gentry of scotland and as there are few peers but have some descendents who will appear in the baronage there will then be a proper opportunity of publishing any remarkable event that has been omitted here  the addenda or alterations since this work has been put to the press the author has thrown at the end of this volume and for the greater ease to the reader has reduced them to alphabetical order by which means any thing wanted may easily be found out  the reader is desired to excuse some seeming inaccuracies that appear in numbering the pages of this work these were occasioned by the additions made to several families since they were first printed off whereby the numbers of many pages are doubled  subscribers a his grace archibald duke of argyle large paper his grace james duke of

dignity and redeeming the liberty of his country cummin ever mindful of his own interest entered into the design and made a solemn engagement with robert to assist him with all his power in mounting the throne provided upon the success of the affair he should be restored to the vast possessions his family had enjoyed which would have aggrandized him much beyond any other subject and placed him in a condition little inferior to royal but upon maturer consideration and weighing the matter in the balance of selfinterest rymer fordun abercrombie etc etc he began to doubt the event the attempt was hazardous he dreaded the strength of england every chance seemed against the cause if it failed he was undone how to mend the step he had taken was to be determined his own black heart suggested the detestable remedy either from the hopes of great rewards from the english or perhaps with a view to the crown itself in virtue of his mother who was baliols sister he divulged the whole schemes of the scotch patriots to the king of england bruce was then in london but happily in time discovered he was betrayed and not without difficulty made his escape to scotland where finding clear proof of the

magnanimous and great during his confinement and at his execution we shall take the liberty here to insert a few passages from a paper published by the authority of the sheriff of london after his death  a little before he was carried to towerhill he demanded an interview with lord kilmarnock who was in the same unhappy situation with himself which was granted after it was ended the two lords saluted one another and balmerino bid lord kilmarnock an eternal happy adieu and with a cheerful countenance added my dear lord i wish i could alone pay the reckoning and suffer for us both etc  during the time the scaffold was putting in order for the execution of lord balmerino the sheriff that attended at the first execution went to balmerinos apartments as a notice to his lordship that his time was come upon whose entrance his lordship said i suppose lord kilmarnock is no more and having asked how the executioner performed his duty upon receiving the account said then it was well done and now gentlemen said his lordship i will detain you no longer for i desire not to protract my life he then saluted the company in a manner so cheerful as drew tears from every eye but his own and hastened to the scaffold  but before we view his lordship on the scaffold it is but just to the memory of that great but unhappy man to acquaint the public what was his deportment in his retirement here twas graceful without affectation cheerful but not presumptuous he conversed freely with his friends twice refreshed himself with a bit of bread and a glass of wine and desired the company to drink to him ain degrae ta haiven but above all he called frequently upon god and seemed both willing and prepared to die  when he mounted the scaffold he did it with so undaunted a step as surprised every spectator that was unacquainted with the greatness of his soul  he walked round the scaffold bowed to the people read the following inscription on his coffin arthurus dominus de balmerino decollatus    die augusti      aetatis suae    said it was right and with seeming pleasure looked on the block which he called his pillow of rest  he then called for the executioner who being introduced to him was about to ask his forgiveness but my lord stopped him and said friend you need not ask me forgiveness the execution of your duty is commendable then presenting the executioner with three guineas said friend i never had much money this is all i have i wish it was more for your sake and am sorry i can add nothing else to it but my coat and waistcoat which he instantly took off and placed on his coffin for the executioner having prepared himself for the block he took his last farewell of them and having once more taken a view of the great number of spectators his lordship said i am afraid there are some who may think my behavior bold and speaking to a gentleman near him added remember sir what i tell you it arises from a confidence in god and a clear conscience  then observing the executioner with the ax in his hand took it from him and having felt the edge returned it him again at the same time showing him where to strike the blow and animating him to do it with resolution for in that friend said he will consist your mercy  his lordship then with the same surprising countenance kneeled down at the block and having with his arms extended said this short prayer o lord reward my friends forgive my enemies and receive my soul submitted and gave the signal to the executioner  he married a daughter of capt chalmers by whom he had

bruce as will be shown in the following title  bruce lord of annandale and earl of carrick had the name of bruce been distinguished by no other person but the great and immortal king robert he alone is sufficient not only to ennoble a name but a nation but to his glory and renown we have that of other kings and other heroes to be added to raise this family to the highest pitch of grandeur amongst the illustrious houses of the scotch nobility  we shall therefore deduce their descent from the norman conquest of england which we presume was their first settlement in this island  amongst the great number of noble and valiant normans that came over to england with william the conqueror anno  0   none made a greater figure than robert de bruce the undoubted ancestor of this family  i robert bruis nobilis miles de normand monasticon anglicnum v ii p     in bibl jurid edin or bruce whom sir william dugdale calls a noble knight of normandy seems to have had no small share in the conquest of england  and as william divided the conquered lands amongst those of his followers who had most remarkably distinguished themselves for conduct and bravery so none appears to have got so large a share as this robert de bruis for both scotch and english historians agree that he got possession of the castle and manor of skeleton abercrombies hist dugdales baronage mon anglic where most of his lands are particularly mentioned which became the chief title of his family with above ninety lordships in the east west and north ridings of yorkshire whereof gysburn in cleveland which we shall have occasion often to mention hereafter was one  this robert died about the year   00 some say anno  0   and left issue a son and successor  ii robet de bruis second lord of skeleton a man of great worth and honor who having contracted a friendship with king david i while he resided in england and his lady being then dead by whom he had a son and heir he came to scotland with david who was a generous prince and always conferred his favors upon persons of merit  we shall observe that during the reign of king alexander i his brother david was designed comes and prince of cumberland and was superior of the whole lordship of annandale he was also earl of northumberland huntington sir ja dalrymples col p     and     and northampton in right of his wife mathilda which is fully documented from the register of the episcopal see of glasgow  that robert de bruis came to scotland with david and was accounted one of his nobles or vassals is clear from the said register of glasgow where comes david gives centum solidorum in hardingestra in northamptonshire for repairing the church of glasgow the original writ bears with consent of mathilda his wife et procerum et militum meorum roberti de brus sir william dugdales bar tom ii p     sir ja dalrymples collections etc inter ann    0 and       this alone is sufficient proof of roberts being in scotland with david it is no less certain register of the church of glasgow ciriter ann    0 that he got possession of the lordship of annandale of which there are many documents and it is affirmed by some historians that king david procured him in maririage agnes annand heiress to the rich lordship of annandale which contained all the lands from the bounds of dunegal and strathnith to the lands of ranulph de meschines then earl of chester and lord of cumberland which king david confirmed to him whereby he came to have large possessions both in scotland and in england  and being a man of great parts and equally qualified for the cabinet and the field was long in high favor both with king david i of scotland and king henry i of england  in the year      robert being at the court of england king stephen joined him in commission with bernard de baliol to endeavor to dissuade or divert king david of scotland from his intended invasion of england for which robert used all his interest but david either neglecting or despising the advice sir ja dalrymple and sir william dugdale pursued his former resolutions and entered england with a considerable army upon which robert withdrew his allegiance from david for his lands he held of him in scotland and was on the english side at the battle of standard anno      monasticon angli vol ii p     where he took prisoner his own son robert whom he had left in scotland nutrici suae custodiendum emendavit etc and was then about    years of age when his father presented him to the king of england he desired him to deliver him to his nurse to be taken care of tom ii p     etc  sir william dugdale says he was more sit to be eating wheat bread with his mother than by force of arms to be defending his patrimony of annandale etc  however the year thereafter a peace was concluded upon very honorable terms for scotland northumberland having been delivered up to prince henry and robert continued in friendship and favor with king david ever after  he was very liberal in his

are fully set forth and recorded by many able historians and do not properly fall within the plan of this work we shall only add that no age or country ever produced a man of more eminent qualities abercrombie and all other scotch historians either for peace or war than the famous and renowned king robert bruce  he married  st lady isabel daughter of donald and sister of gratney earl of mar by

before mentioned and is now lord willoughby of brook  kennedy earl of cassilis the progenitors of this noble and illustrious family were considerable proprietors and had large possessions in the west of scotland particularly in carrick before sirnames were much used in this country  that a family of rank and figure in carrick were the undoubted ancestors of the kennedies of cassilis and that they assumed their surname from their being head or chief of that family is sufficiently instructed by the following connection of authentic documents and charters from father to son so that these historians who allege that the first of this family came from ireland must have been in a mistake  i duncanus de carrick flourished in the reign of malcolm iv who succeeded to the crown of scotland anno      being possessed of a considerable estate in carrick he and his posterity were for some time designed by that name  he left issue a son and successor  ii nicholaus de carrick who made a donation to the nuns of northberwick of the patronage of the church of st cuthbert at maybole in the reign of king william the lion who succeeded to the crown in      and died anno       in this

said earl and his successors etc to him and his heirs for ever which is afterwrds confirmed by king alexander iii the   th year of his reign anno      in which he is designed rolandus de carrick ibidem filius nicolai filii duncani etc all which is fully narrated and confirmed by king robert ii chart in pub archiv anno regni secundo  this family being evidently possessed of a large estate and head of a considerable tribe or clan began to be called kennadies from the galic or celtic word keannaty which signifies head of the house or chief of the clan and in that country the word kennady is called kennaty to this day  there are several charters in the records wherein the same persons are designed carrick in the body and kennady on the margin in the reign of king robert ii ibidem by which it is certain that carrick and kennady wete promiscuously used by the heads of this family for a considerable time though their cadets generally took the name of kennady  roland was succeeded by his son  iv sir gilbert de carrick who in several authentic writs is designed son of roland particularly in a submission of a difference betwixt him and the nuns of northberwick in which robert bruce earl of carrick father of king robert bruce and robert bishop of glasgow were arbiters he is therein designed gilbertus de carrick miles filius rolandi etc and his seal which is thereto appended has the

the nuns of northberwick nisbets appnd p    wherein he is designed duncanus filius domini gilberti de carrick militis etc  as he had begun to drop the name of carrick and was more frequently designed by the name of kennedy as caput totius prosapiae so the cadets of the family who were now become numerous followed his example laid aside the name of carrick altogether and embraced that of kennedy of which there are many examples in our records but whether any of them were brothers or sons of this duncan i cannot determine viz  alexander kennedy was chancellor to john baliol remarks on ragmans roll p  0 anno       john kennedy swore fealty to king edward i prynnes collections vol iii p     anno       hugh kennedy did the same ibid p       fergusius kennedy etc is to be found in the

scotland is certainly local and was assumed by the proprietors of the lands and barony of crawfurd in clydsdale as soon as sirnames began to be used in this country  the immediate ancestor of this family was  i galfridus de crawfurd a man of rank and distinction in the reigns of king malcolm iv and king william the lion who succeeded malcolm anno       this galfride sir ja dalrymples coll and

noble and illustrious name of lindsay is of very great antiquity in scotland but there are many different accounts of their origin  some say that a man of considerable rank and courage who gave great assistance to king kenneth ii in his wars against the picts about the year     was the first of the surname of lindsay in this country  sir william dugdale in his baronage mentions several considerable families of the name of lindsay in england in the eleventh and twelfth centuries that their surname was local and was first assumed by the proprietors of the lands and manor of lindsai in the county of essex  our best antiquaries therefore are of opinion that one of these lindsays lesly boethius aberrombie etc having contracted a friendship with king malcolm canmore when in england came with him to scotland where he settled and had several lands bestowed upon him by that generous prince particularly the lands of wachopdale etc and that he was progenitor of the lindsays in scotland certain it is they began to make a figure in this country in the reign of king alexander i ib and fordun who was son of king malcolm canmore succeeded to the crown anno   0  and died anno      and in the reigns of king william the lion and king alexander ii there were a number of patriots and great men of that surname in scotland which is attested by all scotch historians  there flourished

newtarbat in rossshire  ramsay parl of dalhotsie antiquaries do not exactly agree about the origin of the illustrious name of ramsay  some are of opinion that it came originally from germany the armorial bearing being an eagle displayed  others with more probability say from england that it is local and was first assumed from the lands and abbacy of ramsay in nottinghameshire etc  certain it is the ramsays were settled in this country as early as the reign of king david i who succeeded to the crown of scotland anno       and it appears from rymers foedaera angliae and prynnes collections that there were many considerable families in scotland of that surname long before the reign of king robert bruce  it is evident also from our histories and records that besides the ramsays in midlothian there were many eminent families of that surname in fife angus and perthshire in very early times viz the ramsays of coluthie carnock corston forthar parbroath auchterhouse balmain banff and many others some whereof have been hereditary sheriffs of angus sheriffs of fife edinburgh etc and have enjoyed the highest offices in the state but whether they are all descended from the ramsays of dalhousie who are certainly the head or chief of the ramsays in midlothian we shall not pretend to determine but shall proceed to deduce the descent of this noble family by authentic documents from

illustrious ancestors distinguished by the highest titles and connected with the most august and noble families in europe can make any name remarkable and great there is no subject can plead a higher claim than the douglas but it is the least part of the glory of this family that it has been honored with alliances by marriage into the first rank of nobility in scotland england and france even with crowned heads having matched eleven times with the royal house of scotland and once with that of england  that besides the honors conferred on them by their own sovereigns they have been dukes of turenne counts of longueville and marishals of france they were more distinguished by their virtue and merit than by their titles and opulency and the luster of their actions outshone the splendor of their birth  hence we see them leading the van of our armies in scotland supporting by their valor the kingdom and crown of france tottering on the head of charles vii when reduced to the last extremity by the bravery of the english raising the siege of dantzick for which they had the highest honors conferred upon them conquering the saracens in spain with many other acts of military glory that have made this family renowned through all the corners of europe for which we must refer to our historians as our business is more properly genealogy than biography  the traditional account of

scotch territories and routed the royal army a man of rank and figure came seasonably with his friends and followers to the kings assistance he renewed the battle and obtained a complete victory over the invader the king being desirous to see the man who had done him so signal a piece of service he was pointed out to him by his color or complexion in these words of the old galic or celtic language

his family who had been accomplices in the murder of his cousins being jealous of his power and afraid of his return endeavored to instill bad notions of him into the mind of the king and got several suits and processes commenced against his friends and family in his absence aberer v ii p     and   0 which being fully narrated in doctor abercrombies history we shall here pass them over  the earl being informed of what was doing against him thought proper to make the best of his way home he dismissed his grand retinue and passing through england incog sent a dutiful message to the king full of obedience and submission ibid p     the king accepted it most graciously received him kindly and he got again greatly into his majestys avour  in april      rymer tom ii page     he was one of the ambassadors sent to england to confer and make up the differences about the breaches of the late truce  after which having been guilty of some arbitrary proceedings in his own country he went to the court of england where king james was informed he had been engaged in some treasonable practices  upon his return he was ordered to attend the king at stirling but knowing he had many enemies at court refused to come without a safe conduct which the king granted him in the strongest terms and most ample form  he went to stirling accordingly was introduced to the king who retired with him into a closet where they had a long conference by themselves  doctor abercrombie acknowledges he answered the king dutifully and submissively abercrombie vol ii p     to all the points insisted on till he desired him to cancel and give up a treasonable league or association entered into by him the earl of crawford and others of the nobility  he answered that that bond or contract was not in his possession at the time that it contained no treason and that he could not give it up without the consent of his associates the king being incensed at his refusal and not able to bear such disobedience in a subject all scotch historians agree in this fact drew out a dagger and stabbed the earl to the heart of which he died instantly  d february anno       he was succeeded by his brother  xii james ninth earl of douglas and sixth duke of turenne etc who in resentment of his brothers slaughter took up arms against his lawful sovereign and soon got together a far greater army than the king was able to raise in so short a space but how they were dispersed at that time our authors give no account  it is alleged by most of our historians boethius buchanan hauthornden home crawfurd etc that this rebellion subsisted without intermission till it was entirely extinguished anno      but as this appears to be a mistake we beg leave here to insert some unquestionable documents which we submit to the judgment of our readers  earl jamess rebellion certainly broke out in the end of february      yet we find this earl not only reconciled to the king but employed in public negotiations of state the very year after the rebellion commenced follows the kings commission jacobus d g etc sciatis rymer tom xi p     quod nos de side legalitate et circumspectione carissimi consanguinei nostri jacobi

approved and ratified by the king ibid p      th july       the earl immediately upon the concluding of the treaty undertook a pilgrimage to italy accompanied with his brothers and some other friends

which the earl of douglas his mother and brothers were summoned in order to answer to such crimes as should be laid to their charge they refused to obey upon which they were declared rebels and their lands and goods confiscated the king immediately took possession of galloway without opposition and because the people of douglasdale presumed to resist he abandoned them and their goods to the discretion of the soldiers etc  it is most certain that the earl immediately upon his return to scotland commenced a new rebellion and began to raise forces against the king he soon found himself again at the head of an army superior in number to his majestys he went in quest of the royal troops and overtook them near abercorn where the two armies encamped in sight of one another but it seems the seeds of loyalty still took place in the earls breast or he was unwilling to spill the blood of his fellow subjects for certain it is he declined fighting at least was not so forward to engage the royal army as was expected on so favorable an opportunity on which account lord hamilton and some of the chiefs of his followers not only openly upbraided him but that very night deserted him went over to the kings party were brought before his majesty ibid and godscraft who graciously received them accepted their submission and pardoned them whereby the royal army daily increased and the rebels diminished which the king perceiving for some time avoided coming to blows  the earl of angus a faithful and loyal subject who detested his cousins rebellion was the kings lieutenant and

took up arms in the end of king james the iiis reign they knowing the old earls great capacity either for peace or war applied to him to join and head them but he not only absolutely refused to engage

stirlingshire etc  hay earl of errol the grandeur and antiquity of the great and illustrious name of hay being sufficiently set forth and attested both by ancient and modern historians we shall only hint briefly at the traditional account of their origin as it is handed down to us by many eminent authors  in the reign of king kenneth iii the danes having invaded scotland about the year   0 with a great and numerous army were opposed by king kenneth who gave them battle near loncartie in perthshire where the scots were worsted and fled  in their flight through a narrow pass they were met by a brave scotsman and his two sons who were laboring their ground near by they stopped them encouraged them to rally telling them it was better and more honorable to die in the field fighting for their king and their country than to fly and afterward be killed by the merciless danes by thus upbraiding their cowardice they were prevailed upon to stop  there were many gallant men amongst them who fled more from the desertion of their companions than want of courage they joined the brave old man and his sons stopped all the flyers and soon got a considerable body of men together  the father and his sons having only such arms as their ploughs furnished them with led back their countrymen who returned to the charge they renewed the fight fell upon the danes and made a most furious onset crying aloud help is at hand the danes believing that a fesh army had fallen on them soon gave way whereby the scots obtained a complete victory and effectually freed their country from servitude  the battle being over the old man afterward known by the name of hay was brought to the king who gave him and his sons as a just reward of their valor and merit so much land on the side of the river tay in the carse of gowrie as a falcon set off a mans hand should fly over before she settled she flew over about six miles of ground in length which was afterward called errol and has been the possession and chief title of the hays their successors ever since  the king further promoted them to the order of the nobility and assigned them a coat of arms viz argent three setcheons gules to intimate that the father and the two sons had been the three fortunate shields of scotland  thus all ancient scotch authors but  it appears from many histories that there were families of the name of hay both in italy and france even before the era of the battle of loncarty the late countess of errol as head or chief of the hays in scotland had some time ago a most elegant letter from the learned  hay archbishop of marnis wherein he mentions the above account of the battle of loncarty as a piece of history contained in the memoirs of the hays in italy but says that the first of the hays in scotland and italy came both from armenia  there are some other probable accounts of the origin of this noble family with which we shall not trouble our readers here but refer to title marquis of tweeddale  in the genealogical account of the family of errol it is said that the name of the brave old man at the battle of loncarty was thomas afterward surnamed hay that the name of his eldest son was sereld hay and the name of his second achaius these are said to be the first of the name of hay in scotland and the ancestors of the hays of errol but as we have no authentic documents for the next three or four generations we shall begin to deduce the descent of this noble family from certain authority viz original charters and our public records  i william de la haya said to be lineally descended of the first thomas lived in the reign of king david i who succeeded to the crown anno      and died in       this william was a great man at the court of king malcolm iv chartul of the priory of st andrews

in scotland above five hundred years appears both from our histories and records though some traditional accounts deduce their origin and descent much higher  mr martin of clermont a learned and judicious antiquary says that one solvathius forbes martins genesis collect v ii p    married moravilla daughter of king gregory the great about the year   0 and that all the forbess in scotland are descended of him  other historians say that one achonacher a man of rank who came from ireland having killed a monstrous wild boar took the name of forbear nisbet vol i p     which was afterward turned to forbeas that he was ancestor of the forbess and that they took the boars head for their armorial bearing in memory of their having killed the boar  cambden says that one of the name of bois in king john baliols time after kiling a mighty wild boar cambd fol edit p     was called forbois which afterward was turned to forbes but this must be a mistake at least as to the era for there were forbess in scotland long before that time  it is alleged by others with more probability that forbes is a local surname and was first taken up by the proprietors of the lands and barony of forbes soon after the reign of king malcolm canmore about which time several men of rank in scotland assumed their sirnames from the lands they possessed and were progenitors of some of the most considerable families in the kingdom  we shall therefore pass over the traditional accounts and deduce the descent of this noble family by authentic documents from the first of them we find upon record viz  i john

of urquhart which he gallantly defended against king edward i of england abercrombie vol i p     to the very last extremity and on no terms could be prevailed on to surrender in the end the castle was taken by storm and the whole garrison with himself and all his sons were put to the sword anno   0  but happily his lady being with child was delivered of a son who succeeded him and carried on the line of this family  this son who was also named  iv alexander forbes when a young man lumisdens m s hist of the family of forbes scots compend and chart penes dom forbes joined king robert bruce performed many brave actions in his service and never deserted his interest for which and in regard of the great sufferings of his family and his own eminent loyalty he obtained a grant of several

eminent patriot macduff the eighth thane and first earl  i macduff eighth thane afterward earl of fyfe was one of the greatest and most powerful subjects in the kingdom and as he was no less good than great he was consequently much dreaded by macbeath the usurper  the great share he had in bringing about king malcolm canmores restoration and his killing macbeath with his own hand are facts so well known that it is needless here to insist on them  and as malcolm was a prince both generous and grateful he did not fail to reward his benefactor according to his merit fordun vol i he confirmed to

an unicorns head couped  motto over fork over  chief seats at kilmaurs in cunningham and finlayston in renfrewshire on the banks of the river clyde  gordon duke of gordon though there are many elegant histories of this ancient and illustrious family written by learned and judicious antiquaries yet they differ greatly as to their origin and first settlement in this island  some bring them from greece to gaul and from thence to scotland at least a thousand years ago others bring them from italy others from spain flanders etc  certain it is there were many considerable families of the name of gordon in france long before the norman conquest of england whose posterity we shall have occasion to mention hereafter and whose descendents are subsisting in france to this day  the most probable conjecture therefore is that some of these gordons came to england with william the conqueror anno  0   and to scotland with king malcolm canmore or his son king david i for it is well known that the ancestors of several of the best families in this kingdom are of norman extract and came to scotland with one or other of these princes  it is also said that in the reign of king malcolm canmore a valiant knight of the name of gordon came to scotland and was kindly received by that prince and having killed a wild boar which greatly infested the borders the generous malcolm gave him a grant of several lands in the merse or berwickshire which he called gordon after his own surname he settled there took the boars head for his armorial bearing in memory of his having killed that monstrous animal that he was progenitor of all the gordons in scotland and mention is made of adam de gordon the father and adam his son in the reigns of the said malcolm and david  it is most certain the gordons were making no small figure in scotland immediately after that era we shall therefore insist no more on the historial accounts but proceed to deduce the descent of this great and most noble family by unquestionable authority from their immediate ancestor  i ricardus de gordon said to be grandson of the knight who killed the boar or son of the second adam he was a man of considerable distinction in scotland in the reigns of king malcolm iv and king william the lion who succeeded malcolm anno       he was undoubtedly proprietor of the lands and barony of gordon and others in berwickshire which is instructed by a donation he made to st marys church of kelso chartulary of kelso in the lawyers library edin and printed in the appendix to mr gordons hist of the family of gordon and the monks serving god there and to the church of st michael in his village of gordon a bounded piece of his lands and estate of gordon lying contiguous to the churchyard of gordon in a free and perpetual alms and grants to whatever minister they shall place in the said church of gordon all the ordinary privileges of pasturage moss muir and other conveniences that the inhabitants of the lands of gordon enjoyed etc  this deed has no date but by the subsequent confirmations appears to have been made inter    0 et    0  he died about the year   00 and was succeeded by his son  ii sir thomas de gordon who by his charter confirms all the donations made by his father ibidem to god and st marys church at kelso and to the monks serving god there etc and that in as full free and ample a manner as expressed in the deeds of his father and he is then designed thomas de gordon filius ricardi etc  cotemporary with this thomas there flourished in france bertram de gordon who wounded with an arrow king richard i hovedons history p     of england before the castle of chalons of which he died anno       about this time lived also adam de gordon in scotland this appears by a charter of confirmation in which richard bishop of st andrews confirms to the abbacy of kelso in a free and perpetual alms the church of gordon with the whole of its parish  viz of gordon and spotiswood and in which he at the desire of the abbot and monks pointed out a churchyard or burial place to that parish chartulary of kelso and gordons appendix but granting liberty to the inhabitants of the other half of the lands of gordon belonging to adam de gordon to take their sacrament and bury either there or at their pleasure in their mother church of home etc  richard was bishop of st andrews from      to      so this deed must have been made within that space  if this adam was not a younger son of richard he was certainly a near relation of the family ibid and chartul of coldstream seeing he possessed part of the lordship of gordon he is a frequent witness in charters and donations to the monastery of kelso in the reign of king william the lion and was probably grandfather of adam who married the heiress alicia etc  thomas died in the reign of king alexander ii and was succeeded by his son  iii sir thomas de gordon who by a charter chartulary of kelso confirms to the monks and abbot of kelso all the donations and concessions made to them by richard de gordon his grandfather and thomas his father etc  in two other charters granted by him with consent of marjory his wife to the said abbot and monks of kelso for the salvation of his own soul ibidem and gordons appendix and that of his wise and daughters his ancestors and successors etc he confirms all his fathers and grandfathers donations and grants them several other privileges and possessions in his lordship of gordon and commits his body to them chartulary of coldstream to be buried at kelso as they shall see meet  he also makes a donation to the religious at coldstream of pasturage upon the lands of thorndyke and gordon tempore alexandri ii and is then designed filius domini thomae militis  this sir thomas is mentioned in two other charters to the monastery of kelso chartulary of kelso anno      in which he is designed dominus thomas de gordon miles etc  pontius de gordon of a considerable family in normandy lived about this time in a convention with king henry iii of england this pontius did homage to king henry pro castro et honor de castellania de gordon in normandy and for all his other castles and lands which he held of the king of france and that he shall hold these lands in the same manner of the king of england rymer tom i p     as he held them formerly of the king of france for which king henry grants him many noble privileges anno       sir thomas de gordon had no male issue and was succeeded in his whole lands and estate by his daughter  iv alicia de gordon chartulary of coldstream and kelso who in many charters is designed daughter and heiress of sir thomas etc  she married her cousin adam de gordon who in the beginning of the reign of king alexander in a donation to the monastery of coldstream is designed adam filius adae de gordon ibidem and was probably the grandson of adam proprietor of part of the estate of gordon before mentioned by which marriage the whole lordship of gordon was now united in one family  this adam mortified to the monastery of dryburgh a bounded piece of land lying in his territory of fawns in berwickshire for the salvation of his own soul chartulary of dryburgh penes macfarlane the soul of alicia his spouse his ancestors and successors etc ante annum    0  when king alexander iii sent one thousand auxiliaries to king lewis of france to attend him in his expedition to the holy land anno    0 adam de gordon was one of the chief commanders and lost his life in that enterprise leaving issue by the said alicia a son  sir adam their heir  alicia survived her husband which appears by her charter of confirmation to the religious in kelso in these words alicia de gordon chartulary of kelso and gordons appendix filia et haeres quondam domini thomae de gordon militis in pura viduitate etc pro salute animae meae et animarum fratris mei et adae de gordon quondam sponsi mei etc confirmasse etc omnes donations etc a domino ricardo proavo meo five a domino thoma quondam avo meo five a domino thoma quondam patre meo etc to which deed her seal is appended  v adam designed dominus de gordon succeeded adam and alicia his father and

goodness was restored to his fathers estate and honors and was the second earl  he was a youth of great hopes and of a sweet disposition but died unmarried anno      whereby the estate and honors devolved upon his brother  xvi john third earl of gowrie who with his brother alexander made that audacious attempt upon the kings sacred person at perth on the memorable fifth of august   00 when both the brothers were slain in the enterprise  though there are particular histories of gowries conspiracy wrote by several historians yet we have only hereto subjoined the account given by a learned author no transaction in the scotch history can be so little accounted for as that of gowries conspiracy a reason for an attempt so horrid is scarcely so much as hinted and the methods used even supposing such had been the intention were so preposterous that it cannot reconcile either with the character of the two young gentlemen or with the other circumstances of the story itself nature and education had joined in adorning them especially the elder with the most noble accomplishments more learned than is usual among persons of their rank more religious than is common at their age of life generous brave popular their countrymen far from thinking them capable of any atrocious crime conceived the most sanguine hopes of their early virtues  this remarkable incident happened on the fifth august   00 historians tell us that as the king was going out in the morning to the chase from his palace of falkland he was accosted by the younger of the two ruthvens alexander who with an air of secrecy and importance acquainted him that the evening before a stranger had been seized near his brothers house at perth and secured and on searching him a vast quantity of foreign gold was found upon him the king immediately suspecting this unknown person to be a trafficking priest supplied with foreign coin in order to excite new commotions in the kingdom ordered him to be sent to falkland but this mr ruthven strenuously opposed and with many arguments urged the king to proceed to perth and examine into the matter himself the king whose curiosity was awakened by the strangeness of the affair promised to go when the chase was over during the whole of which ruthven continued his importunity in so strong at manner that even after it was over he would not allow the king to wait a fresh horse but insisted on his setting out on the same he had hunted with the whole day mr ruthven too was very desirous that the king should set out without attendants but this he refused and with a train of about twenty persons set out for perth  the earl of gowrie apprised by his brother of the kings approach met him at a little distance from the town and conducted him to his house mean time no preparations for entertaining his majesty appeared the earl seemed embarassed nor did he apologize for the seanty fare with which he entertained his royal guest the kings repast being over his attendants were conducted by the earl to dine in another apartment at that time mr ruthven took the opportunity of whispering the king that now he might have an opportunity of seeing the unknown person the king desired sir thomas erskine to go with him but mr ruthven would not consent he then conducted the king by a narrow staircase through several apartments all of which he locked behind him till at last he came to a small room where instead of a fettered criminal as the king expected he found a man standing compleately armed with a sword and dagger at his side ruthven upon his entrance snatched the dagger from the mans side and addressing the king spoke to him of his fathers execution that he was now his prisoner and at his mercy but added that if he would be quiet and make no noise his life should be in safety he then delivered back the man the dagger told him to take care of the king and at same time binding the king with an oath not to make any noise or disturbance during his absence he returned to acquaint his brother with what he had done  mean while the kings attendants impatient at his not appearing inquired at gowrie what had become of him at that instant one of gowries domestics entered the room and acquainted them that the king had just mounted his horse and rode off for falkland on which all of them immediately left the house and called for their horses at this time mr ruthven had returned to the king and told him that now he behoved to die and at same time offered to bind his hands unarmed as the king was he would not submit to such an indignity but closing with mr ruthven a fierce struggle ensued during which the man in armor stood by trembling dismayed and motionless without offering the least assistance to his master or violence to the king  in the scuffle the king had pulled mr ruthven near a window part of which was open and putting out his head called out with a wild affrighted voice treason murder his attendants knew the voice and observing a hand at the window collaring the king they immediately rushed up stairs to his assistance the greater number took the principal staircase but found all the doors fast which while they were attempting to force open sir john ramsay entered by a back stair and seeing mr ruthven struggling with the king drew his dagger plunged it twice into his body then pulled him from the king and threw him down stairs where he was met by sir thomas erskine and sir hugh herries who with their daggers dispatched him mr ruthven calling out with his last breath alas alas i am not to blame during this scuffle the man in armor who had been concealed in the apartment made his escape unknown  there were now in the apartment with the king ramsay erskine and herries and one wilson a footman who entered the room along with them before they had time to congratulate the king on his narrow escape the earl came up the same backstair and rushed in with a sword in each hand attended by seven servants completely armed threatening them all with immediate death notwithstanding the inequality of the numbers the three gentlemen immediately attacked the earl and sir john ramsay having run him through the heart his followers immediately fled  the kings attendants who were endeavoring to force a passage from the other staircase were now let in and with transports of joy congratulated the king on his deliverance and he falling on his knees with his attendants around him offered thanks to god for his wonderful preservation  the danger however was not quite over the inhabitants of perth hearing of the death of the earl their beloved provost and patron surrounded the house and vowed vengeance against the king but the magistrates being admitted into the kings presence and acquainted with the fact they by their influence by degrees appeased the multitudes who soon after dispersed the king then returned to falkland having left the care of the dead bodies of the earl and his brother to the magistrates  such is the story handed down to us by many writers but all of them are at a loss to account for the motives of a conduct so contrary to the known character of these two brothers whose gentle and peaceable dispositions made them idolized by all who knew them  three of gowries servants were afterward hanged at perth for being concerned in the attempt but from them no light could be drawn into this intricate affair and the man who was concealed in the study and who upon promise of pardon had revealed himself and proved to be the earls steward was as much a stranger to his masters design as the rest and though placed in the study by the earls immediate command he did not even know for what end that station was assigned him the truth of which seems strongly to appear from his behavior to the king while alone in the apartment with him and when instead of appearing to have a design upon his life or liberty he stood motionless trembling and affrighted in short altogether unfit for so horrid an office     all the honors and estates of the earldom of gowrie were forfeited and annexed to the crown and the fifth of august in time coming ordered to be regularly observed as

great chamberlain to robert duke of normandy got from that prince the castle and honor of croy alias gray in picardy from which he assumed his surname  this fulbert had a son  john lord gray peerage of england vol ii p   who succeeded him  and a daughter  arlette who was mother of william the conqueror  certain it is there were several of that surname came from france to britain with that great prince anno  0   and had considerable commands in his army and as he divided the lands of england amongst his brave officers ibidem we find that the grays got a large share made a great figure and became very numerous soon after william was master of the country they were progenitors of several noble families that have flourished with great luster in that kingdom ever since salmons abridgment p     viz the dukes of suffolk and kent the marquis of dorset the earls of tankerville and stamford the barons gray of codnor ruthin wilton roleston wark and chillingham etc from which last is descended the lord gray in scotland  in the northern counties there are still many ancient families of that name which enjoy considerable estates as appears from the acts of parliament nominating the justices of the peace commissioners of supply etc in those parts  and it is observable that the grays in scotland carry the same armorial bearings with those in the north of england which may be seen in their churches tombstones and other monuments of antiquity and as northumberland formerly belonged to scotland it is the general opinion that lord gray of chillingham of that county whose predecessor came over with william the conqueror gave the lands of browfield or broxmouth in the county of roxburgh adjoining to it to a younger son of his family of whom all the grays in scotland are said to be descended  but both scotch and english historians who assert that the grays came first into scotland in the reign of king james i cambden boethius buchanan etc are in a mistake for we have undoubted proof that they were settled and making a figure in this country near two hundred years before that era or above five hundred years ago  and though we cannot six the precise time of their coming yet we shall deduce the descent of this noble family by authentic documents in a direct line from  i sir hugh de gray a man of considerable rank and figure in the reign of king alexander ii who succeeded to the crown anno      was then proprietor of the lands of browfield or broxmouth in roxburghshire nisbet vol i p     and is particularly documented by a charter of walter de lundin to his kinsman

escape to france where he continued in banishment for several years and the queen was so sensible of his unshaken fidelity that when that cruel sentence of death was passed upon her in england she pulled a ring off her finger and ordered one of her servants to deliver it to her cousin lord john hamilton as a token of the just sense she had of his constant fidelity and sufferings for her interest which ring is still preserved in the family  when he heard that the king had begun to take the management of affairs upon himself he returned to scotland anno      and being joined by his

driven into some unwarrantable actions he made it evident that he had not been led by any inclination of his own and heartily run into all opportunies of redeeming it and in the very article of his

unfortunate prince and never left him till he embarked for france   d december      and was always suspected of retaining a warm affection to him even when the revolution had altered the system of government and directed the subjects allegiance to a new king which plainly appears from the speech he made in the beginning of      when the prince of orange asked the opinion of the scotch nobility and gentry then at london in relation to the affairs in scotland upon this occasion the earl of arran delivered his opinion as follows  i have all the honor and deference for the prince of orange imaginable i think him a brave prince miscellaneous collections of the year      crawfurds peerage p     and that we owe him great obligations in contributing so much to our delivery from popery but while i pay those praises i cannot violate my duty to my master i must distinguish between his popery and his person i dislike the one but have sworn and do owe allegiance to the other which makes it impossible for me to assign away that which i cannot forbear believing is the king my masters right for his present absence from us in france can no more affect my duty than his longer absence from us has done before and the prince desiring our advice mine is that we should move his majesty to return and call a free parliament for the securing our religion and property which in my humble opinion

the first of that most noble house to the present generation we shall only add what is said on this peerage by our lords of session in their report to the house of peers anno       william master of newbottle succeeded to the honors of jedburgh and on that title voted in parliament anno   0  where his father the marquis of lothian also sat and voted as marquis of lothian and upon his fathers decease he succeeded to the honors of lothian therefore if a judgment were to be formed on what thus appears it would be natural to conclude that the honors of jedburgh and lothian are conjoined in the same person but as it appears that the present marquis of lothian in his fathers lifetime voted anno      at the election of a peer to sit in parliament in the room of earl marishal then deceased under the character of lord jedburgh it is not impossible that the family of lothian may be possessed of some settlement in this peerage of jedburgh different from what has hitherto been found in the

the isles  somerled being no less ambitious than great raised an army and invaded the territories of malcom iv who succeeded david was joined by donald son of malcolm macbeth who had been at the head

his eldest son  iii dovenald or donald of the isles who was certainly progenitor of the whole clan of macdonald and though we do not find him designed king yet he is often called lord of the isles ergyle inchgall etc and it does not appear that he ever acknowledged the king of scotland for his superior  he made a donation of eight cows etc to the monastery of paisley chartul of lennox page

immortal king robert bruce when all others who were willing could not abercrombie and barbers life of king r bruce and they who were able would not so much as own his title far less screen his person

of great worth and honor a firm and steady friend of king robert bruce  at the battle of bannockburn anno      he charged upon the head of  000 of his own men ibidem with remarkable bravery and conduct and had no small share of the honor gained by the scots on that memorable day  he was so much a true and faithful subject to king robert that he never once asserted his own independency as king or lord of the isles as long as he lived  he married a daughter of the family of ocaine m s of the family the chiestain of a great tribe in the kingdom of ireland by whom he had a son and sccessor  vii john lord of the isles a man of great spirit but he did not inherit the loyalty and virtues of his father and grandfather he turned an enemy to his young sovereign king david bruce and joined edward baliol which appears from a ratification by the king of england rymer tom iv p     of an indenture entered into betwixt edward baliol king of scotland and john lord of the isles etc anno       that same year he got a charter from king edward as he is then called of the lands of kintyre knapdale the islands of mull sky lewis and a great many others for which he obliged himself by all means possible to molest and annoy the enemies of edward etc  he afterward got a safe conduct to go up to england ibid p     anno      and it seems he then set up for an independent prince ibid tom v

johanne de isle et haeredibus suis etc data apud arnelle  mo die januarii       this reginald was progenitor of the macdonalds of moydart clanronald etc of whom glengary moror etc are descended but whether he was a son of a former marriage or older or younger than johns successor we shall not pretend to determine  but as the different branches of the clan macdonald do not agree about this part of their history we shall only make an obvious remark or two upon the preceding charters and leave the determination of the points in dispute to the judgment of our readers  john of the isles got his first charter under the great seal of all the lands therein mentioned to himself and his heirsgeneral holding of the king before narrated       about ten months thereafter he gave a considerable estate to his son reginald and the heirsmale of his body confirmed and approved by the king not holding of the crown but of john himself and his heirs whereby johns lawful successor became reginalds superior and in the charter reginald is neither designed filius legitimus nor dilectus filius the common style in old charters but simply filius meus therefore by any thing that appears upon record johns lawful heir was a different person from reginald  john died in the end of      or beginning of      and was insallibly succeeded in all the estates he died possessed of and in the superiority of the other lands he had given off to his children by his son  viii donald lord of the isles who it seems set out upon an independent sooting for richard king of england entered into a treaty with him as a sovereign prince rymer tom vii anno      and his father john is then said to be nuper defunitus  this donald was a man of an aspiring genius and had vast possessions chart in pub archiv he gave off parts of his lands to his friends and neighbors viz the macleans macintoshes mackenzies mackinnons etc all holding of himself for military service which greatly increased his power but upon the forfeiture of this family these clans got their lands holding of the crown  in the year   00 donald lord of the isles and john de isle his brother got a safe conduct from king henry iv rymer tom viii

treat of a final peace with them in their own country ibid p     anno   0   in a truce concluded betwixt the king of england and france ibid tom ix donald lord of the isles and john stanely of man are included as independent princes anno       they are again both included in a treaty with france as allies of england ibid tom xii p  00 anno      whereby it appears that this lord was more in the english interest than the scotch  he married dame margaret lesly only daughter of walter lesly by lady eupheme eldest daughter and coheiress of william the last male of the ancient earls of ross and upon whose heirs the estate and honors of ross were settled by act of parliament by her he had a son  alexander his heir  as the battle of harlaw happened in consequence of this marriage we shall briefly account for it as follows  walter lesly who married eupheme countess of ross besides his daughter married to the lord of the isles had a son alexander who became earl of ross as heir to his mother he married isabel daughter of robert duke of albany governor of scotland by whom he had an only daughter eupheme countess of ross his sole heiress she became a nun and died without issue whereby the successi on to the earldom of ross in right of blood ought to have devolved upon the said dame margaret lesly lady of the isles her undoubted heir of line  but the duke of albany having obtained from his grandchild eupheme the nun a resignation of her honors in favors of his second son the earl of buchan resign penes comitem de rothes and failing heirsmale of his body to fall to the crown the earl of buchan thereupon added that of ross to his other titles  donald lord of the isles claimed that earldom in right of his wife the duke of albany determined his son should have it in virtue of the nuns resignation  donald being denied what he thought he had a just title to resolved to assert his right by force of arms and raised an army of about ten thousand men chiefly of his own friends and followers the clans beforementioned  the duke was not behindhand with him in raising forces fordun vol ii p     but soon got together an army much about the same number commanded by the brave alexander stewart earl of mar  they met near a village called harlaw within ten miles of aberdeen where a most bloody battle ensued fought with incredible obstinacy on both sides ibidem in which many brave men lost their lives but neither had reason to brag much of the victory the lord of the isles rather wearied than conquered retreated the next day and the earl of mar was not in a condition to pursue him this happened anno       it seems donald afterward made up matters with the governor for the earl of buchan possessed the earldom of ross without further disturbance till he was slain at the battle of vernoil in france anno      then that earldom came to the crown in virtue of the resignation by eupheme the nun chart in pub archiv beforementioned this is fully instructed by many charters under the great seal to be seen in our public records though it does not appear that the said dame margaret lady of the isles ever gave up her title fordun vol ii for she always designed herself countess of ross even after the crown was in possession of that earldom  donald died in france anno      and was succeeded by his son  ix alexander afterward earl of ross of whom buchanan says he was unus post regem long potentisimus etc  in his mothers lifetime he designed himself dominus insularum et magister comitatus rossiae for it seems he still intended to assert his title to that earldom he raised an army of above ten thousand men burnt the town of inverness and laid waste a great part of the country the king being highly incensed at this insolence raised an army to oppose him ibid p     and came up with him in lochaber the clan chatton and the camerons seeing the standard of their lawful sovereign deserted the lord of the isles whose forces being immediately attacked by the kings troops were soon routed and put to slight in the year       sometime thereafter alexander repenting of his disloyal practices threw himself at the kings feet ibid p   0 and implored mercy who notwithstanding his open rebellion was graciously pleased to pardon him  at last king james out of his great goodness and love of justice yielded the earldom of ross to him being sensible he had a good title to it in right of his mother who was really heir of line of the family as before observed by which accession to his estate he became one of the greatest and most powerful subjects in the kingdom  this alexander earl of ross grants a charter to john ross of kilravock in liferent and his son hugh his apparent heir in fee chart in pub archiv of the lands of kilravock eastergeddes etc upon kilravocks resignation to the earl as his lawful superior   d june    0 confirmed by a charter under the great seal  in the minority of king james ii he was by the estates of the kingdom ibidem appointed justiciar of scotland benorth the river forth and it is acknowledged he kept all that country in peace and good order as long as he lived  he granted several charters and other deeds as earl of ross and lord of the isles ibidem all confirmed by charters under the great seal which is a sufficient proof that the crown acquieseed in his possession of that earldom  he married elizabeth charta penes ducem de gordon daughter of sir alexander seton lord of gordon and sister of alexander first earl of huntly by whom he had three sons and two daughters    john his heir    hugh progenitor of the

beginning of      and was succeeded by his eldest son  x john earl of ross and lord of the isles who was certainly one of the greatest and most powerful men in the kingdom and behaved like a dutiful and loyal subject excepting his engagement with the earl of douglas as long as king james ii lived with whom he appeared to be in great favor  there was a truce concluded with the english in november      rymer tom xi p     etc in which john earl of ross was one of the guarantees and to another in       and though he was engaged in the earl of douglass rebellion yet it is certain he made his peace with the king very soon thereafter for in the year      he is one of the guarantees of a treaty with the english ibid p     and     and one of the wardens of the marches and again in       but after the death of king james ii he begun to revive the old pretensions of his family to independency and shaking off his allegiance to his lawful sovereign he entered into a treaty with the king of england in the following terms viz  that john de isle earl of ross and lord of the isles donald balagh and john of isle son and heir apparent of the said donald and all their subjects the macdonalds of moydart or clanronald men people and inhabitants of the earldom of ross and isles etc become liegemen and subjects to king edward iv his heirs etc to do homage etc and that they shall remain for ever subjects to the kings of england and assist them against all their enemies etc king edward on the other part agrees and gives the earl of ross during life a yearly pension of one hundred merks sterling in time of peace and two hundred pounds sterling in time of war and twenty pounds sterling to donald balagh in time of peace and forty pounds sterling in time of war and further in case of a treaty for a final peace betwixt the two kingdoms that england shall not agree with scotland without getting the earl of ross rymer tom xi p     etc comprehended in it etc  this treaty was concluded  th february      but was kept secret for several years ibidem and was never discovered till there was actually a final peace concluded between scotland and england by an article whereof it was provided that both the respective kings should renounce all former engagements made against each other the english were thereby obliged to produce their treaty with the earl of ross by which this treasonable intrigue came to light anno       in the interim the earl of ross got charters under the great seal from king james iii chart in pub archiv of many lands and baronies inter      et       at last john earl of ross was summoned before the parliament      was indicted for high treason found guilty and by sentence of the three estates records of parliament was outlawed and forfeited and

consequently much about his person in short there was scarce any body could have access to his majesty without the boyds permission the king was still in the palace of linlithgow where the lord kennedy one of the regents and no friend of the boyds kept a very watchful eye over him the lord boyd therefore thought it necessary for his own interest to have his majesty out of lord kennedys hands which by the blind of a huntingmatch no doubt with his majestys approbation he accomplished and got him safely conducted to edinburgh much against the lord kennedys inclination but where he was afterward entirely under the direction of the boyds  however lord boyd like a wife statesman prevailed with the king to call a parliament wherein it was declared that the lord boyd had done the king

eldest son who was certainly one of the most accomplished young men in the kingdom married lady mary stewart the kings eldest sister with the consent and approbation of his majesty he got by her a great accession to his estate and was by king james iii created earl of arran this indeed greatly aggrandized his family and at the same time was one of the causes of its being so soon pulled down and brought to ruin  they became greatly envied by some and for their exorbitant power and their having engrossed the whole authority of the nation to themselves were as much hated by others and though there are no particular misdemeanors or acts of oppression laid to their charge yet their enemies became innumerable  the old lord was obliged to be much from court in the execution of his office of great chamberlain his son the earl of arran was at denmark upon an embassy and his lady with him who always accompanied him wherever he went the enemies of the family took that opportunity of working their ruin they first got the kings favor and affection alienated from them they then prevailed with his majesty to call a parliament in      to which lord boyd his son the earl of arran and his brother sir alexander boyd of duncow were summoned to appear and answer for such crimes as should be exhibited against them the old lord being sensible of the great authority and power of the faction

an author of good reputation norths examination of the history of the reign of king charles ii p    who though an englishman seems to have examined the whole conduct of this scotsman without prejudice and says it is well known that by the prudent conduct of the duke of lauderdale scotland was in a posture not only of safety but of giving assistance to the king if needed  he was an inexpugnable loyalist and kept the door of scotland close shut that no harm could get in or out there while he was commissioner which in the sense of the earl of shaftsbury and his party was the worst of offenses  in the mean time all the party foulmouths vented against him the utmost obloquy that could possibly be imagined as if he had been the basest of men and the modern timeserving historians chime in with

some scotch authors allege that they are descended from alexander second son of kenneth thane of lochaber mr simsons essays hist of the stewarts etc and immediate younger brother of bancho predecessor of the scotch royal family  but the following narration will make it plainly appear that they came from england  although upon the great victory obtained by william duke of normandy afterward called the conqueror over harold king of england at hastings in october  0   all the southern provinces of england submitted quietly to the government of the victor yet several earls great lords and powerful barons in the northern provinces much attached to their old race of kings and impatient of servitude stood up valiantly in defense of their liberties and the independency of their country and having carried on a bloody but unsuccessful war against the conqueror whom they looked upon as an usurper were at last compelled to leave their country abandon their estates and save their lives by flying to scotland where they were kindly received by king malcolm iii as will be shown hereafter  the most eminent of these families was the ancestor of the dunbars earls of march who are treated of under that title page     of this work  the next was the progenitor of the old earls of lennox of whom we are now to give an account  the first of them we can fix upon with any certainty is    aykfrith or egfrith an english saxon lord who was possessed of a great estate in northumberland ordericus vitali which with cumberland and westmorland belonged to the scots for several generations it is therefore probable that he was of scotch extract he had also the lordships of dent and sadbergh thoreby ducatus loidiensi p    in yorkshire and was cotemporary with the kings canute and edward the confessor  he made a great addition to his paternal estate by the marriage of ecksrida a rich yorkshire heiress doomsday book in registro honoris de richmond with whom he got vast possessions viz the lands and

his fidelity who being too young to have been concerned in his fathers conspiracies ibidem got a good share of his yorkshire estate  another dangerous insurrection having been raised against the conqueror by the northern counties in the year  0   arkyll joined heartily in it and being again defeated was forfeited and obliged to leave england ordericus vitalis p     etsimon dunelmensis p    according to these words of the said author  eodem tamen anno arkyllus fuit inter rebels eboracenses quibus profligatis a conquestore in exilium actus est etc  arkyll fled to scotland to king malcolm

fought upon the   d day of july      henricus de knighton etc   into what family this heroic earl married we cannot with any degree of certainty affirm but if tradition can be credited it was to a sister or daughter of donald earl of mar and certain it is he had issue two sons who survived him    donald his heir    murdoch who obtained in patrimony from his brother the lands of duntreath etc in

representative and is the only branch of that illustrious and once flourishing family now subsisting in a direct maleline  xi margaret only child of earl donald succeeded to the estate of lennox by her fathers destination but not to the honors which he could not give and neither she nor her husband ever assumed them  she married walter of faslane son of alan of faslane the first of this family we find upon record who obtained the lands of faslane from malcolm fifth earl of lennox and his son donald the sixth and last of the old earls of lennox gives a charter of confirmation to walter of

is made of the original donation by earl malcolm to alan of faslane autogr pen macfarlane before observed  though this family used no other surname but that of faslane duncan stuart in the history of the royal family yet a late author derives their descent from walter third lord high steward of scotland and this seems to be in some measure confirmed by a charter of alan of faslane to which his seal was appended having thereon a fess cheque of three tracts writs of adincaple with some other mark of distinction but be this as it will it is certain that walter of faslane soon after his marriage with margaret the heiress relinquished his own paternal coat and assumed the armorial bearing of this family and his posterity took on the surname of lennox whereof the eldest son was to get the estate of lennox which came by his mother and his second was to get his own paternal estate of faslane etc  he was at last designed dominus de lennox which appears by a charter waltero de faslane domino de lennox et haeredibus suis comitibus de lennox etc anno      chartulary of lennox p    and in november      this walter of faslane in person and margaret the heiress his wise by letters

ibidem etc  what became of these three brothers or whether any of them succeeded to the estate of faslane we can give no further account but walter of faslane and margaret the heiress were succeeded in the territory of lennox by their eldest son  xii sir duncan lennox knight grandson of donald the sixth earl and heir of line of the family who having the prospect of a great estate and malcolm macfarlane ancestor of the lord of macfarlane the undoubted heirmale of the old earls declining to accept a dignity which he thought he had not estate sufficient to support king robert ii out of a grateful remembrance of the many and eminent services performed to the kings his predecessors by the family of lennox conferred de novo ibidem upon the said sir duncan and his heirs the dignity of earl of lennox after it had lain dormant for the space of eight or ten years ever since the death of earl donald in       there are a great many charters still extant relating to duncan earl of lennox but by none of them can we discover into what family he married chartularies of lennox pasley etc only we are sure he had three daughters    isabel    margaret    elizabeth of whom more particularly hereafter  the earl entered into an indenture with robert earl of fise and meneith afterward duke of albany and governor of scotland during the minority of king james i whereby it was agreed that sir murdoch stewart son and heir to the said earl of fife shall have to wife isabel eldest daughter to the said earl of lennox and that the earl shall resign his haill earldom of lennox in the kings hands for new inestment thereof to himself and the heirsmale lawfully to be begotten of his body which failing to the said sir murdoch and isabel and the heirs to be procreate betwixt them which failing to

returned from england duncan earl of lennox was arrested at the kings instance was incarcerate in the castle of edinburgh and from thence carried to the castle of stirling where he was accused not of

father duke robert the kings uncle in    0 but as there is a full account of him his children and death inserted in the title duke of albany page   th and   th of this work we shall here only briefly mention his four sons viz   robert who died before himself unmarried   sir walter   sir alexander who both suffered with their father   sir james who upon his fathers grandfathers and brothers imprisonment broke out into open rebellion burnt the town of dunbarton and among others killed sir john stewart of dundonald governor of the castle there etc for which he was outlawed and immediately obliged to fly to ireland where he died without lawful issue before the month of may in the year      but he had several natural sons who afterward came over to scotland act of legitimation in the public regist and were preferred to great honors three whereof were legitimated by king james iii anno       after the entail in      before narrated all the vassals of the earldom of lennox thought it absolutely necessary to have the charters granted by earl duncan confirmed to them by his eldest daughter and undoubted heiress isabel of this we have many instances in the records etc particularly a charter granted to william lord graham ancestor to the duke of montrose anno      of the lands of errachy gartcarron strahblane balgrochyr and many others wherein she is designed isabella stewart

duke of lennox  xiii margaret third daughter of earl duncan though by some authors said to be second was married to robert menteith of rusky ibidem who insefts her in some of his lands   th july      by her he had a son  murdoch menteith of rusky who married christian daughter of sir david murray of tullibardine ancestor of the duke of athole and had by her a son patrick who died without

ejusdem quondam duncani proai sui chart penes franciscum dom napier de tota quarta part comitatus de levenax etc  the above mentioned heirs portioners had a long contest amongst themselves concerning the division and succession to the earldom of lennox which was at last determined in favors of the family of dnly anno      whereby that earldom came to the stewarts and in consequnence of the above descent the stewarts of darnly and haldanes of gleneagles quarter the arms of lennox with their own but the napiers of merchiston have ever since assumed the arms of lennox in place of the old bearing of the napiers  by the preceding narration it appears nisbet vol i p     that the earldom of lennox according to the above mentioned entail went in a regular course of succession to the lawful heirs of line of that ancient family which is fully instructed by the above indisputable documents and if earl duncan had had a son lawfully born he would have had a just and undoubted right to both the estate and title of earl of lennox in which case the female succession could never have taken place  yet we must here observe that the said earl duncan had a son donald who in an authentic charter of confirmation from the countess of lennox of the lands of balgrochyr is designed filius legitimus quondam duncani comitis de lennox etc these lands of balgrochyr ly in the parish of camsie and earldom of lennox the charter is granted by sir william graham of kincardine ancestor of the duke of montrose in      which lands he held of the lord of craigbernard and he of the family of lennox therefore

upon him the command of the garrison where he behaved with such singular resolution and conduct that he obliged the count to raise the siege the burghers were so sensible of the great service he had done them that they made him considerable presents and struck several medals in honor of him upon that occasion some whereof are still preserved in the family  in    0 he drove the imperialists

ker marquis of lothian that the noble and illustrious name of ker is of very great antiquity in scotland appears from many authentic documents  some deduce them from a noble family of that surname in france one whereof came over to england with william the conqueror had a considerable command in his army and afterward settled in england in confirmation of which they allege that baron ker and several other families of that surname now subsisting in france trace their origin even higher than that era  others are of opinion that ker is a local surname and was first assumed by the possessors of the lands and baronies of ker and kershall in lancashire where several families of that name have made a considerable figure for many ages past but it must be observed that the kers in england and france have the very same armorial bearings so whether they came from france to england or from england to france we shall not pretend to determine  sir george mackenzie that learned and judicious antiquary is of opinion that the kers first settled in the south parts of scotland about the year    0 but it is most certain they were a numerous and flourishing family in this country long before

robert kers but whether they came from england or france or were sons of any of the abovenamed kers he does not determine but thinks that ralph ancestor of the kers of fernyhirst was the eldest brother because that family carried the same arms with the kers in england and france without any difference either of tincture or charge we shall therefore follow that great author and deduce their descent according to his account  i ralph ker who settled in teviotdale about the year    0 got possession of the lands lying betwixt the water of jed and the lands of straseburgh of which the earls

family it is said that one julius de berry a french gentleman of rank who lived near bourbon made a great entertainment at his house for the king of france as he passed that way that amongst other delicacies there were fine strawberries fully ripened before the ordinary time wherewith the king was so well pleased that he assigned him strawberry leaves for his arms which in the french language are called frases or frasiers from which he assumed fraser for his surname and certain it is the frasers continue to carry strawberry leaves or frases for their armorial bearing to this day  the time of their first settling in this country is uncertain mkenzies essy mr mtins collections etc some authors say that a nobleman of france called pierre frasier came to scotland in the reign of king

abercombie simsons hist of the stewarts etc grandson of bancho thane of lochaber paternal ancestor of the royal family of stewart  the frasers were undoubtedly settled and had considerable possessions

over the scots under his conduct particularly at homildon in   0  and at the battle of shrewsbury in   0  where the victory was chiefly ascribed to the earl of marchs military skill  after all he became weary of distressing his native country and made application to robert duke of albany governor of scotland for a pardon who gave him a favorable answer upon which he came to scotland and was restored to all his estates and honors by the governor anno   0  and lived peaceably in his own country all the remainder of his days  he married christian daughter of sir william seton of that ilk

english about the redemption of king james i rymer anno      which was happily accomplished the year thereafter and the earl had the honor of knighthood conferred upon him at the solemnity of the kings coronation  though it does not appear that this earl was ever guilty of any bad practices against the state yet the ravages and devastations committed by his father against his country during his rebellion made many good subjects enemies to his family they endeavored to prepossess the king against him and to convince him that it was not in the power of a governor to restore to his estate and fully to pardon so great and formidable a rebel as his father was who had been justly outlawed and forfeited by the iaws of the land  the earl was apprehended and committed prisoner to the castle of edinburgh but the king would suffer nothing to be done against him contrary to law he therefore called a parliament to meet at perth in order for his trial on  0th january       the earl pled that his father had been fully pardoned by the duke of albany then governor of scotland and that he had never been guilty of any crime against the state  the advocates for the king replied that the power of restoring rebels and exiles was lodged in the king alone and never in the person of a governor  at last after long debate the parliament passed sentence against him in these words  quod ratione

alexander duke of albany anno       yet such was the kings goodness and bounty to this earl that he bestowed upon him a pension out of the earldom of buchan then in the crown which supported him

which was no inconsiderable sum in those days and sufficiently shows the kings lenity and good will toward the family  it appears also that the parliament only forfeited his lands that held of the king for we find that this patrick and his heirs possessed the lands and barony of kilconquhar in fife which was the undoubted property of the earls of march but they held these lands of the bishop of st andrews who granted a new charter book of original charter belonging to macfarlane patricio dunbar filio et haeredi quondam georgii comitis de march terrarum baroniae de kilconquhar etc circa annum

ever has produced a family fruitful in a race of great men who not indebted to the nobility of their origin have always reflected greater glory on their progenitors on the hereditary titles and offices they enjoyed than they ever deduced from them  our best antiquaries derive their origin from a certain great man called robert who performed glorious exploits against the danes when they invaded scotland with a numerous army in the reign of king malcolm ii cambden abercrombie vol   p  0  stewarts hist of the royal family and many other authors though some trace their origin much higher however this hero remarkaby distinguished himself at the battle of barry or camustone in angus where with his own hand he killed the famous camus general and champion of the danish army whereby the scots gained a complete victory anno  0 0  king malcolm in recompense of his great and signal services bestowed upon him several lands particularly the barony of keith in eastlothian from which his posterity assumed their surname he also appointed him hereditary great marishal of scotland which high office has continued in his family and has never been enjoyed by any other since that time  of this great warrior was lineally descended herveus or hervieus de keth of whom we have many authentic documents in the archives of the kingdom which sufficiently prove that he was great marishal of scotland and proprietor of the lands and barony of keth and as he was undoubted progenitor of this illustrious family from him we deduce their descent by unquestionable vouchers  i herveus de keth great marishal of scotland flourished in the reign of king david i who succeeded to the crown anno      and died anno       this herveus had a dispute with the abbot and convent of kelso chartulary of kelso penes macfarlane p    who claimed the church of keth in the village of this herveus designed herveus de keth marescallus regis scotiae at a convention held on that cause to which j bishop of glasgow and r abbot of jedworth are witnesses inter annos      et      in which last year the bishop died  that there had been many meetings and conventions about this contest sufficiently appears from the writs in the chartulary of kelso  at last the pope interposed his authority and joceline bishop of glasgow and osbert prior of paisley were delegated by him as judges of the plea ibid p    which had long sublisted between the monks of kelchou and herveus great marishal about the church of keth in the village of the said herveus etc their sentence in favors of the monastery was confirmed by richard bishop of st andrews who died anno      ibid p    and joceline having been constituted bishop of glasgow anno      ibidem the controversy must have been determined between these two periods  it may here be observed that of old there were two keiths that which belonged to this family was promiscuously called keithhervey ibid p    and chart in pub archiv and keithmarishal the other which sometime belonged to the frasers was called keithsymons or keithhundely now humby but the great marishals soon became proprietors of both as will be shown hereafter  herveus de keth lived to a great age died betwixt the years    0 and      and was father of  ii malcolmus de keth who in a donation to the monastery of arbroath chartulary of arbroath penes macfarlane p  0  is designed son of herveus

keth great marishal of scotland is a witness anno       he is also mentioned in another donation to the same monastery ibid p     together with robert de ednem thomas de heriz etc before the year    0  this malcolm appears to have died before his father for we never find him designed great marishal he left issue two sons    philip de keth    david de keth who enjoyed a share of the marishals office with his brother chartulary of arbroath and cambuskenneth and dalrymples collections as in several donations to the monasteries of arbroath and cambukenneth we find philip and david de keth designed brothers and great marishals of our lord the king between the years      and      this david had a son richard origin writs penes macfarlane vol ii p       etc ad ann          and      who is said to

afterward succeeded by that of earl but as most of the accounts of the origin and descent of our great families before the reign of king malcolm iii are only traditional and sometimes sabulous we shall begin the memoirs of this illustrious family from the reign of that king since which era the unintered possession of it down to the present time is clearly documented by our histories and records  all our historians agree that king malcolm iii called canmore held a conentus procerum or parliament at forsar in the beginning of his reign by some authors said to be in  0   and by others in  0   at which general meeting malcolm created some of the chiefs of his nobility earls by the titles they formerly enjoyed  thanes amongst whom was martacns thane afterward earl of mar who probably

most noble and ancient family undoubtedly devolved upon robert lord erskme lineally descended of lady helen only daughter of the said eleventh earl as before observed  alexander earl of mar in right of his wise in manner abovementioned being a man of an enterprizing genius became weary of a peaceable life at home he therefore raised a large company of gentlemen his followers carried them to flanders and with them entered into the service of john duke of burgundy where he and his followers performed such feats of chivalry at the siege of liege abercromby etc as acquired great reputation both to himself and his countrymen  he then married jean duchess or countess of brabant and in her right claimed that sovereignty but the brabanters refusing to submit to the government of a foreigner and the countess dying within little more than a year after their marriage he returned home greatly incensed against the brabanters  he therefore immediately fitted out a fleet and failed to the coast of flanders where he attacked a large fleet of the brabanters returning from dantzick hathornden etc richly ladened all which he took pillaged and destroyed and returned to scotland with vast wealth and booty  though this sir alexander had no right to the earldom of mar but by his charters from isabel countess thereof as is above narrated whereby the whole was limited to the heirs to be procreated betwixt them which failing to return to her heirs etc yet soon after his return to scotland he made a resignation of the earldom of mar lordship of garrioch etc into the kings hands for new infeftment to himself etc upon which the king granted a new charter to the said sir alexander and thomas stewart his natural son and their heirsmale which failing to the king and his heirs whatever

about the earldom of mar betwixt the king as having right by the resignation and charter above narrated and robert lord erskine who as this earldom appears to have descended to heirs general had an undoubted right and title thereto for the whole descendents of gratney eleventh earl of mar were now failed except those of his daughter  i lady elyne beforementioned who married sir john menteith lord of arran by whom she had issue only one daughter  ii christian menteith married to sir edward keith to whom she had an only child  iii janet keith who married thomas seventh lord erskine to whom

retours in the archives of the family of mar   d april      to elizabeth countess of mar the last descendent of the body of donald twelfth earl of mar only son of gratney eleventh earl who was the common great great grandfather or atavus of isabel last countess of mar and of robert lord erskine as above deduced  we shall only here observe before we proceed to the history of the family of erskine that though the earls of mar as far back as we have any records were amongst the greatest and most illustrious families in the kingdom yet we find few or none of their descendents who assumed mar for their surname  nicol de mar is witness in a charter of king malcolm iv to the town of inverness haddingtons collections ante      in which year king malcolm died  thomas earl of mar grants a charter to john de mar of some lands in aberdeenshire in the reign of david ii ibid p     who succeeded to the crown of scotland anno       johannes de mar miles rymer tom vi p    was taken prisoner at the battle of durham anno      etc etc  but we cannot connect any of these with this family  erskine earl of mar all our antiquaries agree that this noble family is of very great antiquity but the history of its origin like that of most other ancient families is chiefly founded on tradition  some authors deduce their descent from a noble florentine who is said to have come to scotland in the reign of king kenneth ii  it is said by others that in the reign of king malcolm ii a scotsman of high distinction having killed with his own hand enrique one of the danish generals at the battle of murthill cut off his head and with the bloody dagger in his hand showed it to the king and in the gaelic said erisskyne alluding to the head and dagger and in the same language also said i intend to perform greater actions than what i have done etc whereupon king malcolm imposed upon him the surname of erskyne and assigned him for his armorial bearing a hand holding a dagger with je pense plus for a motto which has continued to be the crest and motto of this noble family ever since  but we shall insist no further on these traditional accounts and shall here only observe that it is most certain that this family had vast possessions in the shires of renfrew and air in very early times particularly the lands barony and castle of erskine a beautiful seat upon the banks of the river clyde whether the erskines gave their name to their lands or took it from them we shall not pretend to determine but certain it is there is no account either from records or tradition of any persons being possessed of the lands of erskine before them  the first of the family we can mention from any good authority is  i henricus or henry de erskine he was proprietor and lord of the barony of

year  after which lord erskine took the title of earl of mar lord of garrioch etc and granted many charters of lands belonging thereto  notwithstanding that robert lord erskine was acknowledged as earl of mar and acted as such yet he was never entirely in peaceable possession of that earldom for king james iis council got an act passed in his first parliament declaring that whatsoever lands his majestys father died possessed of or had claimed ibidem should remain with the king during his minority  by an indenture betwixt the kings council and robert lord erskine calling himself earl of mar it was agreed for the guide and quiet of the land that the king shall deliver up to lord erskine the castle of kildrimmie to be kept by him till the kings majority which done the said lord shall come before the king and three estates and show his rights and claims as far as law will and further it is accordit that half the revenues belonging to the earldom of mar shall remain with the said lord till the ending of the plea and that whenever the said lord shall receive the castle of kildrimmie he shall deliver up not only the castle of mar but likeways the castle of dumbarton writs of the fam of mar dated  0th august    0  there is a protest taken by said lord erskine in the hands of richard cadie notar in the presence of the king and council in stirling castle  th august      complaining upon the chancellor for refusing to retour him to the lordship of garrioch and put him in possession of the castle of kildrimmie protesting that he might and should be free to intromit at his own hand with the haill lands of mar and garrioch etc  and accordingly he immediately after besieged and took the castle of kildrimmie whereupon the king seized the castle of alloa ibidem   for the recovery of which there was an indenture entered into between the king and council on the one part and lord erskine on the other by which lord erskine oblige himself to deliver up the castle of kildrimmie betwixt and the third july next to any the king should appoint to be kept by them till the kings majority and then to be delivered up to either of them who should be found to have right to it at the sight of the three estates and to account to the king at his majority for the one half of the earldom of mar and the king and council on their part obliged themselves that so soon as the castle of kildrimmie should be delivered up to thse appointed by the king his majesty should deliver up to lord erskine his castle of alloa and all the furniture and warlike stores found therein this indenture is sealed by the kings privy seal and the seals of william bishop of glasgow and of james of livingston then keepers of the kings person and the lords of graeme and gray bind themselves as cautioners for the king and councils fulfilling their part of the indentures and on the part of lord erskine his seal and the seal of his son and heir sir thomas erskine is affixed and sir henry douglas of lochleven thomas of wemyss and william auchterlony of kelly bind themselves as cautioners for the father and sons performing their part of the indentures which bears date the  0th june      ibidem   on the  th september      sir thoma erskine appeared in parliament as procurator for his father and took instruments in the hands of john anthrie notar that lord erskine was ready to fulfill the terms of the above indenture and that his right should not be prejudised by lapse of time ibidem he being willing to submit all questions to be determined by a full and free parliament suspected persons burgesses being removed  there are many other protests taken by robert lord erskine and his son sir thomas betwixt this time and the year      but as they are all to the same purpose with the last mentioned one ibidem it is unnecessary to insert more of them here  at last in the year      the king brought a reduction against sir thomas now lord erskine his father being then dead of his father lord erskines service ibidem abovementioned to isabel countess of mar  the heads of the reduction are   st that lord erskine ought not to have been served heir in pub archiv because there were no witnesses who could swear to his being come of elyne of mar who was long since dead    dly because the said service was contrary to the act of parliament anent the kings keeping possession of all lands or rights his majestys father was in possession of or had claimed at the time of his decease    dly because isabel countess of mar was not the person who died last vested and fased in that earldom but alexander stewart and thomas his natural son to both whom the king was heir    thly because the king himself was nearest heir to isabel countess of mar as being descended from isabel of mar king robert bruces first queen mother of princess marjory and isabel of mar being eldest daughter of gratney earl of mar ought to be preferred to the descendents of elyne her second sister in the earldom of mar which was an indivisable subject  upon these grounds an assize of error met at aberdeen where the king himself was present and they by their verdict dated   th may      reduced the service of robert lord erskine and sound that the king only had right to the earldom of mar lordship of garrioch etc  this reduction was confirmed in parliament records of parliament  th november       but against all these proceedings thomas lord erskine entered his protest and he and his posterity always continued to assert their right to the earldom of mar and to complain of the violence with which they said it was wrested from them  at last in the reign of queen mary john then lord erskine obtained leave to have this question tried anew and to have it determined by an inquest whether he was nearest heir to isabel countess of mar or not and lord erskine having laid before the inquest the proofs of his propinquity as above deduced and shown that there was nothing in the four reasons of reduction at the instance of the king         st because it never was before heard of or pretended that the proof of propinquity to ones ancestors by undoubted records was not as valid as that by witnesses which in many cases by lapse of time was rendered impossible that if this was to be established as a rule the king would be found to have right to one half of the lands of scotland as well as to the earldom of mar  that as to the second reason the act of parliament anent the kings keeping possession during his minority that could be no reason for reducing the service of robert lord erskine to isabel countess of mar but only for not giving him possession till the kings majority  that as to the third reason that isabel countess of mar did not die last vested and saised but earl alexander her husband and thomas his natural son it was of no weight because that alexander was only saised of that estate in right of liferent failing issue of the marriage as appeared by the charter of the said countess isabel and earl alexander dated  th december   0   and which is confirmed by king roberts charter of confirmation   st january   0   by which it undeniably appears that the charter of resignation by isabel countess of mar   th august   0  was altered both by the parties concerned and their sovereign lord the king and therefore the resignation and charter that followed thereon   th may      in favors of the said alexander and thomas his natural son who died before him without issue was null and void  that as to the fourth reason that isabel of mar queen to robert bruce was daughter to gratney earl of mar and eldest sister to elyne who married sir john menteith that it was well known that isabel of mar queen to robert bruce was sister to gratney earl of mar and not his daughter but daughter to earl of mar his father which was fully proved by gratney earl of mar being always styled in king roberts charters his brother but never his father  the inquest accordingly met and found by their retour dated  th may      that he was the nearest heir to robert earl of mar and  lord erskine etc which robert was  heir to isabel countess of mar and to gratney earl of mar her great grandfather  and in      he was restored to the earldom of mar per udum justitiae which was ratified in parliament  th june       he obtained a charter under the great seal as heir to lady isabel countess of mar of the whole estate and earldom of mar comprehending strathdon braemarr cromarr stathde and lordship of garrioch etc   d june       and there is an instrument of sasine dated the   th of july thereafter  the lands abovementioned having been all in nonentry from the year      to the      being   0 years  we have chosen to give the reader the whole of this remarkable suit at

likeways as has been beforementioned renewed his claim to the earldom of mar and obtained liberty to have that cause reheard and his right being clearly and distinctly proven he was restored per modum justitiae to the earldom of mair lordship of garrioch etc anno      the same was afterward ratified and confirmed by parliament  th june      as before observed he took his seat accordingly as earl of mar rolls of parliament and he and his successors have always since protested that they ought to be called as the first earl  there is a charter from queen mary and king henry in archiv  mar to john earl of mar   th july      narrating that the family of erskine of long and bygone times had the custody and keeping of the principal forts and places of strength in the kingdom and had always discharged their trust faithfully and stoutly and their majestys being desirous to keep noble ancient and untainted families in their native lands rights and possessions and to make them secure of the same and particularly considering that john earl of mar and his predecessors had for a long time bygone been keepers of the castle of stirling and sheriffs of the shire thereof therefore they gave and granted heretably and irredeemably to the said earl of mar and his heirs bearing the arms and surname of erskine the office of sheriff of stirlingshire or the prefecture or captainship and custody of the castle of stirling with the park garden etc etc ibidem together with the office of bailiary and chamberlainry of the lands and lordship of stirling and of the water of forth etc  in the year      how soon king james vi was born the care and keeping of him was committed to the earl of mar which great trust he faithfully discharged and with great prudence and firmness took all imaginable care of his royal education and to protect his sacred person from the violence and snares of the two contending parties who left no means whatsoever untried of getting him into their hands melvils memoirs and all our historians for this reason he removed the king from edinburgh to stirling where he was governor and had the sole command although he always behaved with the utmost submission to the queen and had the greatest regard for her majesty yet the unhappy situation of his country at that time forced him to concur with those who set the crown on the princes head anno      and as he appears not to have been satisfied with the intentions of either of the parties nor with their method of pursuing them he declined being engaged on either side further than the preservation of the kings person and the liberties of his country made it absolutely necessary for him to be and although when the factions came to blows he generally joined and supported the party that called themselves the kings yet as he plainly showed that he thought them too much guided and influenced by the court of england it is certain they never let him into any of their secrets  when the earl of lennox the regent was surprised and killed in the town of stirling he by the timely assistance he brought to the kings party prevented the whole heads of it from being cut off or made prisoners and when a new regent was to be chosen the confidence that the nation in general had in the earl of marrs integrity and moderation forced the kings party to consent to his being made regent notwithstanding all the practices used by queen elizabeth and her ambassadors to prevent it  so soon as he was in possession of that high office he applied himself vigorously to allay as far as possible the factions which tore his country in pieces and to free it from the influence of english councils in order to these things he had accomodated matters with kirkcaldie of grange ibidem and others who were in possession of the castle of edinburgh and persuaded them to join and cooperate with him to bring about peace and tranquillity thing so much to be wished for but just when he was on the point of bringing these good purposes to bear he to the great misfortune of his country died a young man in november      as some say not without the suspicion of poison  he married annabella murray daughter of lord tullibardine by whom he had a son  john his heir  and a daughter  lady margaret married to archibald earl of angus  he was succeeded by his son  xiv john fourteenth lord erskine and seventh earl of mar who was very young at the time of his fathers death and was educated in the castle of stirling along with king james vi whom the states of the kingdom after the death of lord mar committed to the care of his widow the countess of mar and though this earl had been educated with king james yet he in his younger days was so far seduced by some others of the nobility as to forget himself and the unblemished loyalty of his ancestors and to join with them in surprising the king at ruthen anno      for which his whole lands were justly seized and he obliged to fly the country however he soon became sensible of the crime he had committed chart in pub archiv et amil de mar and the king was so gracious as to pardon him restore to him his whole estate and receive him again into his favor  in the year      the king entrusted the keeping of his new born son and heir as usual to the earl of mar with a strict order to him not to deliver him up to any person whatever ibidem without a written mandate under his own hand and in case of his death not to deliver him to any person whatsomever neither to the queen his mother nor even to the parliament if they required it till he was eighteen years of age then he would command himself  lord mar was naturally a man of great abilities and being bred from his infancy in the factious court of king james vi he became an able statesman he was the person the king chose to send to england to congratulate queen elizabeth upon the suppression of the attempt of the earl of essex melvil and all our historians and it is acknowledged he entered into some secret negotiations and measures for securing the kings succession to the crown of england he was accompanied by the abbot of kinloss and matters were managed with such dexterity and address that most of the queens ministers and great men of england entered into engagements unknown to her majesty and to one another to support king jamess title to the crown of england  when king james went to england anno   0  he carried lord mar along with him but before he came to york lord mar was obliged to return to scotland to appease queen anne who had demanded her daughter princess elizabeth and her son prince charles whom lord mar had left under the care of his countess with express command not to deliver them to any person whatever without an order under his hand it is said that the queen never forgave him this  however immediately thereafter he followed the king to england and so soon as he got to london he was appointed a privy councillor of that kingdom and was enstalled one of the knights of the garter at windsor   0   he continued much at court and greatly in the kings favor for the first eight or ten years after he went to england who entrusted and confided much in him with regard to the

summoned to appear before the parliament to take that solemn league betwixt and the beginning of january then next but at that time he was with the king so did not appear  upon the   th of january

no maleissue the earldom of murray went with his eldest daughter to james lord down ancestor of the present earl of murray who being lineally descended from robert duke of albany from him we proceed to deduce the descent of this noble family by unquestionable authority  i robert duke of albany governor of scotland was third son of king robert ii by elizabeth more  he married margaret grandchild and heiress of alan earl of menteith by whom he had a son  ii murdoch duke of albany who succeeded him in his estate and honors was also governor of scotland and was very active and instrumental in

commonly called beg ancestor of the stewarts of baldoran etc  it is proper here to observe that though it has been said by some authors that these sons were born before their father and mother were married consequently not lawful yet it must be owned that the subsequent marriage of their parents by the law of scotland legitimated them to all intents and purposes but further because they were born out of the kingdom it was thought necessary to get an act of legitimation from the crown which they obtained both under the privy and great seals for the greater security and more evident testimony etc as the record bears to and in favors of andrew lord evandale chart in pub archiv arthur and walter stewarts his brothersgerman etc etc dated at edinburgh   th april      note the other

james earl of arran etc protests for himself and in name of his fathers house of ochiltrie that neither the duke of lennoxs grace nor nae other has right to carry the crown or be nearest to the kings

royal house of stewart and can boast what few subjects can do strathallan lesly van bassan sir g mackenzie hathornden bail marn etc etc that most of the crowned heads in europe are descended from them as will clearly appear by the following memoirs  the traditional account of their origin handed down to us by several good historians is  i that an hungarian gentleman named mauricius or maurice a son of george a younger son of andrew king of hungary had the command of the ship in which edgar atheline the rightful heir to the english crown his mother agatha and his sisters the princesses margaret

the name of st margarets hope so called after princess margaret who became queen to king malcolm iii called canmore and is well known by the name of st margaret  this maurice being a man of parts and merit was highly esteemed by king malcolm who to induce him to settle in scotland conferred many favors upon him and gave him considerable possessions in the shires of dunbarton and stirling

obtained from that great prince for his good and faithful services chart in pub archiv et chart in archiv familiae de perth a grant of several lands in perthshire anno      and perhaps it is no improbable conjecture that the caltrops were then first added by way of copartment to his coat of arms as they were used on that memorable occasion with great success against the english horse and very possibly by the advice or under the direction of sir malcolm  the year thereafter in a full parliament where he sat as one of the barons majores regni he made a resignation into the kings hands

independency of his country he opposed the union strenuously as in his opinion evidently tending to destroy both  it is much for the credit and shows the disinterestedness of this nobleman that though

majority he returned to scotland and applied himself entirely to the management of his private affairs to the encouragement of the liberal as well as the useful arts to the improvement of husbandry and the manufactures not only upon his own estate but through the whole kingdom wherever his influence extended and thereby became a most excellent member of civil life as he had early imbibed all the principles of his family and devoted himself to the service of the house of stewart so soon as charles the young pretender arrived he was amongst the first of those who joined his standard with all the force he could raise he was his first lieutenant general at the battle of preston commanded at the siege of carlisle and stirling and during the whole time of the rebellion on every occasion acted with the greatest courage and conduct having no other point in view but as far as in him lay to promote the good of the cause in which he was embarked in spite of a very delicate constitution he underwent the greatest of fatigues and was the first on every occasion of duty where his head or his hands could be of use bold as a lion in the field of battle but ever merciful in the hour of victory with an heart open to all the delicate feelings of humanity these mild and gentle affections that peculiarly distinguished the brave filled his breast with universal benevolence made him attentive to relieve the miseries and calamities of the distressed wherever he found them and put him always in remembrance that no distinction of party can blot out the character of man  after the battle of cullodden he embarkked for france but by this time his constitution being quite exhausted with the fatigues he had undergone he died in the passage upon the   th day of may      his body was kept for some days in expectation of making the land but being detained by contrary winds at last it was obliged to be buried in the sea  by an act of parliament it was declared that all persons that were concerned in the rebellion and did not surrender before the month of july should be deemed convicts for high treason but as this james died before the limited time the attainder did not take place against him however it sell with all its weight upon his brother and heir lord john who was embarked in the same cause and in his person the whole estate of perth was forfeited to the crown this john was educated at doway where he very soon discovered a strong propensity and forward genius toward a military life and accordingly the bent of his studies were turned that way  after having acquired some of the accomplishments necessary for a soldier he entered into the service of the king of france and when he had passed through several gradations got the command of a regiment which he raised himself and was named the royal scotch he had the same warmth and affection for the interest of the house of stewart that his brother and father had and commanded the french piquets that were sent over in      in support of that cause during the time of the rebellion he always acted as a good officer and his corpse was of considerable advantage on several occasions to his party after the defeat at cullodden he made his escape to france in the same ship in which his brother embarked and resumed the command of his own regiment under the conduct of marshal saxe in flanders where he distinguished himself on many occasions but in none more than in the care and concern he showed for any of the british subjects that were taken prisoners or in distress here he exerted the generosity of his mind and displayed that goodness of heart that ever distinguishes true nobility after the siege of bergenopzoom he was appointed a major general when lying ill of a fever of which he soon thereafter died and was buried in the chapel of the english nuns at antwerp he also leaving no issue the representation devolved upon his uncle  lord john drummond before mentioned who was eldest son of the chancellors second marriage he had a noble and liberal education having spent a great part of his younger years in foreign parts particularly at the courts of france and spain he was master of a dignity of manners that claimed the esteem of every body kind and benevolent to his friends affable and polite in his behavior to all men firm and steady in the principles which he believed right

manner suitable to his rank he married  st the heiress of balegarno  dly lady mary stewart daughter of charles earl of traquair but died without issue at edinburgh anno      and was buried in the

and illustrious family yields to none in the kingdom for antiquity our historians mention thanes and earls of sutherland as soon as those dignities were known in scotland  they are said to be sprung from a warlike people called the moravii who came from germany to this country in the reign of king corbred i to whom they gave great assistance in his wars against the romans  king corbred rewarded them nobly gave them large possessions in the northern parts martins collect gordons history of sutherl cambden colliers dict scotch compend etc where they settled from them the county of murray had its name and their posterity became proprietors of all that large tract of country now called murray ross sutherland caithness etc  there is a very good history of this noble family written by sir robert gordon of gordonstoun a man of great ingenuity learning and knowledge but he deduces their descent no farther back than  alan thane of sutherland a man of great power and authority who flourished in the reigns of king duncan and macbeth the usurper when the northern parts had been invaded by a considerable body of danes and norvegians under the conduct of their king olaus and had

  he was made lord high treasurer of scotland and his majesty having had many proofs of his loyalty and fidelity appointed him his high commissioner records of parliament of the church both to the parliament and general assembly anno       in that high station he asserted the kings prerogative with such firmness and intrepidity that he gained himself many enemies even amongst the more moderate sort so that his majesty was most unwillingly forced to lay him aside though he knew him to have been a most faithful minister  he was afterward impeached for treason by the parliament      of which they found him guilty but submitted his punishment to the king who knew his only crime had been his steady attachment to his interest he therefore ordered him a pardon under the great seal ibidem wherein is fully narrated an ample testimony of his great abilities and singular integrity in the discharge of his duty  though the brevity of this work will not permit us to give a minute detail of all the transactions and vicissitudes of fortune that attended this noble lord yet we cannot but observe that though he has been most unjustly aspersed by the sactious party which then prevailed yet his royal master was always convinced of his fidelity and the uprightness of his heart which many original letters from his majesty all written with his own hand and still preserved in the family which we have seen do sufficiently testify we therefore take the liberty to insert some few of them here the first was written immediately after the parliament had passed sentence against him

battle of philiphaugh  though there are many others of the same nature amongst the writs of this family both from his majesty and other ministers wherein his fidelity is applauded by all yet we think it unnecessary to trouble our readers with any more of them  after the parliament passed sentence upon him in      his estate was sequestrated and he was banished his native country he went directly to the king was most graciously received and the above letters show that he was constantly trusted and employed by his majesty ever after  he was with the king at oxford in      when the scotch army

scotch nation in wisdom and dexterity and though he was often provoked by the insolence of some of the bishops to a dislike of their overmuch servor and too little discretion his integrity to the king

great and illustrious family of murray earl of tullibardin is fully set forth and deduced under the title of murray duke of athole and earl of tullibardin page   st of this work etc to that we refer our readers  hay marquis of tweeddale the antiquity of the noble and illustrious name of hay is sufficiently attested both by ancient and modern historians and though we shall not pretend to disprove the traditional account of their origin from the battle of loncarty about the year   0 which is so fully narrated in many scotch histories and particularly under the title of errol page    th of this work yet we beg leave to offer to the readers consideration some conjectures which are supported by many presumptive proofs and concurring circumstances viz  that the surname of hay came originally from france that there were lands and a lordship or that denoation in yormandy from which its preable the surname was first assumed histoire sommaire de nor mandie par le sireur de massavile penes macfarlane long before the time or william the co this is attested by undoubted authority  humphry  de vetulis lord of pontaude in  and one of the most considerable  in that country married albreda de  or  by whom he had a son roger de bellamont or beamont lord o pontandemar who gave the name of beaumontoger to a town in normandy ibidem and dugdales baronage of england and was one of the council who persuaded william duke of normandy to invade england before the year  0    in the list of the great captains that came over from normandy to england with that heroic prince hist of normandy vol i p  0  and roll of battle abbay etc le sieur de la haya is expressly mentioned with several others of the same name which plainly shows that they were a numerous and flourishing family before the conquest  that there were several religious houses founded by them appears from the same history particularly le abbay de blancheland in the diocese of contasines histoire de normandy was founded and endowed by richard de la haya in normandy anno       that the hays in normandy had the same amorial bearings with these in scotland books of arms of old french families pen macfarlane   and that for some generations after they were settled in scotland many of them were designed by the appellation of de la haya all which  strong presumptive proofs that they came originally from france prynnes collect rymers foed angliae and it is certain that there are families of that surname subsisting in normandy to this day who deduce their pedigree above a hundred years before the conquest  as then there is clear proof that several of that name came to britain in the year  0   and as it appears from our records that they were settled and making a figure in scotland within less than an hundred years thereafter it is extremely probable that some of that race came to scotland with our king david i as it appears from all our histories that several of norman extraction who had contracted a friendship with that amiable prince when in england came along with him and settled in this country of whom some of the most considerable families in scotland are descended introduction to forduns hist p  0 such as bruces maules somervilles colviles normanviles montgomeries baliols and many others  it is hoped therefore that it reflects no dishonor on this illustrious family to appear to have sprung from a noble family in france who certainly settled in this island within less than an hundred years after the battle of loncarty and were a great and flourishing family in normandy before it  and as he first of the family of errol we find upon record chartulary of scoon murray cupar st andrews etc was william de la haya who was settled in perthshire in the reigns of king david i and king malcolm iv so there is sufficient proof that william de la haya chartulary of newbottle kelso dunfermline etc ancestor of the family of tweeddale was settled in lothian much about the same era  and as it does not appear from any record that they were of the same family it is highly probable that the latter was a son or grandson of one of those great captains of the name of hay who came over to england with william the conqueror and attending king david into scotland settled in the south parts as the ancestor of the family of errol settled in the north of that kingdom  we now proceed to our

still retain as will appear from several charters under the great seal hereafter narrated and from hence the surname of the family  the lands of wemyssshire the parishes of kennoway markinch
