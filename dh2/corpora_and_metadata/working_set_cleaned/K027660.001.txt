journey etc etc  they order said i this matter better in france    you have been in france said my gentleman turning quick upon me with the most civil triumph in the world  strange quoth i debating the matter with myself that one and twenty miles sailing for it is absolutely no further from dover to calais should give a man these rights  i will look into them so giving up the argument  i went straight to my lodgings put up half a dozen shirts and a black pair of silk breeches   the coat i have on said i looking at the sleeve will do  took a place in the dover stage and the packet sailing at nine the next morning  by three i had got sat down to my dinner upon a fricasseed chicken so incontestably in france that had i died that night of an indigestion the whole world could not have suspended the effects of the all the effects of strangers swiss and scotch excepted dying in france are seized by virtue of this law though the heir be upon the spot  the profit of these contingencies being farmed there is no redress droits daubaine  my shirts and black pair of silk breeches  portmanteau and all must have gone to the king of france  even the little picture which i have so long worn and so often have told thee eliza i would carry with me into my grave would have been torn from my neck  ungenerous  to seize upon the wreck of an unwary passenger whom your subjects had beckoned to their coast  by heaven sire it is not well done and much does it grieve me it is the monarch of a people so civilized and courteous and so renowned for sentiment and fine feelings that i have to reason with   but i have scarce set foot in your dominions   calais when i had finished my dinner and drank the king of frances health to satisfy my mind that i bore him no spleen but on the contrary high honor for the humanity of his temper  i rose up an inch taller for the accommodation   no  said i  the bourbon is by no means a cruel race they may be misled like other people but there is a mildness in their blood as i acknowledged this i felt a suffusion of a finer kind upon my cheek  more warm and friendly to man than what burgundy at least of two livres a bottle which was such as i had been drinking could have produced   just god said i kicking my portmanteau aside what is there in this worlds goods which should sharpen our spirits and make so many kindhearted brethren of us fall out so cruelly as we do by the way  when man is at peace with man how much lighter than a feather is the heaviest of metals in his hand he pulls out his purse and holding it airily and uncompressd looks round him as if he sought for an object to share it with  in doing this i felt every vessel in my frame dilate  the arteries beat all chearily together and every power which sustained life performed it with so little friction that twould have confounded the most physical precieuse in france with all her materialism she could scarce have called me a machine   i am confident said i to myself i should have overset her creed  the accession of that idea carried nature at that time as high as she could go  i was at peace with the world before and this finished the treaty with myself    now was i a king of france cried i  what a moment for an orphan to have begged his fathers portmanteau of me  the monk calais i had scarce uttered the words when a poor monk of the order of st francis came into the room to beg something for his convent no man cares to have his virtues the sport of contingencies  or one man may be generous as another man is puissant  sed non quo ad hanc  or be it as it may  for there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humors they may depend upon the same causes for ought i know which influence the tides themselves  twould often be no discredit to us to suppose it was so i am sure at least for myself that in many a case i should be more highly satisfied to have it said by the world i had had an affair with the moon in which there was neither sin nor shame than have it pass altogether as my own act and deed wherein there was so much of both   but be this as it may the moment i cast my eyes upon him i was predetermined not to give him a single sous and accordingly i put my purse into my pocket  buttoned it up  set myself a little more upon my center and advanced up gravely to him there was something i fear forbidding in my look i have his figure this moment before my eyes and think there was that in it which deserved better  the monk as i judged from the break in his tonsure a few scattered white hairs upon his temples being all that remained of it might be about seventy  but from his eyes and that sort of fire which was in them which seemed more tempered by courtesy than years could be no more than sixty  truth might lie between  he was certainly sixtyfive and the general air of his countenance notwithstanding something seemed to have been planting wrinkles in it before their time agreed to the account  it was one of those heads which guido has often painted  mild pale  penetrating free from all commonplace ideas of fat contented ignorance looking downwards upon the earth  it looked forwards but looked as if it looked at something beyond this world how one of his order came by it heaven above who let it fall upon a monks shoulders best knows but it would have suited a bramin and had i met it upon the plains of indostan i had reverenced it  the rest of his outline may be given in a few strokes one might put it into the hands of any one to design for twas neither elegant or otherwise but as character and expression made it so it was a thin spare form something above the common size if it lost not the distinction by a bend forwards in the figure  but it was the attitude of entreaty and as it now stands presented to my imagination it gained more than it lost by it  when he had entered the room three paces he stood still and laying his left hand upon his breast a slender white staff with which he journeyd being in his right  when i had got close up to him he introduced himself with the little story of the wants of his convent and the poverty of his order  and did it with so simple a grace  and such an air of deprecation was there in the whole cast of his look and figure  i was bewitched not to have been struck with it    a better reason was i had predetermined not to give him a single sous  the monk calais  it is very true said i replying to a cast upwards with his eyes with which he had concluded his address  it is very true  and heaven be their resource who have no other but the charity of the world the stock of which i fear is no way sufficient for the many great claims which are hourly made upon it  as i pronounced the words great claims he gave a slight glance with his eye downwards upon the sleeve of his tunick  i felt the full force of the appeal  i acknowledge it said i  a coarse habit and that but once in three years with meagre diet  are no great matters and the true point of pity is as they can be earned in the world with so little industry that your order should wish to procure them by pressing upon a fund which is the property of the lame the blind the aged and the infirm  the captive who lies down counting over and over again the days of his afflictions languishes also for his share of it and had you been of the order of mercy instead of the order of st francis poor as i am continued i pointing at my portmanteau full cheerfully should it have been opened to you for the ransom of the unfortunate  the monk made me a bow  but of all others resumed i the unfortunate of our own country surely have the first rights and i have left thousands in distress upon our own shore  the monk gave a cordial wave with his head  as much as to say no doubt there is misery enough in every corner of the world as well as within our convent  but we distinguish said i laying my hand upon the sleeve of his tunick in return for his appeal  we distinguish my good father betwixt those who wish only to eat the bread of their own labor  and those who eat the bread of other peoples and have no other plan in life but to get through it in sloth and ignorance for the love of god  the poor franciscan made no reply a hectic of a moment passed across his cheek but could not tarry  nature seemed to have had done with her resentments in him he showed none  but letting his staff fall within his arm he pressed both his hands with resignation upon his breast and retired  the monk calais my heart smote me the moment he shut the door  psha said i with an air of carelessness three several times  but it would not do every ungracious syllable i had uttered crowded back into my imagination i reflected i had no right over the poor franciscan but to deny him and that the punishment of that was enough to the disappointed without the addition of unkind language  i considered his gray hairs  his courteous figure seemed to reenter and gently ask me what injury he had done me  and why i could use him thus  i would have given twenty livres for an advocate  i have behaved very ill said i within myself but i have only just set out upon my travels and shall learn better manners as i get along  the desobligeant calais when a man is discontented with himself it has one advantage however that it puts him into an excellent frame of mind for making a bargain now there being no traveling through france and italy without a chaise  and nature generally prompting us to the thing we are fittest for i walked out into the coach yard to buy or hire something of that kind to my purpose an old a chaise so called in france from its bolding but one person desobligeant in the furthest corner of the court hit my fancy at first sight so i instantly got into it and finding it in tolerable harmony with my feelings i ordered the waiter to call monsieur dessein the master of the hotel  but monsieur dessein being gone to vespers and not caring to face the franciscan whom i saw on the opposite side of the court in conference with a lady just arrived at the inn  i drew the taffeta curtain betwixt us and being determined to write my journey i took out my pen and ink and wrote the preface to it in the disobligeant  preface in the desobligeant it must have been observed by many a peripatetic philosopher that nature has set up by her own unquestionable authority certain boundaries and fences to circumscribe the discontent of man she has effected her purpose in the quietest and easiest manner by laying him under almost insuperable obligations to work out his ease and to sustain his sufferings at home it is there only that she has provided him with the most suitable objects to partake of his happiness and bear a part of that burden which in all countries and ages has ever been too heavy for one pair of shoulders it is true we are endued with an imperfect power of spreading our happiness sometimes beyond her limits but it is so ordered that from the want of languages connections and dependencies and from the difference in education customs and habits we lie under so many impediments in communicating our sensations out of our own sphere as often amount to a total impossibility  it will always follow from hence that the balance of sentimental commerce is always against the expatriated adventurer he must buy what he has little occasion for at their own price  his conversation will seldom be taken in exchange for theirs without a large discount  and this by the by eternally driving him into the hands of more equitable brokers for such conversation as he can find it requires no great spirit of divination to guess at his party   this brings me to my point and naturally leads me if the seesaw of this desobligeant will but let me get on into the efficient as well as the final causes of traveling   your idle people that leave their native country and go abroad for some reason or reasons which may be derived from one of these general causes  infirmity of body imbecility of mind or inevitable necessity the first two include all those who travel by land or by water laboring with pride curiosity vanity or spleen subdivided and combined in infinitum  the third class includes the whole army of peregrine martyrs more especially those travelers who set out upon their travels with the benefit of the clergy either as delinquents traveling under the direction of governors recommended by the magistrate  or young gentlemen transported by the cruelty of parents and guardians and traveling under the direction of governors recommended by oxford aberdeen and glasgow  there is a fourth class but their number is so small that they would not deserve a distinction was it not necessary in a work of this nature to observe the greatest precision and nicety to avoid a confusion of character and these men i speak of are such as cross the seas and sojourn in a land of strangers with a view of saving money for various reasons and upon various pretenses but as they might also save themselves and others a great deal of unnecessary trouble by saving their money at home  and as their reasons for traveling are the least complex of any other species of emigrants i shall distinguish these gentlemen by the name of simple travelers   thus the whole circle of travelers may be reduced to the following heads idle travelers inquisitive travelers lying travelers proud travelers vain travelers splenetic travelers   then follow the travelers of necessity the delinquent and felonious traveller the unfortunate and innocent traveller the simple traveller and last of all if you please the sentimental traveller meaning thereby myself who have traveled and of which i am now sitting down to give an account  as much out of necessity and the besoin de voyager as any one in the class  i am well aware at the same time as both my travels and observations will be altogether of a different cast from any of my forerunners that i might have insisted upon a whole nitch entirely to myself  but i should break in upon the confines of the vain traveller in wishing to draw attention toward me till i have some better grounds for it than the mere novelty of my vehicle  it is sufficient for my reader if he has been a traveller himself that with study and reflection hereupon he may be able to determine his own place and rank in the catalogue  it will be one step toward knowing himself as it is great odds but he retains some tincture and resemblance of what he imbibed or carried out to the present hour  the man who first transplanted the grape of burgundy to the cape of good hope observe he was a dutch man never dreamt of drinking the same wine at the cape that the same grape produced upon the french mountains  he was too phlegmatic for that  but undoubtedly he expected to drink some sort of vinous liquor but whether good bad or indifferent  he knew enough of this world to know that it did not depend upon his choice but that what is generally called chance was to decide his success however he hoped for the best and in these hopes by an intemperate confidence in the fortitude of his head and the depth of his discretion mynheer might possibly overset both in his new vineyard and by discovering his nakedness become a laughingstock to his people  even so it fares with the poor traveller sailing and posting through the politer kingdoms of the globe in pursuit of knowledge and improvements  knowledge and improvements are to be got by sailing and posting for that purpose but whether useful knowledge and real improvements is all a lottery  and even where the adventurer is successful the acquired stock must be used with caution and sobriety to turn to any profit  but as the chances run prodigiously the other way both as to the acquisition and application i am of opinion that a man would act as wisely if he could prevail upon himself to live contented without foreign knowledge or foreign improvements especially if he lives in a country that has no absolute want of either  and indeed much grief of heart has it often and many a time cost me when i have observed how many a foul step the inquisitive traveller has measured to see sights and look into discoveries all which as sancho panca said to don quixote they might have seen dryshod at home it is an age so full of light that there is scarce a country or corner of europe whose beams are not crossed and interchanged with others  knowledge in most of its branches and in most affairs is like music in an italian street whereof those may partake who pay nothing  but there is no nation under heaven  and god is my record before whose tribunal i must one day come and give an account of this work  that i do not speak it vauntingly  but there is no nation under heaven abounding with more variety of learning  where the sciences may be more fitly wooed or more surely won than here  where art is encouraged and will so soon rise high  where nature take her all together has so little to answer for  and to close all where there is more wit and variety of character to feed the mind with  where then my dear countrymen are you going    we are only looking at this chaise said they  your most obedient servant said i skipping out of it and pulling off my hat  we were wondering said one of them who i found was an inquisitive traveller  what could occasion its motion   twas the agitation said i coolly of writing a preface  i never heard said the other who was a simple traveller of a preface wrote in a desobligeant  it would have been better said i in a vis a vis   as an english man does not travel to see english men i retired to my room  calais i perceived that something darkened the passage more than myself as i stepped along it to my room it was effectually mons dessein the master of the hotel who had just returned from vespers and with his hat under his arm was most complaisantly following me to put me in mind of my wants i had wrote myself pretty well out of conceit with the desobligeant and mons dessein speaking of it with a shrug as if it would no way suit me it immediately struck my fancy that it belonged to some innocent traveller who on his return home had left it to mons desseins honor to make the most of four months had elapsed since it had finished its career of europe in the corner of mons desseins coachyard and having sallied out from thence but a vamptup business at the first though it had been twice taken to pieces on mount sennis it had not profited much by its adventures  but by none so little as the standing so many months unpitied in the corner of mons desseins coachyard much indeed was not to be said for it  but something might  and when a few words will rescue misery out of her distress i hate the man who can be a churl of them   now was i the master of this hotel said i laying the point of my forefinger on mons desseins breast i would inevitably make a point of getting rid of this unfortunate desobligeant  itstands swinging reproaches at you every time you pass by it   mon dieu said mons dessein  i have no interest  except the interest said i which men of a certain turn of mind take mons dessein in their own sensations  i am persuaded to a man who feels for others as well as for himself every rainy night disguise it as you will must cast a damp upon your spirits  you suffer mons dessein as much as the machine   i have always observed when there is as much sour as sweet in a compliment that an englishman is eternally at a loss within himself whether to take it or let it alone a frenchman never is mons dessein made me a bow  cest bien vrai said he  but in this case i should only exchange one disquietude for another and with loss figure to yourself my dear sir that in giving you a chaise which would fall to pieces before you had got half way to paris  figure to yourself how much i should suffer in giving an ill impression of myself to a man of honor and lying at the mercy as i must do dun homme desprit  the dose was made up exactly after my own prescription so i could not help taking it  and returning mons dessein his bow without more casuistry we walked together toward his remise to take a view of his magazine of chaises  in the street calais it must needs be a hostile kind of a world when the buyer if it be but of a sorry postchaise cannot go forth with the seller thereof into the street to terminate the difference betwixt them but he instantly falls into the same frame of mind and views his conventionist with the same sort of eye as if he was going along with him to hydepark corner to fight a duel for my own part being but a poor swordsman and no way a match for monsieur dessein i felt the rotation of all the movements within me to which the situation is incident  i looked at monsieur dessein through and through  eyed him as he walked along in profile  then en face  thought he looked like a jew  then a turk  disliked his wig  cursed him by my gods  wished him at the devil    and is all this to be lighted up in the heart for a beggarly account of three or four louisdors which is the most i can be overreachd in  base passion said i turning myself about as a man naturally does upon a sudden reverse of sentiment  base ungentle passion thy hand is against every man and every mans hand against thee  heaven forbid said she raising her hand up to her forehead for i had turned full in front upon the lady whom i had seen in conference with the monk  she had followed us unperceived  heaven forbid indeed said i offering her my own  she had a black pair of silk gloves open only at the thumb and two forefingers so accepted it without reserve  and i led her up to the door of the remise  monsieur dessein had diabled the key above fifty times before he found out he had come with a wrong one in his hand we were as impatient as himself to have it opened and so attentive to the obstacle that i continued holding her hand almost without knowing it so that monsieur dessein left us together with her hand in mine and with our faces turned toward the door of the remise and said he would be back in five minutes  now a colloquy of five minutes in such a situation is worth one of as many ages with your faces turned toward the street in the latter case it is drawn from the objects and occurrences without  when your eyes are fixed upon a dead blank  you draw purely from yourselves a silence of a single moment upon monsieur desseins leaving us had been fatal to the situation  she had infallibly turned about  so i begun the conversation instantly    but what were the temptations as i write not to apologize for the weaknesses of my heart in this tour  but to give an account of them  shall be described with the same simplicity with which i felt them  the remise door calais when i told the reader that i did not care to get out of the desobligeant because i saw the monk in close conference with a lady just arrived at the inn  i told him the truth but i did not tell him the whole truth for i was full as much restrained by the appearance and figure of the lady he was talking to suspicion crossed my brain and said he was telling her what had passed something jarred upon it within me  i wished him at his convent  when the heart flies out before the understanding it saves the judgment a world of pains  i was certain she was of a better order of beings  however i thought no more of her but went on and wrote my preface  the impression returned upon my encounter with her in the street a guarded frankness with which she gave me her hand showed i thought her good education and her good sense and as i led her on i felt a pleasurable ductility about her which spread a calmness over all my spirits    good god how a man might lead such a creature as this round the world with him   i had not yet seen her face  twas not material for the drawing was instantly set about and long before we had got to the door of the remise fancy had finished the whole head and pleased herself as much with its fitting her goddess as if she had dived into the tiber for it  but thou art a seduced and a seducing slut and albeit thou cheatest us seven times a day with thy pictures and images yet with so many charms do thou do it and thou deckest out thy pictures in the shapes of so many angels of light it is a shame to break with thee  when we had got to the door of the remise she withdrew her hand from across her forehead and let me see the original  it was a face of about six and twenty  of a clear transparent brown simply set off without rouge or powder  it was not critically handsome but there was that in it which in the frame of mind i was in which attached me much more to it  it was interesting i fancied it wore the characters of a widowed look and in that state of its declension which had passed the two first paroxysms of sorrow and was quietly beginning to reconcile itself to its loss  but a thousand other distresses might have traced the same lines i wished to know what they had been  and was ready to enquire had the same bon ton of conversation permitted as in the days of esdras   what aileth thee and why art thou disquieted and why is thy understanding troubled  in a word i felt benevolence for her and resolved some way or other to throw in my mite of courtesy  if not of service  such were my temptations  and in this disposition to give way to them was i left alone with the lady with her hand in mine and with our faces both turned closer to the door of the remise than what was absolutely necessary  the remise door calais this certainly fair lady said i raising her hand up a little lightly as i began must be one of fortunes whimsical doings to take two utter strangers by their hands  of different sexes and perhaps from different corners of the globe and in one moment place them together in such a cordial situation as friendship herself could scarce have achieved for them had she projected it for a month    and your reflection upon it shows how much monsieur she has embarassed you by the adventure   when the situation is what we would wish nothing is so illtimed as to hint at the circumstances which make it so you thank fortune continued she  you had reason  the heart knew it and was satisfied and who but an english philosopher would have sent notices of it to the brain to reverse the judgment  in saying this she disengaged her hand with a look which i thought a sufficient commentary upon the text  it is a miserable picture which i am going to give of the weakness of my heart by owning that it suffered a pain which worthier occasions could not have inflicted  i was mortified with the loss of her hand and the manner in which i had lost it carried neither oil nor wine to the wound i never felt the pain of a sheepish inferiority so miserably in my life  the triumphs of a true feminine heart are short upon these discomfitures in a very few seconds she laid her hand upon the cuff of my coat in order to finish her reply so some way or other god knows how i regained my situation   she had nothing to add  i forthwith began to model a different conversation for the lady thinking from the spirit as well as moral of this that i had been mistaken in her character but upon turning her face toward me the spirit which had animated the reply was fled  the muscles relaxed and i beheld the same unprotected look of distress which first won me to her interest  melancholy to see such sprightliness the prey of sorrow  i pitied her from my soul and though it may seem ridiculous enough to a torpid heart  i could have taken her into my arms and cherished her though it was in the open street without blushing  the pulsations of the arteries along my fingers pressing across hers told her what was passing within me she looked down  a silence of some moments followed  i fear in this interval i must have made some slight efforts toward a closer compression of her hand from a subtle sensation i felt in the palm of my own  not as if she was going to withdraw hers  but as if she thought about it  and i had infallibly lost it a second time had not instinct more than reason directed me to the last resource in these dangers  to hold it loosely and in a manner as if i was every moment going to release it of myself so she let it continue till monsieur dessein returned with the key and in the mean time i set myself to consider how i should undo the ill impressions which the poor monks story in case he had told it her must have planted in her breast against me  the snuff box calais the good old monk was within six paces of us as the idea of him crossed my mind and was advancing toward us a little out of the line as if uncertain whether he should break in upon us or no  he stopped however as soon as he came up to us with a world of frankness and having a horn snuff box in his hand he presented it open to me  you shall taste mine  said i pulling out my box which was a small tortoise one and putting it into his hand  it is most excellent said the monk then do me the favor i replied to accept of the box and all and when you take a pinch out of it sometimes recollect it was the peace offering of a man who once used you unkindly but not from his heart  the poor monk blushed as red as scarlet mon dieu said he pressing his hands together  you never used me unkindly  i should think said the lady he is not likely i blushed in my turn but from what movements i leave to the few who feel to analyze  excuse me madame replied i  i treated him most unkindly and from no provocations  it is impossible said the lady  my god cried the monk with a warmth of asseveration which seemed not to belong to him  the fault was in me and in the indiscretion of my zeal  the lady opposed it and i joined with her in maintaining it was impossible that a spirit so regulated as his could give offense to any  i knew not that contention could be rendered so sweet and pleasurable a thing to the nerves as i then felt it  we remained silent without any sensation of that foolish pain which takes place when in such a circle you look for ten minutes in one anothers faces without saying a word whilst this lasted the monk rubbed his horn box upon the sleeve of his tunick and as soon as it had acquired a little air of brightness by the friction  he made a low bow and said twas too late to say whether it was the weakness or goodness of our tempers which had involved us in this contest  but be it as it would  he begged we might exchange boxes  in saying this he presented his to me with one hand as he took mine from me in the other and having kissed it  with a stream of good nature in his eyes he put it into his bosom  and took his leave  i guard this box as i would the instrumental parts of my religion to help my mind on to something better in truth i seldom go abroad without it and often and many a time have i called up by it the courteous spirit of its owner to regulate my own in the justlings of the world they had found full employment for his as i learnt from his story till about the fortyfifth year of his age when upon some military services ill requited and meeting at the same time with a disappointment in the tenderest of passions he abandoned the sword and the sex together and took sanctuary not so much in his convent as in himself  i feel a damp upon my spirits as i am going to add that in my last return through calais upon inquiring after father lorenzo i heard he had been dead near three months and was buried not in his convent but according to his desire in a little cimetiery belonging to it about two leagues off i had a strong desire to see where they had laid him  when upon pulling out his little horn box as i sat by his grave and plucking up a nettle or two at the head of it which had no business to grow there they all struck together so forcibly upon my affections that i burst into a flood of tears  but i am as weak as a woman and i beg the world not to smile but pity me  the remise door calais i had never quitted the ladys hand all this time and had held it so long that it would have been indecent to have let it go without first pressing it to my lips the blood and spirits which had suffered a revulsion from her crowded back to her as i did it  now the two travelers who had spoke to me in the coachyard happening at that crisis to be passing by and observing our communications naturally took it into their heads that we must be man and wife at least so stopping as soon as they came up to the door of the remise the one of them who was the inquisitive traveller asked us if we set out for paris the next morning  i could only answer for myself i said and the lady added she was for amiens  we dined there yesterday said the simple traveller  you go directly through the town added the other in your road to paris i was going to return a thousand thanks for the intelligence that amiens was in the road to paris but upon pulling out my poor monks little horn box to take a pinch of snuff  i made them a quiet bow and wishing them a good passage to dover  they left us alone    now where would be the harm said i to myself if i was to beg of this distressed lady to accept of half of my chaise  and what mighty mischief could ensue  every dirty passion and bad propensity in my nature took the alarm as i stated the proposition  it will oblige you to have a third horse said avarice which will put twenty livres out of your pocket  you know not who she is said caution  or what scrapes the affair may draw you into whispered cowardice   depend upon it yorick said discretion twill be said you went off with a mistress and came by assignation to calais for that purpose    you can never after cried hypocrisy aloud show your face in the world  or rise quoth meanness in the church  or be any thing in it said pride but a lousy prebendary   but it is a civil thing said i  and as i generally act from the first impulse and therefore seldom listen to these cabals which serve no purpose that i know of but to encompass the heart with adamant  i turned instantly about to the lady    but she had glided off unperceived as the cause was pleading and had made ten or a dozen paces down the street by the time i had made the determination so i set off after her with a long stride to make her the proposal with the best address i was master of but observing she walked with her cheek half resting upon the palm of her hand  with the slow shortmeasurd step of thoughtfulness and with her eyes as she went step by step fixed upon the ground it struck me she was trying the same cause herself  god help her said i she has some motherinlaw or tartufish aunt or nonsensical old woman to consult upon the occasion as well as myself so not caring to interrupt the process and deeming it more gallant to take her at discretion than by surprise i faced about and took a short turn or two before the door of the remise whilst she walked musing on one side  in the street calais having on first sight of the lady settled the affair in my fancy that she was of the better order of beings  and then laid it down as a second axiom as indisputable as the first that she was a widow and wore a character of distress  i went no further i got ground enough for the situation which pleased me  and had she remained close beside my elbow till midnight i should have held true to my system and considered her only under that general idea  she had scarce got twenty paces distant from me ere something within me called out for a more particular inquiry  it brought on the idea of a further separation  i might possibly never see her more  the heart is for saving what it can and i wanted the traces through which my wishes might find their way to her in case i should never rejoin her myself in a word i wished to know her name  her familys  her condition and as i knew the place to which she was going i wanted to know from whence she came but there was no coming at all this intelligence a hundred little delicacies stood in the way i formed a score different plans  there was no such thing as a mans asking her directly  the thing was impossible  a little french debonaire captain who came dancing down the street showed me it was the easiest thing in the world for popping in betwixt us just as the lady was returning back to the door of the remise he introduced himself to my acquaintance and before he had well got announced begged i would do him the honor to present him to the lady  i had not been presented myself  so turning about to her he did it just as well by asking her if she had come from paris  no she was going that rout she said  vous netez pas de londre  she was not she replied   then madame must have come through flanders  apparamment vous etez flammande said the french captain  the lady answered she was  peutetre de lisle added he  she said she was not of lisle  nor arras  nor cambray  nor ghent  nor brussels she answered she was of brussels  he had had the honor he said to be at the bombardment of it last war  that it was finely situated pour cela  and full of noblesse when the imperialists were driven out by the french the lady made a slight curtsy  so giving her an account of the affair and of the share he had had in it  he begged the honor to know her name  so made his bow   et madame a son mari  said he looking back when he had made two steps  and without staying for an answer  danced down the street  had i served seven years apprenticeship to good breeding i could not have done as much  the remise calais as the little french captain left us mons dessein came up with the key of the remise in his hand and forthwith let us into his magazine of chaises  the first object which caught my eye as mons dessein opened the door of the remise was another old tattered desobligeant and notwithstanding it was the exact picture of that which had hit my fancy so much in the coachyard but an hour before  the very sight of it stirred up a disagreeable sensation within me now and i thought twas a churlish beast into whose heart the idea could first enter to construct such a machine nor had i much more charity for the man who could think of using it  i observed the lady was as little taken with it as myself so mons dessein led us on to a couple of chaises which stood abreast telling us as he recommended them that they had been purchased by my lord a and b to go the grand tour but had gone no further than paris so were in all respects as good as new  they were too good  so i passed on to a third which stood behind and forthwith began to chaffer for the price  but twill scarce hold two said i opening the door and getting in  have the goodness madam said mons dessein offering his arm to step in  the lady hesitated half a second and stepped in and the waiter that moment beckoning to speak to mons dessein he shut the door of the chaise upon us and left us  the remise calais cest bien comique it is very droll said the lady smiling from the reflection that this was the second time we had been left together by a parcel of nonsensical contingencies  cest bien comique said she    there wants nothing said i to make it so but the comic use which the gallantry of a frenchman would put it to  to make love the first moment and an offer of his person the second  it is their fort replied the lady  it is supposed so at least  and how it has come to pass continued i i know not but they have certainly got the credit of understanding more of love and making it better than any other nation upon earth but for my own part i think them errant bunglers and in truth the worst set of marksmen that ever tried cupids patience   to think of making love by sentiments  i should as soon think of making a genteel suit of clothes out of remnants  and to do it  pop  at first sight by declaration  is submitting the offer and themselves with it to be sifted with all their pours and contres by an unheated mind  the lady attended as if she expected i should go on  consider then madam continued i laying my hand upon hers   that grave people hate love for the names sake   that selfish people hate it for their own   hypocrites for heavens   and that all of us both old and young being ten times worse frightened than hurt by the very report  what a want of knowledge in this branch of commerce a man betrays whoever lets the word come out of his lips till an hour or two at least after the time that his silence upon it becomes tormenting a course of small quiet attentions not so pointed as to alarm  nor so vague as to be misunderstood  with now and then a look of kindness and little or nothing said upon it  leaves nature for your mistress and she fashions it to her mind   then i solemnly declare said the lady blushing  you have been making love to me all this while  the remise calais monsieur dessein came back to let us out of the chaise and acquaint the lady the count de l her brother was just arrived at the hotel though i had infinite good will for the lady i cannot say that i rejoiced in my heart at the event  and could not help telling her so  for it is fatal to a proposal madam said i that i was going to make you    you need not tell me what the proposal was said she laying her hand upon both mine as she interrupted me  a man my good sir has seldom an offer of kindness to maketo a woman but she has a presentiment of it some moments before   nature arms her with it said i for immediate preservation  but i think said she looking in my face i had no evil to apprehend  and to deal frankly with you had determined to accept it  if i had  she stopped a moment  i believe your good will would have drawn a story from me which would have made pity the only dangerous thing in the journey  in saying this she suffered me to kiss her hand twice and with a look of sensibility mixed with a concern she got out of the chaise  and bid adieu  in the street calais i never finished a twelveguinea bargain so expeditiously in my life my time seemed heavy upon the loss of the lady and knowing every moment of it would be as two till i put myself into motion  i ordered post horses directly and walked toward the hotel  lord said i hearing the town clock strike four and recollecting that i had been little more than a single hour in calais    what a large volume of adventures may be grasped within this little span of life by him who interests his heart in every thing and who having eyes to see what time and chance are perpetually holding out to him as he journeyeth on his way misses nothing he can fairly lay his hands on    if this will not turn out something  another will  no matter  it is an assay upon human nature  i get my labor for my pains  it is enough  the pleasure of the experiment has kept my senses and the best part of my blood awake and laid the gross to sleep  i pity the man who can travel from dan to beersheba and cry it is all barren  and so it is and so is all the world to him who will not cultivate the fruits it offers i declare said i clapping my hands chearily together that was i in a desert i would find out wherewith in it to call forth my affections  if i could not do better i would fasten them upon some sweet myrtle or seek some melancholy cypress to connect myself to  i would court their shade and greet them kindly for their protection  i would cut my name upon them and swear they were the loveliest trees throughout the desert if their leaves withered i would teach myself to mourn and when they rejoiced i would rejoice along with them  the learned smelfungus traveled from boulogne to paris  from paris to rome  and so on  but he set out with the spleen and jaundice and every object he pafsd by was discolored or distorted  he wrote an account of them buttwas nothing but the account of his miserable feelings  i met smelfungus in the grand portico of the pantheon  he was just coming out of it  it is nothing but a huge cockpit vide ss travels  said he  i wish you had said nothing worse of the venus of medicis replied i  for in passing through florence i had heard he had fallen foul upon the goddess and used her worse than a common strumpet without the least provocation in nature  i poppd upon smelfungus again at turin in his return home and a sad tale of sorrowful adventures had he to tell wherein he spoke of moving accidents by flood and field and of the cannibals which each other eat the anthropophagi  he had been flayed alive and bedevild and used worse than st bartholomew at every stage he had come at    i will tell it cried smelfungus to the world you had better tell it said i to your physician  mundungus with an immense fortune made the whole tour going on from rome to naples  from naples to venice  from venice to vienna  to dresden to berlin without one generous connection or pleasurable anecdote to tell of but he had traveled straight on looking neither to his right hand or his left lest love or pity should seduce him out of his road  peace be to them if it is to be found but heaven itself was it possible to get there with such tempers would want objects to give it  every gentle spirit would come flying upon the wings of love to hail their arrival  nothing would the souls of smelfungus and mundungus hear of but fresh anthems of joy fresh raptures of love and fresh congratulations of their common felicity  i heartily pity them they have brought up no faculties for this work and was the happiest mansion in heaven to be allotted to smelfungus and mundungus they would be so far from being happy that the souls of smelfungus and mundungus would do penance there to all eternity  montriul i had once lost my portmanteau from behind my chaise and twice got out in the rain and one of the times up to the knees in dirt to help the postilion to tie it on without being able to find out what was wanting  nor was it till i got to montriul upon the landlords asking me if i wanted not a servant that it occurred to me that that was the very thing  a servant that i do most sadly quoth i  because monsieur said the landlord there is a clever young fellow who would be very proud of the honor to serve an englishman  but why an english one more than any other  they are so generous said the landlord  i will be shot if this is not a livre out of my pocket quoth i to myself this very night  but they have wherewithal to be so monsieur added he  set down one livre more for that quoth i  it was but last night said the landlord quun my lord anglois presentoit un ecu a la fille de chamber  tant pis pour madlle janatone said i  now janatone being the landlords daughter and the landlord supposing i was young in french took the liberty to inform me i should not have said tant pis  but tant mieux tant mieux toujours monsieur said he when there is any thing to be got  tant pis when there is nothing it comes to the same thing said i pardonnez moi said the landlord  i cannot take a fitter opportunity to observe once for all that tant pis and tant mieux being two of the great hinges in french conversation a stranger would do well to set himself right in the use of them before he gets to paris  a prompt french marquis at our ambassadors table demanded of mr h if he was h the poet no said h mildly  tant pis replied the marquis  it is h the historian said another  tant mieux said the marquis and mr h who is a man of an excellent heart returned thanks for both  when the landlord had set me right in this matter he called in la fleur which was the name of the young man he had spoke of  saying only first that as for his talents he would presume to say nothing  monsieur was the best judge what would suit him but for the fidelity of la fleur he would stand responsible in all he was worth  the landlord delivered this in a manner which instantly set my mind to the business i was upon  and la fleur who stood waiting without in that breathless expectation which every son of nature of us have felt in our turns came in  montriul i am apt to be taken with all kinds of people at first sight but never more so than when a poor devil comes to offer his service to so poor a devil as myself and as i know this weakness i always suffer my judgment to draw back something on that very account  and this more or less according to the mood i am in and the case  and i may add the gender too of the person i am to govern  when la fleur entered the room after every discount i could make for my soul the genuine look and air of the fellow determined the matter at once in his favor so i hired him first  and then began to inquire what he could do but i shall find out his talents quoth i as i want them  besides a frenchman can do every thing  now poor la fleur could do nothing in the world but beat a drum and play a march or two upon the fife i was determined to make his talents do and cannot say my weakness was ever so insulted by my wisdom as in the attempt  la fleur had set out early in life as gallantly as most frenchmen do with serving for a few years at the end of which having satisfied the sentiment and found moreover that the honor of beating a drum was likely to be its own reward as it opened no further track of glory to him  he retired a ses terres and lived comme il plaisoit a dieu  that is to say upon nothing   and so quoth wisdom you have hired a drummer to attend you in this tour of yours through france and italy psha said i and do not one half of our gentry go with a humdrum compagnon du voyage the same round and have the piper and the devil and all to pay besides when man can extricate himself with an equivoque in such an unequal match  he is not ill of  but you can do something else la fleur said i  o quoui  he could make spatterdashes and play a little upon the fiddle  bravo said wisdom  why i play a bass myself said i  we shall do very well  you can shave and dress a wig a little la fleur  he had all the dispositions in the world  it is enough for heaven said i interrupting him  and ought to be enough for me  so supper coming in and having a frisky english spaniel on one side of my chair and a french valet with as much hilarity in his countenance as ever nature painted in one on the other  i was satisfied to my hearts content with my empire and if monarchs knew what they would be at they might be as satisfied as i was  montriul as la fleur went the whole tour of france and italy with me and will be often upon the stage i must interest the reader a little further in his behalf by saying that i had never less reason to repent of the impulses which generally do determine me than in regard to this fellow  he was a faithful affectionate simple soul as ever trudged after the heels of a philosopher and notwithstanding his talents of drumbeating and spatterdashmaking which though very good in themselves happened to be of no great service to me yet was i hourly recompensed by the festivity of his temper  it supplied all defects  i had a constant resource in his looks in all difficulties and distresses of my own  i was going to have added of his too but la fleur was out of the reach of every thing for whether twas hunger or thirst or cold or nakedness or watchings or whatever stripes of ill luck la fleur met with in our journeyings there was no index in his physiognomy to point them out by  he was eternally the same so that if i am a piece of a philosopher which satan now and then puts it into my head i am  it always mortifies the pride of the conceit by reflecting how much i owe to the complexional philosophy of this poor fellow for shaming me into one of a better kind with all this la fleur had a small cast of the coxcomb  but he seemed at first sight to be more a coxcomb of nature than of art and before i had been three days in paris with him  he seemed to be no coxcomb at all  montriul the next morning la fleur entering upon his employment i delivered to him the key of my portmanteau with an inventory of my half a dozen shirts and silk pair of breeches and bid him fasten all upon the chaise  get the horses put to  and desire the landlord to come in with his bill  cest un garcon de bonne fortune said the landlord pointing through the window to half a dozen wenches who had got round about la fleur and were most kindly taking their leave of him as the postilion was leading out the horses la fleur kissed all their hands round and round again and thrice he wiped his eyes and thrice he promised he would bring them all pardons from rome  the young fellow said the landlord is beloved by all the town and there is scarce a corner in montriul where the want of him will not be felt he has but one misfortune in the world continued he he is always in love  i am heartily glad of it said i  twill save me the trouble every night of putting my breeches under my head in saying this i was making not so much la fleurs eloge as my own having been in love with one princess or another almost all my life and i hope i shall go on so till i die being firmly persuaded that if ever i do a mean action it must be in some interval betwixt one passion and another whilst this interregnum lasts i always perceive my heart locked up  i can scarce find in it to give misery a sixpence and therefore i always get out of it as fast as i can and the moment i am rekindled i am all generosity and good will again and would do any thing in the world either for or with any one if they will but satisfy me there is no sin in it   but in saying this  surely i am commending the passion  not myself  a fragment  the town of abdera notwithstanding democritus lived there trying all the powers of irony and laughter to reclaim it was the vilest and most profligate town in all thrace what for poisons conspiracies and assassinations  libels pasquinades and tumults there was no going there by day  twas worse by night  now when things were at the worst it came to pass that the andromeda of euripides being represented at abdera the whole orchestra was delighted with it but of all the passages which delighted them nothing operated more upon their imaginations than the tender strokes of nature which the poet had wrought up in that pathetic speech of perseus o cupid prince of god and men etc every man almost spoke pure iambics the next day and talked of nothing but perseus his pathetic address  o cupid prince of god and men  in every street of abdera in every house  o cupid cupid  in every mouth like the natural notes of some sweet melody which drops from it whether it will or no  nothing but cupid cupid prince of god and men  the fire caught  and the whole city like the heart of one man opened itself to love  no pharmacopolist could sell one grain of helebore  not a single armourer had a heart to forge one instrument of death  friendship and virtue met together and kissed each other in the street  the golden age returned and hung over the town of abdera  every abderite took his oaten pipe and every abderitish woman left her purple web and chastely sat her down and listened to the song   twas only in the power says the fragment of the god whose empire extends from heaven to earth and even to the depths of the sea to have done this  montriul when all is ready and every article is disputed and paid for in the inn unless you are a little sourd by the adventure there is always a matter to compound at the door before you can get into your chaise and that is with the sons and daughters of poverty who surround you let no man say let them go to the devil  it is a cruel journey to send a few miserables and they have had sufferings enough without it i always think it better to take a few sous out in my hand and i would counsel every gentle traveller to do so likewise he need not be so exact in setting down his motives for giving them  they will be registered elsewhere  for my own part there is no man gives so little as i do for few that i know have so little to give but as this was the first public act of my charity in france i took the more notice of it  a wellaway said i i have but eight sous in the world showing them in my hand and there are eight poor men and eight poor women for em  a poor tattered soul without a shirt on instantly withdrew his claim by retiring two steps out of the circle and making a disqualifying bow on his part had the whole parterre cried out place aux dames with one voice it would not have conveyed the sentiment of a deference for the sex with half the effect  just heaven for what wise reasons have thou ordered it that beggary and urbanity which are at such variance in other countries should find a way to be at unity in this   i insisted upon presenting him with a single sous merely for his politesse  a poor little dwarfish brisk fellow who stood over against me in the circle putting something first under his arm which had once been a hat took his snuff box out of his pocket and generously offered a pinch on both sides of him it was a gift of consequence and modestly declined  the poor little fellow pressed it upon them with a nod of welcomeness  prenez en  prenez said he looking another way so they each took a pinch  pity thy box should ever want one said i to myself so i put a couple of sous into it  taking a small pinch out of his box to enhance their value as i did it  he felt the weight of the second obligation more than that of the first  twas doing him an honor  the other was only doing him a charity  and he made me a bow down to the ground for it   here said i to an old soldier with one hand who had been campaignd and worn out to death in the service  here is a couple of sous for thee  vive le roi said the old soldier  i had then but three sous left so i gave one simply pour lamour de dieu which was the footing on which it was begged  the poor woman had a dislocated hip so it could not be well upon any other motive  mon cher et tres charitable monsieur  there is no opposing this said i  my lord anglois  the very sound was worth the money  so i gave my last sous for it but in the eagerness of giving i had overlooked a pauvre honteux who had no one to ask a sous for him and who i believed would have perished ere he could have asked one for himself he stood by the chaise a little without the circle and wiped a tear from a face which i thought had seen better days  good god said i  and i have not one single sous left to give him  but you have a thousand cried all the powers of nature stirring within me  so i gave him  no matter what  i am ashamed to say how much now  and was ashamed to think how little then so if the reader can form any conjecture of my disposition as these two fixed points are given him he may judge within a livre or two what was the precise sum  i could afford nothing for the rest but dieu vous benisse  et le bon dieu vous benisse encore  said the old soldier the dwarf etc the pauvre honteux could say nothing  he pulled out a little handkerchief and wiped his face as he turned away  and i thought he thanked me more than them all  the bidet having settled all these little matters i got into my postchaise with more ease than ever i got into a postchaise in my life and la fleur having got one large jackboot on the far side of a little bidet post horse  and another on this for i count nothing of his legs  he canterd away before me as happy and as perpendicular as a prince    but what is happiness what is grandeur in this painted scene of life a dead ass before we had got a league put a sudden stop to la fleurs career  his bidet would not pass by it  a contention arose betwixt them and the poor fellow was kicked out of his jackboots the very first kick  la fleur bore his fall like a french christian saying neither more or less upon it than diable so presently got up and came to the charge again astride his bidet beating him up to it as he would have beat his drum  the bidet flew from one side of the road to the other then back again  then this way  then that way and in short every way but by the dead ass  la fleur insisted upon the thing  and the bidet threw him  what is the matter la fleur said i with this bidet of thine  monsieur said he cest un cheval le plus opiniatre du monde  nay if he is a conceited beast he must go his own way replied i  so la fleur got off him and giving him a good sound lash the bidet took me at my word and away he scamperd back to montriul  peste said la fleur  it is not mal a propos to take notice here that though la fleur availed himself but of two different terms of exclamation in this encounter  namely diable and peste that there are nevertheless three in the french language like the positive comparative and superlative one or the other of which serve for every unexpected throw of the dice in life  le diable which is the first and positive degree is generally used upon ordinary emotions of the mind where small things only fall out contrary to your expectations  such as  the throwing once doublets  la fleurs being kicked off his horse and so forth  cuckoldom for the same reason is always  le diable  but in cases where the cast has something provoking in it as in that of the bidets running away after and leaving la fleur aground in jackboots  it is the second degree  it is then peste  and for the third    but here my heart is wrung with pity and fellowfeeling when i reflect what miseries must have been their lot and how bitterly so refined a people must have smarted to have forced them upon the use of it   grant me o ye powers which touch the tongue with eloquence in distress  whatever is my cast grant me but decent words to exclaim in and i will give my nature way   but as these were not to be had in france i resolved to take every evil just as it befell me without any exclamation at all  la fleur who had made no such covenant with himself followed the bidet with his eyes till it was got out of sight  and then you may imagine if you please with what word he closed the whole affair  as there was no hunting down a frightened horse in jackboots there remained no alternative but taking la fleur either behind the chaise or into it   i preferred the latter and in half an hour we got to the post house at nampont  nampont the dead ass  and this said he putting the remains of a crust into his wallet  and this should have been thy portion said he had thou been alive to have shared it with me i thought by the accent it had been an apostrophe to his child but twas to his ass and to the very ass we had seen dead in the road which had occasioned la fleurs misadventure the man seemed to lament it much and it instantly brought into my mind sanchos lamentation for his but he did it with more true touches of nature  the mourner was sitting upon a stone bench at the door with the asss panel and its bridle on one side which he took up from time to time  then laid them down  looked at them and shook his head he then took his crust of bread out of his wallet again as if to eat it held it some time in his hand  then laid it upon the bit of his asss bridle  looked wistfully at the little arrangement he had made  and then gave a sigh  the simplicity of his grief drew numbers about him and la fleur amongst the rest whilst the horses were getting ready as i continued sitting in the postchaise i could see and hear over their heads   he said he had come last from spain where he had been from the furthest borders of franconia and had got so far on his return home when his ass died every one seemed desirous to know what business could have taken so old and poor a man so far a journey from his own home  it had pleased heaven he said to bless him with three sons the finest lads in all germany but having in one week lost two of the eldest of them by the smallpox and the youngest falling ill of the same distemper he was afraid of being bereft of them all and made a vow if heaven would not take him from him also he would go in gratitude to st iago in spain  when the mourner got thus far on his story he stopped to pay nature her tribute  and wept bitterly  he said heaven had accepted the conditions and that he had set out from his cottage with this poor creature who had been a patient partner of his journey  that it had eat the same bread with him all the way and was unto him as a friend  every body who stood about heard the poor fellow with concern   la fleur offered him money  the mourner said he did not want it  it was not the value of the ass  but the loss of him  the ass he said he was assured loved him  and upon this told them a long story of a mischance upon their passage over the pyrenean mountains which had separated them from each other three days during which time the ass had sought him as much as he had sought the ass and that they had neither scarce eat or drank till they met  thou have one comfort friend said i at least in the loss of thy poor beast i am sure thou have been a merciful master to him  alas said the mourner i thought so when he was alive  but now that he is dead i think otherwise  i fear the weight of myself and my afflictions together have been too much for him  they have shortened the poor creatures days and i fear i have them to answer for  shame on the world said i to myself  did we love each other as this poor soul but loved his ass  twould be something   nampont the postillion the concern which the poor fellows story threw me into required some attention the postillion paid not the least to it but set off upon the pave in a full gallop  the thirstiest soul in the most sandy desert of arabia could not have wished more for a cup of cold water than mine did for grave and quiet movements and i should have had an high opinion of the postillion had he but stolen off with me in something like a pensive pace  on the contrary as the mourner finished his lamentation the fellow gave an unfeeling lash to each of his beasts and set off clattering like a thousand devils  i called to him as loud as i could for heavens sake to go slower  and the louder i called the more unmercifully he galloped  the deuce take him and his galloping too  said i  he will go on tearing my nerves to pieces till he has worked me into a foolish passion and then he will go slow that i may enjoy the sweets of it  the postillion managed the point to a miracle by the time he had got to the foot of a steep hill about half a league from nampont  he had put me out of temper with him  and then with myself for being so  my case then required a different treatment and a good rattling gallop would have been of real service to me    then prithee get on  get on my good lad said i  the postillion pointed to the hill  i then tried to return back to the story of the poor german and his ass  but i had broke the clue  and could no more get into it again than the postillion could into a trot    the deuce go said i with it all here am i sitting as heartily disposed to make the best of the worst as ever wight was and all runs counter  there is one sweet lenitive at least for evils which nature holds out to us so i took it kindly at her hands and fell asleep and the first word which roused me was amiens   bless me said i rubbing my eyes  this is the very town where my poor lady is to come  amiens the words were scarce out of my mouth when the count de ls postchaise with his sister in it drove hastily by she had just time to make me a bow of recognition  and of that particular kind of it which told me she had not yet done with me she was as good as her look for before i had quite finished my supper her brothers servant came into the room with a billet in which she said she had taken the liberty to charge me with a letter which i was to present myself to madame r the first morning i had nothing to do at paris there was only added she was sorry but from what penchant she had not considered that she had been prevented telling me her story  that she still owed it me and if my rout should ever lay through brussels and i had not by then forgot the name of madame de l  that madame de l would be glad to discharge her obligation  then i will meet thee said i fair spirit at brussels  it is only returning from italy through germany to holland by the rout of flanders home  twill scarce be ten posts out of my way but were it ten thousand with what a moral delight will it crown my journey in sharing in the sickening incidents of a tale of misery told to me by such a sufferer to see her weep and though i cannot dry up the fountain of her tears what an exquisite sensation is there still left in wiping them away from off the cheeks of the first and fairest of women as i am sitting with my handkerchief in my hand in silence the whole night besides her  there was nothing wrong in the sentiment and yet i instantly reproached my heart with it in the bitterest and most reprobate of expressions  it had ever as i told the reader been one of the singular blessings of my life to be almost every hour of it miserably in love with some one and my last flame happening to be blown out by a whiff of jealousy on the sudden turn of a corner i had lighted it up afresh at the pure taper of eliza but about three months before  swearing as i did it that it should last me through the whole journey  why should i dissemble the matter i had sworn to her eternal fidelity  she had a right to my whole heart  to divide my affections was to lessen them  to expose them was to risk them where there is risk there may be loss  and what will thou have yorick to answer to a heart so full of trust and confidence  so good so gentle and unreproaching   i will not go to brussels replied i interrupting myself  but my imagination went on  i recalled her looks at that crisis of our separation when neither of us had power to say adieu i looked at the picture she had tied in a black ribband about my neck  and blushed as i looked at it  i would have given the world to have kissed it  but was ashamed  and shall this tender flower said i pressing it between my hands  shall it be smitten to its very root  and smitten yorick by thee who have promised to shelter it in thy breast  eternal fountain of happiness said i kneeling down upon the ground  be thou my witness  and every pure spirit which tastes it be my witness also that i would not travel to brussels unless eliza went along with me did the road lead me toward heaven  in transports of this kind the heart in spite of the understanding will always say too much  the letter amiens fortune had not smiled upon la fleur for he had been unsuccessful in his feats of chivalry  and not one thing had offered to signalize his zeal for my service from the time he had entered into it which was almost four and twenty hours the poor soul burned with impatience and the count de ls servants coming with the letter being the first practicable occasion which offered la fleur had laid hold of it and in order to do honor to his master had taken him into a back parlour in the auberge and treated him with a cup or two of the best wine in picardy and the count de ls servant in return and not to be behind hand in politeness with la fleur had taken him back with him to the counts hotel la fleurs prevenancy for there was a passport in his very looks soon set every servant in the kitchen at ease with him and as a frenchman whatever be his talents has no sort of prudery in showing them la fleur in less than five minutes had pulled out his fife and leading off the dance himself with the first note set the fille de chamber the maitre dhotel the cook the scullion and all the household dogs and cats besides an old monkey a dancing i suppose there never was a merrier kitchen since the flood  madame de l in passing from her brothers apartments to her own hearing so much jollity below stairs rung up her fille de chamber to ask about it and hearing it was the english gentlemans servant who had set the whole house merry with his pipe she ordered him up  as the poor fellow could not present himself empty he had loadend himself in going up stairs with a thousand compliments to madame de l on the part of his master  added a long apocrypha of inquiries after madame de ls health  told her that monsieur his master was au desespoire for her reestablishment from the fatigues of her journey  and to close all that monsieur had received the letter which madame had done him the honor  and he has done me the honor said madame de l interrupting la fleur to send a billet in return  madame de l had said this with such a tone of reliance upon the fact that la fleur had not power to disappoint her expectations  he trembled for my honor  and possibly might not altogether be unconcerned for his own as a man capable of being attached to a master who could be a wanting en egards vis a vis dune femme so that when madame de l asked la fleur if he had brought a letter  o quoui said la fleur so laying down his hat upon the ground and taking hold of the flap of his right side pocket with his left hand he began to search for the letter with his right  then contrarywise  diable  then sought every pocket  pocket by pocket round not forgetting his fob  peste  then la fleur emptied them upon the floor  pulled out a dirty cravat  a handkerchief  a comb  a whip lash  a nightcap  then gave a peep into his hat  quelle etourderie he had left the letter upon the table in the auberge  he would run for it and be back with it in three minutes  i had just finished my supper when la fleur came in to give me an account of his adventure he told the whole story simply as it was and only added that if monsieur had forgot par hazard to answer madames letter the arrangement gave him an opportunity to recover the faux pas  and if not that things were only as they were  now i was not altogether sure of my etiquette whether i ought to have wrote or no but if i had  a devil himself could not have been angry twas but the officious zeal of a wellmeaning creature for my honor and however he might have mistook the road  or embarrassed me in so doing  his heart was in no fault  i was under no necessity to write  and what weighed more than all  he did not look as if he had done amiss   it is all very well la fleur said i  twas sufficient la fleur flew out of the room like lightening and returned with pen ink and paper in his hand and coming up to the table laid them close before me with such a delight in his countenance that i could not help taking up the pen  i begun and begun again and though i had nothing to say and that nothing might have been expressed in half a dozen lines i made half a dozen different beginnings and could no way please myself  in short i was in no mood to write  la fleur stepped out and brought a little water in a glass to dilute my ink  then fetched sand and sealwax  it was all one i wrote and blotted and tore off and burnt and wrote again  le diable lemporte said i half to myself  i cannot write this selfsame letter throwing the pen down despairingly as i said it  as soon as i had cast down the pen la fleur advanced with the most respectful carriage up to the table and making a thousand apologies for the liberty he was going to take told me he had a letter in his pocket wrote by a drummer in his regiment to a corporals wife which he durst say would suit the occasion  i had a mind to let the poor fellow have his humor  then prithee said i let me see it  la fleur instantly pulled out a little dirty pocketbook crammed full of small letters and billetdoux in a sad condition and laying it upon the table and then untying the string which held them all together run them over one by one till he came to the letter in question  la voila said he clapping his hands so unfolding it first he laid it before me and retired three steps from the table whilst i read it  the letter madame je suis penetre de la douleur la plus vive et reduit en meme temps an desespoir par ce retour imprevu du corporal qui rend notre entrevue de ce soir la chose du monde la plus impossible  mais vive la joie et toute la mienne sera de penser a vous  lamour nest rien sans sentiment  et le sentiment est encore moins sans amor  on dit quon ne doit jamais se desesperer  on dit aussi que monsieur le corporal monte la guard mecredi alors ce sera mon tour  chacun a son tour en attendant  vive lamour et vive la bagatelle  je suis madame   it was but changing the corporal into the count  and saying nothing about mounting guard on wednesday  and the letter was neither right or wrong  so to gratify the poor fellow who stood trembling for my honor his own and the honor of his letter  i took the cream gently off it and whipping it up in my own way  i sealed it up and sent him with it to madame de l  and the next morning we pursued our journey to paris  paris when a man can contest the point by dint of equipage and carry all on floundering before him with half a dozen lackies and a couple of cooks  it is very well in such a place as paris  he may drive in at which end of a street he will  a poor prince who is weak in cavalry and whose whole infantry does not exceed a single man had best quit the field and signalize himself in the cabinet if he can get up into it  i say up into it  for there is no descending perpendicular amongst em with a  me voici mes enfans  here i am  whatever many may think  i own my first sensations as soon as i was left solitary and alone in my own chamber in the hotel were far from being so flattering as i had prefigured them i walked up gravely to the window in my dusty black coat and looking through the glass saw all the world in yellow blue and green running at the ring of pleasure  the old with broken lances and in helmets which had lost their vizards  the young in armor bright which shone like gold beplumed with each gay feather of the east  all  all tilting at it like fascinated knights in tournaments of yore for fame and love   alas poor yorick cried i what art thou doing here on the very first onset of all this glittering clatter thou art reduced to an atom  seek  seek some winding alley with a tourniquet at the end of it where chariot never rolled or flambeau shot its rays  there thou may solace thy soul in converse sweet with some kind grisset of a barbers wife and get into such coteries    may i perish if i do said i pulling out the letter which i had to present to madame de r  i will wait upon this lady the very first thing i do so i called la fleur to go seek me a barber directly  and come back and brush my coat  the wig paris when the barber came he absolutely refused to have any thing to do with my wig twas either above or below his art i had nothing to do but to take one ready made of his own recommendation   but i fear friend said i this buckle will not stand  you may immerge it replied he into the ocean and it will stand   what a great scale is every thing upon in this city thought i  the utmost stretch of an english periwigmakers ideas could have gone no further than to have dipped it into a pail of water  what difference it is like time to eternity  i confess i do hate all cold conceptions as i do the puny ideas which engender them and am generally so struck with the great works of nature that for my own part if i could help it i never would make a comparison less than a mountain at least all that can be said against the french sublime in this instance of it is this  that the grandeur is more in the word and less in the thing no doubt the ocean fills the mind with vast ideas but paris being so far inland it was not likely i should run post a hundred miles out of it to try the experiment  the parisian barber meant nothing   the pail of water standing besides the great deep makes certainly but a sorry figure in speech  but twill be said  it has one advantage  it is in the next room and the truth of the buckle may be tried in it without more ado in a single moment  in honest truth and upon a more candid revision of the matter the french expression professes more than it performs  i think i can see the precise and distinguishing marks of national characters more in these nonsensical minutiae than in the most important matters of state where great men of all nations talk and stalk so much alike that i would not give ninepence to choose amongst them  i was so long in getting from under my barbers hands that it was too late of thinking of going with my letter to madame r that night but when a man is once dressed at all points for going out his reflections turn to little account so taking down the name of the hotel de modene where i lodged i walked forth without any determination where to go  i shall consider of that said i as i walk along  the pulse paris hail ye small sweet courtesies of life for smooth do ye make the road of it like grace and beauty which beget inclinations to love at first sight it is ye who open this door and let the stranger in   pray madame said i have the goodness to tell me which way i must turn to go to the opera comique  most willingly monsieur said she laying aside her work   i had given a cast with my eye into half a dozen shops as i came along in search of a face not likely to be disordered by such an interruption till at last this hitting my fancy i had walked in  she was working a pair of ruffles as she sat in a low chair on the far side of the shop facing the door    tres volentieres most willingly said she laying her work down upon a chair next her and rising up from the low chair she was sitting in with so cheerful a movement and so cheerful a look that had i been laying out fifty louis dors with her i should have said  this woman is grateful  you must turn monsieur said she going with me to the door of the shop and pointing the way down the street i was to take  you must turn first to your left hand  mais prenez guarde  there are two turns and be so good as to take the second  then go down a little way and you will see a church and when you are past it give yourself the trouble to turn directly to the right and that will lead you to the foot of the pont neuf which you must cross  and there any one will do himself the pleasure to show you   she repeated her instructions three times over to me with the same good natured patience the third time as the first  and if tones and manners have a meaning which certainly they have unless to hearts which shut them out  she seemed really interested that i should not lose myself  i will not suppose it was the womans beauty notwithstanding she was the handsomest grisset i think i ever saw which had much to do with the sense i had of her courtesy only i remember when i told her how much i was obliged to her that i looked very full in her eyes  and that i repeated my thanks as often as she had done her instructions  i had not got ten paces from the door before i found i had forgot every tittle of what she had said  so looking back and seeing her still standing in the door of the shop as if to look whether i went right or not  i returned back to ask her whether the first turn was to my right or left  for that i had absolutely forgot  is it possible said she half laughing  it is very possible replied i when a man is thinking more of a woman than of her good advice  as this was the real truth  she took it as every woman takes a matter of right with a slight courtesy   attendez said she laying her hand upon my arm to detain me whilst she called a lad out of the backshop to get ready a parcel of gloves i am just going to send him said she with a packet into that quarter and if you will have the complaisance to step in it will be ready in a moment and he shall attend you to the place  so i walked in with her to the far side of the shop and taking up the ruffle in my hand which she laid upon the chair as if i had a mind to sit she sat down herself in her low chair and i instantly sat myself down besides her   he will be ready monsieur said she in a moment  and in that moment replied i most willingly would i say something very civil to you for all these courtesies any one may do a casual act of good nature but a continuation of them shows it is a part of the temperature and certainly added i if it is the same blood which comes from the heart which descends to the extremes touching her wrist i am sure you must have one of the best pulses of any woman in the world  feel it said she holding out her arm so laying down my hat i took hold of her fingers in one hand and applied the two forefingers of my other to the artery    would to heaven my dear eugenius thou had passed by and beheld me sitting in my black coat and in my lackadaysical manner counting the throbs of it one by one with as much true devotion as if i had been watching the critical ebb or flow of her fever  how would thou have laughed and moralized upon my new profession  and thou should have laughed and moralized on  trust me my dear eugenius i should have said there are worse occupations in this world than feeling a womans pulse  but a grissets thou would have said  and in an open shop yorick    so much the better for when my views are direct eugenius i care not if all the world saw me feel it  the husband paris i had counted twenty pulsations and was going on fast toward the fortieth when her husband coming unexpected from a back parlour into the shop put me a little out in my reckoning  twas no body but her husband she said  so i began a fresh score  monsieur is so good quoth she as he passed by us as to give himself the trouble of feeling my pulse  the husband took off his hat and making me a bow said i did him too much honor  and having said that he put on his hat and walked out  good god said i to myself as he went out  and can this man be the husband of this woman  let it not torment the few who know what must have been the grounds of this exclamation if i explain it to those who do not  in london a shopkeeper and a shopkeepers wife seem to be one bone and one flesh in the several endowments of mind and body sometimes the one sometimes the other has it so as in general to be upon a par and to tally with each other as nearly as man and wife need to do  in paris there are scarce two orders of beings more different for the legislative and executive powers of the shop not resting in the husband he seldom comes there  in some dark and dismal room behind he sits commerceless in his thrum nightcap the same rough son of nature that nature left him  the genius of a people where nothing but the monarchy is salique having ceded this department with sundry others totally to the women  by a continual higgling with customers of all ranks and sizes from morning to night like so many rough pebbles shook long together in a bag by amicable collisions they have worn down their asperities and sharp angles and not only become round and smooth but will receive some of them a polish like a brilliant  monsieur le mari is little better than the stone under your foot    surely  surely man it is not good for thee to sit alone  thou wast made for social intercourse and gentle greetings and this improvement of our natures from it i appeal to as my evidence   and how does it beat monsieur said she  with all the benignity said i looking quietly in her eyes that i expected  she was going to say something civil in return  but the lad came into the shop with the gloves  a propos said i i want a couple of pair myself  the gloves paris the beautiful grisset rose up when i said this and going behind the counter reached down a parcel and untied it i advanced to the side over against her they were all too large the beautiful grisset measured them one by one across my hand  it would not alter the dimensions  she begged i would try a single pair which seemed to be the least  she held it open  my hand slipped into it at once  it will not do said i shaking my head a little  no said she doing the same thing  there are certain combined looks of simple subtlety  where whim and sense and seriousness and nonsense are so blended that all the languages of babel set loose together could not express them  they are communicated and caught so instantaneously that you can scarce say which party is the infecter i leave it to your men of words to swell pages about it  it is enough in the present to say again the gloves would not do so folding our hands within our arms we both lolld upon the counter  it was narrow and there was just room for the parcel to lay between us  the beautiful grisset looked sometimes at the gloves then sideways to the window then at the gloves  and then at me i was not disposed to break silence  i followed her example so i looked at the gloves then to the window then at the gloves and then at her  and so on alternately  i found i lost considerably in every attack  she had a quick black eye and shot through two such long and silken eyelashes with such penetration that she looked into my very heart and reins  it may seem strange but i could actually feel she did    it is no matter said i taking up a couple of the pairs next me and putting them into my pocket  i was sensible the beautiful grisset had not asked above a single livre above the price  i wished she had asked a livre more and was puzzling my brains how to bring the matter about  do you think my dear sir said she mistaking my embarrassment that i could ask a sous too much of a stranger  and of a stranger whose politeness more than his want of gloves has done me the honor to lay himself at my mercy  men croyez capable  faith not i said i and if you were you are welcome  so counting the money into her hand and with a lower bow than one generally makes to a shopkeepers wife i went out and her lad with his parcel followed me  the translation paris there was no body in the box i was let into but a kindly old french officer i love the character not only because i honor the man whose manners are softened by a profession which makes bad men worse but that i once knew one  for he is no more  and why should i not rescue one page from violation by writing his name in it and telling the world it was captain tobias shandy the dearest of my flock and friends whose philanthropy i never think of at this long distance from his death  but my eyes gush out with tears for his sake i have a predilection for the whole corpse of veterans and so i strode over the two back rows of benches and placed myself beside him  the old officer was reading attentively a small pamphlet it might be the book of the opera with a large pair of spectacles as soon as i sat down he took his spectacles off and putting them into a shagreen case returned them and the book into his pocket together i half rose up and made him a bow  translate this into any civilized language in the world  the sense is this  here is a poor stranger come in to the box  he seems as if he knew no body and is never likely was he to be seven years in paris if every man he comes near keeps his spectacles upon his nose  it is shutting the door of conversation absolutely in his face  and using him worse than a german  the french officer might as well have said it all aloud and if he had i should in course have put the bow i made him into french too and told him i was sensible of his attention and returned him a thousand thanks for it  there is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality as to get master of this short hand and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs with all their inflections and delineations into plain words for my own part by long habitude i do it so mechanically that when i walk the streets of london i go translating all the way and have more than once stood behind in the circle where not three words have been said and have brought off twenty different dialogues with me which i could have fairly wrote down and sworn to  i was going one evening to martinis concert at milan and was just entering the door of the hall when the marquesina di f was coming out in a sort of a hurry  she was almost upon me before i saw her so i gave a spring to one side to let her pass  she had done the same and on the same side too so we ran our heads together she instantly got to the other side to get out i was just as unfortunate as she had been for i had sprung to that side and opposed her passage again  we both flew together to the other side and then back  and so on  it was ridiculous we both blushed intolerably so i did at last the thing i should have done at first  i stood stock still and the marquesina had no more difficulty i had no power to go into the room till i had made her so much reparation as to wait and follow her with my eye to the end of the passage  she looked back twice and walked along it rather sideways as if she would make room for any one coming up stairs to pass her  no said i  that is a vile translation the marquesina has a right to the best apology i can make her and that opening is left for me to do it in  so i ran and begged pardon for the embarrassment i had given her saying it was my intention to have made her way she answered she was guided by the same intention toward me  so we reciprocally thanked each other she was at the top of the stairs and seeing no chichesbee near her i begged to hand her to her coach  so we went down the stairs stopping at every third step to talk of the concert and the adventure  upon my word madame said i when i had handed her in i made six different efforts to let you go out  and i made six efforts replied she to let you enter  i wish to heaven you would make a seventh said i  with all my heart said she making room  life is too short to be long about the forms of it  so i instantly stepped in and she carried me home with her  and what became of the concert st cecilia who i suppose was at it knows more than i  i will only add that the connection which arose out of that translation gave me more pleasure than any one i had the honor to make in italy  the dwarf paris i had never heard the remark made by any one in my life except by one and who that was will probably come out in this chapter so that being pretty much unprepossessed there must have been grounds for what struck me the moment i cast my eyes over the parterre  and that was the unaccountable sport of nature in forming such numbers of dwarfs  no doubt she sports at certain times in almost every corner of the world but in paris there is no end to her amusements  the goddess seems almost as merry as she is wise  as i carried my idea out of the opera comique with me i measured every body i saw walking in the streets by it  melancholy application especially where the size was extremely little  the face extremely dark  the eyes quick  the nose long  the teeth white  the jaw prominent  to see so many miserables by force of accidents driven out of their own proper class into the very verge of another which it gives me pain to write down  every third man a pigmy  some by ricketty heads and hump backs  others by bandy legs  a third set arrested by the hand of nature in the sixth and seventh years of their growth  a fourth in their perfect and natural state like dwarf appletrees from the first rudiments and stamina of their existence never meant to grow higher  a medical traveller might say it is owing to undue bandages  a splenetic one to want of air  and an inquisitive traveller to fortify the system may measure the height of their houses  the narrowness of their streets and in how few feet square in the sixth and seventh stories such numbers of the bourgoisie eat and sleep together but i remember mr shandy the elder who accounted for nothing like any body else in speaking one evening of these matters averred that children like other animals might be increased almost to any size provided they came right into the world but the misery was the citizens of paris were so cooped up that they had not actually room enough to get them  i do not call it getting any thing said he  it is getting nothing  nay continued he rising in his argument it is getting worse than nothing when all you have got after twenty or five and twenty years of the tenderest care and most nutritious aliment bestowed upon it shall not at last be as high as my leg now mr shandy being very short there could be nothing more said upon it  as this is not a work of reasoning i leave the solution as i found it and content myself with the truth only of the remark which is verified in every lane and bylane of paris i was walking down that which leads from the carousal to the palais royal and observing a little boy in some distress at the side of the gutter which ran down the middle of it i took hold of his hand and helped him over upon turning up his face to look at him after i perceived he was about forty  never mind said i some good body will do as much for me when i am ninety  i feel some little principles within me which incline me to be merciful toward this poor blighted part of my species who have neither size or strength to get on in the world  i cannot bear to see one of them trod upon and had scarce got seated beside my old french officer ere the disgust was exercised by seeing the very thing happen under the box we sat in  at the end of the orchestra and betwixt that and the first sidebox there is a small esplanade left where when the house is full numbers of all ranks take sanctuary though you stand as in the parterre you pay the same price as in the orchestra a poor defenseless being of this order had got thrust some how or other into this luckless place  the night was hot and he was surrounded by beings two feet and a half higher than himself the dwarf suffered inexpressibly on all sides but the thing which incommoded him most was a tall corpulent german near seven feet high who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of his seeing either the stage or the actors the poor dwarf did all he could to get a peep at what was going forwards by seeking for some little opening betwixt the germans arm and his body trying first one side then the other but the german stood square in the most unaccommodating posture that can be imagined  the dwarf might as well have been placed at the bottom of the deepest drawwell in paris so he civilly reached up his hand to the germans sleeve and told him his distress  the german turned his head back looked downupon him as goliath did upon david  and unfeelingly resumed his posture  i was just then taking a pinch of snuff out of my monks little horn box  and how would thy meek and courteous spirit my dear monk so tempered to bear and forbear  how sweetly would it have lent an ear to this poor souls complaint  the old french officer seeing me lift up my eyes with an emotion as i made the apostrophe took the liberty to ask me what was the matter  i told him the story in three words and added how inhuman it was  by this time the dwarf was driven to extremes and in his first transports which are generally unreasonable had told the german he would cut off his long queue with his knife  the german looked back coolly and told him he was welcome if he could reach it  an injury sharpened by an insult be it to who it will makes every man of sentiment a party i could have leaped out of the box to have redressed it  the old french officer did it with much less confusion for leaning a little over and nodding to a sentinel and pointing at the same time with his finger to the distress  the sentinel made his way up to it  there was no occasion to tell the grievance  the thing told itself so thrusting back the german instantly with his musket  he took the poor dwarf by the hand and placed him before him  this is noble said i clapping my hands together  and yet you would not permit this said the old officer in england   in england dear sir said i we sit all at our ease  the old french officer would have set me at unity with myself in case i had been at variance  by saying it was a bon mot  and as a bon mot is always worth something at paris he offered me a pinch of snuff  the rose paris it was now my turn to ask the old french officer what was the matter for a cry of  haussez les mains monsieur labbe reechoed from a dozen different parts of the parterre was as unintellgible to me as my apostrophe to the monk had been to him  he told me it was some poor abbe in one of the upper loges who he supposed had got planted perdu behind a couple of grissets in order to see the opera and that the parterre espying him were insisting upon his holding up both his hands during the representation  and can it be supposed said i that an ecclesiastic would pick the griffers pockets the old french officer smiled and whispering in my car opened a door of knowledge which i had no idea of   good god said i turning pale with astonishment  is it possible that a people so smit with sentiment should at the same time be so unclean and so unlike themselves  quelle grossierte added i  the french officer told me it was an illiberal sarcasm at the church which had begun in the theater about the time the tartuffe was given in it by moliere  but like other remains os gothic manners was declining  every nation continued he have their refinements and grossiertes in which they take the lead and lose it of one another by turns  that he had been in most countries but never in one where he found not some delicacies which others seemed to want le pour et le contre se trouvent en chaque nation there is a balance said he of good and bad every where and nothing but the knowing it is so can emancipate one half of the world from the prepossessions which it holds against the other  that the advantage of travel as it regarded the scavoir vivre was by seeing a great deal both of men and manners it taught us mutual toleration and mutual toleration concluded he making me a bow taught us mutual love  the old french officer delivered this with an air of such candor and good sense as coincided with my first favorable impressions of his character  i thought i loved the man but i fear i mistook the object  twas my own way of thinking  the difference was i could not have expressed it half so well  it is alike troublesome to both the rider and his beast  if the latter goes pricking up his ears and starting all the way at every object which he never saw before  i have as little torment of this kind as any creature alive and yet i honestly confess that many a thing gave me pain and that i blushed at many a word the first month  which i found inconsequent and perfectly innocent the second  madame de ramboulict after an acquaintance of about six weeks with her had done me the honor to take me in her coach about two leagues out of town  of all women madame de rambouliet is the most correct and i never wish to see one of more virtues and purity of heart  in our return back madame de rambouliet desired me to pull the cord  i asked her if she wanted any thing  rien que pisser said madame de rambouliet   grieve not gentle traveller to let madame de rambouliet p  ss on  and ye fair mystic nymphs go each one pluck your rose and scatter them in your path
