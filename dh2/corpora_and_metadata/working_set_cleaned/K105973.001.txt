its valor and tenacity of its liberty for the stand it made against the romans for its slaughter of the legions vita agricolae  and for the subjection of the nation by agricola who did not dare to attempt his caledonian expedition and leave behind him unconquered so tremendous an enemy  when our first invaders landed in great britain north wales was possessed by the ordovices a name derived from the language of the country signifying the situation being almost entirely bounded by the river deva or the modern dee and another river of the name of dyvi mr llwyd in cambden ii      the one flows into the irish sea below chester the other into the same sea on the borders of cardiganshire  the spirit which the people showed at the beginning did not desert them to the last notwithstanding they were obliged to submit to the resistless power of the romans they never fell a prey to the enervating charms of luxury as the other nations of this island did they never with womanish invocations requested the aid of the deserting conquerors or sunk beneath the pressure of the new invaders they preserved an undaunted courage amidst their native rocks and received among them the gallant fugitives happy in congenial souls the hardy saxons for above three centuries could not make an impression even on our low lands offa was the first who extended his kingdom for some miles within our borders his conquest was but temporary for we possessed chester the capital of the cornavii till the year     when it was wrested from us by the united force of the heptarchy beneath the able egbert this indeed reduced our confines but did not subdue our spirit with obdurate valor we suftained our independency for another four centuries against the power of a kingdom more than twelve times larger than itself and at length had the glory of falling when a divided country beneath the arms of the most wise and most warlike of the english monarchs  i naturally begin my journey from the place of my nativity flintshire downing in the county of flint to give a general idea of this shire the reader must learn that it is lest of the twelve welsh its northern side is washed by the estuary of the dee the seteia estuarium of ptolemy the land rises suddenly from the shore in fine inequalities clayey and plenteous in corn and grass for two three or four miles to a montanous tract that runs parallel to it for a confiderable way  the lower part is divided by picturesque dingles which run from the mountains and open to the sea filled with oaks the inferior parts abound with coal and freestone the upper with minerals of lead and calamine and immense strata of limestone and chert the principal trade of the country is mining and smelting  the northern part of the county is flat and very rich in corn especially wheat which is generally exported to liverpool the shire in most places raises more than is sufficient for the use of the inhabitants it is extremely populous and in the mineral parts composed of a mixed people whose fathers and grandfathers had resorted here for sake of employ out of the english mine counties many of whose children born of welsh mothers have quite lost the language of their fathers  a lofty range of mountains rise on the west and form a bold frontier our county is watered by several small rivers such as the allen the terrig and the wheeler part of its western boundary by the clwyd and maelwr a disjoined part of the country by the dee  we are ignorant of the classical name of this little province the ordovices of which all west of cheshire was part were subdivided in the time of the romans in all probability as the rest of the country was they had reguli or lords who ruled over little districts and united under a common leader when the exigencies of the time required these factions weakened the state separated their interest and facilitated their conquest by the first invaders  the names of these districts are now unknown gwynedd is the most ancient we are acquainted with for the country of north wales the portion i inhabit was called tegangle which comprehends the hree modern hundreds of coleshill prestatyn and rudland the name is preserved in the montanous parts of this parish and some others to this day called mynnydd tegang i reject the translation of tegangle into fair england as a mongrel compound the word is of a much more ancient date it being derived from cangi or ceangi a set of people according to the learned baxter belonging to every british nation who attended the herds and resided with them in different grazing grounds at different times of the year the neighboring cornavii had their ceangi who wintered in wiral and took their summer residence in tegangle a word to be properly derived on that account from teg fair cang the name of the people and lle a place to corroborate which at this very day is a plain in the parish of caerwys a part of the old tegangle adjoining to this mountain that still retains the title of maes can havod or the plain of the hundred summer residences for this reason i presume to differ from mr baxter in his notion of the summer residence of these cangi he places it near the canganorum promontorium or braich y pwll head in caernarvonshire but those were the cangi of the ordovices these of the cornavii  it may be remarked that contrary to what happens to most subdued nations our country preserved its own language and the conquerors even deigned to adopt the names of the british towns and people latinizing them from the original words thus londinium from lundein i e llong din or dinas the city of ships cambden i   0  from its considerable commerce deva from its situation on the river deva or dysi  dunmonii from dunmnyn or the hill of ore brigantes from brig choice or chief men coritani or rather coitani from coed a wood mr pegge  on the retreat of their roman masters the latinized names were dropped except in a very few instances and their own resumed but the rest of the britons who submitted to the saxon yoke universally received with it the names of places from their conquerors  the whole of flintshire was subdued by the saxons immediately after the taking of chester by egbert it was an open country destitute of inaccessible rocks and mountains like the rest of north wales and consequently incapable of defense against so potent an enemy the conquerors as usual newnamed the towns villages and hamlets but could not cancel the ancient thus hawarden still is known to the welsh by the name of pennardd lag or halawg mold by that of wyddgryg and hope by that of estyn which with the continuance of our language to this day proves that even at that time it mixed but little with our conquerors numbers of saxons were settled among us who held their lands from the mercian governors or earls we find in the doomsday book many of their names who had possessions in this tract such as ulbert osmer and elmer  the first notice of any subdivision of the tract called flintshire doomsday book appears in the doomsday book when that survey was taken it was made a part of cheshire to which it was considered as an appendage by conquest old records affirm that the county of flint appertains to the dignity of the sword of chester it was soon subdued by robert de rothelent commander in chief under hugh lupus who carried his arms far into wales and secured his conquests in the marches by building or rather by adding new works to the castle of rudland which he had wrested from one of our princes  the tract from chester to the clwyd was then considered as a hundred of cheshire and called in the doomsday book atiscros hundred numbers of places still existing are mentioned in it disguised often by the norman spelling whiteford the place in question is called widford notice is also taken of some of the present townships such as tremostyn trebychton and merton under the names of mostone widsord putecaine and meretone mostone was then a ploughland terra unius carucae it had on it four villeyns and eight boors  bordarii borda signifies a cottage with a small piece of land annexed held by the service of finding for the lord poultry eggs etc for his bwrdd or table  a wood a league long and forty perches particatae broad and was valued at twenty shillings  widford is joined with putecaine the first seems to have comprehended our present trelan or the place where the churchvillage now stands these had one ploughland two villeyns and twelve others between men and maid servants fisheries and a wood half a league long and forty perches broad the value was the same with that of mostone  with meretone is joined the third part of widford and the berewicha or hamlet of caldecote the last at present a township of the parish of holywell in this division was a presbyter a church and six villeyns here was a wood half a league long and twenty perches broad one odin held these of the earl  at the time of the conquest all this tract of flintshire which was called by the saxons englefield and afterward by the normans atiscros was in possession of edwin the last earl of mercia and on his defeat and forfeiture bestowed with the earldom of chester on hugh lupus the whole was in a manner depopulated and reduced to a waste i imagine by the two inroads made into those parts by harold at the command of edward the confessor to revenge on griffith ap lhewelyn the insult offered him by giving protection to algar one of his rebellious subjects powell  00   it is observable that there were only seven churches at that time in the whole hundred   haordine the present hawardin   widford   bissard boteuuaral and ruagor   inglecroft brunfor and alchene   danfrond calston and wesbie   prestetone and ruestoch and finally the  th at roelend besides one that lay waste at cancarnacan and whenescol parochial divisions had not yet taken place mr agard antiquary discourses i      a writer in the latter end of the sixteenth century remarks that the old historians make no mention of either parishes parsons vicars incumbents or curates the people attended in those days either the cathedral churches or the conventual which were served by the prelates or monks and those often assisted by presbyters clerks and deacons as piety gained strength other churches for the convenience of the devout were erected by the nobility and men of property who were desirous of spiritual assistance within their precincts and to this were owing the churches which at the period in question were so sparingly scattered over the land the places which enjoyed this advantage had the title of lhan prefixed as that of tree which signifies primitively a habitation is to the townships  thus in our parish is tremostyn tremostyn remarkable for the ancient seat of the family of the same name which acquired it by the marriage of jevan vychan with angharad heiress of howel ap ithel vychan of mostyn in the reign of richard ii the great gloomy hall is of very old date furnished with the high dais or elevated upper end and its long table for the lord and his jovial companions and another in the side the seat of the inferior partakers of the good cheer the walls are furnished in a suitable manner with ancient militia guns swords and pikes with helmets and breast plates with funereal achievements and with variety of spoils of the chase a falcon is nailed against the upper end of the room with two bells hung to each foot with these encumbrances it flew from its owner a gentleman in the county of angus on the morning of the twentyfourth of september      and was killed near this house on the morning of the twentysixth the precise time it reached our country is not known therefore we are uncertain whether this bird exceeded in swiftness the hawk which flew thirty miles in an hour in pursuit of a woodcock or that which made a flight out of westphalia into prussia in a day instances recorded miscellany tracts tr v p    by the learned sir thomas brown the adjacent kitchen is overlooked by a gallery leading to the ancient apartments of the lady of the house at a period when the odours of the pot and spit were thought no ill savours at one end of the gallery is a great room remarkable for a singular event during the time that henry earl of richmond was secretly laying the foundation of the overthrow of the house of york he passed concealed from place to place in order to form an interest among the welsh who favored his cause on account of their respect to his granfather owen tudor their countryman while he was at mostyn a party attached to richard iii arrived there to apprehend him he was then about to dine but had just time to leap out of a back window and make his escape through a hole which to this day is called the kings richard ap howel then lord of mostyn joined henry at the battle of bosworth and after the victory received from the king in token of gratitude for his preservation the belt and sword he wore on the day he also pressed richard greatly to follow him to court but he nobly answered like the shunamitish widow i dwell among mine own people the sword and belt were preserved in the house till within these few years it is observable that none of our historians account for a certain period of henrys life previous to his accession it is very evident that he passed the times when he disappeared from bretagny in wales many cotemporary bards by feigned names record this part of his life under those of the lion the eagle and the like which were to restore the empire to the britons for the inspired favorers of the house of lancaster did not dare to deliver their verses in other than terms allegorical for fear of the reigning prince  there is little more remarkable about the house than what is common to others built at different times here are two remarkable portraits one of sir roger mostyn knight with a white beard and locks in black with great breeches stuck round the waistband with points this piece of magnificence gave rise to a very coarse proverb applied to inferior people ambitious of acting beyond their station the other portrait is of his lady mary eldest daughter of sir john win of gwedir baronet both are full lengths dated      and i think painted by mytens  here is another picture not less remarkable for its ridiculous composition than for the distinguished person painted in it a kitcat length of sir roger mostyn the first baronet in a strange long flaxen wig a breast plate buff skirts and antique roman sleeves a black holding his helmet his lady reading with one hand on a scull and by her husband a lapdog this gentleman was the most eminent loyalist of our county raised a regiment in support of the crown consisting of fifteen hundred men in twelve hours time whitelock     mostly colliers and garrisoned his house which in september      was surrendered to the parlementary forces with four pieces of cannon and some arms ibid   the busts collected in italy deserve mention busts that of the elder brutus is particularly fine as if formed in the instant that the love of his country got the better of paternal affection when with a steady voice he was delivering to the lictors his titus and tiberius to receive the reward of their treasons  a beautiful head of a young faun in a phrygian bonnet  a fine head of one of the cornelii an homer and an hippocrates a seleucus with two wings fastened to an imperial diadem symbols of dispatch and expedition two busts in brown alabaster of a male and female faun with the flammeum on their heads both are of hideous deformity but well executed here are besides a few small monumental marbles with inscriptions which the antiquarian reader may find in the appendix  in the library is a most elegant collection of the classics library containing variety of the most ancient and rare editions a numerous collection of books relating to the greek and roman antiquities especially those which comprehend the medallic history variety of manuscripts mostly on vellum and many of them richly illuminated in a few words scarce any private library can boast of so valuable an assemblage which remain indisputable evidences of the taste and judgment of that excellent man its accomplished founder the late sir thomas mostyn the family are besides possessed of other very valuable antiquities such as the cake of copper found at caerhen in caernarvonshire the torques this very curious antiquity is engraven in the appendix with the account drawn up by my learned countryman llwyd  discovered near harlech and the silver harp which the family had the power of bestowing on the most skilful minstrel rythmer or bard at the eisteddfad or assembly held for trials of their several merits each of these shall be spoken of in their proper places  before i quit the house i must take notice that thomas ap richard ap howel ap jevan vychan lord of mostyn and his brother piers founder of the family of trelacre were the first that abridged their name and that on the following occasion rowland lee bishop of lichfield and president of the marches of wales in the reign of henry viii sat at one of the courts on a welsh cause and wearied with the quantity of aps in the jury directed that the panel should assume their last name or that of their residence and that thomas ap richard ap howel ap jevan vychan should for the future be reduced to the poor dissyllable mostyn no doubt to the great mortification of many an ancient line  in the higher part of this township stands the curious cross called maen achwynfan maen achwynfan or the stone of lamentation because penances were often finished before such sacred pillars and concluded with weeping and the usual marks of contrition for an example near stafford stood one called the weeping cross a name analogous to ours this is of an elegant form and sculpture is twelve feet high two feet four inches broad at the bottom and ten inches thick the base is let into another stone the top is round and includes in raised work the form of a greek cross beneath about the middle is another in the form of st andrews and under that a naked figure with a spear in its hand close to that on the side of the column is represented some animal the rest is covered with very beautiful fretwork like what may be seen on other pillars of ancient date in several parts of great britain  maen y chyfan   i do not presume after the annotator on cambden has given up the point to attempt a guess at the age only must observe that it must have been previous to the reign of gross superstition among the welsh otherwise the sculptor would have employed his chizzel in striking out legendary stories instead of the elegant knots and interlaced work that cover the stone  those who suppose it to have been erected in memory of the dead slain in battle on the spot draw their argument from the number of adjacent tumuli containing human bones and sculls often marked with mortal wounds but these earthy sepulchers are of more ancient times than the elegant sculpture of this pillar will admit this likewise from the crosses is evidently a christian monument the former were only in use in pagan days  there are likewise gilli near to it an ancient chapel now a farmhouse called gelli the name of an adjacent tract this might have relation to the cross as well as a place for performance of divine service to the abbot of basingwerk who had a house at no great distance in one of our townships still called trerabbot or the abbots habitation this tract misspelt by the english getely ayloffs rotuli walliae           with the wood at that time on it was granted by edward i to the abbot and convent on the tenth of november at westminster before the death of our last prince he also gave him power to grub up the wood which by the present nakedness of the place appears to have been done effectually  from the summit of garreg a hill in this parish the traveller may have an august foresight of the lofty tract of snowdon from the crooked moel shabog at one end to the towering penmaenmawr at the other of the vast promontory of llandidno and part of the isle of anglesea with the great bay of llandulas forming a vast crescent the estuaries of the dee and the mersey and to the north at times the isle of man and the cumberland alps the sure presages of bad weather  i will descend now to trebychton trebychton another of our maritime townships where stands my paternal house attended with what was very frequent in our principality a summer house at a very small distance and a cellar beneath used as a retreat for the jolly owners and their friends to enjoy remote from the fair their toasts and noisy merriment this and the other lower parts of the parish are finely wooded with oaks which grow so spontaneously that was the place depopulated it would in a very few years relapse into an impenetrable forest  in trelan is the parish church dedicated to saint mary the rectory is a sinecure which with the vicarage is in the gift of the bishop of st asaph the church i imagine retains the ancient site it had at the time of the conquest the present building consists of a nave and one aile the last was built by a blethyn drow of the house of mostyn to whom that part belongs  the two mertons merton uch glan and isglan are adjacent townships in the reign of edward i before his conquest the lands of the men of merton to the amount of sixteen ploughlands were taken from them and bestowed on the abbot and convent of basingwerk against the laws of wales and the custom of the country and contrary to the peace between the king and prince lhewelyn pewel   0  this violent act was done by reginald de gray dugdales baron i      justice of chester probably by connivance of the king to provoke the welsh to commit some outrage that would give color to the english to break the truce  folebroc folebroc or feilebroc belonged to the monks of basingwerk and is mentioned in the confirmation of the grants to that convent by henry ii and again in the charters renewed to it by lhewelyn ap jorwerth and david ap lhewelyn princes of north wales the monks had a grange on it and right of pasturage on the mountain in common with neighboring inhabitants dugdales monast i   0       the products of this parish are corn of every sort excepting rye little cheese or butter is made here for sale as the grass is chiefly consumed by horses for the farmers are greatly employed in carrying the minerals of the country the same may be said of the shire in general every cottager has his potatoe garden which is a great support to them and was a convenience unknown fifty years ago the lower parts are well wooded and much timber is at times sold to leverpool and other places at good prices much is also used at home in the mines  the collieries of mostyn and bychton have been worked for a very considerable space coal and in the last century supplied dublin and the eastern side of ireland with coal they are at present but in a low state partly from the rise of the works at whitehaven but more from the loss of the channel of the dee which in the beginning of this century flowed so close to our shore that ships of two hundred tons lay under this parish with their cables twisted round the trees at this time vessels of sixty or seventy cannot approach nearer than two miles the dee now flowing under the opposite shore still we load a few vessels for ireland and some parts of north wales much is also consumed by the neighboring smeltinghouses and the inland parts of denbighshire the improvements of land by lime has of late occasioned a great comsumption of coal by the farmer and by the persons who burn it for sale  the coal is of different thickness from three quarters to five yards the beds dip from one yard in four to two in three they immerge beneath the estuary of the dee are discovered again on the south side of wiral in cheshire as if corresponding with some of the flintshire they remain as yet lost on the northern part of the same hundred but are found a third time in vast quantities in lancashire on the opposite side of the mersey their extent from west to east in this county may be reckoned from the parish of llanasa through those of whiteford holywell flint northop and hawarden our coal is of different qualities suited to the variety of demands of the several sorts of founderies in the neighborhood beds of canal are met with inferior indeed in elegance to those of lancashire but greatly coveted by the limeburners sometimes is also found the peacockcoal of doctor plot hist staffordshire      remarkable for the beauty of its surface glossed over with the changeable brilliancy of the colors of that beautiful bird  coals were known to the britons before the arrival of the romans who had not even a name for them yet theophrastus in his book on stones   describes them very accurately at lest three centuries before the time of caesar and even says that they were used by workers in brass it is highly probable that the britons made use of them it is certain they had a primitive name for this fossil that of glo and as a farther proof i may add that a flintax the instrument of the aborigines of our island was discovered stuck in certain veins of coal exposed to day in craig y parc in monmouthshire ph tr no     p  00  and in such a situation as to render it very accessible to the inexperienced natives who in early times were incapable of pursuing the veins to any great depths the artless smelters of ancient times made use of wood only in their operations as we find among the relics of their hearths as shall be observed hereafter  a very useful species of ashcolored greasy clay is discovered over one of the beds it resists the fire remarkably well and has been used with great success in the mineral smelting furnaces  the beds of sandstone are frequent in the lower parts of the parish freestone and reach within half a mile of the mountain when the stratum changes first to a blackish shale soon dissolluble by exposure to the air after that to a whitish limestone or to a hard chert both are found in strata a of vast thickness lime the first is burnt into excellent lime and is also used as a flux for lead ores the common sort of houses are built with it for which it is less proper by reason of its excessive dampness at change of weather  in the township of tremostyn near the shore is a cliff of a very singular appearance looking like the semivitrified lava of a volcano the stratum is in front universally changed in its disposition and run into a horrible mass of red and black often porous but in all parts very hard in it is a hollow a vein in which was lodged the pyritical matter that took fire and caused the phenomenon its fury chiefly raged toward the front and diminished gradually in the internal part of the bed which at some distance within land appears only discolored the stratum is a sandstone of the common sort da costas fossils      i am informed that these appearances are not uncommon in derbyshire and that mr ferber an ingenions swede and mr whitehurst our ingenious countryman has taken notice of them in their writings  the chert is the petrosex of the later writers it is of a flinty nature chart and is the only stone that resembles flint in our county the annotator on cronsted justly remarks that the true flint abounds in chalk which is an absorbent earth as chert does in the neighborhood of limestone which is also calcareous as yet this species of stone has nor been found of any use i susspect that in case it was burnt and ground it might prove serviceable in making a coarse stone ware as the nodular flints are in making the finer  the hilly part of our parish has been for a long succession of years rich in minerals of lead and calamine some years ago about seventeen hundred of copper ore was discovered but none since notwithstanding it has been diligently searched arenaria saxatilis scarlet mushroom after i shall suspend enquiry after these and other minerals and fossils of this tract till i am about to leave the part of flintshire productive of these sources of wealth i shall here only take notice of a vegetable rare in other places which grows on certain parts of the mountain in plenty and in may makes a pretty appearance with its white flowers this is the arenaria saxatilis or mountain chickweed engraven in the annexed plate with a scarlet kind of mushroom unnoticed by linnaeus but described by mr ray p    no   of his synopsis of british plants  in my road to the next parish south of this i take that which lies on the shore and pass by the ancient smeltinghouse of llanerchymor which is still in use for fusing of lead ore and extracting of silver  the sea or the estuary of the dee lies at a small distance on the left a verdant marsh intervening the hundred of wiral a portion of cheshire is seen on the other side a hilly tract woodless and dreary chequered with cornlands and black heaths yet formerly was so well clothed as to occasion this proverbial distich  from blacon point to hilbree a squirrel might leap from tree to tree the view of this branch of the sea terminates on one end with chester and the rock of beeston on the other with the two little islands of hilbree or ilbre on one had been a cell of benedictines dedicated to our lady and depqndent on chester this possibly was the hermitage called hilburghy which in the second of edward iii received ten shillings a year from an old charity belonging to the castle at chester janner      the tides recede here so very far as to deny us any variety of fish the species most plentiful are of the flat kind such as flounders a few plaice small soles and rays dabs visit us in november and in the last year was taken that rare species or flounder the whiff whose figure is given in the annexed plate the weever is very common here other species are taken accidentally  the herring in this sea is extremely desultory at times they appear in vast shoals even as high as chester arrive in the month of november and continue till february and are followed by multitudes of small vessels which enliven the channel great quantities are taken and salted but are generally shotten and meagre it is now about ten years since they have paid us a visit  excepting the caryocatactes or nutbreaker corvus caryocatactes lin syn     de buffon iii     gesner av     scopoli    kramer     br zool ii      i do not recollect any very uncommon bird to have visited this parish one of this species was killed in the garden at mostyn in october      its native country is savoy switzerland lorraine and some parts of germany these birds do not regularly migrate but in a certain period quit their usual habitations for example in october      multitudes appeared in burgundy and other parts of france the one that visited us was probably a strayed bird out of some flock that had quitted its native land it is a species of some beauty yet without variety or richness whiff of colors being spotted with triangular marks of pure white in rusty brown in size it is somewhat inferior to a jackdaw the bill very strong sharp and fitted for the piercing of trees which makes it very destructive to timber it inhabits the vast forests of firs from which it has been styled pica abietum guttata like the jackdaws it also nestles in lofty towers and like them is very noisy its food is nuts which it breaks with its bill the cones of firs acorns berries and insects from the first circumstance the germans have named it nussbretcher a name adopted in the british zoology  on crossing a little rill beneath the banks i enter the parish of holywell and very soon after cross its noted stream near its discharge into the estuary of the dee on the right ascend to the site of the abbey and castle of basingwerk a place of importance in the wars between the english and the welsh the land toward the sea is steeply sloped the west side was protected by a deep gully formed by the river the southeast by the vast ditch which has hitherto been universally supposed to have been that made by offa king of the mercians i owe the detection of that mistake to mr john evans of llwyn y groes this gentleman is now engaged in an actual survey of north wales and of publishing a large map of that part of the principality a work extremely worthy of public encouragement a farther account of the plan will be printed in the last page of this volume  who proves it to be one termination of another stupendous work of the same kind known by the name of wats ditch of which a full account will be given in some of the following pages with remarks on the mounts and other works that lie near its course  the only vestige of this fortress appears in the foundation of a wall on the edge of offas ditch basingwerk castle lord lyttelton hist henry ii  d edit ii     says that the founder was an earl of chester i imagine that it must have been richard son of hugh lupus and second earl of chester and that the abbey was fortified on the following occasion for even religious institutions had no exemption tempore necessitatis belli licitum est hospitari et incastellari in ecclesia innocentius de immunitate ecclesiae quoted in coll curious discourses i  0    accordingly the first notice i find of it is in the life of st werburg by bradshaw who informs us that richard on his return out of normandy where he had been educated began his reign with an act of piety he attempted in      a pilgrimage to the well of st wenefrede but either in going or returning was attacked by the welsh and obliged to take shelter in basingwerk he applied to st werburg for relief who miraculously raised certain sands between flintshire and wiral and thus gave means to his constable to pass to his assistance which sands from that time were called the constables sands bradshaw styles the place of his retreat an abbey a proof that here had been a religious community before the time usually assigned for the foundation of this house i must also draw from lord lytteltons authority for i can find no other that this castle was demolished by the welsh in the reign of stephen hist henry ii   henry ii in      after his escape from the ambuscade of eulo left basingwerk restored well fortified and manned mparis      in order to secure a retreat on any future disaster he did the same by the cast of rudland in his days the inland parts of our county were a dangerous wild of forest after his defeat he never trusted himself among our woods but made his marches along the open shores  the same monarch left another species of garrison powel  0   for he established here a house of knights templars a military order introduced into england in the preceding reign they were first instituted in the holy land for the protection of pilgrims and possibly henry might have the same view in fixing them here to secure the english devotees in performing their vows to our neighboring saint who seems about this time to have come into reputation it is singular that these religious knights were allowed at their institution only one horse between two yet so greatly did they flourish that about the year    0 or a hundred and fifty years after their institution the order had acquired in different parts of christendom nineteen thousand manors  this castle was but of very short duration for in      the gallant prince owen gwynedd laid siege to it took the same     and levelled it to the ground after which the name occurs no more as a fortress i think at this period it belonged to hugh de bello campo or beauchamp on whom this and rudland castle had been bestowed by the english monarch annals waverleienses       the abbey called also by the welsh maesglas or greenfield  abbey of which there are some considerable remains was founded in      according to the opinion of bishop tanner by randle the second earl of chester according to bishop fleetwood by henry ii for my part i believe it to be of greater antiquity but do not pretend to derive its origin no light into the matter can be collected from the charters preserved by sir william dugdale there are three of them either serving to confirm the ancient donations or confer new in each is mention of the earl as a benefactor but there is not the left hint of his having been the founder i must attribute that honor to one of the princes of wales for both lhewelyn ap jorwerth and his son david in their respective charters recite that they give and confirm the several donations to god st mary the monastery of basingwerk and the monks which had been bestowed on them by their predecessors for the salvation of their souls  randal was certainly a great benefactor for it appears that before his days the monks had only a chapel here from that period it became considerable and about that time part of the present buildings were erected for the convenience of its inhabitants who were of the cistorcian order  the architecture is mixed here appears what is called saxon having the round arches and short columns in some parts and the  basingwerk abpry   gothic narrow slips of highpointed windows in others the first species had not fell out of use and the last was coming into fashion in the days of the first great benefactor  the church lay on the east side but is now totally destroyed the refectory is pretty entire and on one side has a great recess with two round arches and a plain in front  above were the cells for the lodgings of the monks with a small window to each  the chapel of the knights templars is a spacious building the windows are long narrow and pointed the pilasters between them on the inside slender and elegant  there are some remains of offices used at present by a tanner within less than fifty years much of the habitable part was standing and sometimes used by the worthy family the mostyns of trelacre a lady now living was born within the walls  during the preparations for the conquest of wales by edward i the abbey was under the protection of the english there are extant two orders for the purpose providing that they had no commerce with what are styled the welsh rebels ayloffs rotuli walliae        i imagine that the convent was firmly attached to the victor for i have been informed that there are among the lists of summons in the tower writs for calling the abbot to parliament in the   d   th   th   d and   th of edward i  according to the valuation of its revenues in      the gross sum at the

as william peverel held the same in the time of henry his grandfather the same charter confirms the donations of ranulph carl of chester and other barons viz holywell fulbrook the chapel of basingwerst the ancient residence of the monks with the mills and their appertenances likewise holes and a moiety of lecche and one hundred shillings of the revenues of chester the gift of the said earl calders with its inhabitants and finally kethlenedei the gift of robert banastre  lhewelyn ap jorwerth prince of wales and cotemporary with henry iii confirms all the donations of his ancestors particularly the site of their house the mill before their gate and the land before their doors which last was granted to them by ranulphus and his brother aeneas the same grant gives them also the land of meredeth wawor in holywell fulbrook a community of pasturage on the mountains hanot de le weceb and creicgraft with all their appertenances his son and successor david by another charter confirms the donations of his father and adds the lands of huttred brother to meredeth wawor of holywell the grange of fulbrook the church of holywell and the chapel of clsul and the land and pasturage     of gelli before granted by his father he likewise empowers them to buy and sell every thing tollfree in all his territories for the use of their house also the fifth part of the fish taken in his fisheries at rudland and the tenth of the fish belonging to him in other parts he confirms to them all the village of wenhewm with all its inhabitants and appertenances being the gift of howen de porkenton and confirmed by helyso he at the same time confirms the lands and pasturage in penthlin the gift of his father  this charter is dated from coleshill in    0 and witnessed by hugh bishop of st asaph and his chancellor the famous ednyfed vychan and others  tanner notitia     mentions the tithes of blackbrook and the wood of langdon lands in chanclesworth the manor of west kirkby in cheshire the silver mine near basingwerk free warren in gethli menegrange ouregrange beggerburgh and holywell  the abbey also was possessed of the hospital or chapel of sponne near coventry which had been originally founded by hugh ceveilioc earl of chester who probably bestowed it on these monks dugdales warwickshire i       the revenues of the abbot amounted in the whole reckoning rising

william mostyn esquire of trelacre conveyed it into that family in which it now remains  i cannot recover the names of any more than two of the abbots both of the same with my own thomas ap dafydd pennant presided over the house in the time of guttun owain a bard who flourished in the year    0 and celebrates the hospitality of the abbot in some verses printed in the collection of mr rhys jones the poet is so liberal of his praise as to say that he gave twice the treasure of a king in wine  er bwrw yno aur brenin of a roes deuswy ar win he speaks also of his works of utility of the water and of the windmills he erected neither is he silent on a subject pleasing to every welsh ear the pedigree of his patron whom he derives from edwin and from elidir ap rhys sais a direct descendant from

near the ruins of the house is called the abbots and is supposed to be his cotemporary  the road from hence is remarkably picturesque along a little valley bounded on one side by hanging woods beneath which the stream hurries toward the sea unless where interrupted by the frequent manufactories its origin is discovered at the foot of a steep hill st wenefredes well beneath the town of holywell or trefynnon to which it gave the name the spring boils with vast impetuosity out of a rock  st wenefreds well moss and seal   and is formed into a beautiful polygonal well covered with a rich arch supported by pillars the roof is most exquisitely carved in stone immediately over the fountain is the legend of st wenefrede on a pendent projection with the arms of england at the bottom numbers of fine ribs secure the arch whose intersections are coupled with some sculpture  some are mere works of fancy grotesque figures of animals but the rest allude chiefly to the stanley family this building and the chapel over it rose from the piety of that great house who left these memorials of their benefactions there are besides some marks of illustrious donors for example the profile of margaret mother to henry vii and that of her husband the earl of derby cut on the same stone  the compliments to the stanlies are very frequent the wolfs head is the arms of the earls of chester it is enclosed in a garter in respect to sir william stanley knight of that order who had been chamberlain of that city and justiciary of north wales the tun with a plant issuing out of it is a rebus the arms of his wife elizabeth hopton allusive to her name this proves that the building was erected before      in which year sir william lost his head the other badges of the same house are the stags head the eagles leg and the three legs the arms of the isle of man  we also find that catherine of arragon widow to prince arthur and afterward the unfortunate wife of his brother henry viii was a benefactress to this building at lest her arms appear here three pomegranates in a shield surmounted with a crown the badge of the house of granada in memory of the expulsion of the moors by her father ferdinand sandfords geneal      the eagle seems also to belong to her being one of the supporters of the arms of her family  over one of the lesser arches on each side of the well are the dragon and grehound the supporters of the arms of england during the reign of henry vii and part of that of henry viii the first was born by henry vii as a badge of the house of tudor which derived itself from cadwalader last king of britain who bore on his ensign a red dragon henry in imitation of him at the battle of bosworth carried on his standard a red dragon painted on white and green silk which afterward gave rise to the office of rouge dragon among the heralds  on one side of a wall that supports the roof was painted the tale of the tutelar saint at present almost defaced over it is inscribed in honorem sanctae wenefredae v and m  in another wall is an elegant nich in which stood a statue of the virgin mary pulled down as i have been informed in the year       i have also heard that there had been another of st wenefrede to grace the image on high festivals it is probable that isabel countess of warwick widow to the great richard beauchamp left to st wenefrede in      her gown of russet velvet dugdales warwickshire i       over this spring is a chapel chapel of the same date with the other building a neat piece of gothic architecture but in a very ruinous state this had been a free chapel in the gift of the bishop with the reserve of a stipend to the chapter but the rest of the offerings were to be expended on the chapel in richard iiis time the abbot and convent had from the crown ten marks yearly for the sustentacione and salarie of a priest at the chapelle of st wynesride harleian mss no          the chapel is the property of john davies esquire of llanerch the well is common for i find by a decision of the court of chancery on a lawsuit respecting the lordship of holywell between sir john egerton knight and john eldred chancellor ellesmere decrees that on calling to mind that within the said manor there is a fountain or well of ancient and worthy memory he does not think fit that the petitioner or any other should have the property thereof notwithstanding the general words of the grant of the manor and therefore his lordship does order that notwithstanding the said grant that the well shall continue as now it is or heretofore has been saving to the petitioner and his heirs and assigns the benefit of the stream and watercourse with the appertainances  there are two different opinions about the origin of this stream one party makes it miraculous the other assert it to be owing only to natural causes the advocates for the first deliver their tale thus  in the seventh century lived a virgin of the name of wenesrede of saint wing frede of noble parents her fathers name was thewith a potent lord in the parts where holywell now stands her mothers wenlo descended from an ancient family in montgomeryshire and sister to st beuno beuno assumed the monastic habit retired to clynnog in caernarvonshire where he built a church and founded a convent after completing this work of piety he visited his relations in flintshire and obtaining from his brotherinlaw a little spot at the foot of the hill on which he resided erected on it a church and took under his care his niece wenefrede a neighboring prince of the name of cradocus son of king alen was struck with her beauty and at all events determined to gratify his desires he made known his passion to the lady who affected with horror attempted to escape the wretch enraged at the disappointment instantly pursued her drew out his sabre and cut off her head cradocus instantly received the reward of his crime he fell down dead and the earth opening swallowed his impious corpse hidgen in his polychronicon

years she died at gwytherin in denbighshire where her bones rested till the reign of king stephen when after divine admonition they were surrendered to the abbey of st peter and st paul at shrewsbury the memory of the two great events that of her first death is celebrated on the   d of june that of her translation the  d of november  a fraternity and gild was established in honor of our faint at

as sanative as those of the pool of bethesda all infirmities incident to the human body met with relief the votive crutches the barrows and other proofs of cures to this moment remain as evidences pendent over the well the saint is equally propitious to protestants and catholics for among the offerings are to be found these grateful testimonies from the patients of each religion  the holy father gave all encouragement to the piety of pilgrims to frequent this fountain pope martin v seldens notes on michael drayton      in the reign of henry v furnished the abbey of basingwerk with pardons and indulgences to sell to the devotees these were renewed again in the reign of queen mary by the interest of thomas goldwell bishop of st asaph powels notes on girald cambr     mr addison says he saw his picture at ravenna in the convent of theatins among the eminent men of that order  who fled into italy on the accession of elizabeth multitudes of offerings flowed in marks of gratitude from such who had received benefit by intercession of the virgin  the resort of pilgrims of late years to these fontanalia has considerably decreased the greatest number are from lancashire in the summer still a few are to be seen in the water in deep devotion up to their chins for hours sending up their prayers or performing a number of evolutions round the polygonal well or threading the arch between well and well a prescribed number of times few people of rank at present honor the fountain with their presence a crowned head in the last age dignified the place with a visit the prince who lost three kingdoms for a mass paid his respects on august   th      to our saint and received as a reward a present of the very shift in which his great grandmother mary stuart lost her

supposed with blood of thammuz yearly wounded we whose ancestors between two and three centuries ago abridged our faith to the mere contents of the old and new testament and to the creed called the apostles do not think the belief in the above and other legends requisite i refer the reader to the arguments used by the antiquary doctor powel in his notes on the itinerary of giraldus cambrensis and to bishop fleetwoods annotations on the life of the saint for proofs against the truth of the tale but with protestants and temperate catholics it carries with it selfconfutation  the waters are indisputably endowed with every good quality attendant on cold baths and multitudes have here experienced the good effects that thus result from natural qualities implanted in the several parts of matter by the divine providence in order to fulfill his will heaven for a short period deigned to convince a dark and obdurate age with a series of miracles which were delivered down to succeeding times as incontestible proofs of the reality of the divine mission without them a sufficient ground of trust and reliance upon the supreme being has long since been established second causes innumerable are dispersed throughout the universe subordinate to the first every element proves to us a medicine or a bane as suits his unerring dispensation we cannot want we cannot have the mediation of poor departed mortals the supposition would be bestowing on them the attributes of the deity omnipresence and omniscience  some eminent botanists of my acquaintance have reduced the sweet moss mosses and the bloody stains to mere vegetable productions far from being peculiar to our fountain the first is that kind of moss called a jungermannia imperfectly described and figured by dillenius in his history of mosses which has induced us to give a new engraving of it this species is also found in another holy well in caernarvonshire called ffynnon llandeniolen in a parish of the same name  the other is a byssus likewise odoriferous common to lapland and to other countries besides our own it adheres to stones in form of fine velvet linnaeus calls it byssus jolithus sp pl ii      fl lap     no      or the violetsmelling he says the stone to which it adheres easily betrays itself by the color being as if smeared with blood and if rubbed yields a smell like violets micheli in his genera of plants mentions the same genesis   0 tab    fig    and schwenckselt discovered it among the vegetables of silesia he calls it a muscus subrubeus and informs us that the smell is grateful to the heart and that if put among clothes it gives them a good scent and serves to drive away moths cat stirp etc silesiae      linnaeus says as quoted by baron halier no  0 0  that it is of use in eruptive disorders  above the well stands the church dedicated to st wenefrede the parish wakes are celebrated in november the time of her translation the living before the dissolution belonged to the abbey of basingwerk and is a vicarage in the gift of jesus college oxford which nominates and john davies esquire of llanerch the layrector presents  above the church is a hill called bryn y castle narrow and very steep on the sides projecting at the end over the little valley on this might have stood the castle of treffynnon or st wenefrede built by randle iii earl of chester in the year    0 powel      there are not at present any vestiges left  it is singular that no mention is made in the doomsday book of either chapel church or well yet townships now of less note are named such as brunford caldecote and others notwithstanding bishop fleetwoods opinion i think the legend of st wenefrede was known previous to that survey for the very name of holywell is saxon probably bestowed on it before the conquest on account of the imputed sanctity of the well  the spring is certainly one of the finest in these kingdoms and by the two different trials and calculations lately made for my information is found to fling out about twentyone tons of water in a minute it never freezes or scarcely varies in the quantity of water in droughts or after the greatest rains after a violent fall of wet it becomes discolored by a wheyey tinge  the stream formed by this fountain runs with a rapid course to the sea which it reaches in little more than a miles distance the industry of this century has made its waters of much commercial utility the principal works on it at this time are battering mills for copper a wiremill coarse paper mill snuffmill a foundery for brass and at this time a cotton manufactory is establishing the success of which will be an extensive blessing to the neighborhood  during the reign of pilgrimages nothing but a cornmill or two the property of the monks found employ for this beneficial stream  the town was also very inconsiderable till the beginning of this century the houses few and those for the most part thatched the streets unpaved and the place destitute of a market the flourishing mines that for some time were discovered in the neighborhood made a great change in the appearance and introduced the effects of wealth the town or rather township contains somewhat more than two thousand souls  the monks of basingwerk obtained for it the grant of a fair and a market the first has been dropped beyond the memory of man the market was also lost till it was renewed by letters patent dated jan  0th   0  granted to sir john egerton baronet the patent also contains a grant of three fairs viz on the   d of april the tuesday in easter week and the  d of september the market has been the most flourishing in north wales but the fairs never could be established  the situation of the town is pleasant and healthy on the back is a lofty hill at times extremely productive of lead ore toward the sea is a pretty valley bounded by woods the end finishes on one side with the venerable abbey to such who reque the use of a coldbath few places are more proper for besides the excellence of the waters exceeding good medical assistance and comfortable accommodations may be found here and the mind entertained and the body exercised in a variety of beautiful rides and walks  my next visit was to flint i took the lower road by the shore blackened with the smoke of smeltinghouses and in the more flourishing times of the collieries with vast stacks of coal the last township in hoywell parish on this side is that of coleshill coleshill which gives name to a hundred and was so called from its abundance of fossl fuel this place had at the conquest four villeyns two boors and a radman this last seems to have been the same with the rod or radknights who by the tenure of their lands were bound to ride with or for their lord as often as his affairs required  after crossing a small brook enter the town of flint flint a place laid out with great regularity but the streets far from being completed the removal of the greater and the lesser sessions and its want of trade will be farther checks to its improvement this town gave name to the county which with that of caernarvon merioneth and anglesey composed the four ancient north welsh shires formed by edward i immediately after the conquest of our principality i cannot assign any derivation of the word our county is totally destitute of the fossil usually so called i can only remark that it is purely saxon and notwithstanding it is not mentioned in the doomsday book was called so before the conquest  this place also seems to me to have been the same with what was named colsul or coleshill i can find no other site for the chapel of colsul granted by david ap llewelyn to the abbey of basingwerk the present flint probably went at this period under both names there is no trace of any chapel in the neighborhood excepting this nor any other place of consequence enough to tempt our princes to live at it was called in the doomsday book coleselt and was possessed by robert of rudland edwin held it from him and as a freeman here was one hide of land taxable  the whole place appears to have been founded in times of danger and every provision made against an attack from a people recently subdued and who had submitted reluctantly to a foreign yoke the town is formed on the principle of a roman encampment being rectangular and surrounded with a vast ditch and two great ramparts with the four regular portae as usual with that military nation i shall hereafter give a conjecture of the probability of its having been a roman station  the public buildings within this precinct are the church the town hall and the jail not one of which is any ornament to this little capital the church or rather chapel is dedicated to st mary and is only a perpetual curacy under northop i imagine this to have been the capella de colsul dugdale monast i   0  belonging to the abbey of basingwerk mentioned in the charter of david ap llewelyn at lest i can trace no other flint in that time was probably comprehended under the name of colsul  the castle stands on a low freestone rock that juts into the sands a little northeast of the town and was once joined to it by a bridge which led to the outwork called the barbican a square tower with a gateway now entirely demolished within was a court surrounded with a ditch faced with a wall that joined by means of a drawbridge to the main fortress whose entrance for better security was little more than a postern  the castle is a square building with a large round tower at three of the corners and a fourth a little disjoined from the other and much larger than the rest this is called the double tower  flint castle   it had been joined to the castle by a drawbridge and is of great thickness it has a circular gallery beneath vaulted with four arched openings into a central area a little more than twentytwo feet in diameter in one part the gallery is suddenly lowered and goes sloping toward the castle and then rising upwards makes a sort of communication with an upper gallery  this was the keep or strong part of the castle and the same that the french call le dongeon to which as froissart informs us the unfortunate richard ii retired as the place of greatest security when he was taken by bolingbroke  the channel of the dee at present is at some distance from the walls but formerly flowed beneath there are still in some parts rings to which ships were moored  the founder of this castle is uncertain cambden attributes it to henry ii and his noble hisstorian lord lyttelton is of the same opinion after his escape at euloe it is possible that he might have begun a fortress here for security in future times that he might have left it incomplete and that it was finished by edward i the rolls of the last reign mention the place several times  in the year      there was an order for proclaming a market and fair to be held at flint and the same was afterward done through cheshire and the cantreds of wales  in    0 appears an order for the custody of the gate of the castle of flint perhaps this might have been the year in which it was first garrisoned  in      the town received its first charter was made a free borough and the mayor sworn faithfully to preserve its liberties this is dated at flint on the  th of september it was confirmed again in the  d and  d years of philip and mary and afterward in the   th of william iii  in      the burgesses also received a grant from edward of timber out of the woods of northop ledebroke the greater and lesser keldreston wolsynton weper and sutton in order to smelt their lead ore and at the same time a right of pasturage in the same woods  in    0 there is an order for superintending the works of this castle and those of rudland and chester places of the first importance on the borders of a newconquered country rotuli walliae      the first great event that occurs to me respecting this fortress is in the year    0 when the welsh wearied with the reiteration of oppression as a signal of general insurrection surprised the place     at the same time that david brother of llewelyn took hawarden and rees the son of malgon and griffith ap meredeth ap owen seized the castle of aberystwyth powel       here in      the infatuated son of our conqueror received from exile his imperious favorite piers gaveston who had

england dodridge       in this dollorous castle iii  as halle styles it was deposed the unfortunate monarch richard ii to this place he was inveigled by henry percy earl of northumberland with the assurance that bolingbroke wished no more than to be restored to his own property and to give to the kingdom a parliament northumberland with a small train first met richard at conway then on his return from ireland the king distrusted the earl who to remove all suspicion went with him to mass and at the altar took an oath of fidelity the king fell into the snare proceeded with the earl for some time till he perceived about the precipice of penmain rhos a large band of soldiers with the percy banners the king would have then retired but northumberland catching hold of his bridle forcibly directed his course the poor prince had just time to reproach him with his perjury telling him that the god he had sworn upon that morning would do him justice at the day of judgment carte ii      he caused the king to dine at rudland and conveyed him that night to flint the next morning he was astonished with the sight of a numerous army commanded by his rival in full march along the sands they soon surrounded the castle the prince descended from the keep this place in old writers is called the dongeon or donjon according to skinner turris mussima prpagnaculi ad ultimum receptum but the word being now entirely applied to the miserable hole in which captives are confined i shall still retain the term keep  to meet bolingbroke who fell on his knees and for a short space assumed a respectful appearance but he soon stung off the mask for with a high sharp voice say stow the duke badde bring forth the kings horses and then two little nagges not worth forty franks were brought forth the king was set on the one and the earl of salisbury on the other and thus the duke brought the king from flint to chester where he was delivered to the duke of glocesters son and to the earl of arundels son that loved him but a little for he had put their fathers to death who led him strait to the castle stows annals       if froissart may be credited richard did not experience the pang of ingratitude from man alone by a strange infection it seized the most faithful of the brute creation for his very dog deserted him and fawned on his rival bolingbroke as if he understood and predicted the misfortunes of his old master the story is so singular that i shall relate it in the words of his noble translator sir john bouchier lord berners fol cccxii  who speaking of the transactions in flint castle says  and as it was enfourmed me king richard had a grayhounde called mathe who always waited upon the king and would know no man else for when so ever the king did ride he that kept the grayhounde did let him lose and he would straight run to the king and fawn upon him and leap with his fore fete upon the kings shoulders and as the king and the earl of derby talked together in the court the grayhounde who was wont to leap upon the king left the king and came to the earl of derby duke of lancastre and made to him the same friendly countinaunce and chere as he was wont to do to the king the duke who knew not the grayhounde demanded of the king what the grayhounde would do cosyn quod the king it is a great good token to you and an evyll sign to me sir how know you that quod the duke i know it well quod the king the grayhounde makes you chere this dave as king of england as ye shall be and i shall be deposed the grayhounde has this knowledge naturallye therefore take him to you he will follow you and forsake me the duke understoode well those words and cherysshed the grayhounde who would never after follow king richard but followed the duke of lancastre  in the

and variety of antique instruments lately discovered by the workmen in the old washes of this and the next parish which prove that the romans made this their port for exporting the metal after it was

my memory recourse was had to the virgula divinatoria or divining rod which by powers sympathetic with the latent ore was to save the usual expenses of search and to point out the very spot where the treasures lay a foreign adventurer half knave half enthusiast made the trial but it proved as unfortunately unsuccessful to himself as to his admirers the instrument of the attempt was no more than a rod forked at one end to be cut in a planetary hour on saturns day and hour because saturn is the significator of lead jupiter venus sol and mercury were also concerned in the time of the operation jupiter or pars fortunae was to be in conjunction sextile or trine to the lord of the ascendent or second and the better if any reception happen but beware it be not by square or opposition for that

strongly down and seemed to feel the same attraction as is between iron and the magnet the sensible agricola speaks of this practice incidentally and gives a long account of the process but places no kind of faith in it assuring us that the skilful miner should follow the natural signs of the mineral veins and despise the use of these enchanted sticks he traces their origin from imposture the magicians of pharaoh made use of wands in their deception of the serpents minerva by virtue of a wand turned the aged ulysses into a young man and again to his former state circe by the magical powers

consequences of a defeat tributa et metalla et caeterae servientium panae tributes and mines and all the dire penalties of slavery agricola himself verifies the prophetic spirit of our brave chieftain by calling our mines the reward of victory these were to be worked not by the conquerors but by condemned criminals by slaves diodorus siculus lib v c   gives a melancholy account of these slaves whose state can only be paralleled by the poor indians in the mines of potost  and britons newly subjugated it is probable that when the island was entirely settled this badge of slavery was taken away and the miners were as before the arrival of the romans voluntary laborers  when the ore was got it was cleansed according to the modern method and smelted in a furnace plinii lib xxxiv c     and cast into forms very nearly resembling the common pigs of lead  of such roman pigs of lead i have seen three found in different parts of britain the one in hints common in the manor of ralph floyer esquire in the county of stafford in the year      it was found under ground at the depth of four feet its length is twentytwo inches and a half the weight a hundred and fiftytwo pounds about two pounds heavier than our common pigs of lead on the upper surface is a rim within that in raised capitals struck when the metal was hot is this inscription impxvesp viixtximpx vxcos or imperatore

of      conjectures it to have been a c made by the superintendant of the mine or furnace to show either that the pig had paid duty or was of due weight or of proper purity for my part i am of opinion that decea had once between it and the g the letter n which will render it deceang or de ceangis the place which produced the ore but by some accident that letter was defaced and the g left seemingly unconnected this explanation will fling light on certain pieces of lead described by cambden to be taken notice of a few lines lower  this curious antiquity is in the cabinet of mr green apothecary in litchfield whose collection merits the attention of the inquisitive traveller who may be assured of the most liberal reception from the worthy owner  in      two pigs of the same kind and of the same length were discovered on hayshaw moor in the manor of dacre in the west riding of yorkshire on the estate of sir john ingleby of ripley one is preserved by the family the other was presented to the british museum these also have an imperial inscription on the top imperatore caesare domitiano augusto consule septimum this was cast in the year    and under the same regulation the other pig which i saw at ripley hall has the same inscription and on one side the word brig signifying that it came from the country of the brigantes vide tab ix   in the time of cambden twenty pieces of lead similar to the above were found near halton in cheshire some inscribed imp domit aug c de ceang others imp vesp vii t imp v coss these have been supposed to commemorate a victory over the cangi but it is evident that they were nothing more than pigs of lead brought here for use or for transportation and i am farther satisfied that the ore which produced this lead was dug and smelted either in that part of flintshire anciently called tegangle or the summers residence of the cangi or ceangi or from the residence of the same order of people either in derbyshire or some neighboring county this gives reason to suspect that these cangi during their long vacant time might sometimes engage in mineral concerns and then the ore when smelted might receive the mark of the people from whom it was received the pig of lead in mr greens cabinet certainly came from the cangi of derbyshire  from the regulation mentioned by pliny and all these imperial inscriptions it is clear that the public took the mineral concerns into its own hands and had their stampmasters in proper places i cannot pretend to fix the period of the first establishment if the inscription to claudius cambden i    horsely      on a mass of lead found in henry viiis time near wokey hole in somersetshire be of the same kind with the former it must have been within the year    the time of his ninth tribuneship  the romans found such plenty of silver in the spanish mines that for some time they never thought it worth their labor to extract it from lead strabo lib iii p      in later times they discovered an ore that contained silver tin and lead and these three metals were smelted from it it appears that the first product was the tin the second the silver and what pliny calls galaena which was left behind in the furnace and seems to be the same with our litharge and being melted again became lead or as the ancients called it to distinguish it from white lead or tin black lead plinii lib xxxiv c      the british name of lead is lost the only word we have to express an ore is mwyn but the species is expressed by an adjunct as mwyn aur gold mwyn plwm lead ore both which were probably derived from the latin the romans made use of the word metallum to express ore as well as the metal fused from it the word minera is a word of a barbarous age and probably derived from our mwyn  i shall finish this account of the roman state of the lead concerns with observing that they appeared to have been well versed in metallurgy and to have had their smeltinghouses the ruder britons before their conquest by the romans had a very simple process they placed the ore in a hole in the ground and mixed it with wood which being fired proved sufficient to melt the lead out of the soft and kindly ores of this country a small gutter communicated with a second hole into which the metal ran from the first these artless slaghearths are very frequent in our county discovered by the quantity of scoria mixed with charcoal some of our modern smelters have endeavored to extract the remaining part of the metal from these slags but in vain the ancient smelters having so effectually done their business as not to have left behind sufficient to pay the expenses of a second operation the most that could be procured from a ton of slags amounting only to about a hundred and fifty pounds weight  i cannot tell what use the britons made of the metal excepting as an article of commerce i must not dare to assent to the tale of the venerable bede lib i c   p     who says that the stakes driven into the thames to obstruct the passage of caesar were wrapped round with lead the project was useless this expedient of the britons was temporary the stakes did not require such a covering to preserve them and the metal of lead was surely very improper to point them with  i am of opinion that there had been in our country a succession of founderies of lead from the time of the romans to the present at every period in which the civil commotions would permit them to be carried on the saxons worked the british mines as well as the romans and made frequent use of the lead in all works of ecclesiastial magnificence the cathedral of lindisfarn bid hist lib iii c    p     was roofed with lead by its bishop eadberct about the year     that of york was covered with the same metal by its great prelate

apud cambden script post bedem      i mention these circumstances merely to show that the saxons continued the business of smelting in the different parts of our island we are assured that there have been at different times smeltingworks for a century or two past in the parishes of flint and hawarden and at present there is one in use in each of them  i shall take this opportunity of mentioning incidentally the other minerals of greet britain taken notice of by the ancients either as articles of trade or matters of curiosity  tin was aot only the first metal in these islands which we read of tin but also the greatest object of commerce and which originally led to the discovery of great britain by the romans the mercantile phoenicians traded to the silley islands the cassiterides or land of tin from the port of cadiz four hundred years before christ the romans for a considerable space could not discover the place from whence the former procured the precious metal they attempted to detect the trade by following the course of a phoenician vessel but the master faithful to the interest of his country voluntarily run his ship ashore in another place preferring the loss of all rather than suffer a foreign nation to become partakers of so profitable a secret the public immediately compensated his loss out of its treasury this did but make the romans more eager after the discovery and after many trials succeeded publius crassus father of marcus crassus the triumvir who was praetor and governed spain for several years landed in the cassiterides and found the report of their riches verified strabo lib iii p     to  0    as soon as the romans made a conquest of the country they formed in the tin province camps and roads still visible and left behind vases urns

landsend and was not as some writers imagine limited by the western parts of somersetshire  it is not to be imagined that they could neglect a corner of our island productive of a metal so useful in mechanics as tin and which it yielded in such plenty as to receive from that circumstance the name so great was the intercourse that foreign nations had with the inhabitants bordering on belerium as to give them a greater scavoir vivre and more extensive hospitality than was to be found in other parts of the island they were equally expert in working the mines and preparing the ore which lay in earthy veins within the rocky strata they melted and purified it then cast it into rows of cubes and carried it to ictis the modern isle of wight from thence it was transported into gaul conveyed from

should never have believed it was possible that the britons could have neglected their rich mines of copper and have been obliged at first to have imported that metal perhaps the ore was less accessible and the art of fusion unknown for islands from their very situation must remain longer ignorant of arts than continents especially ours which lay far to the west of the origin of all science  strabo says that they imported works of brass but it is as certain that they afterward did themselves fabricate that metal into instruments the celts a british instrument was made in this

sorts of metals but mostly of gold being the easiest fused and most capable of an impression doctor borlase has preserved a series of these very early coins from the rudest and most unintelligible impressions to the period when the britons made an attempt to form a face on their coins all these are unlettered a proof of their antiquity and of their having been struck before their intercourse

with the romans they made an essay to imitate their manner of coining they put letters on them elephants and gryphons things they were before unacquainted with they were not suffered to make any progress in the art for as soon as their conquest was effected their coin was suppressed the learned have endeavored to trace these ancient moneys from the phoenicians but the comparison would not

halkin is a hamlet of a number of houses called the pentre or hamlet a name in wales common to all such assemblages of dwellings where there is no church to distinguish it from llan where the place of

to his ancestor sir richard grosvenour knight by charles i of all the mines of lead or rakes of lead within the hundreds of coleshill and rudland harleian mss no  00     these tracts were before set on leases for a certain term of years thus james i grants that term to richard gwynne on payment of the annual acknowlegement of sixtysix shillings and eight pence and a new one was granted in      by a warrant from lord treasurer weston to richard grosvenour esquire roger grosvenour his son and mr thomas gamul for their joint lives paying the usual rent and a fine of ten pounds ibid   i apprehend that this grant and another similar of the minerals in bromefield and yale made to the same gentleman are the first alienations of this nature from the crown which for many centuries after the conquest assumed the entire claim of all mines and minerals by virtue of the royal prerogative sir john pettus fodinae regales from p    to    has preserved a series of grants from the reign of edward i to that of henry vii in which they empower different persons to scarch for ore some of them are confined to particular counties others to the kingdom in general and the only prohibition is that of working beneath castles or houses in gardens or meadows the owners of which were to be indemnified in all damages they might sustain richard ii is the first prince who makes a general allowance in his letters patent to richard wake clerk for searching for mines of gold and silver in the county of devon for ten years the adventurer had power to dig paying damage to the owner of the ground as well within liberties as without and to pay onetenth of the profit to the holy church and a ninth into the exchequer  this is not the first instance of the application of the tithe of ore to religious uses edward i directs the same proportion to be paid to the parochial churches in wales out of the neighboring mines rotull wallia  sir joseph ayloffs     the abbey of basingwork had also a revenue arising from the same source tanners notit monast       i cannot find that the owner of the ground in case the mine was discovered in private property was permitted to have any share of the profit till the fifth of henry vi      when the duke of bedford regent of france received a ten years leaf of all the mines of gold and silver in the kingdom of england paying to holy church a tenth to the king a fifteenth and to the lord of the soil the twentieth part this allotment though final is a proof of the justice and moderation that guided the actions of the protector of henrys infant years  these regal grants were for every species of metal excepting iron for gold and silver copper tin and lead and all other metals containing gold and silver these two were the great object yet the grants do not preclude the royal clame to the baser kinds  during this reign the art of refining or the separation of metals from the ore was made the ground of an imposture common enough in after times there are not fewer than four instances of persons undertaking the transmutation of the baser metals into pure gold and silver each of whom received the royal protection rymers foedera xi          0  0  henry iv had passed an act that none shall use to multiply gold or silver nor use the craft of multiplication and if any the same do that he incur penalty of felony this was aimed at persons who under pretense of transmutation counterfeited the nobler metals but afterward it was found a check on the metallurgic art as it extended even to the punishment of any ingenious refiner who had discovered the method of getting more gold and silver out of the baser kinds than was known before which occasioned the repeal of the act in the first year of william and mary c  0  to prevent them from being interrupted in their operations for certain malevolent people supposed they used unlawful arts i e the art magic in a supersticious age this suspicion might have proved fatal to the projectors who wisely assumed the most religious term for their mystery to obviate the malice of their enemies the metals were not to be transmuted but transubstantiated ibid  for they had great reason to imagine that the believers of the word in the religious sense would hardly contradict the feasibility of the project in the temporal meaning besides they were to act under the guise of piety for the adept  must be bomo frugi a pious holy and religious man one free from mortal sin a very virgin ben jonsons alchemist  we hear nothing of the event of these undertakings but imagine they ended like all others of that nature the bubble did not die with this weak prince for in      we find that edward iv gave the same encouragement to one david beaupe and john merchant to have for four years facultatem et scientiam philosophiae artificialem naturalem generationis a mercurio in aurum faciendo et simili modo a mercurio in argentum the liberty of changing mercury into gold and silver rymer xii     we hear no more of these impostures till the reigns of elizabeth and james i when they were most successfully revived vide life of doctor dee ben jonsons alchemist etc   edward continued the mineral grants to several great men among others to the earl of warwick the earl of northumberland and his brother richard earl of gloucester the farm was now increased they were to pay the king an eighth neat profit the lord of the soil the ninth and the curate of the place the tenth  in the short and turbulent reign of richard iii no attention was paid to concerns of this kind but his successor henry vii in his very first year discovered his ruling passion avarice by immediately appointing jasper duke of bedford and several other persons of distinction to be governors of all his mines in england and in wales paying to the king the fifteenth moses stringer author of opera mineralia explicata calls it the fifth which suits better the character of that monarch of the pure gold and silver and to the lord of the soil the eleventh as it grows  elizabeth was the first of our princes who laid the foundation for our mineral success and for all the vast manufactures that arose in consequence i read that in      henry vi rymer xi      possibly on discovery of the imposture of metallic transmutations had sent for out of hungary austria and bohemia three experienced miners and thirty assistants to work his mines so unskilled were the english at that time the civil wars which broke out immediately after frustrated this wise measure elizabeth resumed it being too quicksighted not to see into the defects and wants of her kingdom she not only adopted it but improved on the plan our knowledge of minerals was almost extinguished and of course the manufactures which depended on them we imported our swords our knives stirrups bits and even our pins out of germany through the channel of the netherlands our works of brass and even our wire excepting a small quantity which was worked by hand were of foreign fabric the first step taken by this politic princess was to forbid the importation of these and several other articles from parts beyond sea statute  th elizabeth c    the next was to invite into her kingdom foreign miners foreign smelters and foreign artificers of metallic productions  she next formed a corporation under the title of the society for the mines royal the first governor was william earl of pembroke several men of rank were joined in the commission as assistants and several citizens and some foreigners of known experience in these matters she likewise framed the same members into another corporation which naturally depended on the former viz the society for the minerals and battery works these corporations were founded on may the   th       some progress had been made a few years before for the procuring materials for these new manufactures for in      she had granted the mines of eight counties besides those in wales to daniel houghsetter in      she made another grant to cornelius devosse and a third in the same year more comprehensive than all to christopher shutz of all mines minerals and subterraneous treasures except copperas and alum which shall be found in all other parts of england not mentioned in the former patent or within the english pale in ireland by the name of gold silver copper tin lead quicksilver cadmian ore or lapis calaminaris and all manner of ewres or oars simple or pure mixed or compounded for latten wire or steel etc to each of these patentees an englishman was joined  it is worth observing that the crown in most of these grants lays absolute clame to all mines whatsoever under a notion that they are royal mines yet the prerogative could only be entitled to such which yielded gold and silver the origin of this pretense arose from the kings right of coinage in order that he might have the requisite materials which would have confined him to the two noble metals but until the happy period arrived when our constitution was established and the royal and the private property justly distinguished the subject was too weak to assert his rightful clame elizabeth herself was too fond of the darling prerogative even with all her boasted love to her people to resign this part her patent to william humfrey and christopher shutz is worded in the most unlimited manner for it not only gave them power to sink shafts wheresoever they pleased gardens etc excepted but to build houses requisite to carry on the works not only upon the royal demesnes but in the grounds of any of her subjects the spirited percies in the person of thomas earl of northumberland first withstood this invasion of his right he contested with the crown the title to the copper mines in his manor of keswick but the lawyers decided against him alleging that although the crown had a power to grant away its manors it had not the power to alienate the mineral being perfectly linked to the prerogative of the crown  but as usual the gentlemen of the long robe had two opinions respecting this point some asserting that if any gold or silver was found in the mines of baser metal the whole would belong to the king which in fact was bestowing all the mineral property on the crown there being scarcely any base metal but what holds some particles of the nobler others again in a future reign qualified this by saying that although the gold or silver contained in the base metal of a mine in the hands of a subject be of less value than the base metal yet if the gold or silver do countervail the charge of resining it or be of more worth than the base metal spent in resining it this is a royal mine and as well the base metal as the gold and silver in it belong to the prerogative of the crown this opinion was given in    0      and subscribed by maynard glaw ville and others the first vers of the time   such was the state of the royal clame so discouraging to the industry of the subject till the great event of the revolution when the crown in the first year of william and mary fully gave up all pretensions to the mines of copper tin iron and lead notwithstanding gold or silver may be extracted from them in any quantities by a following act this right was again confirmed only the crown reserved to itself a power of purchasing within thirty days after raising all ores made merchantable at the following rates copper at    l per ton tin at  0 l lead at   l and in default of such payment the owners were at liberty to dispose of their ore as they pleased thus as mr blackston commentaries   to i     observes the private owners were not discouraged from working mines through a fear that they may be clamed as royal neither does the king depart from the just rights of his revenue since he may have all the precious metal contained in the ore paying no more for it than the value of the base metal is supposed to be to which base metal the landowner is by reason and law entitled  some account of the ores and fossils of the mineral tract which gave rise to this digression will be given when i cross it again in the course of my journey  from pentre halkin i pursued

whence our ancient heroes might deliver their araith or allocutio to animate their followers against the invading strangers this post is called moel y gaer or the hill of the fortress a name common to several others of similar use this seems to have been an out post of the ordovices in order to defend their country against the roman invaders we shall toward the end of the volume have occasion to mention the chain of posts along the clwydian hills from that next to the sea to remote and internal parts our ancestry disputed the possession of their country by inches here they lodged their wives and children to these places they drove their cattle out of the low country they established in each numerous garrisons ready to sally forth and repel the foe or to defend all that was dear to them

half of one belonging to the latter half an acre of meadow a wood two leagues long and half a league broad the whole was valued at forty shillings yet on all this were but four villeyns six boors and four slaves so low was the state of population  it is probable roman that this place had been a british post opposed to the country of the cornavii and to the invading romans to the west of the church in a field adjoining to the road is a mount called trumans hill within a piece of ground which appears to have been squared and nicely sloped this evidently had been a small camp whose figure has been much obliterated by the frequency of agriculture it stood on the brow of the hill and commanded a full view of the country another mount called connas he is to be seen near broadlane house the roast an eminence overlooking another flat with fosses and an exploratory mount lying in the parish of gresford was another and at caerestyn a fourth we shall find occasion to speak more of these in the

their residence cambden ii       genealogists collins peerage i    tell us that roger fitzvalerine son of one of the noble adventurers who followed the fortunes of william the conqueror possessed this castle and having frequent contests with the welsh often saved himself by retreating to it and from that circumstance it was called howards den but with high respect to all the blood of all the howards it does not appear that their name was then known with more probability does their historian say that william the son of fitzvalerine received the addition of de haward or howard from the accident of being born in this place  on the extinction of the ancient earls of chester to prevent that honor from being according to the expression of the time parcelled out among distaffs this as

nothing more of this place till the year      the first of edward iii dugdale baron i      when robert the last baron of montalt for want of issue passed this manor and his other great possessions to isabel the queen mother but on her disgrace it fell again to the crown  in      the king granted the stewartship of chester granted to the earl of salisbury with hawarden etc to william montacute earl of salisbury but as isabel retained a lifeinterest in the grant he procured her release of it for the sum of six hundred marks it continued in his family till the death of his great nephew john earl of salisbury who was beheaded by the townsmen of cirencester after an unsuccessful insurrection in   00 in favor of richard ii his deposed master salisbury had before granted his estates in fee to thomas mountague dean of sarum lodowick de clifford john venour and richard hertcombe and their heirs but after his attainder by act of parliament  th henry iv they became forfeited to the king  in      it was granted      by patent from henry iv to his second son thomas duke of clarence but in      the  d of henry v thomas earl of salisbury son to john petitioned for annulling the former sentence his suit was referred to another parliament and then dismissed henry then made to clarence another grant in which the former was declared to be invalid in this the advowson of the living is also given  clarence was slain at the battle of baugy    0 in    0 and died without issue hawarden returned to henry v and from him to his son henry vi who in      to sir thomas stanley granted it to sir thomas stanley comptroller of his household and to the heirs male of his body but in    0 it was resumed and in the next year granted together with mold to edward prince of wales on this occasion john hertcombe clamed hawarden as heir to the last survivor of the four feoffees he alleging that john earl of salisbury was not possessed of hawarden at the time of his forfeiture and on this plea obtained a privy seal to enquire into it an inquisition was taken his plea was found to be good and restitution was made this john hertcombe levied a fine to sir richard strangeways knight etc and john needham to the use of john needham and his heirs  in      a fine was levied to richard nevill earl of salisbury and alice his wife daughter to thomas montacute the great earl of salisbury and sir thomas stanley knight afterward lord stanley he had married elinor daughter of richard earl of warwick  to the use of thomas stanley and the heirs male of his body on condition that if thomas stanley do fell or suffer discontinuance or if he die without issue male it is lawful for the said richard earl of salisbury or the heirs of alice his wife to reenter on the death of lord stanley the fee descended to his son and heir thomas afterward earl of derby and after his decease to his second wife margaret countess of richmond and mother to henry vii that monarch in      honored the place with a visit and made some residence here for the amusement of stag hunting but his primary motive was to soothe the earl her husband after the ungrateful execution of his brother sir william stanley  on the death of margaret hawarden desended to thomas earl of derby granson to the late earl and continued in his family till the execution of the gallant james earl of derby in      soon after his death it was purchased from the agents of sequestration by sergeant glynne on the restoration the lords made an order on the   th of july    0 that the earl of derbys and several other lords estates which had been sold in the late usurpation without their consents should be repossessed by them without molestation drakes parlem hist xxii      this induced glynne to make an offer to the earl of the surrender of hawarden for a lease of three lives account communicated to me by sir john glynne  the proposal was either rejected or not immediately accepted the consequence of which was the loss of the whole to the derby family the lords resentful of the indignities their order had experienced in the late troubles began with an attempt to obtain reparation to one of the greatest sufferers in the december of the same year they sent down to the commons a private bill for the restoring to charles earl of derby all the manors lands etc which belonged to his late father this was strongly opposed and the bill was laid aside without drake xxiii  0 ever coming to a second reading drake xxiii     the earl was then glad to compound with the sergeant for the property of this place and granted it to him and his heirs in whom it still remains  it appears by these proceedings as if the parliament was fearful of the consequences of even an act of justice for during the long troubles there had been such vast change of property effected by fuch variety of means that it was apprehended that the enquiry into the causes and the dispossession of numbers who had quietly enjoyed such property from their fathers might be attended with the most inflammatory consequences it is likewise probable that many of the members might be interested in the event therefore were determined to stop at once any proceeding that might tend to affect the fortunes of themselves or friends numbers of sales were made by the loyalists themselves under the influence of fear they were content to receive a trifle for the purchase rather than lose the whole by violence for there were very few who had not incurred a praemunire under the ruling powers which they were glad to get clear of by a seemingly voluntary sale when they were thus disappointed in the hope of reenjoyment of their fortunes they laid the blame on the king and invented the calumny of his rejecting this bill after it had been passed unanimously by both houses  during the civil wars this cattle suffered the usual vicissitudes of fortune it was firft possessed by the parliament and kept for its use till the year      besieged in      at which time a cessation of arms being agreed to on the part of the king with the irish rebels a number of the forces were drawn from ireland and landed at mostyn in this county in the month of november these were immediately employed to reduce the castle of hawarden the garrison received by a trumpet a verbal summons which gave occasion to the following letters between lieutenant colonel marrow and john warren and alexander elliot the commanders on the part of the parliament i omit the immediate answer to the summons written in the religious strain affected by the party which marrow replies to like a true cavalier  gentlemen it is not for to hear you preach that i am sent here but in his majestys name to demand the castle for his majestys use as your allegiance binds you to be true to him and not to enveigle those innocent souls that are within with you so i desire your resolution whether you will deliver the castle or no   the rejoinder from the castle was to this effect  sir we have cause to suspect your disaffection to preaching in regard we find you thus employed if there be innocent souls here god will require their blood of them that shed it we can keep our allegiance and the castle too and therefore you may take your answer as it was in english plain enough before we can say no more but gods will be done rustworth ii part iii  00    these letters had at the time but little

obstinate commandants  gentlemen i presume you very well know or have heard of my condition and disposition and that i neither give nor take quarter i am now with my firelocks who never yet neglected opportunity to correct rebels ready to use you as i have done the irish but loath i am to spill my countrymens blood wherefore by these i advise you to your feilty and obedience toward his majesty and show yourselves faithful subjects by delivering the castle into my hands for his majestys use in so doing you shall be received into mercy etc otherwise if you put me to the least trouble or loss of blood to force you expect no quarter for man woman or child i hear you have some of our late irish army in your company they very well know me and that my firelocks use not to parley be not unadvised but think of your liberty for i vow all hopes of relief are taken from you and our intents are not to starve you but to batter and storm you and then hang you all and follow the rest of that rebellious crew i am no breadandcheese rogue but as ever a loyalist and will ever be while i can write or name  nov         thomas sandford captain of firelocks i expect your speedy answer this tuesday night at broadlane hall where i am now your near neighbor  to the officer commanding in chief at hawarden castle and his concerts there     all this eloquence would have been flung away had not more forces on the side of the king and want of provisions on that of the garrison cooperated with this valiant epistle so as rushworth says after a fortnights siege and much ink and little blood spilt the castle being in want of provisions was surrendered to sir michael earnley on condition to march out with half arms and two pair of colors one flying and the other furled and to have a convoy

parliament ordered to be dismantled dismantled with four other castles in this part of north wales whitelock     these orders extended only to the rendering it untenable but the farther destruction was effected by the owner sir william glynne the first baronet of the name between the years      and       the remains are a fine circular tower or keep described on the summit of a mount this alone is pretty entire nothing except this and a few walls and the foundations of some rooms exist at present which sir john glynne has with great pains laid open by the removal of the rubbish in one place was discovered a long flight of steps at the bottom of which was a door and formerly a drawbridge which crossed a deep long chasm nicely faced with freestone to another door leading to two or three small rooms probably they were places of confinement where prisoners might be lodged with the utmost security after pulling up the bridge over the deep chasm that intervened between them and open day  the several parts of this fortress seem to have been built at different times it is surrounded with deep fosses now filled with trees in      the timber of the park and demesne was valued at five thousand pounds and was sold in that century but the present owner will have the merit of restoring it manyfold to the next by the vast plantations he has made  the living is in the gift of the lord

and proves wills and has his court and his proctors  the living is at present eleven hundred pounds a year and in proportion as the subjacent lands are cultivated will experience a far greater

to any uses which any five with the consent of the lord shall agree on  in broadlane pictures the mansion house built by the present baronet in      are four portraits of great merit part of the collection of sir konelm digby they represent the evangelists with their respective attributes seemingly the production of valentine a irhman he died      a gentleman well skilled in prints tells me that these four pictures were engraven by rousselet  who studied the style of carravaggio these are in his best manner the attitudes are fine and the lights and shadows most admirably disposed they are half lengths a size that his great model excelled in  among the family portraits are two of the chief justice glyme the able political lawyer of the reign of charles i and the succeeding usurpation he was of the house of glynllivon in caernarvonshire which derives itself from cilmintroedddu or cilmin with the black foot one of the fifteen tribes and cotemporary with and nephew to merfyn frych prince of wales in the year      sir john glynne was born at glynllivon in the year   0  chief justice glynne his father was sir william glynne knight his mother a griffith of caernarvon his education was after the best mode his school was that of the college at westminster his academic learning was instilled into him at hartball oxford and his knowledge of the law at lincolns end where he became a bencher his abilities were immediately discovered by the popular party by whose influence he was made steward of westminster recorder of london and twice elected member for the former in the two parlements of    0 he was next to pym the most active manager against the earl of strafford the unfortunate peer remarked that glynne and maynard treated him like advocates palmer and whitelock like gentlemen and yet omitted nothing material that could be urged against him whitelock     the author of hudibras seems to catch at this part of the character of these two great lawyers  did not the learned glynne and maynard to make good subjects traitors strain hard in the case of strafford and in that of the impeachment of the twelve bishops they acted on principle this appears evident from the prosecution they afterward underwent for the noble stand they made against the ruin of the constitution planned and afterward effected by the army on september the  th      they were expelled the house committed to the tower and had a charge of high treason brought against them parliament hist xvi         glynne soon determined to submit to the rising powers in the next year he was restored to his place in the house appointed one of the ten  the justice glynne   commissioners for carrying on the treaty with the king in the isle of wight and voted by the house to be a sergeant at law in the new call it thought fit to make he as well as the artful whitelock evaded all concern in trial of the king but afterward temporized fully with the powers in being cromwell soon made him one of his council in      he was constituted chamberlain of chester in the following year was on the refusal of the chief justice rolls sent into the west with a commission to try colonel penruddock and the other insurgents athenae oxon ii      rolls lost his place for his scruples and in his room the sergeant was rewarded with the office of lord chief justice of the upper bench he was grateful to his patron for being appointed of the committee to receive the protectors scruples about being made king he urged the acceptance with the utmost zeal it is amusing to compare the change of sentiment from the year      when the kingly office was voted to be unnecessary burdensome and dangerous with the opinion of      when the learned sergeant tells cromwell that it is essential to the settlement of the nation parliament hist xxi  0  notwithstanding the usurper did not dare to assume the name he mimicked the powers and honored his advocate with calling him up by writ into his house of peers that motley assembly of the year      the prudent lawyer maintained his ground till the year of the restoration when by a masterpiece of cunning he published in octavo the arguments he had used to prevale with his former master to mount the throne under the title of monarchy asserted to be the best the most ancient and legal form of government how flattering must this have been to the rightful prince to find the ancient mode acknowleged as most eligible even after the long abuse of it in his family by one of the ablest supporters of the protectorate  whether this recommended him to the new government or whether he had made his peace before is not certain he was received by charles with distinguished marks of favor who not only knighted him but bestowed on him the honor of prime sergeant and even created his eldest son a baronet in the convention parliament he was elected for the county of caernarvon and was appointed one of the committee for examining the acts passed during the late usurpation which were inconsistent with the present government and how the many fines recoveries etc made in the late courts of law might be confirmed and rendered good he had likewise a concern in the act of general pardon and in all others in which the assistance of an able lawyer was requisite drakes parlem hist xxii       he retired from the house in the following parliament and lived till the year      when he died in london and was interred in his own vault beneath the altar of st margarets church westminster  from breadlane the land begins to slope toward the dee at the bottom between the fifth and sixth stone from chester lies breughten formerly the property of the ravenscrofts and afterward that of the hopes at the conquest it was called brochetune and was held of hugh lpus by robert de roelent or rudland levenot a freeman possessed it before robert also had a manor here once held by a saxon of the name of ulmer  close to the village of breton lies the large marsh of saltney which reaches within about a mile of chester it is at present divided by a most excellent road by whose side runs a small canal cut by sir john glynne for the conveyance of his coal into the dee near the city this tract was formerly granted by robert lord of mold to the monks of basingwerk for pasturage he also gave them the same privilege in hawarden and the liberty of cutting rushes for thatching their buildings harleian ms no  0      the principal part of this common lies in flintshire the boundary is marked by a stone near the east end it extends considerably on both sides from the right flows the leeches a small brook rising a little beyond doddleston that place lies out of my rout yet i mention it as the place of interment of that honest chancellor egerton lord ellesmere who preferred it out of affection to his mother a native of this village  another circumstance leads me to name this parish humiliating as it is to a welshman for at balderton bridge our countrymen met with a cruel defeat from hugh cyvelioc earl of chester who by way of trophy made a rampart of their heads  at the extremity of saltney within a mile of chester the land rises suddenly on the left hand of the ascent are considerable hollows with correspondent elevations one has the appearance of a round bastion which makes me conjecture that they might have been works designed to command this pass into the country of the ordovices for it points toward varis conovium and segontium  cheshire a part of the country of the cornavii chester commences on the flat beneath this bank the road is continued along the small common of overleigh and ends at hanbridge the suburbs of chester on this side of the river belonging to the parish of st mary  the access to the city is over a very narrow and dangerous bridge of seven irregular arches rendered more inconvenient by the ancient gateways at each end formerly necessary enough to prevent the inroads of my countrymen who often carried fire and sword to these suburbs which were so frequently burnt as to be called by the britons treboeth or the burnt town  i shall begin my account of this respectable city by declining the honor of asserting it to have been of british foundation notwithstanding i have the authority of ranulph the monk and of henry bradshaw another religious of this city  the founder of this city as faith polychronicon was leon gaure a mighty strong giant who builded caves and dungeons many a one no goodly building ne proper ne pleasant but king leir a britain fine and valiant was founder of chester by pleasant building and was named guerleir by the king brodshaws life of st werburg  yet this legend does not err greatly from the right name caer lleon caer lleon the camp of the legion caer lleon vawr ar ddyfr dwy the camp of the great legion on the dee being the head quarters of the twentieth legion styled also valeria and victrix this legion came into britain before the year    for it had share in the defeat of boadicea by suetonius after this victory the roman forces were led toward the borders of north wales probably into this county afterward by reason of the relaxed state of discipline a wing had been cut off by the ordovices just before the arrival of agricola but the quarters of these troops at this period are not exactly known it is probable that part at lest were on the deva that he collected a few of his forces and began his march against the enemy from this place and that after his successful expedition into mona mona etc he determined to six here a garrison as the fittest place to bridle the warlike people he was about to leave behind him in consequence he fixed part of the legion here and detachments in the neighboring posts before he ventured on the distant expedition to scotland into which he led part as appears from the inscriptions which prove that a vexillatio of this legion was concerned in building a portion of the roman wall in order to encourage the troops he left behind he formed here a colony and the place was styled from them and from its situation divanas colonia devana as is proved by the coin of septimus geta son of severus which was thus inscribed  col devana leg xx victrix it was also called simply deva and deva from the river which washe one side  the ancient hallowed dee the form of the city evinces the origin to have been roman fours chief streets being in the figure of their camps with four gates four principal streets and variety of lesser crossing the others at right angles dividing the whole into lesser squares the walls the precincts of the present city mark the limits of the ancient no part of the old walls exist but they stood like the modern on the soft freestone rock high above the circumjacent country and escarpe on every front  the structure of the four principal streets is without parallel they run direct from east to west and north to south and were excavated out of the earth and sunk many feet beneath the surface excavated the carriages are driven far below the level of the kitchens on a line with ranges or shops over which on each side of the streets passengers walk from end to end secure from wet or heat in galleries or row  as they are called purloined from the first floor of each house open in front and balustraded the backcourts of all these houses are level with the rows but to go into any of these four streets it is necessary to descend a flight of several steps  these rows appear to me to have been the same with the ancient vestibules and to have been a form of building preserved from the time that the city was possessed by the romans they were built before the doors midway between the streets and the houses and were the places where dependents waited for the coming out of their patrons de signif vocab   and under which they might walk away the tedious minutes of expectation plautus in the third act of his mostella describes both their situation and use  viden vestibulum ante aedes et ambulacrum ejusmodi the shops beneath the rows were the cryptae and apothecae magazines for the various necessaries of the owners of the houses  the streets were once considerably deeper as is apparent from the shops whose floors lie far below the present pavement in digging foundations for houses the roman pavement is often discovered at the depth of four feet beneath the modern the lesser streets and allies which run into the principal streets sloped to the bottoms of the latter as is particularly visible in were bridge street but these are destiture of the galleries or rows  it is difficult to assign a reason for these hollowed ways great vaults an ancient historian mentions the existence in his days of certain vaults and passages of which not a trace nor even the lest memory is left notwithstanding the most diligent search and enquiries have been made in this cite says the author of the polychronicen ben ways under earth with vowtes and stone work wonderly wrought three chambred works great stones i grave with old mens names therein there is also julius cezars name wonderly in stones grave and other noble mens names also with the writing about meaning the altars and monumental inscriptions but he probably mistakes the name of julius caesar for that of julius agricola to whom it is reasonable to suppose some grateful memorial was erected unless these hollowed streets were formed by the void left after the destruction of these great vaults i can no more account for their formation than for the place which those ancient souterrains occupied new lot none have ever been discovered by the frequent sinking of cellars for new buildings on the site of the old tradition has delivered no such accounts to us nor is their exit to be traced beneath the walls in any part of their circumference the only vaults now known are of a middle age and which belonged either to the hotels of the great men or to the religious houses dispersed through the city  of the four gates of the city east gate roman one of them the east gate continued till of late years of roman architecture and consisted of two arches much hid by a tower erected over it in the later days a few years ago it was pulled down on account of its straitness and inconveniency to give way to a magnificent gate which rose in its place by the munificence of lord grosvenor i remember the demolition of the ancient structure and on the taking down the more modern case of norman masonry the roman appeared full in view  it consisted of two arches formed of vast stones fronting the eastgate street and the forest street the pillar between them dividing the street exactly in two the accurate representation    of them by mr wilkinson of this city will give a stronger idea of them than words can convey as also of the figure of the roman soldier placed between the tops of the arches facing the forest street  this species of double gate was not unfrequent the porta esquilina montfaucon iii part ii p      and the port portese nardini roma anticha p    at rome were of this kind flores in his medals of the roman colonies in spain p     tab xxixxiixxiii  exhibits one on the coins of merida the ancient emerita particularly on those of augustus which shows that the colonists were proud of their gate and perhaps not without reason as it appears to have been the work of the best age i must conclude that the mode seems to have been derived from the grecian architecture for at athens stood a dipylon or double gate now demolished as i have been informed by my friend mr stuart   the gate in question faced the great watling street road and near the place where other military ways united through this was the greatest conflux of people which rendered the use of the double portal more requisite  the roman bath beneath the feathers inn hypocy in bridge street is probably still entire but the only part which can be seen by reason of the more modern superstructures is the hypocaust this is of a rectangular figure supported by thirtytwo pillars two feet ten inches and a half high and about eighteen inches distant from each other upon each is a tile eighteen inches square as if designed for a capital and over them a perforated tile two feet square such are continued over all the pillars above these are two layers one of coarse mortar mixed with small red gravel about three inches thick and the other of finer materials between four and five inches thick these seem to have been the floor of the room above the pillars stand on a mortarfloor spread over the rock on the south side between the middle pillars is the vent for the smoke about six inches square which is at present open to the height of sixteen inches here is also an antichamber exactly of the same extent with the hypocaust with an opening in the middle into it this is sunk near two feet below the level of the former and is of the same rectangular figure so that both together are an exact square this was the room allotted for the slaves who attended to heat the place the other was the receptacle of the fuel designed to heat the room above the concamerata sudatio vitruvius lib v c ii  or sweatingchamber where people were seated either in niches or on benches placed one above the other during the time of the operation such was the object of this hypocaust for there were others of different forms for the purposes of heating the waters destined for the use of the bathers  i must now descend toward the bridge in search of the few further relics of the ancient colonists after passing through the gate on the right near some skinners houses is a small flight of steps which lead to a large round arch seemingly of roman workmanship it is now filled with more modern masonry and a passage left through a small arch of a very eccentric form ancient postern on the left within the very passage is the appearance of another round arch now filled up this postern is called the shipgate or hole in the wall  this seems originally designed for the common passage over the dee into the country of the ordovices either by means of a boat at high water or by fording at low the river here being remarkably shallow what reduces this to a certainty is that the rock on the hanbridge side is cut down as if for the convenience of travelers and immediately beyond in the field called edgars are the vestiges of a road pointing up the hill roman road and which we shall have hereafter occasion to say was continued toward bonium the present bangor  in a front of a rock in the same field and facing this relic of the roman road is cut a rude figure of the dea armigera minerva with her bird and altar sculpture or minerva this probably was a sepulchral monument for such were very usual on the sides of highways but time or wantonness has erased all inscription  beyond this stood past all memory some ancient buildings whose site is marked by certain hollows for the ground probably over the vaults gave way and fell in within the remembrance of persons now alive tradition calls the spot the site of the palace of edgar nothing is now left from which any judgment can be formed whether it had been a roman building as doctor stukeley surmises or saxon according to the present notion or norman according to braun civitates ortis iii pl   this work was published in       who in his ancient plan of this city styles the ruins then actually existing ruinosa domus comitis cestriensis perhaps it might have been used successively by every one who added or improved according to their respective national modes  having had occasion to mention the name of a departed antiquary i think fit to acknowledge my obligations for the many hints i have benefitted by from the travels of that great and lively genius but at the same time lament that i must say i often find him plus beau que la verite his rapid fancy led him too frequently to paint things as he thought they ought to be not what they really were in the subject before us this assertion may be supported by his giving three arches to the ancient east gate and hollow ways to every part of the city where search has been made  the beautiful altar altar in possession of mr dyson and the soldier in the garden or mr lawton are the only pieces of detached antiquities now ramaining in this city the first is of great elegance and was erected by flavius longus tribune of the twentieth victorious legion and his son longinus in honor of the emperors  and maximian the father and son who thus expressed their gratitude were of samosata a city of syria on one side is the inscription on the opposite is a curtain with a festoon above on one of the narrower sides is a genius with a cornucopia and on the other is a pot with a plant of the supposed acanthus elegantly leaved on the summit is a head included in a circular garland i fogot to remark that immediately over the inscription is a globe overtopped with palmleaves if this is not a general compliment to their victories i should imagine it designed to express their particular successes in africa of which the palm tree was a known emblem  this was found in digging for a cellar near the eastgate on the ancient pavement which consisted of great stones around it were found the marks of sacrifice heads horns and bones of the ox roebuck etc and with them two coins one of vespasian in brass with his head inscribed imp caes vesp aug coss iii and on the reverse victoria augusti s c and a winged victory standing the other was of copper inscribed round the head of constantius fl val constantius nob c and on the other side genio populi romani alluding to a genius holding in one hand a sacrificing bowl in the other a cornucopia  the other antiquities discovered here are now dispersed which obliges me to have recourse to books in order to place them in one point of view  the first is the noted altar discovered in      another at present preserved at oxford it is inscribed to jupiter with the british epithet tanarus or the thunderer by the transposal of the letters r and n in the word taran this appears to have been complimentary to the britons by adopting the epithet in their language instead of that of tonans the inscription approved most by mr horsely tab    no iii  runs thus  jovi optimo maximo tanaro titus elupius galeria praesens guntia primipilus legionis vicessimae valentis victricis commodo et laterano consalibus votum solvit lubens merito the word guntic in the learned prideaux and gale gales comm     is read gunethae as if derived from gwinedd one of the british names of north wales over which they suppose elupius had presided this might account for his preference of the word tanaro as highly flattering to the vanity of those he governed  the next is a statue in possession of the late reverend mr prescot statue or mithras with a phrygian bonnet on his head a little mantle cross his shoulders and a short jacket on his body he is placed standing with a torch in his hands declining this is supposed to have been mithras or the sun a deity borrowed from the persians and much in vogue among the romans in the second and third century horsely cumberland      an inscription deo soli mitrae has been discovered in cumberland the phrygian bonnet marks him for a foreign deity the declining torch shows the funebrious occasion of this stone  mr horsely mentions another stone discovered in digging a cellar in watergate street in      the inscription is so imperfect that he ingenuously confesses that without the aid of fancy it cannot be made out  a few bricks with the number of the legion stationed here fill the list of the roman antiquities of the place i say nothing of the inscription deae nymphae brigantes preserved by mr gale it being justly disputed whether it belonged to this place  i must not omit the most valuable memorial which the romans left cheesemaking in a particular manner to this county the art of cheesemaking for we are expressly told that the britons were ignorant of it till the arrival of the romans the cestrians have improved so highly in this article as to excel all countries not excepting that of italy the land of their ancient masters  the twentieth legion was recalled from britain before the writing of the notitia the legion quits this station it not being mentioned in that work which was composed horsely     about the year     it is supposed also to have been drawn from chester before the retreat of the romans from this island its name being found at bath among some of the latest inscriptions we have idem     the city must not at that period be supposed to be totally deserted it remained occupied by the descendants of the legionaries who partook of the same privileges and were probably a numerous body numbers likewise who had married with the native islanders and embraced civil employs in all likelihood stayed behind after the final abdication of britain by the legions in     after this the city fell under the government of the britons till their conquest was entirely effected by the new invaders the saxons

the war into the northern counties among which lay the principal partisans of the invaders whose country he ravaged in resentment of their treason this city is mentioned among those which suffered edmund by the perfidiousness of his own people was constrained to leave both the mercian and northumbrian kingdoms in possession of canute canute  0   who in the famous partition of england between these rival princes in  0   retained those parts for his own share  on the restoring of the saxon line it reverted with the rest of the mercian province to its old masters leofric a munificent nobleman was at that time governor of mercia and earl of chester these earls were not created but merely official he died  0    0   and was succeeded by his son alfgar or algar a turbulent nobleman who engaging in rebellion aided by the welsh prince gryffydd ap lleweln was twice deprived of his earldom and was once pardoned after his second deprivation he obtained again the province by dint of arms assisted by gryffyd and a norwegian fleet he died soon after and was interred in coventry where the earls of mercia had their principal seat  his eldest son edwin succeeded norman conquest  0   in whom ended the race of earls of chester of saxon blood after the battle of hastings he sled with his brother morkar earl of northumberland to london with a view of the crown vacant by the death of harold being disappointed in his hopes he took his sister algytha widow to the slain monarch and sent her to chester and endeavored to escape to malcolm king of scotland but was intercepted by the way and slain  england now experienced a total change of masters the conqueror in order at once to secure his new dominions and to reward his followers bestowed on them the lands of the noble saxons he wisely divided the provinces which had hitherto been ruled by a few great men into lesser portions and by this means broke the power which before often braved the throne mercia heretofore under the government of a duke or earl postconquest earls of chester and ruled by what was called in the saxon phrase the merchenlege received in many cases a distinct master cheshire fell to the share of gherbod a valiant fleming by misfortune he fell into the hands of his enemies being called into flanders soon after he had taken possession of his new territories and by reason of a long captivity was obliged to resign them to another the conqueror in his place appointed hugh de aurange better known by the name of hugh lupus the first norman earl of chester who ever possessed the county to him he delegated a fullness of power made his a county palatine and gave it such a sovereign jurisdiction that the ancient earls kept their own parlements and had their own courts of law in which any offense against the dignity of the sword of chester was as cognizable here as the like offense would have been at westminster against the dignity of the royal crown for william allowed lupus to hold this county tam libere ad gladium sicut ipse rex tenebat angliam d coronam the sword by which he was invested with this dignity is still to be seen in the museum inscribed hugo comes cestriae another inferior office was also held by the earls by virtue of this sword that of sword bearer of england at the times of coronation leicester  0    lups instantly took possession of his dominions it is probable that he was invested in them by william himself for we find the conqueror at chester in person in  0   where he repelled the welsh and finally reduced the mercian province which appears to have been in arms to this period ordericus vitalis lib iv p      at the same time restored the walls and built the castle the former having either fallen into decay since the days of ethelfreda or were not thought sufficiently strong for the exigencies of the times  as soon as lupus was firmly established he began to exert his regal prerogatives he formed his parliament by the creation of eight barons viz nigel baron of halton robert of montalt william malbedeng baron of nantwich vernon of shipbrook fitzhugh of malpas hamon de massy venables of kinderton and nicholas of stockport these were to assist the earl with their advice ego comes hugo et mei barons was the form of his writs they were obliged to pay him attendance and to repair to his court to give it the greater dignity they were bound in time of war with wales to find for every knightsfee a horse with caparison and furniture or two without furniture in the division of cheshire their knights and freeholders were to have corselets and habergeons and were to defend their lands with their own bodies every baron had also four esquires every esquire one gentleman and every gentleman one valet erdeswickes mss quoted by doctor gower p     each of these barons had also their free courts of all pleas and suits and all plaints except what belonged to the earls sword they had besides power of life and death the last instance of the exertion of this power was in the person of hugh stringer who was tried for murder in the baron of kindertons court and executed in      doctor gowers materials etc p      the earls had their chamberlain which supplied the place of chancellor an office continued to this day the first we know of was philippus camerarius who took his name from his office in the time of randle gernouns earl of chester here is a baron of the exchequer and other officers conformable to those of the crown at westminster also justices before whom the causes which of their nature should otherwise belong respectively to the courts of kings bench and common pleas are triable leicester       in imitation of regal power the earls appointed a high constable of cheshire correspondent to the high constable of england which was held in fee by the baron of halton who by virtue of this office took place of the other barons and the baron of montalt had precedence after him by virtue of his office in fee of high steward  robert de rothelent was another baron who was commander in chief of the forces in cheshire and prime governor of the county under his cousin hugh lupus as his office and rank dropped with him he is not reckoned among the barons probably the office was found unnecessary and clashing with the priveleges of the high constable  this species of government continued from the conquest till the reign of henry iii a period of about     years when in      on the death of john scot the seventh earl of the norman line without issue male henry took the earldom into his own hands and gave the daughters of the late earl other lands in lieu unwilling as we said that so great an inheritance should be parcelled out among distaffs the earldom resumed by the crown the king bestowed the county on his son edward who did not assume the title which he afterward bestowed on his son edward of caernarvon first english prince of wales  after the resumption of the earldom by the crown the government of the city assumed a new form for in the year      the   th of henry iii it appears to have first been under the directions of a mayor and sheriffs the mayor seems to have been the substitute for the constable an office which during the period of the norman earls was under them supreme in all matters military and civil in both city and county the sheriffs seem to have been a new name for bailiffs who acted under the former vale royal       after giving a general idea of the state of this place and county to the time of henry iii i shall return to the time of hugh lupus and give to the best of my power a brief chronological account of its history leaving the ecclesiastical part to be treated apart  in the days of that potent earl and probably long before he was possessed of this city it enjoyed by prescription diverse priveleges guild mircatory it had a guild mercatory ibid      analogous to a modern corporation so that no person who was not of that society could exercise any trade or carry on any commerce within its precinct such was the state in which the normans found it which the earls afterward confirmed under their seals  two overseers selected out of the most respectable citizens were appointed to maintain the rights of this guild they received for the use of the city all the customs paid by strangers unless at the fairs which in those days were said to have been held three times in the year these officers were probably of the same nature as the deans of guild in scotland it appears also from the doomsday book that here was a supreme officer called the prapesitus regis or provost who had the care both of the civil and commercial interests  it is difficult to say at this time what were the articles of exportation excepting slaves and horses exports slaves the first barbarous traffic was carried on by the saxons to a great height the description of the mart is an exact picture of the negro commerce there is a town called brichstou bristol opposite to ireland and extremely convenient for trading with that country wulfstan induced them to drop a barbarous custom which neither the love of god nor the king could prevale on them to lay aside this was the mart for slaves collected from all parts of england and particularly young women whom they took care to provide with a pregnancy in order to enhance their value it was a most moving sight to see in the public markets rows of young people of both sexes tied together with ropes of great beauty and in the flower of their youth daily prossituted daily sold execrable fact wretched disgrace men unmindful even of the affection of the brute creation delivering into slavery their relations and even their very offspring vita s wulfstan in anglia sacra ii     wulsstan was bishop of worcester and died in  0   at present so little have we emerged from barbarism in that instance  horses were another article horses hides etc but their exportation was prohibited excepting they were designed for presents by a law of athelstan but these as well as several others such as metals hides dogs and chalk were probably still exported as in the times of the romans chester was admirably situated for supplying all these articles excepting the last the frequent wars carried on with the welsh furnished them with slaves if those were wanting their neighbors of the northumbrian kingdom were ready to dispose of their nearest relations willielm malmesh in script post bedam p     the rich plains of cheshire furnished horns and hides and the cambrian mines lead and copper  cheese must not be omitted cheese as a most important article for the britons made so great a progress in the arts of the dairy that even under the roman reign there was great exportation of cheeses for the use of the roman armies in which this county doubtlessly had the greatest share  the imports were the spices and other luxuries of the east imports procured either from venice or afterward from the cities of pisa and amalphi anderson i        the magazines of the precious asiatic commodities  cloth was brought from flanders and linen from germany idem    cloth linen relics

the doomsday book among the imports of chester ireland might also supply them with furs and several other commodities this being the channel of communication on that side of the kingdom and the great

great plenty it is certain that chester had long been a celebrated port it appears to have been a station for the saxon navy and frequently the seat of the court of the mercian kingdom both during the heptarchy and after it became a province at the general union under egbert  the state of this city in the time of edward the confessor and at the conquest must be collected from the famous survey the doomsday book  it appears that in the time of the saxon monarch here were four hundred and thirtyone houses which were taxable besides fiftysix that belonged to the bishop that it yielded ten marks of silver and a half two parts to the king and the third to the earl that whenever the king came in person he clamed from every ploughland two hundred hesthas one cuna of ale and one rusca of butter hestha is supposed to be a capon cuna and brewing tub or vat i do not find rusca explained  that if any persons made bad ale they were either to sit in a chair full of dung or pay four shilings that there were twelve judges in the city and seven mintmasters that whenever repairs were wanting for the walls or the bridge notice was given for one man out of every hideland in the county to appear and in case of absence he was fined forty shillings to be divided between the king and the earl and that the city was so depopulated at the time that hugh lupus took possession that there were two hundred and five houses fewer than in the time of the confessor  it is probable that the city soon emerged from its calamities and felt a considerable increase under its new masters a more polished race for the normans affected as much elegance in their dress and their buildings as they did temperance in their meat and drink the example of a magnificent warrior such as the new earl was quickly copied his court and that of his successors rendered it the most considerable place in these parts  according to lucian quoted by cambden i      a jolly monk who flourished about the time of the conquest its commerce was very considerable he speaks of the ships coming from gascoign spain ireland and germany who by gods assistance and by the labor and conduct of mariners repair hither and supply them with all sorts of commodities so that being comforted with the favor of god in all things we drink wine plentifully for those countries have abundance of vineyards  here      in      henry ii and malcolm

crown fordun i       baldwin archbishop of canterbury      in      visited this place in his road from wales where his zeal led him to recommend the croisade to the mountaneers assisted by the eloquent and vain giraldus all the historian takes notice of in this respectable city is that constance countess of chester kept a herd of milch hinds made cheeses of their milk and presented three to the archbishop that he saw an animal a compound of an ox and a stag a woman born without arms who could sew as well with her feet as others of her sex did with their fingers and finally that he heard of a litter of whelps begotten by a monkey itin cambr c xi p     as giraldus was a great dealer in presages it is wondrous he made no use of all these portents probably no signal event happened in these parts in his days to which they could be applied  the next remarkable occurrences were the ravages of llewelyn ap gryffydd      prince of wales who carried fire and sword to the very gates of chester and destroyed every thing around on both sides of the river provoked by the cruel injuries his subjects sustained from geffrey langley lieutenant of the county under prince edward walstngham p

lancastrians speeds hist      she appointed james lord audley to command the cheshire forces michael drayton gives an animated description of the effects of civil discord on this occasion he acquaints

marks of royal favor were not unfrequent henry vii and his queen came here in           and henry sent his son arthur to visit the place in             this city had also its share in the calamitous distempers of the times in   0    0  it was visited by that endemic disorder the sweatingsickness which destroyed in three days ninetyone householders the remark of this destroyingangels respect to the female sex was verified here for only four perished  in           it was followed by the pestilence when such numbers died and such numbers fled that the streets of the city were overgrown with grass  it appears that the citizens of chester were not less celebrated for their dramatic performances than those of coventry dugdale i           they exhibited two species one formed upon moral romance the other on scriptural history in this year they enacted at the highcross the play of robert king of cicyle or robert le dia borrowed from the french morality of that name  here i of king

mission and restores the poor king to his throne  the year      reminds me of the religious dramas being performed in this city      whitson plays these are the famous interludes known by the name of mysteries originally composed in the years      and      by randal higgenet a monk of chester abbey as this prologue acquaints us  reverend lords and ladies all that at this time assembled be by this messauge understond you shall that some times there was mayor of this city sir john arnway knight who most worthilye contented himself to set out in play the devise of one dane rondall moonke of chester abbey rondal it seems first composed these mysteries in latin and took true pains to obtain leave to exhibit them in an english dress having made three journies to rome for his holinesss permission harleian mss       others again were the labors of sir henry frances another monk as appears by the proclamation for the whitson plays in this year made by the clerk of the pentice setting forth that in  oulde time not only for the augmentation and increes of the holy and catholic faith and to exort the minds of the common people to good devotion and wholesome doctrine but also for the comonwelth of this city a play and declaration of diverse stories of the bible beginning with the creacion and fall of lucifer and ending with the general judgment of the world to be declared and played in the whitsonne week was devised and made by sir henry frances sometime moonke there who gat of clement then bushop of rome  000 days or pardon and of the bushop of chester at that time  0 days of pardon to every person resorting in peaceable manner to hear the said plays which were insituted to the honor of god by john arnway then major of chester his brethren and whole cominalty thereof to be brought forth declared and played at the cost and charges of the craftesmen and occupations of the said city etc etc harleian mss  0    these plays had probably been dropped for a considerable time which occasioned the proclamation in the reign of that pageantloving prince henry viii fortythree years had elapsed since the last performance of this nature when the assumption of our lady was played before his brother arthur at the abbygates of this city  these mysteries were the rude origin of the english theater our drama as the very ingenious mr warton remarks was in early times confined entirely to religious subjects and these plays were nothing more than an appendage to the specious and mechanical devotion of the age history of english poetry i      i refer the reader to that gentlemans amusing history of the rise and progress of these performances and confine myself to a few specimens of the gross and ridiculous exhibitions of the times when the audience listened with the fullest admiration and devotion to what would at present fill a theater with laughter from the gay at the absurdity or scandalize the serious part with the unintentional impiety i shall only premise that the scene of action was the church in defiance of the fulminations of the furious bonner and the pious gindal  these plays were twentyfive in number they were performed for above three centuries to the staring audience who received the unvaried subject with the same annual pleasure as the romans did the farces in their days of honest simplicity  tandemque redit ad pulpita notum

deceavinge many a creature though my ale were naught she is then welcomed by the devils which closes the piece and all i shall relate of those heaps of absurdities  the city had      public stews till this time been indulged with public stews or brothels which for some centuries were permitted by legislative authority and regulated by wholesome laws ordained by the commons and confirmed by the king and lords hose of southwark were attended to in a particular manner in      the  th of henry ii one article affords reason to believe that a certain disease had a much earlier date than the siege of naples for it prohibits the stewholders from keeping any woman that has the perilous infirmity of burning stows hist london ii book iv    their houses were distinguished by having the fronts whitewashed by having signs not hung out but painted against the walls among the signs i observe the singular one of the cardinals hat notwithstanding the keepers were protected in their profession they were reckoned infamous were not to be impannelled on any juries or allowed to hold a tavern drakes parlem hist ii      the women that frequented them were forbidden the rites of the church as long as they exercised their profession and were excluded from christian burial if they were not reconciled before their death henry viii suppressed the surry houses in      those in this city in       this year was distinguished by one of the cruel deeds that marked the reign of the bigoted mary      the burning of george marsh for his adherence to the protestant faith i have often been informed by the worthy doctor william cooper that when marsh was brought to boughton the place of execution by the sheriffs amory and cooper the last an ancestor of the doctor favoring the religion of the sufferer attempted his rescue but being overpowered by his brotherofficer was obliged to fly till better times when he returned and discharged the office of mayor in       festive times now took place again      probably in compliment to the taste of the glorious but romantic queen elizabeth in the year      upon the sunday after midsummer in the mayoralty of sir lawrence smith the history of aenecs and queen dido was played on the reedseye set forth by william croston gent and mr man on which triumph was made two forts and shipping on the water besides many horsemen well armed and appointed the forts and shipping seem to have been pageants to carry on some deeds of chivalry we hear of the ship fame laden with good renown among the pageantries of henry holinshed  0   and the fortress of beauty assailed by virtuous desire among those of elizabeth the same       the assailants battered it with nosegays and the besieged discharged against them cannons filled with sweet powder or odoriferous waters  during sir lawrences mayoralty we have an account of another spectacle an annual one upon the watch of the even of st john the baptist for sir lawrence and the aldermen and common council contract with two painters to have in readiness with all furniture thereto belonging viz four giants one unicorne one dromedarye one luce one camel one ass one dragon six hobbye horses and sixteen naked boys and the same being in readiness shall bear or carry or cause to be borne and carried duringe the watch from place to place according as the same have been used etc harlcian mss no        i am at a loss to guess the end of this preparation but find that it was suppressed during the mayoralty of       the virtue of edward dutton   0  mayor or the city in   0  must not pass unnoticed this worthy magistrate like marseilles good bishop kept his station during the whole time of a dreadful pestilence  when nature sickened and each gale was death his house was infected and some of his children and servants died the court of exchequer was removed to tarvin the  assizes were held at namptwich and the fairs ceased during this sad visitation  in this year the city was honored with the presence of james i where he was received with a magnificence that did honor to the place  the mayor edward button presented his majesty with a fair standing cup with a cover double gilt and in it a hundred jacobins or gold he also delivered the citys sword to the king who returning it the mayor bore it before him on horseback his worship was offered the honor of knighthood but declined it the city did not confine its munificence to crowned heads i find that in      robert earl of leicester chamberlain of the county palatine met with a most honorable reception was received at the highcross by the whole corporation entertained by the mayor and presented with a cup containing forty angels the unfortunate earl of essex in      in his way to ireland was still more distinguished he was presented with the like sum but in a cup of the same kind as that which was afterward presented to james  from      i discover nothing very particular for a considerable space till the city was involved in the calamities of a siege in      in consequence of its unshaken loyalty to charles i at the beginning of the civil war immediate attention was paid to this important city by the royal party the fortifications were put into the best repair and outworks extended from the alcove on the north part of the walls to the brink of the river near boughton and in consequence numbers of houses were pulled down to prevent them from giving shelter to the enemy the first attempt made on the place by the parliament army was on the  0th of july      when sir william brereton gave a violent assault on the works but met with a repulse in the same year he sent a summons to sir abraham shipman then governor to surrender the gallant commander bid him come and win it and wear it  after the repulse of lord biron before namptwich the county of chester was almost entirely in the hands of sir william brereton and the city suffered from that time a sort of blockade from the quarters the enemy possessed in the neighborhood even as near as the village of christleton sallies and excursions were frequently made and according to the diary of the siege with advantage to the loyalists  on september the   th      the parliament gained an advantage irrecoverable by the besieged colonel jones and adjutantgeneral lothian who were employed in the reduction of beeston castle drew from before that place in a secret manner a large body of forces and in the night stormed the outworks and made themselves masters of every thing even to the city walls his majesty immediately after this misfortune passed through wales and got into the city in hopes of animating the garrison and was lodged at sir francis gamuls near the bridge he arrived only time enough to be a spectator from the leads of the phoenix tower of the fatal battle on rowton heath on september    when his forces under sir marmaduke langdale then on their march to raise the siege after a welldisputed action sunk under the superior fortune of general pointz  the king continued that night in chester and on quitting it the next day gave orders to the governor lord biron that in case there was no appearance of relief within eight days he was to treat of a surrender the king took the route of denhigh attended to that town by the three respectable citizens sir francis gamul alderman cooper and captain thropp the siege was continued with the utmost vigor by sir william brereton notwithstanding which the gallant garrison held out for twenty weeks beyond the expectation of every body and after having been reduced to live on horses dogs and cats yielded on the  d of february       on terms that did honor to the spirit of the besieged the city was evacuated by the royalists and received from the parliament as governor colonel jones but the miseries of the citizens did not terminate with the siege a dreadful pestilence broke out in      two thousand inhabitants perished and the city became almost a desert  in order to give a further history of the military bridge civil and ecclesiastical architecture of this ancient city i return to the bridge this passage was prior to the conquest at which period it seems to have been either destroyed or found to be so much out of repair that i find in doomsday book an order for the provost to summon one man from each hide of land in the county in order to rebuild the bridge and the walls and in case of neglect of appearance the lord of the person so summoned was to forfeit to the king and earl forty shillings  according to a ms quoted by mr gross it was begun by the great restorer of the city ethelfieda and after her death completed by her brother edward before that time the passage was by a ferry that plied between the postern called the shipgate and edgars field it does not appear to me that any part of the saxon bridge remains so frequently has it been repaired since that distant period  beneath the arch next to the city causeway and mills is a current which by means of a great dam or causeway that crosses the river obliquely supplies the city mills with water these mills and the causeway were originally founded by hugh lupus harleian mss  0    0  00         and retained by his successors and afterward by the earls of chester of the royal line i find them often leased by the crown edward the black prince in particular in      grants them the fishing suit court and calsey for three years to robert of bredone parson of st peter of chester and others at the annual rent of   0 l idem  0       this rent was very considerable in those days and arose from the obligation every inhabitant of the city then lay under to grind at these mills excepting the tenants of the abbot and monks of st werburgh and in after times those of the dean and chapter inhabiting without the northgate who had a mill of their own at bachpool  i must not omit that a grant of these mills for life was the reward of valor to my countryman sir howel y fwyall for his bravery in taking prisoner john king of france in the battle of poitiers this grant was also made by the black prince who not only knighted howel but allowed a mess of meat to be served before his battle ax in memory of the good use he made of it in that day from which he acquired the name of fwyall or howei or the ax hist gwedir family fifteen tribes of nwales   on each side of the bridgegate are two rounders bridgegate over it are the three feathers the arms of the princes of wales those were first assumed by the black prince after the battle of cresh in      our historians assert that they were the three ostrichfeathers which the king of bohemia bore that day in his coronet and that he was slain by edward who seizing on the crest bore from that time both the feathers and the motto ib dien i serve i am unwilling to sully the honor of our gallant prince by supposing that he would stain his sword in so unequal an encounter the king was blind with age and finding the battle go against his allies was led by his own orders into the rage of the combat determined to die in the cause of france our brave prince probably might assume this royal cognizance in memory of the glorious day and add to it his own motto ic dien the old english for i serve allusive to the scriptural verse the heir while he is a child differs not from a servant cambdens remains      an imprese extremely suitable to the characteristic modesty and filial piety of this prince  this and the other city gates were placed under the protection of certain great men who held lands within the county palatine the earl of shrewshury had the care of the bridgegate the earl of oxford of the eastgate the earl of derby of the watergate but the northgate belonging peculiarly to the city was entrusted only to its chief magistrates tolls were exacted at entrance from all strangers for the support of the guard and notwithstanding the cause has long since ceased are still demanded at the bridgegate  above the gate is a lofty octagonal tower waterworks begun in   00 by permission of the corporation by john tyrer of this city containing the works which for a long time raised water out of the dee to a cistern in the top whence it was conveyed in pipes to almost all parts of the city possibly these did not answer their purpose effectually for in      tyrer had a new grant of a tower erected for a waterwork and a wellplace ten feet square near spittle boughton with full powers for the conveyance of the water to the cistern or conduit near the highcross this work which was first begun by the black friars in the time of edward i de aquaeductu per ipsos the black friars faciendo a font prope furcas vide tanner     fell to decay in      the works undertaken by tyrer being found to be ruinous and useless john hopkins and john hadley by the encouragement of the corporation began new works for supplying the city with water from the river dee for this purpose they purchased the grant made to tyrer and also one of the cornmills for the convenience of placing their engine the city confirmed to them all the powers formerly vested in tyrer and particularly that of setting up a cistern opposite to the abbey court as a constant receptacle for fresh water  near the bridgegate is one ascent to the city walls walls which are the only entire specimen of ancient fortification now in great britain they are a mile and three quarters and a hundred and one yards in circumference and being the principal walk of the inhabitants are kept in excellent repair by certain imposts murrace called murage duties collected at the customhouse upon all goods and merchandise brought into the port of chester from parts beyond the seas belonging to persons not freemen of the city the irish linen adds considerably to the fund being nearly twothirds of the whole the duty on this article is two pence on every hundred yards the annual receipt of the different duties on the average of the last seven years is about  0 l an officer called a murenger is chosen out of the body of the aldermen to inspect the repairs generally an old member to whom the duty affords amusement and health this fund is now permanent in old times the murage was only occasional thus in the   th of edward ii there was a grant for two years of a halfpenny for every cranock of corn and a farthing of ale meal and malt and for commodities not expressed in the grant a farthing out of every two shillingsworth  i cannot discover any vestige of the original walls such as those which are said to have been restored by the warlike ethelfleda i would not willingly detract from the ladys merit but i must deny her that of being the foundress of the fortifications and of enlarging the city beyond the roman precincts the form at present is so entirely roman that any addition she could make would have destroyed the peculiar figure that wise people always preserved in their stations or castrametations wheresoever the nature of the ground would permit the antiquities which distinguish their residence are not found confined to any one quarter they are met in digging on every side within the walls  the military architecture is still entirely on the roman plan it is probable that after their retreat it fell into ruin in the impoverished turbulent and barbarous ages that succeeded yet never was so totally demolished but that it might still yield a defense to the possessors we find it wrested out of the hands of the britons by egbert in     we again see it possessed by the danes in     and besieged by alfred who slew all the banditti whom he found without the walls and lastly we find it taken by ethelfleda by the voluntary surrender of the garrison all this proves a continuance of the fortifications probably ruinous and wanting that restoration which they found from that illustrious woman  we see the roman mode of fortification preserved to this day exactly on the ancient plan from each side of the gates projects a propugnaculum vegetius lib iv c   or bastion in order to annoy the enemy who attempted to enter and between them in the very entrance was the cataracta or portcullis ready to be dropped in case they forced the gates so that part of them might be caught within the walls and the rest excluded should it happen that they set the gates on fire there were holes above in order to pour down water to extinguish the flames  the walls are in many parts especially on the north and cast sides guarded by towers placed so as not to be beyond bowshot of one another in order that the archers might reach the enemy who attempted to attack the intervals intervalla autem turrium ita sunt facienda ut ne longius sit alia ab alia sagittae intermissione etc vitruvius lib i c    they also are mostly of a round form as was recommended by the roman architects in order the better to elude the force of battering rams turres itaque rotundae aut polygoniae sunt faciendae quadratas enim machinae celerius dissipant etc ibid turres sunt projiciendae in exteriorem partem uti cum ad murum hostis impetu velit appropinquare a turribus etc ibid   the thickness of the walls answer to the breadth prescribed by vitruvius only two persons can walk abreast excepting where the ground adjacent gives a larger expanse the great architect directs that they should be of such a breadth that two armed men may pass each other without any impediment  the city to this time enjoys the four gates answerable to the principalis dextra and sinistra praetoria and decumana the eastgate one of the principales existed within my memory  my walk leads me beneath the castle to another of the principales the present watergate that opens toward the waterside and near which the dee in former times flowed  at the extreme angle of the city beyond this gate is a salient tower exactly round watertower unless where interrupted by a small squared projection at the entrance this tower is joined to the walls by a deep open gallery embattled on each side beneath is a large arch for the passage of the tide before the late enclosures which also are within my remembrance this tower is at present called the watertower it jutted into the ancient channel or the river where the ships lay which fastened their cables to its sides by the great iron rings infixed in the stone this tower was formerly called the new yet was founded in    0 for there exists a contract for that purpose between the mayor and citizens of chester and one john de helpston mason for building quandam turrem rotundum etc a round tower of the thickness of ten yards and a half with a cavity within twentyfour yards high and so strong as to be defensible and all this for the sum of one hundred pounds harleian mss no  0    0   the next remarkable outlet is the northgate beyond which is a large suburb  the phoenix tower stands on the angle of the walls beyond this gate the present tower was built in      and was used by six of the companies of the city as a chamber for business it took its name from the fabulous bird the crest of the painterstainers company which was placed in front  the eastgate is the next entrance eastgate here stood a lofty square tower with many apartments erected according to tradition by edward iii this had been a porta principalis was the grand entrance into the town and was the termination of the great watlingstreet road which crossed the island from dover and was the great road from that port to this place in      this gate being found too narrow and inconvenient was pulled down and a magnificent arch arose in its room at the sole expense of richard lord grosvenour beyond this is a vast suburb called the foreststreet whose lower part was defended by a gate demolished as a nuisance within these few years  after passing the eastgate the traveller will observe without the walls a vast fosse cut through the live rock now a common road to the water but which appears to me to have been a work of the romans as a defense on this side and which continues the rectangular shape of the station  the views from the several parts of the walls are extremely elegant fineviews the mountains of flintshire and denbighshire the hills of broxton and the insulated rock of beeston form the ruder part of the scenery a rich flat gives a softer view and the prospect up the river toward boughton recalls in some degree the idea of the thames and richmondbill  on the conquest as has been before related the king visited this city in person and restored the fortifications it is probable that he only repaired the walls but that he entirely rebuilt the castle ordericus vitalis     on the norman model and enlarged it far beyond the dimensions of that of the saxons which occupied the summit of the mount or little hill on which the fortress stands that part is artificial in order to give a great elevation as was customary in the saxon keeps and the portion so flung up appears here to have been a mixture of stones and exceedingly hard clay  the castle is composed of two parts an upper and a lower each with a strong gate castle defended by a round bastion on each side with a ditch and formerly with drawbridges within the precincts of the upper ballium are to be seen some towers of norman architecture square with square projections at each corner very slightly salient the handsomest is that called julius caesars its entrance is through a large gothic door probably of later workmanship the lowest room has a vaulted roof strengthened with ordinary square couples the upper had been a chapel as appears by the holy water pot and some figures almost obsolete painted on the walls its dimensions are nineteen feet four inches by sixteen six the height also sixteen feet six the roof is vaulted but the couples which are rounded slender and elegant run down the walls and rest on the cornuted capitals of five short but beautiful round pillars in the same style with those in the chapter house of the cathedral probably the work of the same architect the arsenal some batteries and certain habitable buildings occupy the remaining part  on the sides of the lower court stands the noble room called hugh lupuss hall lupuss hall in which the courts of justice for the county are held the length is very near ninetynine feet the breadth fortyfive the height very aweful and worthy the stateapartment of a great baron the roof supported by woodwork in a bold style carved and placed on the sides resting on stout brackets  this magnificent building probably retains its original dimensions the character of the first norman earl required a hall suited to the greatness of his hospitality which was confined to no bounds he was says ordericus lib iv p      not only liberal but prosuse he did not carry a family with him but an army he kept no account of receipts or disbursements he was perpetually wasting his estates and was much fonder of falconers and huntsmen than of cultivators of the land and holy men and by his gluttony he grew so excessively fat that he could hardly crawl about  adjoining to the end of this great hall is the court of exchequer exchequer or the chancery of the county palatine of chester the earl of cholmondely is the present chamberlain sir richard perrin my worthy countryman sits and discharges the office of vicechamberlain in respect to matters of equity he here acts as lord chancellor the chamberlain was one of the ancient earls great officers and had a fee of twentytwo pounds a year this very building is said to have been the parlementhouse of the little kings of the palatinate it savors of antiquity in the architecture and within are a number of seats described by gothic arches and neat pillars at the upper end are two one for the earl the other for the abbot the eight others were allotted to his eight barons and occupy one side of the room  under the vicechamberlain is a baron who holds a weekly court in which appearances are entered for bringing causes to a trial writs and subpoenas are also here made out as well for the great sessions for this county as for those of the county of flint here is besides an examiner and a sealkeeper who has the charge of the records  the judges have lodgings within the castle during their circuit by ancient custom these are furnished by the sheriffs of the city the sheriffs of the county take care of their horses but are allowed the expenses when they bring in their accounts at the audit  the county jail for felons and debtors is the last place to be described jail i can do little more than confirm the account of it by the humane howard their dayconfinement is in a little yard surrounded on all sides by lofty buildings impervious to the air excepting from above and ever unvisited by the purifying rays of the sun their nocturnal apartments are in cells seven feet and a half by three and a half ranged on one side of a subterraneous dungeon in each of which are often lodged three or four persons the whole is rendered more wholesomely horrible by being pitched over three or four times in the year the scanty air of their straight prisonyard is to travel through three passages to arrive at them through the window of an adjacent room through a grate in the floor of the said room into the dungeon and finally through the dungeon through a little grate above the door of each of their kennels in such places as these are the innocent and the guilty permitted to be lodged till the law decides their fate i am sure the humane keeper mr thomas must feel many a pang at the necessary discharge of his duty mr howard compares the place to the blackhole at calcutta the view i had of it assisted to raise the idea of a much worse prison where  no light but rather darkness visible served only to discover sights of woe the constable of the castle holds his place for life is properly the keeper of the prison but appoints a deputy he is accountable for all prisoners and debtors and answerable for their escapes  within the walls of this fortress was an instance of a felon suffering prison forte et dure for standing mute on his trial till he died of hunger prison forte it dure one adam son of john of the woodhouses was in    0 the  th of edward ii committed for burning his own houses and carrying away the goods he stood mute a jury as usual was empanelled who decided that he could speak if he pleased on this he was committed ad dietam and afterward john le morgan constable of the castle testified that the aforesaid adam was dead ad dietam harleian mss no  0       this was the origin of the punishment of pressing to death or the peine forte et dure which seems a sort of merciful hastening of death for it must have been much more horrible as well as tedious in the manner prescribed by the law of the first edward in whose reign it originated the words of the statute are qe les felouns ecriez et que sont apertement de male fame et ne se voillent mettre en enqueste des felonies qe lem lui met devant justices a la suite le roy soient mys en la prison fort et dure etc  the term ad dietam was ironical expressive of the sad sustenance the sufferer was allowed viz on the first day three morsels of the worst bread on the second three draughts of water out of the next puddle and this was to be alternately his daily diet till he died  mr rymer records a strange instance of a woman at nottingham who underwent this punishment and lived forty days without meat or drink this happened in      in the reign of edward iii who ad laudem dei et gloriosae virginis marlae matris suae unde dictum miraculum processit at creditur the womans name was caecilia indicted for the murder of her husband john de rygeway rymers foedera vi     granted the sufferer a free pardon after mentioning that it is probable that the miracle was a little assisted by natural means i must observe that according to this instance the condemned were in some cases absolutely denied any species of food in others it seems probable from the name of the punishment of adam that they sometimes were allowed that wretched diet which was continued when the punishment changed into the peine dure et forte  there is a singularity in the manner of the treatment of the prisoners who are released by capital punishment out of their dreadful cells which merits mention they are delivered by the constable or his deputy at a stone called gloversstone about ninety yards distant from the outward gate into the hands of the sheriffs of the city who receive them at that stone which is the extreme limit of the castle precincts and from thence convey them to the place of execution which they also have the charge of this custom is not accounted for any more than by tradition that a felon was formerly rescued in his way to the gallows by the citizens of chester and perhaps by the connivance of the magistrates who are supposed to have had the disagreeable duty inflicted on them of executing all criminals whether they are of the county or the city  the city was separated from the castle and made a county of itself by the charter of henry vii the castle was left as an appertance to the shire and has the small outlet of a little street called gloversstone glovers stone which is also independent of the city and in which nonfreemen may set up any trade unmolested by the corporation  the castle has a governor lieutenant governor and constable and is garrisoned by two companies of invalids  the civil government and architecture is next to be taken notice of i have in my account of saxon and norman chester given a brief relation of the government of the city in those periods i shall at present only mention the principal charters and flatter myself that the reader will excuse my brevity not only as it is beyond the power of the traveling topographer to collect the same materials as the resident but because his curiosity will it is to be hoped soon be satisfied by the publication of the history of this city by the reverend doctor gower which will amply supply all my deficiencies  the first royal charter which this city was honored with is that of henry iii charters who confirms all the priveleges bestowed on them by the norman earls and i imagine first flung the government into the form of a regular corporation for he grants and confirms to them that none shall buy or sell merchandise in the city except citizens unless it be in the fairs under the penalty of ten pounds  edward i gave the city of chester with the appertenances and all the liberties and priveleges to its citizens and their heirs to be holden of him and his heirs for ever paying annually  00 l he also granted them the election of a coroner and pleas of the crown and that they should have sock sock he who is invested with this has power to hold courts within his own lands sack power of deciding

citizens to build on such vacant spots  edward the black prince prescribed by particular names the boundaries of the city beginning at the ironbridge and from thence to saltney the portpool flukersbrook boughton etc  richard ii was particularly kind to his favorite city in consideration of some distresses it had undergone he released them from the payment of seventythree pounds ten shillings and eightpence arrears of rent due to the crown he gave them the profits of the ferry toward the rebuilding and repairing of dee bridge he made them two grants of the murage the first for four years the second for five for the repairs of the walls but in the   d year of his reign for the furtherance of justice in the same city and better execution thereof he grants unto his subjects majors sheriffs and commonalty of the said city to hold their courts and limited what processes they might award in actions personal felonies appeals processes of utlagary as at common law granted under the seal of the principality of chester at chester may        king ii      this seems to have been found necessary in order to strengthen the civil policy of this place which had four years before been greatly insulted by a dreadful riot in the abbey by sir baldwyne of radyngstone supported by sir john of stanley with eight hundred men a sheriff was killed and many other excesses committed harleian mss no  0        after the revolution which happened in      the mayor and citizens continued to favor the cause of their deposed master and after his death gave all the assistance in their power to harry percy on his defeat they obtained the royal pardon and in order to conciliate their affections young henry prince of wales and earl of chester confirmed all their former charters and priveleges and afterward granted to them the profits of murage and bridge tower where tolls were collected durante been placito  in a confirmation of the former charters by henry vi we learn the former concourse of strangers the greatness of the commerce of chester by reason of the goodness of its port and the great trade carried on in provisions into and out of wales it farther recites the melancholy change of affairs the conflux of foreign merchants being put a stop to by the choking of the creek with sands and the intercourse with wales destroyed since the insurrection of owen glendwr which considerations moved the king to remit ten pounds of the ancient feefarm rent  the provisions alluded to were probably cheeses on the part of the citizens of chester and perhaps wines spices and other foreign luxuries for which they might receive in exchange from the welsh cattle of different kinds  henry vii members in   0  in consideration of farther distresses of the city not only remitted eighty pounds of its annual rent but granted it a new charter by which he separated it from the county and granted it several of the most valuable priveleges which it still enjoys but being a county palatine and in the time of edward i vested in the crown never received summons either for county or city to return members to parliament till the reign of henry viii when the county in      was empowered to send two knights and the city two citizens the electors of the last are the freemen of the city the returningofficers the sheriffs  the corporation consists of a mayor corporation recorder two sheriff s twentyfour aldermen and forty common council here are beside two annual officers called leavelookers whose business was to prevent all persons who are not free of the city from exercising any trade or exposing to sale any wares or merchandise within the liberties they were accustomed to go round the city in order to preserve these its privileges and sometimes were used to take small sums called leavelookerage for leave for nonfreemen to sell wares by retail but at present the yeoman of the pentise discharges this office and returns the names of such persons who are found to offend in order that actions might be brought against them we find as early as      that similar officers were elected under the name of custos guild mercator and who discharged the same function king ii       the places where the mayor and other officers of the corporation assemble for the dispatch of business pextise or administration of justice are two the first is the pentise an ancient building in the center of the city near the junction of the four principal streets mention is made of the northside having been builded in      here all business within the cognizance of a justice of the peace is transacted the aldermen that have past the chair being empowered to act as long as they wear the gown here also the sheriffs assisted by the recorder sit and determine civil causes  i imagine that this building praetorium st peters church and a few houses to the north and west occupy the site of the roman praetorium for they not only fill the very situation of that part of the old castrametations but account for the discontinuance of the bridge street which ceases opposite to these edifices this also is the cause why the nearer part of the northgate street is thrown out of its course and falls into the eastgate street many yards beyond the mouth of the bridge street for the lower part of the northgate street where the exchange and shambles stand points directly toward the former but is interrupted by the space occupied by these buildings the limit of the praetorium on the east was the narrow portion of northgate street on the south part of the present bridge eastgate and watergate streets on the west goss lane and on the north the space now occupied by the fishmarket the praetorium with its attendants demanded no small space for besides the spot possessed by the general were the apartments of the imperatoris contubernales or the young nobility immediately under his care the augurale where prayers sacrifices and other religious rites were performed which might have stood on the site of the modern church and the general might have had his tribunal on the very spot where the worshipful corporation at present sit for the redress of grievances  the courts of justice are held in the common hall exchange a large and commodious room over the exchange adorned with the portraits of several popular persons among them is a fulllength of sir william williams recorder of this city speaker of the house of commons in the reign of charles ii and solicitorgeneral in that of his successor in this place are held a crownmote court portmote court and court of sessions the mayor assisted by the recorder is judge of the crownmote court he has jurisdiction in all criminal causes treason only excepted he is also judge of the portmote court with the same assistant this court holds plea in all actions real personal and mixed in the court of sessions the aldermen above the chair try pettylarcenies and determine upon inferior offenses in this place the body corporate hold their assemblies for making byelaws for the government of the city for managing the public buildings and directing the charities and finally the city elections of magistrates as well as members are made in this court  the only remains of any hotel and that of no ancient date stood in old commonball lane which when entire surrounded a square and communicated with watergate street it was founded by sir thomas egerton chamberlain of chester afterward lord chancellor of england and designed by him for a dwelling house the small remainder which faced the lane and was occupied by a poor family on the  th of november      was the scene of a dreadful calamity the first floor was engaged by a puppetshow man and at the moment he was exhibiting to a very full audience by some unknown accident  00 pounds weight of gunpowder which was lodged in a warehouse beneath took fire and blew up three stories twentythree people perished and eightythree were much burnt bruised and received broken and dislocated limbs of which number only three died and those with locked jaws the remedy found most efficacious for the burnt was goulards extract of lead  the external effects of this explosion were these the windows and broken glass of several of the neighboring houses fell outward from which it appears that they were not broken by the shock of the gunpowder but by the pressure of the air within the apartments which rushed out into the vacuum occasioned by the explosion a similar phenomenon has been remarked from an explosion from the inflammable vapor of a mine when the neighboring trees fell toward the blast howsoever where the force of the powder was confined by narrow passages its centrifugal effect took place for two boys walking along the rows in watergate street opposite to a passage leading to the building were blown one against the rails the other into the street and the roof of a house was blown off opposite a passage into common hall lane  it is much to be wished that the easy magistracy of this city would from this dire accident take into consideration the safety of the whole in preference to the convenience of a few lazy individuals and either compel them to keep by them only the legal quantity or at their session appoint proper places for lodging gunpowder this is the second tremendous warning of the same nature which the city has been visited with on the first of april      the shop of mr thomas murray in bridge street and the house were blown up and himself and a young gentleman killed notwithstanding this double admonition i fear its attention still continues lethargic  the surviving sufferers of this calamity were relieved   0 l was also immediately collected from the humane inhabitants of the city to be distributed among these miserable maimed objects in the wellregulated infirmary established here and supported by the voluntary contributions from the city county and neighboring parts of wales it is a handsome building in an airy situation and detached from the streets this charity was founded in      and originated from a bequest of  00 l left by dr stratford commissary of richmond toward the commencing of a public hospital in this city subscriptions were circulated and a sum equal to the design soon raised before the present building could be ready for the reception of patients a temporary infirmary was prepared for them in      in northgate street the new infirmary was opened on the   th of march      and has been supported with a spirit that does honor to the environs which has enabled the managers to receive since its institution not fewer than thirteen thousand six hundred and thirtysix objects of relief the portrait of the founder is placed in the councilroom of the infirmary a threequarters piece sitting in a long wig and civilians gown  i shall now take a short view of the ecclesiastical state of this ancient city it is necessary first to observe that the mercian kingdom was divided into five bishoprics lichfield chester worcester lydnecester and dorchester which last was afterward removed to lincoln lichfield was made about the year     metropolitan by order of offa and afterward for a long space incorporated into itself its suffragan chester how greatly the last flourished is evident from an account of its annual payment to the pope in very early times for when lichfield paid only three thousand florins our see advanced five thousand no wonder that its jealousy should be excited very little is known of the state of this church in the saxon period let it suffice to say that a bishop of lichfield of the name of peter in the year  0   removed his episcopal seat to chester and during his life made use of the church of st johns for his cathedral this translation was of very short date for his successor established himself in the former diocese and chester continued without a bishop till the dissolution of monasteries when in      henry viii restored it to its former honor by creating it one of the six westminster oxford bristol gloucester peterborough and chester the first was suppressed in the reign of queen mary new sees formed on that great event and converted the church of the late abbey of st werburgh into the cathedral  the first of the new bishops was john bird a carmelite and provincial of the order a man subservient to the court who by preaching against the popes supremacy so recommended himself to the king as to obtain the bishopric of bangor from whence he was removed to chester as a fit person to suit the rapacity of the times in      he granted away the whole of the manors and demesnes of the sea and accepting impropriation instead of them left his successors not a single acre excepting that on which the palace stands and the court before it another house adjacent a little orchard called the woodyard two houses near st johns church and a few small tenements in the city of york notwithstanding the sum he amassed he was found at the accession of mary in debt to the crown  0   l    s for tenths and subsidies a vast sum for the times his interest with bishop bonner still would have saved him had he not committed in those days the heinous crime of matrimony for which he was deprived in       he left his diocese one of the lest in value yet greatest in extent of any in england for it reaches from hawarden in flintshire to the river derwent in cumberland comprehending the entire counties of cheshire and lancashire part of westmoreland cumberland and richmondshire in yorkshire the chapelties of holt and iscoed the churches of hawarden hanmer bangor worthenhury and the chapelry of orton maddoc in the adjacent parts or wales  the abbey abbey out of which this see was formed was of great antiquity history relates that it had been originally a nunnery founded about the year   0 by wulpherus king of the mercians in favor of his daughters indisposition to a married life this was the celebrated st werburgh who took the veil after living immaculate for three years with her husband ceolredus after the example of her aunt the great ethelreda who cohabited for three years with no less purity with her first spouse tonberctus and for twelve with her second the pious prince egfrid st werburgh presided over several mercian monasteries died at tricengham and by her own order was interred at heanburge but on the approach of the danes in     her body was conveyed to chester as a place of security from the insults of those pagans hiden in gale iii   0   it is uncertain how long this community existed it probably was ruined by the ravages of the barbarians in     and finally suppressed for we are told ibid  that from the reign of king athelstan in     to the coming of the normans a set of canons secular were established in the place of the nuns this pious deed was that of ethelsleda who restored the buildings which afterward were repaired by earl leofric husband to the famous godiva the house was richly endowed by the kings edmund and edgar and by leofric edgars charter begins in a strain equally pious and sublime dugdale monast i  00   on the accession of hugh lupus to this earldom he suppressed the canons secular and established in their place a colony of his countrymen benedictines from bec in normandy for probably he did not care to trust his salvation to the prayers of the saxon religious it is said that this piece of piety was owing to a fit of illness which the earl was seized with when he took the usual way in those days of soothing a troubled conscience anselm abbot of bec and afterward archbishop of canterbury regulated the new foundation and appointed his chaplain richard to be the first abbot lupus and his successors were very liberal in their endowments idem     etc  and the place flourished till its dissolution which was effected by the surrender of the last abbot thomas clerk who received in reward the office of the new deanery which he enjoyed only six weeks the revenues of this great abbey were according to dugdale  00  l   s ii d to speed  0   l    s   d  according to a survey of this abbey preserved in the harleian collection its extent was very considerable surrounding the present square and covering several parts of the adjacent ground the old abbycourt is adorned on two sides by very handsome modern houses built between the years    0 and      on leases granted by the dean and chapter another side is filled by the new palace an elegant pile which rose under the auspices of that munificent and hospitable prelate edmund keen present bishop of ely its place was before occupied by the house of the ancient abbots  the old gate is yet standing is a plain but noble entrance and consists toward the street of two gothic arches included within a round one of great diameter and which appears to have been of far older date one side was the porters lodge on the other a place called st thomass court a chapel dedicated to the same saint stood where the present deanery is and from its ancient appearance seems to have been externally the same building  the cloisters are entire but consist only of three walks the court extending on one side quite to the church by the different arms on the roof it appears to have been repaired at several times from the time of edward iii to that of wsey whose arms with those of the sea of york with the cardinals cap are also to be seen here  on one side stood the fratry school a vast room which is used as a free school founded by henry viii in the   th year of his reign for twentyfour boys who are appointed by the dean and chapter they may continue there four years if their conduct be regular but the dean has power to grant a year of grace no boy unless he be a choirister ought to be chosen before he is nine years old or after he is fifteen two masters are appointed for their instruction a chief and an under master elected by the dean and chapter  in a corner of the east side of the cloister is a passage and stairs to the dormitory and the ancient priests cellars and kitchen on the same side is a passage formerly called the maidens aile    which leads to the little abbycourt a part of the ancient building belonging to the prebends  the beautiful edifice chapter house the chapter house stands in the same walk of the cloister the vestibule is arched supported by four columns each surrounded with eight slender pilasters without capitals which converge near the top of the column and spread over the roof the dimensions of this room are thirtythree feet four inches by twentyseven four the height twelve feet nine on the sides is a stonefeat for the attendants on the business of the chapter  the chapter house is fifty feet long twentysix feet broad end thirtyfive feet high at the upper end is a window consisting of five lancetshaped divisions and on each side is another of three at the height of eight feet and a half from the floor a narrow gallery runs along three parts of the room divided from the windows by a triplet of most elegant lofty slender pillars the roof is of stone the springs of the arches which secure it are supported by neat pilasters with palmy capitals  the modern bookcases deform the lower parts of the room as high as the bottoms of the windows the walls   conjecture had been ornamented with pilasters and had a stoneseat like that of the vestibule the entrance both from the cloisters and between the vestibule and the chapter house are gothic but apparently of a later species of architecture than either of those rooms  the chapter house was built in all probability in the time of rendle the first earl of chesler who died in      after enjoying his earldom eight years the great earl hugh lupus uncle to randle had been interred in the churchyard of the abbey the first care of the nephew was to remove the body into this building leicesters hist antiq      as the most honorable place a respect which would certainly have been paid to it had this edifice existed at the time of his death here his remains continued unmolested till the year      when in digging within the chapter house they were found in a stone coffin wrapped in leather with a cross on the breast and at the head of the coffin a stone in shape of a t with the wolfs head the allusion to his name engraven on it other coffins were discovered beneath the two rooms of earls their countesses or of abbots but the great leveller death had reduced them to dust indistinguishable  the earls who were interred here were hugh who died in   0  randle the first or de meschina in      randle the second or de gernouns who was poisoned in      by william peverel hugh cyvelioc who died at leek in      randle the third or de blundeville who died at wallingford in      where his bowels were interred his heart was buried at the abbey of dieulacres in staffordshire and his body transported to chester finally john scot who in      underwent the same fate as randle the second so that every earl of the norman line were deposited here excepting richard who perished by shipwreck in    0 the particulars of the deaths of this illustriou line may be seen is leicester or in dugdales baronage i    etc     of the abbots geofry who died in   0  and six others were buried in the chapter house or its vestibule williss cathedrals i       the church bounds the north side of the cloisters the lower part of the wall has a row of arches now filled up and savors more of antiquity than any other part this and a portion of the northtransepts are the oldest parts of the present building but there is no part left at present that can boast of a remote date all the labors of the saxons and almost all of those of its refounder hugh lupus are now lost the abbot simon ripley who was elected in      finished the middle aile and the tower the body is supported by six sharppointed arches the columns are thick surrounded by pilasters with small rounded capitals above is a gallery with a neat stone balustrade in the parts where it is entire and a row of large and broad pointed windows which is the general style  the present cathedral appears to have been built excepting the slight fragments just mentioned in the reigns of henry vi vii and viii but principally in that of the two last the beautiful west end was begun in   0  and the first stone laid with much ceremony the window over the door is filled with beautiful tracery and the doorcase enriched with figures and other sculpture the descent into the church is down a multitude of steps so there is reason to suspect that the present was on the foundation of the ancient church which had been on a level with the old streets which we know are many feet higher than they were originally by the accession of rubbish and other adventitious matter  the center beneath the great tower is greatly injured by a modern bellloft which conceals a crownwork of stone that would have a good effect was the loft destroyed  from the springs of arches that appear in the walls of the ne and its ailes it appears as if the architect had intended to have vaulted them in the manner in which st marys chapel and the choiral ailes are done  the choir is very neat and the gothic tabernaclework over the stalls carved in a light and elegant manner the arches in the galleries are divided by pretty slender pillars and perhaps were of a date prior to the body of the church probably the work of abbot oldham who was a benefactor and had a concern in the building  in the chancel are four stonestalls for the officiating priests with carved gothic work above a recess or two for the preserving either the relics or the sacred utensils about the walls are dispersed the monuments of several bishops and churchmen but none of any magnificence and one of sir william manwaring a gallant young man who sell in the defense of the city during its long siege  the bishops throne stands on a stone base as remarkable for its sculpture as its original use its form is an oblong square and each side most richly ornamented with gothic carving arches and pinnacles around the upper part is a range of little images designed to represent the kings and saints of the mercian kingdom each held in one hand a scroll with the name inscribed fanatic ignorance mutilated many of the labels as well as the figures but the last were restored about the year      but the workman by an unlucky mistake has placed female heads on male shoulders and given manly faces to the bodies of the fairsex at first there were thirtyfour figures four are lost the remainder are faithfully described and the history of each monarch and saint accurately given in a little pamphlet published in      by the worthy doctor william cooper who dedicated the profits for the use of the bluecoat hospital in this city i beg leave to dissent from the notion of this having been the shrine of st werbugh st werburchs shrine as it is popularly called it certainly was nothing more than the pedestal on which the real shrine or as the french call it la chasse stood which contained the sacred relics these are made of gold silver vermeil i e silver gilt or some precious materials and often enriched with gems of great value they are of different forms such as churches cabinets etc and should the relic be a head or limb the chasse is made conformable to the shape of the part these are seated usually conspicuous on an elevated place and are always moveable in order that they may be carried in procession either in honor of the saint or to divert some great calamity thus in    0 the shrine of st werburgh was brought out to stop the rage of a fire in the city which for a long time was invincible by every other means but the approach of the holy remains instantly proved their sanctity by putting an end to its furious desolation  before i take leave of this part of the church assassination i must mention an impious outrage committed at the high altar in      by a gentleman of wales who wounded almost to death one patrick filling i suppose the officiating priest the church as usual was immediately suspended till a lustration in order to purify it from the foul stain was performed the abbey was reconciled on st werburghs day the parish church on that of st oswald king ii       an impiety of this kind was committed in the church of notre dame at paris in    0 felibica hist paris ii   00 pieces justif iii      the priest died of his wound and expiation was made by order of the archbishop public prayers were offered up for forty hours in all the churches processions made a fast of three days appointed the whole terminated by a general  reparation satisfaction of the injury by a grand procession in which the whole parliament assisted the streets were covered with tapestry and the avenues barred up with the chains to keep off the mob and thus the place was restored to the discharge of the sacred offices  it is with a kind of horror i read in the zealous fox of an outrage of this sort committed in our own kingdom in the reign of queen mary martyrs iii  the enthusiast was taken and punished by the striking off the criminal hand and by being burnt yet the historian gives him a place among the more wellmeaning sufferers of that barbarous period  behind the choir is st marys chapel and on each side is an aile the monuments in these parts are in no wise remarkable in its northaile is a tomb with a flowery cross that of an abbot and another of an altarform ascribed to henry iv emperor of germany who according to a legendary tale was said to have escaped from his troubles and to have resided in godstall lane in this city to have died there and to have been interred in the abbey it is very uncertain whether this great but calmitous prince was ever in our kingdom but it is very certain be finished his days at liege modern univ hist xxxix     in   0  and was magnificently interred in the cathedral of that city  the transepts are of unequal lengths the north is very large dedicated to st oswald and is the parish church of that name this is said to have stood on the first church of st peter and st paul which was afterward changed to that of the holy trinity and finally to the name it now bears on the rebuilding of the church this aile was designedly enlarged and allotted by the monks to the neighboring inhabitants who were for the most part their servants or tenants at first the religious wished to have the whole to themselves and on that account built at a distance from this aile a chapel called st nicholass and endowed it with a vicarage for the use of the laity but afterward at the request of the inhabitants and by composition between the mayor and abbot about the year      they were restored to the use of the church of st oswald which they still retain king ii          the chapel falling into disuse was purchased by the citizens and converted into their common hall for dispatch of business it is probable that there had been a more ancient common hall a lane in this city still retains the name of old common hall lane  in later times since the building of the exchange it has been converted into a magazine for wool into a carriers warehouse and part into a theater acting under parlementary license  this abbey afforded only a temporary sanctuary to the proshgate the privelege which hugh lupus granted is particular he ordered that no thief or other malefactor that attended the fair held at the feast of st werburgh should be attached unless he committed some new offense there leicester      this says king drew a vast concourse of loose people together at that season and proved of singular advantage to randle the third earl of chester who in being surrounded in the castle of rudland by a numerous army of welsh and in great danger sent for relief to his general roger lacy at that time attending the midsummerfair lacy instantly collected a body of minstrels fiddlers and idle people who were assembled here on account of this privelege marched with them into wales and relieved the earl from his distress randle on his return immediately rewarded lacy with a full power over all the instruments of his preservation megisterium omnium lecatorum et meretricam totius cestreshire by this grant he was empowered to require the attendance of all the minstrels and musicians of the county on the anniversary of the exploit they were to play before him and his heirs for ever in a procession to the church of st john and after divine service to the place where he kept his court the minstrels were there examined concerning their lives and conversation whether any of them played without annual license from their lord or whether they had heard any words among their fellows tending to his dishonor these priveleges were afterward devolved by john son of roger de lacy to hugh de dutton and his heirs the procession and courts were held by their steward within my memory but the custom is now dropped i find also that dutton and his heirs clamed at the feast from the minstrels quatuor lagenas vini et unam lancem four bottles of wine and one lance and at the same time a fee of four pence halfpenny and from every meretrix in cheshire and in the city of chester officium suum exercente four pence leicester       the other religious houses in this city were carmelites the carmelites or white friars who had a convent in that part of st martins parish still called whitefriers lane part of mr marsdens house is formed of the remains the church as appears by brauns view of this city in      stood a little west of it  by the charter of roger lacy to the abbey of norton it appears that there was a monastery in the parish of st michael dugdale monast ii     which he grants to the canons of the former we are left ignorant of the order it was of  in trinity parish stood a house of franciscan or gray friars which bishop tanner conjectures might have been as ancient as the time of henry iii the site was granted to one john cokke i imagine that this stood in the yatch field near the place occupied by the new linnenhall by speeds plan of chester it appears that there was a church there in his time and to this day painted tiles and painted glass relics of ecclesiastical sinery are still dug up  in the parish of st martins rather is that of trinity   s   d is paid at the audit for the site of it was a monastery of preaching or black friars said by speed to have been founded by a bishop of chester meaning as tanner observes of lichfield this as well as the other religious house in this parish was granted to the same john cokke part of this house and its fine vaults are occupied by hanry hesketh esquire  st johns st johns which lies without the walls on the east side of the city was once a collegiate church reputed to have been founded by king ethelred in     on being admonished by a vision to build it on the spot where he should find a white hind after the ruin of the city by the danes the church was restored by his namesake earl of mercia in  0  and was in the next century repaired and endowed by earl leofric a monastery was also founded here for historians record that king edgar was rowed from his palace to the monastery of st john the doomsday book also mentions the monastery of st mary near the same church this besides was the cathedral during the short time the sea was removed from lichfield by bishop peter in an old plan of it appears a house called the bishops  at the dissolution here was found a dean and seven prebendaries or canons in the collation of the bishop of lichfield seven vicars two clerks four choiristers sextons and other servants most of whose houses are distinguished in the same plan their yearly revenue after reprisals was only    l    s   d the site of the college and some part of the buildings were granted by queen elizabeth to john fortescue tanner      on the east side of the churchyard stood the chapel of st anne belonging to the brethren and sisters of the fraternity of st anne harleian mss no          this in later days was called cholmondly hall but is now totally demolished  st johns when entire was a magnificent pile the tower once stood in the center but falling down in      was never rebuilt the chancel was probably demolished at the same time but at that end are some fine arches and other remains of ancient chapels withinside are curious specimens of the clumsy strength of saxon architecture in the massy columns and round arches which support the body the tower is now placed at the west end and has on one side the legend represented by the figure of a man and a hind  on the south side of the churchyard impending over a high cliff supposed to be the radeclive of the doomsday book is a small ancient building probably a chapel called the anchoritage placed over the retreat of some holy hermits this might have been their place of sepulture for in the live rock were found two bodies deposited in coffinshaped cavities this might have been the place where legend says that harold the last saxon king ended his days for it was long believed by the english that he escaped from the battle of hastings and finished his life in retirement  doctor tanner supposes that the convent of benedictine nuns dedicated to st mary originated either from the monastery of st john or was a relic of one of the old nunneries belonging to st werburgh this perhaps may have been the case for from a charter preserved by dugdale it appears that ranale the second earl of chester had obtained for the nuns of chester certain crofts from hugh fitzoliver for them to build a church and convent on which implies that there had been nuns in the city previous to his grant sciatis me dedisse et in perpetuam elemosynam concepisse do et sanctae mariae et monialibus cestriae etc monasticon i  0   i find also that edward the black prince had been a benefactor for there is mention of a charter of his to the nuns granted in the   d of his fathers reign herleian mss no  0       this was suppressed with the other religious houses in      at that time elizabeth grosvenour was prioress who made a surrender of the house and had a pension for life of twenty pounds and eleven of the sisters had also pensions from   l to   l   s   d each the site was granted in the   d of henry viii to the urian breretons senior and junior the revenues were according to dugdale    l    s   d to speed    l    s   d i have a groundplot of this nunnery by which it appears to have been a compact but small building the church was twentytwo yards long and fifteen broad and supported in the middle by a row of pillars the chapel was nine yards by four threequarters the cloisters thirty yards by twentyone it stood in the nurserygarden on the west side of the city still called the nuns garden where vestiges of the walls and arches are yet remaining  without the northgate stood a hospital dedicated to st john the baptist and formerly a sanctuary and endowed with great priveleges the mastership was granted by edward ii to the prior of berkinhead and his successors but afterward disposed of by the crown to secular clergy the house at the dissolution consisted of a chaplain and six poor brethren whose income after reprisals was    l   s  0 d tanner     mention is made by bishop tanner    of the liberties of the hospital of st giles being confirmed by edward iii i am told that a fragment supposed to be part of this charity is to be seen in the forest street  the last ancient hospital was instituted for lepers in the suburbs of boughton about the beginning of edward iis reign i think opposite to the place of excution the buryingground is still made use of by the parish of st oswald  the number of parishes are nine none of the churches are remarkable excepting those of st peters and trinity which are distinguished by their handsome spires the first was finished in      when the parson and others signalized themselves by eating part of a goose on it and flinging the rest into the four streets king i      the number of inhabitants including the suburbs of boughton and hanbridge are estimated to be fourteen thousand seven hundred and thirteen the houses are almost entirely situated in a dry sandstone rock whether it be owing to that the clearness of the air and the purity of the water it is certain that the proportion of death among the inhabitants is only as one to thirtyone whereas i am informed by my worthy friend doctor haggarth of this city that in leeds one in twentyone in northampton and shrewsbury one in twentysix and in london one in twenty and threefourths annually pay the great tribute of nature  i do not recollect any thing remarkable on the outside of the walls which has been unnoticed unless it be the roodeye and the adjacent places the dee after quitting the contracted pass at the bridge flows beneath an incurvated clayey cliff and washes on the right a fine and extensive meadow long since protected against its ravages by a lofty dike i imagine that it lay open to the tides till about the year      when the corporation to whom it belongs demised to one thomas lyneal servant to sir francis walsingham this pasture for the term of twentyone years together with as much land as he could gain to it from the sea he was also to make at his own costs a quay for boats and barks to unload at full sea near the watergate for which he was at first to have two pence for every vessel passing by with any lading but after that the sum was increased to four pence and lyneal was to pay an annual rent of  0 l to the city at first he met with some obstructions sir francis therefore interfered in order that his servant might proceed without further interruption

days exercised themselves in manly sports of the age in archery running leaping and wrestling in mockfights and gallant and romantic triumphs from the hints dropped by daniel king i imagine them to have been of the same nature with those practiced by the young men of the metropolis described by fitzstephen a writer cotemporary with henry ii the lay sons of the citizens rush out of the gates in

generous coursers neigh and champ the bit at length when the course begins and the youthful combatants are divided into classes or parties one body retreats and another pursues without being able to overtake them while in another quarter the pursuers overtake the foe unhorse them and pass them many a length the elders of the city and the fathers of the parties and the rich and the wealthy come into the field on horseback to behold the exercises vide fitzstephens deser lend translated by an antiquary              one would imagine by what follows the ancient historian was describing the sports of ascanius and his youthful train on the plains of sicily  postquam omnem laeti consessum oculosque suoram lustravere in equis etc now round the ring before their fathers ride the boys in all their military pride till the loud lash resounding from afar gave the glad signal of the mimic war strait in three bands distinct they break away divide in order and their ranks display swift at the summons they return and throw at once their hostile lances at the foe then take a new excursion on the plain round within round an endless course maintain and now advance and now retreat again with welldissembled rage their rivals dare and please the crowd with images of war alternate now they turn their backs in flight now dart their lances and renew the fight then in a moment from the combat cease rejoin their scattered bands and move in peace pit a standard was the prize of emulation in the sports celebrated on the roodeye which was won in      by sheriff montford on shrovetuesday  but in the year   0  the amusements took a new form and under the reign of the peaceful james the youthful cavaliers laid aside their mimic war and began that species of horsemanship which the romantic philosopher lord herbert thought unworthy of a man of honor for says he the exercise i do not approve is the running of horses there being much cheating in that kind  the first prizes we hear of after the suppression of the triumph were a bell and bowl to be run for on st georges day which were provided in   0  by mr robert amery formerly sheriff of the city and were brought down to the roodeye with great solemnity this seems to have been the origin of the plate given by the city and annually run for on the same day to the present time a bell was a common prize a little golden bell was the reward of victory in   0  at the races near york whence came the proverb for success of any kind to bear the bell  at one end of the roodeye stands the house of industry poorhouse a large and useful building founded in      by money raised by the city on lifeannuities for several improvements within its liberties here the poor are provided for in a fit manner and to the great ease of the parishes who are relieved from the burden of a numerous poor who were too idle to work and too proud to enter into this comfortable asylum those of the parish of hawarden are also sent here by virtue of an agreement made between the governors of this charity and the overseers of the poor of that parish the inmates contribute by some coarse linen manufactures toward their support  a little beyond this building are the quays quays cranes warehouses and other requisites for carrying on the naval trade of this city these are opposite to the watergate and have been much improved of late years and the intervening space has not long since been filled with a neat street ships of   0 tons burden can now reach the quays where the springtides rise at a medium fifteen feet the neaptides eight in the year      this port was in so deplorable a state and so choked with sands that a vessel of twenty tons could not arrive here but the ships were obliged to lie under neston ten miles distant which gave rise to the assemblage of houses called parkgate built on the shore beneath that town a quay called the new quay now in ruins was erected near this place in the beginning harleaan mss no  00     of the last century for the convenience of loading and unloading the vessels trading with chester and the goods were carried to and from the city by land the misfortune of the port of chester at length gave rise to the prosperity of leverpool about this time a very inconsiderable place it now began to discover its own advantages of situation and quickly emerged from its despicable state to its present flourishing condition  in      new cut some friend to the former prevaled on mr andrew yarranton a gentleman extremely conversant in the commercial advantages of this island to make a survey of the river dee and its estuary he drew a plan formed the project of a new channel a scheme for recovering from the sea a large tract of land and restoring the ancient navigation even to the present quays and this he got to be presented to the duke of york the patron at that time of all useful undertakings he also suggested the idea of a canal from the collieries at aston near hawarden which was to drop into this new channel and facilitate the carriage of coal up to the city mr andrew yarrantons englands improvements by sea and land etc to london      his plan for that of the dee is at p      future times had the advantage of his inventive genius both plans were brought into execution without any great deviation from mr yarrantons project his new cut was to end opposite to flint the present opens opposite to wepra on this side of flint sir john glynnes little canal approaches the dee about two miles below the city mr yarrantons coal canal was to fall into the dee near to flint  an act of parliament was obtained for the recovering and preserving the navigation of the river for settling the duties on ships and for the establishing two ferries for the convenience of travelers into the county of flint other acts were passed in the years         0         and the works were begun with vigor the project was carried on by subscription and the adventurers were to be rewarded by the lands they were empowered to gain on both sides from the white sands or the sea from chester and between the county of cheshire on the northside and the county of flint on the fouthside being sands soil and ground not bearing grass party contests at first filled the subscriptions zeal for the house of hanover was at that time mixed in this city with zeal for its commercial interest but in a little time it was discovered to be the madness of many but the gain of few the expenses proved enormous multitudes were obliged to sell out at above ninety per cent loss and their shares being bought by persons of more wealth and foresight at length the plan was brought to a considerable degree of utility and a sine canal formed guarded by vast banks in which the river is consined for the space of ten miles along which ships of three hundred and fifty tons burden may safely be brought up to the quays much land has been gained from the sea and good farms now appear in places not long since possessed by the unruly element  i remember an almost useless tide flowing about the watertower the ancient channel of the dee flowing under blacon point and the access to the county of flint on this side open only at the recess of tides and annually occasioning the loss of multitudes of lives two ferries are established at fit places the lower is the proper passage for travelers by holyhead into the kingdom of ireland and calls aloud for the aid of a turnpike to render it at all times pervious or the road may be continued to saltney along the flat so as to fall into the other turnpike on the marsh  i shall now take a short view of the trade of this city trade as it stood in the years      and      i bring the last into sight in order to show how far this port has been affected by the commotions of our american subjects and oppose it to the commerce of      when it appears to have been in its meridian since the restoration of the channel in that year were entered inwards      coastingvessels    of which were laden with groceries and other goods from london      coast ships outward of these    came from the port of london and were laden here with lead iron cannon two thousand tons of cheese and other goods  in the same year    vessels were entered inwards from foreign parts and     entered inwards from ireland portugal spain italy and america  from norway and the baltic are imported timber flax tallow hemp iron and deals  from leghorn large quantities of kid and lamb skins which are manufactured by the glovers after being dressed here this in fact is the only manufacture which the city can boast of i find that in the reigns of queen elizabeth james i and the beginning of that of charles i here was a vast trade in calves skins in the first of those monopolizing times the queen grants one arthur balsano a license to export  000 dickers of leather of calves skins ten dozens to every dicker for seven years paying five shillings per dicker james i granted to james maxwel esquire a license to export   000 dickers for the same duty and for twentyone years and this was afterward confirmed to him by charles i harleian mss no  00          this maxwel was one of the grooms of the bedchamber to his majesty and in the preceding reign by a piece of insolence to a gentleman of the inns of court brought on him the resentment of the english and was obliged to atone for it by making due submission the first grant might be made to him by james to make amends for the mortifications he had undergone  from spain and portugal are imported great quantities of cork fruit oil of olives nuts barilla ashes and raisins and several hundred tons of wine from portugal which last form the greatest foreign import of this city  while the trade with america was open fish and oil were brought from newfoundland and a small trade was carried on with caroling  the exports this year were upwards of  000 chaldrons of coal from the cheshire and flintshire collieries which lie within this port  000 tons of lead  00 of lead ore  00 of oak bark all these to foreign parts besides    0 tons of lead and     of lead ore sent coastways that is to the ports of london and leverpool vae nimium vicina for the purpose of reexportation  in       0  coastingvessels were entered inwards and     outward      ships entered inwards from foreign parts including those trading between dublin and parkgate and     outward the following table will show the division of the commerce  inwards outward america     france    flanders   holland   ireland   0  0  isle of man     portugal     spain   italy     norway russia and prussia  0         chaldrons of coal      tons of lead and     of lead ore were sent abroad but so exhausted are our oaktrees that only    tons of bark were shipped      tons of lead and     of lead ore were sent coastways  from the table of entries it appears that the great trade of this city is with ireland which receives annnally from hence  a magazine large quantities of hops woollen cloths worsted stuffs hosiery fustians manchester goods cheese wroughtiron iron great guns hardware bound and unbound books carpets flintglass wrought silks and great quantities of foreign goods sent from london by land and shipped from this port  in return it imports from ireland at the midsummer and michaelmas fairs upwards of  000 boxes and packs of linen cloth containing   000 pieces at lest besides  00 boxes or packs imported into leverpool and sent across the mersey to ince from whence they are conveyed in carts to chester these form all together a million of yards each fair this trade began no longer ago than the year      in which         yards were imported the importations continually increased till the last year of the late war from which period it has been on a par  ireland also sends considerable quantities of lambskins wool linen and bayyarn tallow hides butter feathers and quills ox bones and hoofs glue sheep and cat guts calvevelves provisions and live cattle  the number of ships belonging to this port show the uncommercial genius of its inhabitants there being only twentytwo in the foreign trade containing in all      tons and     men and    in the coasttrade whose tonnage is   0 tons and number of men    yet the port extends on the cheshire side of the estuary as far as the end of wiral and on the flintshire to the verryd or the mouth of the clwyd  there was lately a very fair prospect of adding much to the trade of the city by an iland navigation canal which was begun with great spirit a few years ago it was to run through the county beneath beeston castle and to terminate near middlewich another branch was to extend to namptwich one mouth opens into the dee below the watertower a fine basin is formed into which the boats are to descend by means of five successive locks beneath the northern walls of the city cut in the live rock a few miles of this design are completed but by an unhappy miscalculation of expense and by unforeseen difficulties occurring in the execution such enormous charges were incurred as to put a stop for the present to all proceedings the other branch which was to extend toward middlewich was to end within a limited distance from the great canal between the trent and mersey navigation the great objects were the salt and cheese trade and coal for the supply of the interior parts of cheshire from the vast collieries in staffordshire share also in the exportation of hardware earthenware and all the manufactures of the internal part of the kingdom within its reach might have been reasonably expected  the idea of a canal along the dead flat between chester and ince has been long since conceived by persons very conversant in the nature of the trade of this city one mouth might have opened into the dee in the place of the present another near ince which would create a ready intercourse with leverpool the weever and the saltworks and great dairies on that river with warrington and with the flourishing town of manchester and a numerous set of places within reach of the mersey and of the canal belonging to that useful peer the duke of bridgewater to which the greatest of our inland navigations is connected this little cut the city might and still may enjoy unenvied unrivalled and what is a material consideration the distance is trifling seven miles according to burdets map  the expenses small and the profits to the undertakers great  on leaving the city i repassed hanbridge and at the may pole took the left hand road which is a continuation of the roman road from the river the strait direction is the only proof of its antiquity till it falls into the fields on the left where its tract is often distinguishable by certain ridges or elevated spots the farmer also in digging often falls on adventitious matters such as gravel and remains of pavements it points toward eccleston near which are the relics of a mount the site perhaps of a small castlet it passes through eaton park and crosses the dee at oldford  the village of eccleston is prettily seated near the dee eccleston and commands a view of the towers and spires of chester rising above the wooded banks the most extensive prospect is from a bench on eccleston hill on the roadside which takes in the vast environs of wales cheshire and part of shropshire forming a n admirable composition of rich cultivation bounded by hills of various forms  eccleston retains the same name which it had at the conquest it was held at that time by gilbert de venables from hag lupus before that event by edwin a freeman on the demesne land were two servants four villeyns and a boor a boat and a net part of the place afterward fell to the vernors of kinderlen and finally by a late purchase was added by the family of the grosvenours to their ancient property in this parish the church is a rectory dedicated to st mary  a little farther is eaton eatos or the hamlet on the water a name the most common of any in england at the conquest here was a fishery which employed six fishermen and yielded a thousand salmon this fishery has long since ceased but during its existence the minister of eccleston clamed the twentieth fish the seat of the ancient family of the gresvenours lies in this township a brick house built about the latter end of the last century the gresvenours came in with the conqueror and took their name from the office they held in the norman court that of grand huntsman their first settlement in this county was over lostock bestowed by hugh lupus on his great nephew robert le gresvenour in      richard le grosvenour purchased and fixed his seat at hulme but in the reign of henry vi by the marriage of rawlin or ralph gresvenour with jean daughter of john eaton of eaton esquire it was transferred to this place while chivalry was the passion of the times few families shon in so distinguished a manner none

welsh side an ancient borough and corporation consisting of a mayor two bailiffs and a coroner the inhabitants with those of ruthin and denbigh enjoy the privelege of contributing toward sending a burgess to parliament this town was incorporated by charter granted by thomas earl of arundel dated from his castle of lions    0 the grant is very partial charter running in this form to the burgesses of our town and to their heirs and successors being englishmen this might arise from the hatred of the lord marchers to the welsh on account of the insurrection of glyndwr at that time scarcely suppressed this instilled into the inhabitants a spirit retained perhaps to this moment for within these few years they were the most irascible and pugnacious of all the neighborhood this town is in the parish of gresford but in the diocese of chester it is the only appertenance remaining on this side of the dee of the vast grant made by edward the confessor to that see of all the land on the other side of the river which he first gave and then took from our prince gryssydd ap llewelyr doomsday book in lester     the church is a very handsome building yet no more than a chapel to the former on the font are the arms of the warrens in a window those of the stanlies former owners of the place  the poor relics of the castle are seated close to the river and are insulated by a vast fosse cut through a deep bed of soft red stone castle which seems originally to have been thus quarried for the building of the castle this fortress consisted of five bastions and the work cut into that form to serve as a base to as many towers an ancient survey i met with in the museum among the harleian mss taken in    0 by john norden when it was entire will give a true idea of this curious structure it had been defended in three parts by the great chasm formed by the quarry on the fourth by the dee into which jutted a great quay still to be seen in very dry seasons for it has long since been covered by the encroachment of the river  originally this place had been a small outpost to deva slopes and other now almost obsolete works may be seen near the castle and on the opposite side of the water and coins have been found here that put the matter out of doubt i have seen some of antoninus galienus constantinus and constantius i conjecture that the roman name had been castra legionis and the welsh castle llcon or the castle of the legion because it was garrisoned by a detachment of the legion stationed at chester the english borderers might easily mistake lleon for the plural of llew which signifies a lion and so call it the castle of lions as we find it styled when it came into possession of earl warren and his successors  this country formed part of powysland powysland which when entire reached in a straight line from broxton hills in cheshire southerly to pengwern powys or shrewsbury including a large tract in both these counties from thence through the eastern limits of montgomeryshire comprehending all that county part of radnorshire and breeknockshire then turning northward included the wmmwds of mowddwy edeyrnion and glyndyfrdwy merionyddshire and circuiting part of denbighshire comes along part of the clwydian hills to the summit of moelsamma including all denbighshire excepting those parts which at present constitute the lordships of denbigh and ruthin from hence taking  southeasterly direction to broxton hills asserts its right to mdale hopedale and maeler in hintshire i have before taken notice that offas encroachment was but temporary and of short duration i must farther observe that in the articles of pacification powels notes on girald itin cambr lib ii c ii between henry iii and our last prince lle the limits of the principality experienced but a very small dminution from what it was in offas time when it was agreed that the dee should be the boundary from wirral to castra lnum or holt and from thence a direct line to pengwern powys  it was perhaps of much greater extent under the reign of brochwel ysgythrog who was defeated by the saxons at the battle of chester after this event the borders became a scene of rapine the welsh and the mercians alternately making the the most terrible inroads ino each others dominions bid hist h ii c z p  0 sax cir     till the time of offa who passing the severn with a mighty force expelled the britons from their fruitful seats on the plains and reduced the kingdom of powys to the western side of the celebrated ditch still known by his name the princes of pows were then constrained to quit their ancient residence at pengwern or shrewsbury and remove it to one not less fertile to mathraval in the beautiful vale of meivod from this period their kingdom was called indifferently that of powys or of mathraval the plains of shropshire became a confirmed part of the mercian kingdom the transsabrine portion of gloucestershire and worcestershire and the county of hereford submitted to the yoke but after some time the tract which forms the country above croesoswallt or oswestry and the two maelors gymraeg or the present bromsield and saesneg or the present flintshire maclor with many other cwmmwds relapsed to its natural masters such was its state till     the reign of roderic the great prince of all wales who in his mothers right possessed north wales in that of his wife south wales and by that of his granmother nest sister and heiress to congen ap cadell king of powys he added powysland to his dominions powel     he according to the destructive custom of gavelkind divided his principality among his children to anarawd he gave north wales to cadell south wales to mervyn powysland each wore a talaith or diadem of gold beset with preclous stones whence they were styled y tywyg taleithing or the three crowned princes  after the death of mervyn cadell usurped the portion of his brother his eldest son howel dda or the good in   0 again united all wales into one government he left four sons who divided south wales and powys between them while north wales was assumed in     by jevaf and jago sons to his predecessor edwal voel the confusion that ensued on this occasion prevents me from saying any thing with certainty till bleddyn ap cynvyn who ruled wales at the time of the conquest reunited the kingdoms of north wales and powys the succession to the principality passed away from his children but powysland devolved to his sons which came at length entire to meredith the eldest born after the contentions and slaughter usual after such partitions powel notes upon girald itin cambr lib ii c      meredith made the division which finally destroyed the power of this once potent kingdom to his eldest son madoc he gave the part which bore afterward the name of powys vadog to gryssydd the portion which was called gwenwynwyn powel       i leave to a future disquisition the account of the remaining parts of powysland i shall only trace the succession of the first which belongs more particularly to my subject powys vadog consisted according to the division of the times of five cantress or hundred townships and these

one son named madoc in whom the inheritance remained entire  we now hasten to the end of the line madoc had only one son gryffydd commonly called lord of dinas bran because he made that fortress his chief residence he unfortunately became enamoured of emma an english lady daughter of james lord audley who alienating his affections from his country made him one instrument of its subjection and of the destruction of his own family he took part with henry iii and edward i against his natural prince the resentment of his countrymen was raised against him and he was obliged to confine himself in his castle of dinas bran where probably grief and shame put an end to his life he left four children under age madoc llewelyn gryffydd and owen edward i gave the guardianship of madoc the eldest who was to have for his share the lordship of bromfield and yale the castle of dinas bran and the reversion of maelor saesneg after the death of his mother to john earl warren and of llewelyn who was to possess the lordships of chirk and nanheudwy to roger mortimer son of lord mortimer of wigmore these lords soon conspired to free themselves from their charge and possess themselves of their estates and accordingly caused the poor children to be drowned under holtbridge this i discovered in a manuscript communicated to me by the reverend mr price keeper of the bodleian library before that the manner of their deaths was current in the country under the fable of two young fairies who had been destroyed in that manner and in the same place but the foundation of the tale was till very lately totally lost  having now brought the succession to the required period i shall only say that gryffydd the third son was suffered to enjoy his portion of glyndyfrdwy from whom sprung owen the great revenger of the wrongs of his family and the fourth son owen received for his share cynllaeth this afterward devolved to gryffydd father of glyndwr  the barbarity of the two guardians so far from being punished by their master was rewarded warren had the grant of dinas bran and all bromfield confirmed to him dated from rudland october  th      ayloffs rotuli walliae     mortimer that of chirk the former began immediately to secure his illgotten possessions by building holt castle but dying left the finishing of it to his son william before this grant a family of the name of holt held this place i suppose under its lord paramount these estates continued in the family till      when on the death of john earl warren they devolved to edward fitzalan earl of arundel in right of his wife alice sister to the former warren had been divorced from his wife joan de baars and had obtained from edward ii a grant of his welsh estates and others in surrey and sussex in favor of john and thomas sons of his by maud de nereford to whom he had been contracted before his marriage with joan these children probably died without issue the estates reverting as he had in such a case provided to his own right heirs dugdale baron i      they continued with the fitzalans during three generations richard ii probably seized on them after the execution of richard earl of arundel for we find that unhappy prince had lodged in holt castle during his irish expedition jewels to the value of two hundred thousand marks and a hundred thousand marks in coin holinshed  which with the fortress were delivered to bolingbroke previous to the deposal of richard thomas the son of richard was restored in blood in the following reign he died in      without issue and his unsettled estates fell to his sissters elizabeth who had married thomas mowbray duke of norfolk but then wife to sir gerard useflect and joan who had married william bauchamp lord of abergavenny this occasioned a further division of these estates joans share fell again by a daughter to nevil lord abergavenny after which i lose fight of the succession till the reign of henry vii when that prince made a grant of them to sir william stanley on his execution henry not only resumed the lordship but seized on his vast effects and found in holt castle in money and plate forty thousand marks besides jewels household goods and cattle on his ground leicester       henry viii bestowed this lordship on his natural son henry fitzroy duke of richmond and had possession given him at its capital of holt in      by the duke of norfolk and others king ii      he enjoyed his honor but a short time dying at the age of seventeen in the year       in the following reign i find it in possession of thomas seymour lord admiral and turbulent brother to the protector somerset he made the fortress at holt subservient to his ambitious designs and formed there a great magazine of warlike stores dugdale baron ii      his deserved but illegal execution again flung bromfield into possession of the crown   castle   the great earl of leicester was in possession of chirk and probably of the whole lordship of bromfield  in      holt castle was in the hands of the crown but in that year was feized for the use of the parliament by sir william brereton and sir thomas middhton whitelock    idem      0   the royalists recovered the possession in february       it was closely besieged by major general mytton drake parlem hist xiv      and vigorously defended by the governor sir richard lloyd of ecclusham near wrexham till the beginning of april when it was surrendered on articles the governor having permission to go beyond sea with three hundred pounds and his lady to enjoy his lands being three hundred pounds a year whitelock     immediately after the parliament got possession it was ordered to be demolished  the lordship is at present in the crown under the direction of the steward of bromfield and yale an office in his majestys disposal but a grant of the minerals the far more valuable part was made to the grosvenour family in the reign of charles i subject to the annual payment of twenty shillings an attempt was made by king william to alienate these important domains in favor of the earl of portland and his heirs for ever but on a vigorous representation of the illegality but particularly on the noble speech british biogr vii app     of robert price esquire afterward baron of the exchequer his majesty thought fit to withdraw the grant already made out in the treasury the whole rents at that time resulting to the crown amounted only to a thousand a year besides mises reliefs and other contingent profits the mise was in wales a customary present made to the prince on his accession in old times in cattle but after its conquest changed into money it amounted to about five thousand pounds it was paid thrice in the time of james i first at his coming to the crown secondly on the creation of his son henry prince of wales thirdly on the creation of charles  on leaving holt i returned over the bridge and passing along a portion of cheshire in a flat country with a pleasing view of the broxton hills on the left i reached the site of shocklach castle this with great part of the ancient hundred of dudestan was held after the conquest by robert fitzbugh from hugh lupus it belonged to the barony of malpas but on the division of it one part came to john de sutton baron of dudley the other to urien de sancto petro what is remarkable it was held of queen elizabeth as of her manor of east greenwich nothing excepting a fosse marks the place of this fortress on the opposite side of the road is a vast mount probably of far greater antiquity than the castle and exploratory commanding a great view around by the name of stretton a neighboring place i conjecture that a roman road went this way but my time did not permit me to search after it  at a small distance from shocklach castle i entered maelor saesneg a hundred of flintshire disjoined from the rest of the county at the time of the making of the doomsday book the lands about worthenbury overton and bettisfield or the present parish of hanmer belonged to the hundred of dudestan but long before the forming of the new hundreds which according to sir peter leicester did not happen much later than the reign of edward iii it is

his arms against the english this induced john to divest llewelyn of the government of so important a fortress as a frontier castle for by a writ dated from warwick in the tenth year of his reign he

died in an advanced age and was buried at abberbury  i must not forget that it is related of this fulk that being at the play of chess with john second son to henry ii he received from him a blow with the board which he returned with such violence as almost to demolish the young prince  the succeeding fulk did not degenerate from his ancestors he rendered himself so renowned in the wars abroad that a french romance was composed on the actions of himself and progenitors and translated into english under the title of the gestes of guarine and his sons much of it is preserved in the first volume of lelands collectanea p   0  it consists as in the case of most writings of this nature of a mixture of some truth with much fiction  to him was restored the castle of whittington and its dependencies after satisfaction had been made by king john to wrenoc and wennen the sons of meyric on whom the prince of wales had bestowed it in the reign of henry ii wrenoc received certain lands in the

afterward from his allegiance to john and was excommunicated by name rymer for his defection from that monarch but his sufferings were in the cause of liberty for he was among the glorious band who obtained from john the charter so highly prized by every true briton  it appears that he did not neglect in the following reign to obtain a confirmation of these estates and to secure them to all posterity he obtained in      from henry iii a grant of whittington to him and his heirs for which he gave the king two hundred and sixtytwo pounds and two coursers he also procured the liberty of a market here on a wednesday and a  fair on st lukes day for which he presented his majesty with a palfrey fairs the first is lost there are still considerable fairs or shows of cattle on the last thursdays in april july and september  from another favor bestowed on him by the same monarch in the year    0 it appears that probably the castle of whittington had been dismantled by the welsh for henry gives permission to this fulk to fortify it the memory of this is still preserved in a room in the gateway by the figure of a knight on horseback coarsely painted on the wall with the following lines now almost obliterated placed beneath  this was sir foulk fitzwarren late a great and valiant knight who kept the britons still in awe and oftimes put to flight he of this castle owner was and held it by command of henry late surnamed the third then king of all this land his grandfather a lorrainer by fame was much befriended who peverleys daur took to wife from this foul descended his ancient feats of chivalry in annals are recorded our king of england afterward him baron made and lorded dugdale informs us that this baron was drowned in a river at the battle of jews fighting in behalf of the king but mr mytton reasonably supposes that it must have been his son who appeared in the field that day for from the time that this fulk was appointed lieutenant of the marches by richard i to that of the battle seventyfive years had elapsed so it is probable that he was dead or at lest unable to act the warrior his son therefore must have been the person who fell in that fatal action followed by a body of hardy soldiers raised in these marches inured to war by their frequent conflicts with the welsh  immediately on the defeat the rebel victor montfort earl of leicester appointed peter de montfort a creature of his own governor of this castle and soon after making use of the captive monarchs power against himself obliged him rymer i     to resign to llewelyn ap gryffydd prince of wales the hundred of ellesmere several of the border castles and among others that of whittington and its appertenances this writ was dated from hereford june   d      henry also ceded to him the sovereignty of wales and homage of all the welsh barons and the lord of whittington these grants were afterward confirmed to him by henry with the homage of the neighboring counties which were usually paid to princes ancestors in consideration of  0000 marks paid by llewelyn  in      fulk attended edward i in his expedition against the welsh and was rewarded by the grant of free warren on his lands in this manor  in   00 he had a feud with his potent neighbor richard earl of arundel but it was prevented by the interference of the king  he died in the reign of edward ii his

by edmund earl of kent uncle to the king of raising seditious reports that edward ii was still alive and endeavoring to excite a rebellion for this offense his castle of whittington was seized but by the intercession of his peers restored to him the following year  in the insurrection of owen glyndwr the vassals favored his cause but their lord obtained a pardon for them from henry iv  in    0 the

this county  the castle stands on a flat the gateway castle and the ruins of two vast round towers with cruciform slips by way of windows still remain and the bare vestiges of two others may yet be traced it had been surrounded by a moat and several vast ditches which comprehended several other works the moat was filled by a rivulet that rises near pentre pant in the parish of selatyn on entering this parish it is lost for near a mile and emerges in the fields on the back of the castle  it is probable that this was a place of defense from the time of its earliest possessors no place on the borders of unfriendly nations could possibly remain unfortified but the architect of the castle whose ruins we now contemplate was certainly the great fitzwarine granson of guarine founder of the family these were among the greatest of the barons called lord marchers of wales of whose origin an ample account will be given in the appendix  the steward of the manor holds annually a court leet and court baron in a room in the castle steward to which the inhabitants are summoned and fined one penny each for nonattendance chiefrents are paid to the lord and a heriot of the best beast is clamed at the death of most of the freeholders within the lordship  the church church dedicated to st john the baptist is a rectory valued in the kings books at    l   s it is a small building supposed to have been originally designed as the chapel to the castle and made out of the refuse materials of that fortress by its founder according to the tradition of the place he was buried in the porch it being an act of devotion in those days for all persons on their entrance into churches or religious houses to pray for the souls of the founders and benefactors fulk fitzwarine seventh of the name who had the greatest revenue of any of the family by will dated the   th of richard ii directed that his body should be buried in the chancel the largest part of his estates were in other counties but he gave this place the preference as the ancient seat of the family  in the year    0 a commission was issued from the council in the marches of wales to john trevor and richard lloyd gentlemen to make a terrier of the glebeland and to return an inventory of the furniture belonging to it among which were found three pair of armor furnished with two pikes and two headpieces these

legendary piety on this spot on august  th     sax chron     was fought the battle between the christian oswald king of the northumbrians and the pagan penda king of the mercians oswald was defeated and lost his life the barbarian victor cut the body of the slain prince into pieces and stuck them on stakes dispersed over the field as so many trophies or according to the ancient verses that relate the legend his head and hands only were thus exposed  cujus et abscissum caput abscissosque lacertos et tribus affixos palis pendere cruentos penda jubet per quod reliquis exempla relinquat terroris

victor got provd to the vanquished king the happier lot for now the martyred saint in glory views how oswy with success the war renews and penda scarcely can support his throne whilst oswald wears a neverfailing crown it is probable that the britons bestowed on the spot where the battle was fought the name of maes her or the long field or combat from the obstinacy of the conflict the saxons for a considerable time retained the name of the place where the action was fought with the addition of their own vernacular word feld or selth a field as maserfeld maserfelth and corruptly masafeld  campus

ecclesia album monasterium and whiteminster it is very singular that no evidences exist either of the time of the foundation or of the dissolution the last must have happened in saxon days for immediately after the conquest the church of st oswald was bestowed on the abbey of shrewsbury bishop tanner doubts whether there ever was a monastery here monasticon      but the authority of leland puts this much out of the question  that there once stood here some sort of religious foundation for he expressly says that the cloisters with tombs of the monks remained in the memory of man itin v     i am inclined to think it to have been collegiate a species of establishment very frequent in places of martyrdoms or of assassinations reverential or expiatory according to the nature of the event something of this kind existed here toward the  end of the reign of henry ii for reinerus bishop of st  who had a house near the place alienated all the tithes of  and corn of this church and its

has given two places that title for the saxon heafenseld in northumberland has the same meaning and received it on account of the victory he obtained there over the cumbrian prince oswald attributing his success solely to the intervention of heaven  the present church is of no great antiquity church is spacious and has a handsome plain tower we learn from a monument in memory of mr hugh y that the old church was demolished in      i suppose that the present immediately rose on the ruins it stands quite out of the town in a suburb without the newgate is a vicarage under the patronage of the earl

fortified with a wall and four gates walls and gates that called the blackgate is demolished the newgate the willowgate and the beatricegate still remain the last is a handsome building with a guardroom on both sides and over it the arms of the alas a lion rampant it probably was built by thomas earl of arundel in the beginning of the reign of henry iv who bestowed the name on it in honor of his wife beatrix natural daughter to the king of portugal  over the newgate is the figure of a horse in full speed with an oaken bough in his mouth there is a conjecture but i will not pretend to

of the fitzala earls of anel a potent race that flourished with fewer checks than usual with greatness for near five hundred years  sir william dule baronage says that there was a castle at  at the time of the conquest which i think pree the artificial mount on which it was placed indica to have been earlier than the nrman aer the britns and the  gave their fortresses this species of elevation the normn bulk on the fm and natural sol or rock but often made use of these mounts wnich they found to have been the site of a saxon castle i believe this to have been the case with that in question a fitzalan repaired or rebuilt and added to that which he met with here a tower also as is not unfrequent might receive the name of mdor complimentary either to the son of meredydd or some other great man of the same title  this castle was the residence of the normn owners and had been completely finished i had its  or yard which comprehended that part or the town still called the baily head its barbican or outergate where the maimed and blind were commonly relieved a mount on the outside of the great ditch was the site of this building and from the use bears to this day the name of cripplegate lastly it had its chapel placed at a little distance dedicated to st nicholas and was in the gift of the earls of arundel  i will not tire the reader with a dry list of successors to this place or the guardians of such who were under age i will only observe that after the execution of edmund earl of arudel on the reign of edward ii his queen to show her predilection to her gentle mortimer obtained the possession of it for that favorite  the town was favored with considerable priveleges from its als its first charter from its brevity called by the welsh  gwa or the short charter harlian mss no         was granted by william earl  in the reign of henry ii sharta gt  i must observe here that  parted to the burgesses the same priveleges with  of  ury  the same william in a scutage made in kins johns ti was not to do ward at any place but blancminster for the knights fees held by him nor to furnish more than ten soldier horse or foot within the county of salop nor more than five out of it  his son john took part with the barons against king j who in revenge marched to oswestry in      wys hist wales     and reduced the town to ashes on the death of that prince he was reconciled to his successor henry iii fair and in      obtained for his mnor of blancminster the grant of a fair upon the eve the day and the day after the feast of st andrew he also make the bailliffs clerks of the market with power to imprison  persons who used fraudulent ways in buying or selling  which they paid the consideration of twenty marks these people frequently abused their power it is therefore no wonder that so many of the grievances which the welsh so much complained of to edward i should originate from this place powel       in      this unfortunate town experienced a second destruction being again burnt by llewelyn ap jrwerth prince of wales idem      provision was now made against future insults for in the next reign that of edward i the town was surrounded with walls this happened when that politic monarch meditated the conq of wales therefore thought proper to secure this town  of the keys of the country with proper defense  in     the reign of his unfortunate son edmund earl of arundel was commanded to raise two hundred foot diers out of colne and this neighborhood to repel the scots  in      edward iii granted another fair to this town and in      directed edmund fitzalan to raise two hundred of his vassals from clun and oswestry to attend him in the french wars  in      richard earl of arundel being attainted and executed the king richard

great benefactor to the corporation he gave it a release in   0  from a hundred pounds that they were indebted to him in consideration of the distresses the town suffered during the insurrection of glyndwr he also obtained a pardon from the king for his vassals in chirk rfield and this manor for the share they took in that commotion  in the same year with the release he granted a most extensive charter to the town containing many matters that show the customs of the times and merits on that account a detail of some of the particulars to began with a most essential one his charter neither the lord or his heirs should confiscate or seize the effects of persons dying with or without will in the corporation that no burgess should be compelled to be the ods receivergeneral but only collector of the issues arising within the borough that the burgesses should be discharged from all fees demanded by the constable of the castle or any  his menial servants for any felonies or trespasses committed out of the same liberties when brought to the prison of the castle saving that the constable might receive one penny a his own election from every mansion house in the town and a farthing of every cottage on the feast of st stephen annually that the burgesses should be freed for the future from  excise of ale brewed and sold in the town which had been hitherto payable at the rate of seven pence for every br cervi exposed to sale that they were to be freed from the duty of amobr or lyrewite vide page      that whoever lived in the house of a burgess and happened to die there the burgess was to have a herlot after his decease in the same manner as the  or freeholders residing on the lands of the lord in the hundred of oswestry that no shrewsbury ale should be sold in the town without license while any ale brewed in the town was to be had under the penalty of six shillings and eight pence that none of the inhabitants of the lordhips of oswestry melerly kinardsey egerley ruyton and the eleven towns old ruyton cotton shelvoke shottaton wykey eardeston tedsmere rednall haughton sutton and felton which form a manor in oswestry hundred  should drive or carry any cattle corn or victuals or other wares to any foreign fair or market before the same had been first exposed to sale in the town of oswestry under the penalty of six shillings and eight pence that none of the lords tenants should be compelled to pay the redditus advocarii for the security of the castle etc etc  until the time of the abovementioned charter guard at the gates the lords welsh tenants of the hundred of oswestry were accustomed by their tenure to keep watch and ward for three days and three nights at the four gates of the town during the fairs of st andrew and st oswald with a certain number of men called kaies but these treacherously with others ravaged and plundered the place on this the tenants were compelled to pay a sum of money as wages to a sufficient number of englishmen as the burgesses should think convenient for the custody of the four gates and the welshmen were for ever to be discharged from that duty  the vassals of the earls of arundel in these parts were of a mixed nature either descendants of the norman followers of their ancestor alan or of the native welsh who were most numerous and bore an hereditary dislike to their cotenants of foreign stock the welsh part was called walcheria and lay in the upper part of the manor  this charter of earl thomas was confirmed by his several successors to the time of henry viii charles ii granted another in which a mayor twelve aldermen fifteen common council a highsteward and recorder compose the body corporate  about a mile from oswestry in the parish of sellatyn lies a fine military post on an insulated eminence of an oblong form which has been fortified with much art the top is an extensive area containing fifteen acres three roods and eight perches of fertile ground surrounded with two ramparts and fosses of great heighths and depths at a distance from these at the foot of the hill is another deep fosse which surrounds the whole and ends as do the two others at the two entrances which are placed diagonally opposite to each other on the slope of the hill on both sides of one entrance are a range of deep oblong trenches running transversely between the second ditch and another which seems to be designed for their immediate protection for the first extends no farther than these trenches the other to no great distance beyond them  this place is called old oswerstry old oswestry hn ddinas and anciently caer ogyrfan from ogyrfan a hero coexistent with arthur there is no certainty of the origin of it some ascribe it to oswald or to penda and imagine that it was possessed before the battle of maserfeld by one of those princes others think it to have been the work of the ancient britons to which opinion i incline the strength and the labor in forming it evince that it was not a sudden operation like that of a camp its construction even to the oblong trenches is british for example that of bryn y clawddiau on the clwydian hills which divide flintshire from the vale of clwyd is a similar work  a great dike and fosse wats dike called wats is continued from each side of this post this work is little known notwithstanding it is equal in depth though not in extent to that of offa

chapel in the parish of mold pointing toward the clwydian hills beyond which there can no farther traces be discovered  no reason appears why its course was not continued from sea to sea it seems probable that offa imagined that the clwydian hills and the deep valley that lies on this side at their base would serve as a continuance of his prohibitory line he had carried his arms over most part of flintshire and vainly imagined that his labors would restrain the cambrian inroads in one part and his orders prevent any incursions beyond these natural limits which he had decreed should be the boundaries of his new conquests the weakness of this great work appeared on the death of offa the welsh with irresistible fury despised his toils and carried their ravages far and wide on the english marches superior force often repelled our countrymen sanguinary laws were made by the victorious harold against any that should transgress the limits prescribed by offa the welshman that was found in arms on the saxon side of the ditch was to lose his right hand leland collect iii   0 joannes sarishuriensis as quoted by camden       it is observable that in all parts the ditch is on the welsh side and that there are numbers of small artificial mounts the sites of small forts in many places along its course these were garrisoned and seem intended for the same purposes as the towers in the famous

hundred inhabitants its register commences in      was fortunately saved from the great wreck of such records by mr wilding an oliverian rector in the civil wars it appears from it that the state of population in the first and the last twenty years was as follows  first last increase baptisms       0     weddings          funerals             this happy disproportion of increase between births and burials seems to arise from the hilly situation of the parish which slopes down to the moory flats of those of oswestry and whittington without partaking the lest of their nature the improvements in agriculture contribute much to retain numbers of the inhabitants by finding them a wholesome and innocent employ the want of which exiles multitudes in many places to the vice and disease of great cities  the first house i visited is porkington porkington the seat of robert godolphin owen esquire this place takes its name from a singular entrenchment in a neighboring field called castle brogyntyn a fort belonging to owen brogyntyn a natural son to owen madap meredydd prince of powis vadog powel      it is of a circular form surrounded with a vast earthen dike and a deep fosse it appears sir john owen knt by an old drawing in mr myttons collection to have had two entrances pretty close to each other projecting a little from the sides and diverging the end of each guarded by a semilunar curtain these are now destroyed the whole parish consists of a single township which also bears the same title with the mansion  the name of the house was soon altered to one very nearly resembling the present in      henry iii in an address to llewelyn prince of wales informs him that among others bleddyn filius oeni de porkinton rymer i     had performed to his majesty the service he owed  i must now make a very long transition from this period to that which produced another distinguished personage of this family sir john owen here is preserved the portrait of sir john owen knight of clenneney in caernarvonshire a gallant officer and strenuous supporter of the cause of charles i he greatly signalized himself at the siege of bristol when it was taken by prince rupert and was desperately wounded in the attack congenial qualities recommended him to his highness who superseding the appointment of archbishop williams to the government of conway castle in      constituted sir john commander in his place this fortress was soon given up to general mytton by the contrivance of the prelate and the power of his friends and the knight retired to his seat in the distant parts of the county in      he rose in arms to make a last effort in behalf of his fallen master probably in concert with the royalists in kent and essex he was soon attacked by william lloyd sheriff of the county whom he defeated wounded and made prisoner he then laid siege to caernarvon but hearing that certain of the parliament forces under the colonels carter and twisleton were on their march to attack him he hastened to meet them and took the sheriff with him on a litter he met with his enemies near llandegai a furious recontre ensued in which sir john had at first the advantage but falling in with their reserve fortune declared against him in a personal contest with a captain tailor he was pulled off his horse and made prisoner and his troops disheartened by the loss of their commander took to flight the sheriff died the same day the victory was esteemed of that consequence that captain tailor who was the messenger of the news to the parliament received a reward of two hundred pounds out of sir johns estate rushworth ii part iv        sir john was conveyed to windsor castle where he found four noblemen under confinement for the same cause on the  0th of november a vote past for his banishment and that of the lords goring loughborough capel the earl of holland and major general langhern whitelock      but after the execution of their royal master sanguinary measures took place the duke of hamilton the earl of holland and the lords goring and capel were put upon their trials sir john showed a spirit worthy of his country he told his judges that he was a plain gentleman of wales who had been always taught to obey the king that he had served him honestly during the war and finding many honest men endeavored to raise forces whereby he might get him out of prison he did the like and concluded like a man who did not much care what they resolved concerning him in the end he was condemned to lose his head for which with a humorous intrepidity he made the court a low reverence and gave his humble thanks a bystander asked what he meant he replied aloud it was a great honor to a poor gentleman of wales to lose his head with such noble lords for by g  he was afraid they would have hanged him  sir john by mere goodfortune was disappointed of the honor he was flattered with being as his epitaph says famae plus quam vitae sollicito he neither solicited for a pardon nor was any petition offered to parliament in his favor which was strongly importuned in behalf of his fellow prisoners ireton proved his advocate and told the house that there was one person for whom no one spoke a word and therefore requested that he might be saved by the sole motive and goodness of the house in consequence mercy was extended to him and after a few months imprisonment he was on his petition set at liberty he retired again into his country where he died in      and was interred in the church of penmorva in caernarvonshire where a small monument preserves the following epitaph

sellatyn church i ascended to the parish church the legend of the foundation is that a noble briton being engaged in the chase found in a thicket on this spot a white hind which determined him after the example of ethelred king of the mercians in the instance of st johns church chester to dedicate it to sacred uses he accordingly translated to this place the ancient church which tradition says stood before on a spot still called bryn hen eglwys or the hill of the old church  that highchurch meteor doctor sacheverel that partytool doctor sacheverel was in   0  presented to this living not so much on account of its value as to give him a pretense of making a progress through a long extent of the kingdom and of trying the inclinations of the people in the rich and populous counties he was to pass through he was met on the confines of this by  000 horsemen among which were the first fortunes of shropshire he met with respect in every town little short of adoration the crowd in oswestry was so great that a good old woman could see only a small part of the holy man yet consoled herself with having a sight of his everblessed wig as he rode along  from hence i hastened toward chirk castle keeping a lower road between the two dikes on approaching the village of chirk is a very deep valley consisting of fertile meadows watered by the brook ceiriog and finely bounded by lofty wooded banks on the very verge of that next to chirk stands an artificial mount and i think the vestige of another on the other side of the road which goes between them these were exploratory and probably designed also for defense and might have had on them a small fort for the protection of the pass i imagine these mounts to have been saxon and coeval with the great labor of offa which runs at a small distance from them  in this deep valley battle of crogen which winds along the foot of the vast berwyn mountains was a bloody conflict between part of the forces of henry ii and the welsh in      henry had determined once more to attempt the subjection of wales and to revenge the ravages carried through the borders by its gallant prince owen gwynedd for that end he assembled a vast army at oswestry owen on the contrary collected all his chieftains with their dependants at corwen the king hearing that his antagonist  so near resolved to bring the matter to a speedy decision he marched toward him and in this valley finding himself entangled in impenetrable woods and recollecting his illfortune among the forests of eulo directed his vanguard to make the passage clear by cutting down the trees in order to secure himself from ambuscade the pikemen and flower of his army were posted to cover the workmen the spirit of the common soldiers of the welsh army grew indignant at this attempt and without the knowledge of their officers fell with unspeakable fury on these troops the contest was violent numbers of brave men perished in the end the welsh retired to corwen henry gained the summit of the berwyn but was so distressed by dreadful rains and by the activity and prudence of owen who cut him off from all supplies that he was obliged to return ingloriously with great loss of men and equipage powel       this conflict is sometimes called the battle of corwen but with more propriety that of crogen for it happened beneath castelh crogen the present chirk castle

the end of his life he found that he had undesignedly established a more intolerable tyranny than that which he had formerly opposed in      he took arms in conjunction with sir george booth in order to restore the ancient constitution sir george was defeated by the vigilant lambert and sir thomas forced to take refuge in his castle where after two or three days show of defense he was constrained to surrender on such conditions as the conqueror was pleased to dictate  the other monuments are composed of large and very illexecuted figures of lady middleton wife to sir thomas middleton baronet

antonio di dominis archbishop of spalato in reward for his conversion to protestantism in      he was sent to represent his country in the famous synod of dort he was promoted to the deanery of rochester and in      to that of durham but by his great loyalty having rendered himself hated by his countrymen was in      obliged to take refuge in chirk castle but sinking under the fatigue of the journey and severity of the weather died on christmas day the epitaph was composed by dr pearson bishop of chester at the request of sir thomas middleton by whom the monument was erected  the castle lies about a mile from the village castle in the course of offas dike on the summit of a lofty hill projecting from the great mass of the berwyn mountains before the foundation of the present castle stood another called castle crogen and the territory around bore the name of tref y waun the property of the lords of dinas bran it continued in their possession till the death of gryffydd ap madoc a strenuous partizan of henry iii and edward i edward on the decease of gryffydd rewarded two of his favorites with the guardianship of the two eldestsons of gryffydd madoc to john earl warren and llewelyn to roger mortimer son of roger baron of wigmore who as before related quickly dispatched the unhappy youths and possessed themselves of their fortunes earl warren seized on the lordships of bromfield and yale mortimer on those of the present chirk and nanheudwy he became the founder of the castle it continued in his family but a short time being sold by his grandson john to richard fitzalan earl of arundel the fitzalans possessed it for three generations after which it passed to thomas mowbray duke of norfolk and justice of north wales chester and flint in right of his wife elizabeth elder sister to thomas earl of arundel on  chirk castle   the disgrace and exile of mowbray in      it probably was resumed by the crown and granted again to william beauchamp lord of abergavenny who married the other sister and by the marriage of his granddaughter sole heiress of richard beauchamp earl of worcester with edward nevil afterward lord abergavenny was conveyed into that family in the reign of henry vi powel       the next possessor which occurs to me is the unfortunate sir william stanley who as leland says repayred it well after his ungrateful execution it became forfeited to his rapacious master and as i conjecture was bestowed in      along with holt castle another of sir williams castles by henry viii on his natural son henry fitzroy duke of richmond and somerset kings valeroyal      by his early death it reverted again to the crown  in the following reign i imagine it to have been granted to thomas lord seymour brother to the protector somerset for i find him in possession of holt dugdale baron ii      to which it was an appendage  elizabeth granted it with the same lordships to her worthless favorite dudley earl of leicester on his death

punishment even the most atrocious assassin by payment of a certain fine this was practiced by the lord marchers of these parts in the fifteenth century and continued in mowddwy in merionethshire till it was abolished in the   th of henry viii gwydir family  0    this custom was derived from the ancient germans who accepted a fine of cattle as a compensation for murder which satisfied the relations

weregeld and accordingly set a price on every rank from the king to the peasant wilkins leges sax     the head of the king was valued at thirty thousand thrymses or   00 l half to be paid to his relations and half to the kingdom for the loss it had sustained that of a countryman was esteemed at two hundred and sixtysix or    l    s  the weregeld of a welshman was very low for unless he had property enough to be taxed for the kings use his life was not reckoned of higher price than seventy thrymses or ten guineas the money or fine was distributed as in the time of the ancient germans among the relations of the deceased and oftentimes part went to the lord of the soil as compensation for his loss  the welsh had in like manner their galanas and gwerth gwerth of the same nature with the former but our fine was usually paid in cattle the wealth of the country  but the gwerth was not only a compensation for murder or homicide but for all species of injuries to cuckold the prince

grease that remained in her hands the same     i fear by this and other penalties for the same offense that the crime was not held by my countrymen to be of a very deep dye  welsh saxons and normans had each their pecuniary atonements for lesser injuries a welshman for the loss of his finger received one cow and twenty pence of his nose six oxen and a hundred and twenty pence and for being pulled by the hair a penny for every finger and twopence for the thumb the instruments of the insult leges wallicae      the saxons had similar fines wilkins leges saxon    and the normans like persons of nice honor provided a penalty of five sous for a lug by the nose and ten pour un coup au derriere ms notes to my copy of les coustumes de normandy   the scotch had also similar compensations for

committed a most horrid murder they had killed a poor parson at the instigation of their chieftain because his wife had preferred the nursing another great mans child to his in the remote of parts wales had fled into this neighborhood for protection about the latter end of the fifteenth century two families at that time divided the country with their feuds the kyffins and the trevors who were ready at any time to receive under their protection any banditti that were recommended to them by their remote friends when their villainies rendered it unsafe for them to remain at home the trevors at this time gave asylum to these murderers the friends of the person they had slain wished for revenge being at that time in league with the kyffins a plot was laid to surprise the assassins jevan ap meredeth a gentleman of caernarvonshire who was most anxious to obtain redress for the injury came over with six men and was directed to keep himself concealed least the trevors should be alarmed and frustrate his design he accordingly kept within all day and watched all night at length the villains fell into his hands the trevors instantly pursued him when he was told by the kyffins that if he was overtaken and the offenders rescued he would lose his revenge for according to the custom of the country they would be carried before the gate of chirkcastle and be instantly cleared on the payment of five pounds this determined jevan to order his followers to strike off their heads on the spot one of them executed his order but faintly when the criminal told him that if he had his neck under his sword he would make it take a better edge gwydir family  0    i wish the cause had been better that applause might have been given to this contempt of death but such assassins as these could

thine and every bard with rapture hung on the soft music of my song for thee i languish pine and rave white as dwrdwys curling wave alas no words can speak my pain while thus i love but love in vain wisdom and reason what are they what all the charms of poesy against the fury of thy darts thou vanquisher of human hearts when first i saw thee princely maid in scarlet robes of state arrayed thy beauties set my soul on fire and every motion fanned desire the more on thy sweet form i gazed the more my frantic passion blazed not half so fine the spiders thread that glitters on the dewy mead as the bright ringlets of thy hair thou beauteous object of my care but ah my sighs my tears are vain the cruel maid insults my pain and can thou without pity see the victim of thy cruelty  pale with despair and robbed of sleep whose only business is to weep  behold thy bard thy poet languish oh ease thy bards thy poets anguish and for heavens sake some pity show ere to the shades of night i go o

design it is finished in that substantial yet neat manner becoming the seat of an honest english country gentleman adapted to the reception of his worthy neighbors who may experience his hospitality without dread of spoiling the frippery ornaments becoming only the assemblyrooms of a townhouse or the villa of a great city the present owner meditates the rebuilding of the old part and as he has

strong dikes and deep ditches the inner dike is made of loose stones with a wall of vast thickness on the top within the area are many vestiges of buildings the habitations of the old possessors it

work of a pentagon form beyond which at the very verge is a mount that seems to have been a dernier resort to the garrison in case they had been beaten out of the former these compose what is called

was removed to that of westminster he never had an academic education but was placed immediately in the inner temple where he was chiefly supported by his grandmother  he was never regularly called to the bar the accident of the plague in the neighborhood of london first introduced him into his profession for in      he put on a lawgown and pleading at the kingston assizes where few counsel chose to attend he from that time acted without any notice being taken of his obtrusion about this time he made clandestine addresses to the daughter of a wealthy merchant in which he was assisted by a young lady the daughter of a clergyman the affair was discovered and the confidante turned out of doors jefferies with a generosity unknown to him in his prosperous days took pity and married her she proved an excellent wife and lived to see him lord chief justice of england on her death he married the widow of mr jones of montgomeryshire and daughter to sir thomas blodworth  his first preferment from the court was that of a welsh judge in    0 he was made chief justice of chester after this he rose with great rapidity and as is well known fell as suddenly his conduct as chancellor was upright and able as a politician unrestrained by any principle devoted to the worst measures of an infatuated court he was extremely given to the bottle and paid so little respect to his character that one

ditches now almost levelled by the plough in one corner of this post is a vast exploratory mount this seems to have been an important station an outguard to our country against invaders which made an

gryffydd ap madoc the last lord the earl warren who had usurped the property of the eldest appears to have been seized with remorse for his crime and instead of removing the other object of his fear

to philip ap ivor of iscoed she probably was married before the death of her father otherwise the jealousy of edward about the succession to the principality would have made her share the fate of her sister gwenllian who perforce took the veil in the convent of shaftesbury  writers vary in the account of the day of the birth of glyndwr birth one manuscript fixes it on the   th of may      that preserved by lewis owen places the event five years earlier for the year      says he was distinguished by the first appearance of the pestilence in wales and by the birth of owen glyndwr  heroes are often introduced into the world by some strange phoenomenon omens that presages their future celebrity or the happiness or misery they were to bring upon their country but it is probable that their course is finished before superstition invents the tale and adopts it to their actions holinshed relates one on this occasion correspondent to a blemish we could wish to clear the character of our countryman from his cruelty was foretold at his nativity by the mavelous accident of his fathers horses being found standing that night in the stables up to their bellies in blood shakespeare omits this circumstance but in his spirited character of owen puts these beautiful lines into his mouth finely descriptive of the vainglory and superstition of the old british chieftain  at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes the goats ran from the mountains and the herds were strangely clamorous in the frighted fields these signs have marked me extraordinary and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men his bard jolo goch gives him incense of a far superior kind and i fear the poets ardor to celebrate his patron carried him to the borders of blasphemy for in his cowydd y seren or poem of the star he describes three that appeared to mark three great events for to the star which foretold the birth of our savior he adds another which presaged that of arthur and a third which marked the great deeds of glyndwr in   0  the meridian of his glory cowydd y seren a ymddangoses mis mawrth b a   0    he appears to have had a liberal education his ambition overcame the prejudices of his country against the english and determined him to seek preferment among them he entered himself in the inns of court and studied there till he became a barrister it is probable that he quitted his profession for we find that he was appointed scutiger or squire of the body to richard ii whose fortunes he followed to the last was taken with him in flint castle and when the kings household was dissolved retired with full resentment of his sovereigns wrongs to his patrimony in wales i judge that he was knighted before the deposal of his master for i find him among the witnesses in the celebrated cause between sir richard le scrope and sir ro le grosvenour about a coat of arms under the title of sir  de glendore his brother also appears there by the name of tudor de glendore this cause lasted three years and ended in      collinss peerage vii  0    jolo goch his house the celebrated poet of this period resided here for some time he came on a pressing invitation from owen who knowing the mighty influence of this order of men over the ancient britons made his house as jolo says a sanctuary for bards he made them the instruments of his future operations and to prepare the minds of the people against the time of his intended insurrection from jolo i borrow the description of the seat of the chieftain when it was in full splendour he compares it in point of magnificence to westminster abbey and informs us that it had a gate house and was surrounded with a moat  that within were nine halls each furnished with a wardrobe i imagine filled with the clothes of his retainers according to the custom of those days  near the house on a verdant bank was a wooden house supported on posts and covered with tiles it contained four apartments each subdivided into two designed to lodge the guests  here was a church in form of a cross with several chapels  the seat was surrounded with every convenience for good living and every support to hospitality a park warren and pigeonhouse a mill orchard and vineyard and fish pond filled with pike and gwyniads the last introduced from the lake at bala  a heronry which was a concomitant to the seat of every great man supplied him and his guests with game for the sport of falconry  a place still remains that retains the name of his park it extends about a mile or two beyond the site of his house on the left hand of the valley  the vestiges of the house are small the moat is very apparent the measurement of the area it enclosed is fortysix paces by twentysix there is the appearance of a wall on the outside which was continued to the top of a great mount on which stood the wooden house on the other side but at a greater distance i had passed by another mount of the same kind called hendom which probably might have had formerly a building similar to that described by the bard this perhaps was the station of a guard to prevent surprise or insult from the english side he had much to apprehend from the neighboring fortress of dinas bran and its appendages possessed by the earl of arundel a strenuous supporter of the house of lancaster  the bard speaks feelingly of the wine the ale the braget and the white bread nor does he forget the kitchen nor the important officer the cook whose life when in the royal service was estimated by our laws at a hundred and twentysix cows leges wallicae  such was the hospitality of this house that the place of porter was useless nor were locks or bolts known to sum up all no one could be hungry or dry in sycharth the name of the place  the bard pays all due praise to the lady of the house and her offspring  a gwraig orau or gwragedd wife  gwynn y myd oi gwin ai medd merch eglur llin marchawglyw urddol

children come in pairs a beautiful nest of chieftains the lady whom he thus celebrates was margaret daughter of sir david hanmer of hanmer in the county of flint one of the justices of the kings bench by appointment of richard ii in      and knighted by him in      collinss baronet    0 ii p      her nuptials were previous to her fathers promotion for it is certain that some of the daughters were married and his sons grown to mens estate before glyndwr appeared in arms in the year   00 children they followed him into the field and commanded under him it is probable that most of them fell gloriously in battle mr brown willis indeed says that on their fathers death they fled into ireland that one of them settled in dublin and took the name of baulf hist of st asaph cathedral     or the strong and was ancestor to a reputable family in that city  he matched his daughters into considerable families  his eldest isabel to adam or adda ap jorwerth ddu  his second elizabeth or as some say alicia was married to sir john scudamore of ewyas and holmlacy in the county of hereford  jonet to john crofts of croft castle in the same county  lord gray of ruthyn took through necessity jane after he was made prisoner by her father who forced him into the alliance  his youngest daughter margaret was married to roger monnington of monnington in the county of hereford toward the borders of brecknockshire the estate still continues in the name and family i have had the pleasure of seeing at my house two ladies owners of the place direct descendants from the daughter of glyndwr  his illegitimate issue were his son jevan a daughter married into the house of gwernan another named myfanwy to llewelyn ap adda of trefor and gwenllian to philip ap rys of st harmon in radnorshire  lewis glyn cothi a bard of the time of henry vi speaks in high terms of her father glyndwr  ei thad oedd dwysawg eadarn a holl gymru fun ei farn her father was a potent prince all wales was in his council  i must not omit notice of a mistake of the english historians who mention the marriage of another daughter of glyndwr to edmund earl of march this they assert was also effected by force after the earl became his prisoner but it does not appear that he ever was glyndwrs captive or that march had any other wife than anne daughter to edmund earl of stafford besides the welsh histories are totally silent on that head  such was the state of the domestic affairs of glyndwr at the change of government in      his resentment against the usurper was whetted by wrongs public and private by the murder of the unhappy richard to whom he was strongly attached by being a personal favorite and by the strong partiality the welsh had for their late king  in the very first year or the new reign he experienced the frowns of the court oppressed by lord gray reginald lord gray of ruthyn taking advantage of the deposal of richard instantly seized on a certain common called croeseu which glyndwr in a former reign had recovered from him by course of law owen fought justice without having recourse to violence he laid his case before parliament but his suit was dismissed without redress  this insult was aggravated by another injury when henry went on his expedition against the scots owen was to have been summoned among other barons to attend the king with his vassals the writ for that purpose was delivered to reginald visa ricardi ii      who designedly neglected to deliver it till the time was nearly elapsed and it became impossible for him to obey regineld returned to the king and misrepresented the absence of on as an act of wilful disobedience and by this piece of treachery took possession of all his land and on this under pretense of forfeiture invaded such parts of glyndwrs estates as lay adjacent to his own  the danger of driving into desperate measures a person of his interest spirit and abilities was foreseen by john trevor bishop of st asaph who advised more temperate proceedings that owen was by no means a despicable enemy and that the wlsh would certainly be provoked into a general insurrection his advice was rejected and he was told there could be no fear about such a barefooted rabble lelands collect i   0   it does not appear that glyndwr till this period had any settled design of flinging off the english yoke ambition now came in and joined with his revenge asserts his clame to wales he revolved in his mind his own genealogy he derived himself from the ancient race of british princes and apparently laying aside all sense of private wrong made open clame to the throne of wales to encourage his countrymen strongly attached to the prophecies of ancient times he reminded them of those of merlin and other sages his bards set before them the great qualities of their leader and taught them to expect from his valor and conduct the freedom of ancient britons from the galling weight of the saxon yoke his chief bard gryffydd llwyd after regretting his absence chaunts his praise and predicts the success of the war the cowydd or poem begins thus in the original  eryr digris afrised owain etc the reader will receive it agreeably

blaze but on thy tomb neverfading laurels bloom he first appeared in arms in the summer of the year   00 appears in arms  he naturally directed his attack against the lands of his enemy lord gray and immediately recovered what he had unjustly been dispossessed of during the absence of the former as soon as the news reached henry he sent lord talbot and lord gray to reduce him they arrived with such speed that they surrounded his house before he had any notice but he had the good fortune to escape into the woods he immediately raised a powerful band of men and after causing himself to be proclaimed prince of wales on the  0th of september surprised plundered and burnt to the ground the town of ruthyn burns ruthyn at the time a fair was held there after which he retired to his fastnesses among the mountains one i imagine to have been the great strength surrounded by a vast rampart of stones near corwen called caer drewyn  henry first march of henry against him determined to suppress this revolt in the beginning marched in person against owen and penetrated as far as the isle of anglesea putting to the sword all that resisted he plundered the convent of llanvaes lelands collect i      slew some of the monks and took the rest away with him at length set them at liberty and made restitution to the monastery but peopled it again with english religious the monks of llanvaes had been franciscans an order who were firm adherents to the late prince and who in general were suspected of promoting the insurrection of glyndwr and even of inviting him to invade england this occasioned a persecution of them and several ibid were executed on that account their intelligence with glyndwr is very evident from the favor he showed the order on the taking of cardiff in the year   0  when he burnt the whole town excepting the street inhabited by the franciscans idem       the king returned without effecting any material action for on his approach owen retired among the snowdon hills holinshed       the proclamation for assembling the forces for this expedition was dated on the   th of september from northampton and addressed to the lieutenants of warwickshire leicester and eight other counties in which all persons capable of bearing arms within their jurisdiction were directed to array themselves and be ready to march to such place as his majesty directed who acquaints the lieutenants that he should lie at coventry on his road to wales the monday following rymers foedera viii       on the same day he issued out an order to the bailifss and good people of shrewsbury shrewsbury secured by henry to take proper steps to secure that important place and that they oblige all the welsh resident in the town to give security for their loyal behavior and in case of refusal to commit them to prison idem   0   on the eighth of november in the same year who grants owens estates to the earl of somerset he made a grant of all the estates of glyndwr in north and south wales to his brother john earl of somerset idem      an act as weak as it was irritating for owen was so far from being in any danger of being dispossessed of them that at this very time he was growing more powerful by the accession of new forces it is remarkable that his revenue in money at this period did not exceed three hundred marks which showed that his rents in kind must have been very considerable  but the last public act of this year was conciliating and ozerrs pardon to the welsh the king made one endeavor to bring back the welsh to their allegiance by fair means and for that end issued a proclamation on the  0th of november offering to take under his protection all that would resort to the city of chester and there make their submission to his son henry prince of wales prince henry first appears after which they should be at liberty to return to their respective homes rymer viii      henry was at that time but twelve years of age so early was he initiated into state affairs so early appeared those sparks of genius which shone afterward with such brilliancy    0   the first half of this year passed without any memorable action owen augments his forces owen was busied in augmenting his forces he made considerable levies in wales and received continual addition to his strength by the great resort of his countrymen of all orders who had gone into england for the sake of education or to gain a livelihood by different occupations  the state of henrys affairs state of heneys affairs at this time in respect to the european monarchs the badness of his title to the crown of england and the repentance of several of the great men for their disloyalty to their late prince were circumstances highly in favor of glyndwr  charles vi of france fatherinlaw to the unhappy richard prepared to revenge his deposal and murder the confusion of his own affairs luckily for henry prevented the resentment of the french monarch he contented himself with receiving back his daughter isabel and her paraphernalia and henry gladly renewed a truce with him for thirty years  the scots taking advantage of his situation threatened him with invasion this made it dangerous for him to engage in a distant war and obliged him to continue for a considerable time in the central parts of his dominion to act according to the necessity of events in respect to the welsh he contented himself with issuing out pardons rymer viii          at the instance of prince henry to all that had appeared in arms in the counties of caernarvon anglesey and flint and the people of denbigh and merioneth henry offers new pardons to the inhabitants of chirkland bromfield and yale to the hundred of oswestry and to those of ellesmere and whittington which i find were then reckoned parts of wales owen himleif rice ap tudor william ap tudor and all such as were in actual custody or such who should continue in arms were excepted the first pardon was given out the  0th of may the latest the  th of june and as will appear with some effect  glyndwrs fortune and interest lay as was before mentioned both in north and in south wales this summer he marched with a hundred and twenty men of arms and with great policy owen posts himself on plinlimmon posted himself on plinlimmon hill a lofty mountain the limits of cardiganshire and montgomeryshire admirably adapted for receiving succors from his vassals and friends in each part of the principality from hence his followers made plundering excursions and were the terror of all that declined espousing his cause the county of montgomery suffered greatly plunders montgomery he sacked the capital town leland itin v    burnt the suburbs of pool and ravaged all the borders he destroyed the abbey of comhere in radnorshire took the castle of radnor and caused the whole garrison to the number of threescore beheads sixty men to be beheaded on the brink of the castleyard ibid  the provocation to this piece of cruelty does not appear  the flemings inhabitants of ross pembroke and cardiganshire suffered so greatly from glyndwr that they determined to attempt to remove so troublesome a neighbor surprised they assembled a body of fifteen hundred men and made so expeditious a march as to surround owen and his forces at a place called mynydd hyddgant before he had any notice of their approach they hemmed him in on every side and notwithstanding he could make no retreat without great disadvantage he made a long and manful defense at length finding it impossible to subsist in that place he determined to cut a passage through the enemy or perish in the attempt yet defeats the enemy he knew that neither he nor his men were to expect any mercy so actuated by despair they fell furiously on the flemings and after a strong dispute flung them into great disorder which owen taking advantage of redoubled his attack and at length put them to night leaving two hundred of their party dead on the spot  this victory added greatly to the reputation of glyndwr multitudes resorted to his standard and contributed to make him a most formidable enemy  henry alarmed at his successes marched a second time in person henrys second march he entered wales with a great army about the beginning of june vita r ii      destroyed the abbey of strathfleur in cardiganshire and ravaged the country but was obliged to make a disgraceful retreat after his forces had suffered greatly by famine and the great fatigues they continually underwent  the monk of evesham vita r ii     relates an instance of paternal affection much to the honor of our country a welshman having made a rash promise to the king to betray glyndwr refused afterward to perform it and eagerly stretching out his neck to the headsman told him to strike for that he had two sons at that time in the service of his chieftain therefore would on no account reveal his councils which would prove so penal to them  it is probable corrupts some of owens friends that during this expedition henry found means to corrupt the fidelity of several of the friends of glyndwr for we find a free pardon granted to william ap tudor a gentleman who had been excepted in the pardon of last year and to thirtyone principal persons of the country this is dated from westminster on the  th of july rymer viii  0    this defection seemed to have very little effect on the spirit of glyndwr he acquired new friends and such addition of strength that the king resolved to go again in person against him he issued out his orders to the lieutenants of devonshire and one and twenty other counties to repair with their forces to worcester ibid     on the first of october our old historians are silent about the event of this expedition but mr carte says that it was unfortunate as the former makes a third expedition thus concluded the transactions of this year    0   this year was ushered in with a comet a comet or blazingstar which the bards interpreted as an omen favorable to the cause of glyndwr it served to infuse spirit into the minds of a superstitious people the first success of their chieftain confirmed their belief and gave new vigor to their actions  lord gray was the first that felt the effects of owens power that nobleman strongly attached to henry and impatient of the injuries which he and his friends received from glyndwr raised a considerable army encountered him was defeated and made prisoner owen defeats lord gray historians differ about the scene of action the welsh lay it on the banks of the fyrnwy in the county of montgomery the english say that it was in the neighborhood of ruthyn and that owen advancing toward the castle with a party of men drew his incautious rival into the field where he fell into an ambush and was taken and carried fast bound into confinement amidst the savage fastnesses of the snowdon hills vita ricardi ii      this relation seems probable not only as the castle of ruthyn was the chief seat of lord gray but a fortress of such strength as to baffle all attempts of glyndwr in the infancy of his insurrection without having recourse to stratagem  lord gray remained for a long time in captivity makes him pay a great ransom nor did he gain his liberty till he paid to him the vast sum of ten thousand marks he was such a personal favorite with the king who pitying the severity with which he was treated and admiring the firmness with which he resisted the offers of glyndwr to make him swerve from his loyalty that his majesty issued out a special commission dated the  0th of october in this year empowering sir william de roos sir richard de gray sir william de willughby sir william de zouch john henry william vans john lee john longford thomas pain and john elnstow to treat with owen and his council about the ransom it was agreed to pay six thousand marks on the day of st martin rymer viii     following and give as hostages for the payment of the remainder his eldest son and some other persons and in order to raise the money henry gave license to robert braybrook dagdales baron i     bishop of london and two others feoffees of diverse lordships for lord gray to sell the lordship of herteleigh in kent he also absolved him for six years from the forfeiture of twothirds of the profits of his irish estates usually exacted from such who were nonresident in that kingdom  after this he was set at liberty and he and his tenants suffered to enjoy their property without molestation it is probable that owen engaged his lordship to observe a neutrality as another term of redemption lord gray seemed likewise to think it necessary to secure both his people and himself by an alliance with owen for no sooner was he released than he married jane and marry one of his daughters third daughter of the furious chieftain he had no issue by this lady the match was probably compulsive at best political some of the english historians pretend that he died in captivity but that he obtained his liberty and long survived this treaty is evident for in   0  he was ordered by henry to his estates to repel the ravages his fatherinlaw made on the borders he even lived to serve in the french wars in the reign of henry v and his successor and died in the year    0 collinss peerage ii       owen after securing this potent enemy began to give a free rein to his revenge to punish such of his countrymen whom he considered as traitors to the generous cause of freedom by an unnatural adherence to the english whose yoke they had borne for such a length of time  he burnt the houses of kevn y fan and cesailgyfarch belonging to jevan ap meredyth a partizan of the house of lancaster and to whom and meredyth ap hwlkin llwyd of glynlivon was entrusted under an english captain the castle of caernarvon this place was so closely blocked up by the friends of glyndwr that jevan happening to die there at that time it was found necessary to carry his corpse by sea in order to inter it in the parishchurch of penmorva on the other side of the county hist gwedir      howel sele of nannau in merionethshire story or howel sele first cousin to owen had a harder fate he likewise was an adherent to the house of lancaster owen and this chieftain had been long at variance i have been informed that the abbot of kymmer near dolgellu in hopes of reconciling them brought them together and to all appearance effected his charitable design while they were walking out owen observed a do feeding and told howel who was reckoned the best archer of his days that there was a fine mark for him howel bent his bow and pretending to aim at the do suddenly turned and discharged the arrow full at the breast of glyndwr who fortunately had armor beneath his clothes so received no hurt enraged at this treachery he seized on sole burnt his house and hurried him away from the place nor could ever any one learn how he was disposed of till forty years after the skeleton of a large man such as howel was discovered in the hollow of a great oak in which owen was supposed to have immured him in reward of his persidy the ruins of the old house are to be seen in nannau park a mere compost of cinders and ashes  it must be observed that when owen was carrying him away his relation gryffydd ap gwyn of ganllwyd in ardudwy attempted his rescue but was defeated with the loss of numbers of his men and of his houses of berthlwyd and cesn coch which were burnt to ashes  it was about this period that owen wreaked his revenge on the ecclesiastics who had favored the cause of the english burns st asph and bangor his conduct in this instance fers indefensible for he paid no regard to the most sacred edifices but sacrilegiously destroyed the cathedrals of bangor and st asaph with the episcopal palace and the canons houses belonging to the last he vented in a particular manner his resentment against the last as the bishop john trevor received his preferment from richard of bishop trevor yet was so disloyal as to pronounce against his unfortunate master the sentence of deposition in favor of the usurping henry and afterward to accept an embassy to the court of spain to justify bolingbrokes proceedings to the reigning prince  henry considered him as a sufferer in his cause therefore gave power to the bishops of hereford voltorno and bangor to suffer him to hold in commendam the living of meivod with the chapels of pool and kegidva or guilsfield in order to support his dignity during the ravage of his diocese rymer viii       the bishop of voltorno probably acted as the popes legate   trevor returned to england about the time of the destruction of his cathedral two years after this he revolted from henry and joined with glyndwr to whom he adhered the rest of his days he appeared in arms with him in the year   0  rymer viii      in the year following on the decline of owens affairs he retired to paris died and was buried in the chapel of the infirmary of the abbey de st victoire there and the following epitaph inscribed to his memory hic jacet reverendus in christo pater jobannes episcopus asaphensis in wallia qui obiit a d    0 die veneris x mensis aprilis cujus anima feliciter requieseat in pace amen  glyndwr was pleased to confirm trevor in his see owen confirms him in his see on returning to his allegiance but deposed from that of bangor willis bangor    richard young and deposes the bishop of bangor for his adherence to the usurper and kept him in close confinement owen also appointed in his room llewelyn or as some call him lewis bifort whose name is mentioned in   0  among the chief of the inhabitants fined or outlawed on account of glyndwrs insurrection in the isle of anglesey he afterward joined with the earl of northumberland and lord bardolph and was taken prisoner in the castle of bramham moor in february   0   when those two noblemen were slain but the bishops life was spared as he was found unarmed goodwin       henry was alarmed at the successes of glyndwr and resolved to march in person against him once more he issued out wts rymer viii     to the lieutenants of nottingham and derby and to those of thirty two other counties dated from the castle of b  june  th in which he requires them to assemble the forces of their respective jurisdictions and to attend him at lichfield on the  th of july in order to suppress this dangerous revolt  before the king could assemble his forces news arrived of the great victory which glyndwr obtained on the   d of june gains a great victory at pilleth over sir edmund mortimer owen after the defeat of lord gray pursued his resentment against all the chieftains unfavorable to his designs advanced with his army toward herefordshire and the borders of south wales and carried fire and sword through the lands of his opponents none suffered so severely as the vassals and tenants of edward mortimer earl of march a child of ten years of age who with his brother roger was in the custody of the king at that time henry was very sensible of the just title this child had to the crown being desended from lionel duke of clarence third son to edward iii his title had even been acknowleged in parliament this increased his majestys apprehensions and made him consider the misfortunes of that family the strengthening of his own throne  sir edmund mortimer uncle to this youth unable any longer to bear the depredations of owen collected a large body of his nephews tenants and retainers out of the county of hereford and the adjacent parts particularly from melienydd in radnorshire and with these marched against the invader a bloody action ensued on brynglas a mountain near pilleth a little southwest of knighton in radnorshire victory declared in favor of our countryman some writers assert that the archers of mortimers army bent their bows against their own party stow      another says vita ricardi ii      that marchs welsh tenants took to flight at the first onset and occasioned the defeat the loss chiefly fell on the people of herefordshire eleven hundred fell on the side of mortimer the shameful villainy used by the welshwomen toward the dead carcasses says holinshed was such as honest ears would be ashamed to hear and continent toongs to speak thereof the dead bodies might not be buried without great sums of money given for liberty to conveie them away holinshed   0 who relates it from walsingham those who wish to read the horrid tale may consult the last p     camdeni script angl   shakespeare flings a fine horror over this dreadful tale in relating  when all athwart there came a post from wales laden with heavy news whose worst was that the noble mortimir leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower was by the rude hands of that welshman taken a thousand of his people butchered upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse sach beastly shameless transformation by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of i wish i could exculpate my countrywomen from this heavy charge it originates from thomas de walsmgham an historian who it must be confessed wrote within forty years of this event to his authority i beg leave to oppose that of another ancient writer who ascribes these barbarities to a follower of glyndwr one rees a gyrch vita ricardi      i flatter myself that this was the case for had it been otherwise it would have been totally unnecessary to discourage the english by an express law statute  th henry iv c     from marrying with such furies as the welshwomen were represented to have been  many historians pretend that the young earl of march was present at this defeat was made prisoner and to ensure his allegiance obliged to marry a daughter of glyndwr but at this time he endured another species of confinement at windsor his uncle commanded the forces of the family takes prisoner sir edmund mortimer and lost his liberty in the battle great instances were made to henry for leave to ransom him but the jealous king rejoicing in the misfortunes of this rival house suffered him to continue in the power of his enemy alleging that sir edmund had treacherously flung himself into the hands of glyndwr  after this victory glyndwr received from all parts of wales accession of strength notwithstanding henry was indifferent about the fate of the mortimers his own safety now required him to act with vigor the design of assembling his army at lichfield was laid aside new writs were issued out dated the   st of july it was resolved to distract the welsh by three invasions from different quarters the rendevous of the first army was to be at shrewshury to be commanded by the king in person the second at hereford to be assembled by edmund earl of stafford richard earl of warwick and the lords gray alergavenny audeley and berkly and the third under the conduct of prince henry at chester the forces were to be assembled at each place by the   th of august rymer viii       owen assured that these preparations could not take effect till a certain time gave loose to his resentment in the beginning of august against the inhabitants of glamorganshire who had sided with the english ravages glamorganshire he marched into that county ravaged it on all parts and after burning the bishops castle and the archdeacons house williss llandaff  0    at llandaff in the same inroad he likewise burnt cardiff and abergavenny and then returned to make head against the english  the scots at this time took advantage of the commotions of the welsh and under the command of the great douglas invaded england with a body of twelve or thirteen thousand men it is almost certain that they acted in concert with glyndwr both nations were united in a common hatred of the english both had felt the weight of their power the scots meditated their inroad at the very time that henry had drawn his forces to the borders of wales and as they hoped left the northern borders unguarded henry had intelligence that it was to take place on the assumption of the blessed virgin or the   th of august and in order to defeat it directed the lieutenant of the county of lincoln to hasten toward the north with all the men he could raise  henry henrys fourth march during this time proceeded on his expedition against the welsh it does not appear whether the army under his son and that under the earl of arundel on whom the command of the second army was bestowed made separate diversions into different parts of the country in his favor or whether he united their forces with his own the event of his invasion was very unfortunate glyndwr who had too much prudence to hazard a battle against so superior an army retired to the fastnesses of the mountains and drove away the cattle and destroyed every means the english had of subsistence the season proved uncommonly bad for the very elements seem to have warred against them unsuccessful a continued course of storms and rains with the continual watching against an enemy ever hovering over them and ready to take every occasion of falling on them from the heights wasted the army with sickness and fatigue and obliged the king once more to make a most inglorious retreat  the english owen reputed a magician willing to cover their shame attributed the cause of their disgrace to the incantations of the british chieftain who as an old historian expresses through art magike as was thought caused such foul weather of winds tempest rain snow and hail to be raised for the annoiance of the kings army that the like had not been heard of perhaps glyndwr as well to infuse terror into his foes as to give his people a more exalted notion of him might politically insinuate his skill in spells and charms that they might suppose him aided by more than mortal power this species of credulity was not only strong at this time but even continued to more enlightened days  owen by the mouth of shakespeare speaks thus of his intercourse with the tribe of spints and of his skill in the mystic arts of divination  where is he living clipped in with the sea that chides the banks of england wales or scotland who calls me pupil or has read to me and bring him out that is but womans son can trace me in the tedious ways of art or hold me pace in deep experiments i can call spirits from the vasty deep the poet on this occasion plays finely with the warmth of glyndwr and draws from him that characteristic spirit of our country which is nobly prompt to rise on the appearance or sometimes even on the very apprehension of insult  henry quickly received news from the north that served to alleviate the ill success of his invasion the earl of northumberland and other northern barons had assembled their forces to oppose the scots then on their return home overtook them on holyroodday or the   th of september battle of homeldon on homeldon hill near wooler and gained over them a complete victory numbers of the scotch nobility were slain in the fight and numbers taken among whom was their gallant commander archibald earl or douglas styled by his countrymen tyneman from the loss of men that attended him in all his conflicts  this battle was productive of great events and proved in the end the destruction of the percy family it was usual for the prisoners to fall to the share of the victors and that each person who was fortunate or brave enough to make a captive should receive the reward of his valor by having liberty to ransom him according to his rank or abilities its consequences henry percy surnamed hotspur had himself by the fortune of war been made prisoner by the scots and was redeemed according to the ancient custom of arms the victors at this time expected and clamed the same right but henry wishing to detain as hostages for the peaceable conduct of the scottish nation these illustrious captives sent directions to the earl of northumberland that he should by no means set them at liberty but that he should deliver them to him henry softened this demand by rewarding northumberland with a considerable grant of lands on the borders of scotland rymer viii      and parliament even sent him a letter of thanks for his good services the percies discontented notwithstanding this the percies were greatly dissatisfied whether their high spirit resented the invasion of the ancient title of victors to their prisoners or whether they were seized with remorse for their disloyalty to their former master or whether they were actuated by the ambition of becoming independent or whether all these causes might not cooperate is not very certain yet from this time they formed their design of flinging off their allegiance to henry  a great discontent with his government at this period began to seize the nation the affection for the murdered richard revived so willing were the people to imagine him still alive that the many reports invented on that subject were greedily swallowed and a proneness to revolt almost generally appeared  the first step taken by the percies was the release of the scottish prisoners without ransom release their prisoners this gained the heart of douglas who went home raised a body of men and joined in the enterprise  sir edmund mortimer glyndwr sets mortimer at liberty from the time of his defeat was treated with the utmost humanity and respect glyndwr politically determined to make use of this important prisoner as an instrument of his ambition reminded him of the right of his house to the crown of england and flattered him with the hopes of restoring it to the throne vita ricardi ii     of his ancestors the percies to whom he was allied had made frequent instances to henry for his ransom who on false and injurious pretenses constantly refused attention to their request notwithstanding he never rested till he had procured the enlargement of his favorite lord gray  the percies now began to extend their views and to form a confederacy that promised fair to effect another revolution they entered into an alliance with glyndwr obtained the release of mortimer and like the famous triumvirate of rome determined to divide the empire between them  their place of meeting conspiracy of the percies the mutina of these heroes was at the house of david daron or of aberdaron dean of bangor williss bangor      son of evan ap dafydd ap gryffydd descended from caradoc ap jestyn a prince of wales he was a man of interest and wealth entered strongly into their views and in consequence in the year   0  was outlawed for his attachment to them  here the three chieftains formed the division of britain unite with glyndwr sir edmund mortimer in behalf of his nephew the earl of march took all the country from the trent and seven to the eastern and southern limits of the island northumberland was to have all the counties north of the trent and glyndwr every thing that lay beyond the severn westward  it was on this occasion that owen to animate his countrymen called up the ancient prophecy which predicted the destruction of henry under the name of the moldwarp cursed of gods own mouth himself he styled the dragon a name he assumed in imitatation of uther whose victories over the saxons were foretold by the appearance of a star with a dragon beneath which uther used as his badge and on that account it became a favorite one with the welsh on percy he bestowed the title of lion from the crest of the family on mortimer that of the wolf probably from a similar reason and these three were to divide the realm between them  glyndwr was now in the meridian of his glory concention of the estates of wales he assembled the estates of wales at machynlleth a town of montgomeryshire he caused there his title to the principality to be acknowleged and was formally crowned  at this meeting he narrowly escaped assassination david gam conspires against owen among the chieftains who appeared to support his title came a gentleman of brecknockshire david gam or the oneeyed a man says mr carte ii      who held his estate of the honor of hereford who had long been in the service of bolingbrook and was firmly attached to his interest notwithstanding he had married a sister of glyndwr yet such a furious hatred had he conceived to his cause that he appeared at the assembly with the secret and treacherous resolution of murdering his prince and brotherinlaw carte says that he was instigated to it by henry but gives no authority for his assertion partyzeal or hopes of reward probably determined him to so nefarious a deed he was a fit instrument for the purpose a man of unshaken courage which was afterward put to the proof in the following reign at the battle of azincourt this was the gentleman who was sent to explore the numbers of the enemy before the action and who informed the king that there were enough to kill enough to be taken prisoners and enough to run away in the battle david his soninlaw roger vychan and his relation waltar llwyd rescued the king when environed with his foes they saved his life at the expense of their own and fell with many mortal wounds the king after the victory approached the place where they lay weltering in their blood and in the moment of death bestowed on them the only reward of their valor which he could confer in that sad time the honor of knighthood  but to return to the subject immediately under consideration detected the plot of david against glyndwr was discovered he was arrested and imprisoned and would have met with his merited punishment if he had not been saved by the intercession of owens best friends and warmest partisans wynnes hist wales      he was pardoned on a solemn promise of attachment to the cause of glyndwr and his country it appears that our chieftain did not choose to rely on his promise but kept him in close confinement till the year      as will appear in the transaction of that period  glyndwr as usual wreaked his vengeance on the lands and dependents of dafydd gam entered his country and burnt his house and while it was burning calling one of davids tenants spoke thus merrily to him in verse which shows the general turn of our people to the rhyming art  o gweli di wr coch came in ymofyn y gyrnigwen dywed ei bod hi tan y lan

numbers of the welsh joined hotspur and marched with him to lichfield carrying the stag the badge of the late king as a party distinction in that city he published his reasons for taking arms against henry whom the family had so lately placed on the throne leland collect ii      from hence he led his army toward shrewshury probably because he found himself too weak to attack the usurper for it seems as if his intention had been to have met him on his march had glyndwr joined him with his whole force glyndwr on the other hand had formed a considerable army in wales and sir edmund mortimer had raised the vassals of his nephew  in the month of march henry gave a strong proof of the high opinion he had of his son henry of monmouth afterward king of england at this time only fifteen years of age for by writ dated from westminster the  th of that month he appoints him his lieutenant for wales rymer viii     and all the adjacent counties with full powers to raise men and to act against the insurgents as he should think proper to enquire into all treasons to examine who supplied the rebels with arms or provisions and to grant pardon to all who would lay down their arms and give security for their peaceful behavior  having thus provided as he imagined for the security of the borders of england on the side of wales he began to consider of his march against the percies but hearing that glyndwr idem  0   by reason of want of provisions was preparing to make an inroad into the borders issued orders from westminster dated june   th to the lieutenant of gloucestershire idem      to prepare to repel the invasion with forces he should assemble for that purpose henry then made a most expeditious march to burton upon trent where we find him on the   th on his way against the northern rebels rymer  henry goes to meet him here he understood that percy with his army had advanced toward shrewshury and was preparing to effect a junction with the forces of glyndwr and mortimer he well knew the importance of preventing it from taking place and directed his march toward that town as is said by the advice of the earl of dunbar a scottish nobleman who had espoused his cause the dispatch with which the king executed this resolution saved his crown glyndwr who had assembled his forces at oswestry had sent off only his first division amounting to four thousand men who behaved with spirit in the day of action holinshed      in which fell his brotherinlaw sir jenkin hanmer collinss baronets ii     ed    0  henry prevented him from proceeding with the rest by posting himself between glyndwr and shrewsbury and at the critical time that the northern rebels were about to scale the walls percy quitted the attempt and after rejecting the offer of peace attacked the royal army at battlefield three miles from the place percy defbated and slain he behaved with the spirit worthy of his name fell valiantly and with him the hopes of his party this action happened on the   st of june glyndwr had the mortification of being obliged to remain all the time inactive at the head of twelve thousand men at oswestry glyndwr continues at oswestry the welsh historians pass an unjust censure on him for his conduct on this occasion and blame him for what it seems he could not effect his great oversight appears to me to have been the neglect of attacking henry immediately after the battle when the royal forces had sustained a vast loss and were overcome with fatigue when his own followers and the remains of the northern troops would have formed an army nearly double to that of the king when northumberland now recovered from his illness was in full march toward him the army of mortimer entire that of the king constrained to go northward glyndwr carried on a marauding war and plundered the now defenseless marches the king returned successful from the north to the borders of wales determined to chastise the insurgents but was obliged to desist from his enterprise for want of money to pay his troops and provisions to subsist them he did propose to remedy the first by seizing on the superfluous wealth of the prelates but was prevented by the spirit of the archbishop of canterbury who boldly declared that none of his province should be spoiled on any account which frustrated henrys intent on glyndwr the prelate was afterward better advised and made a grant of the tenth toward the kings necessary charges helinshed       nothing more was done this year than the securing the welsh castles hanry secures the welen castles and placing over them persons of known fidelity the king dates his writ from worcester the  th of september and addressing it to guy mohun bishop of st david at that time keeper of the privy seal and treasurer of england commits to him the custody of the castle of llangadyn that of llanyndovery to john touchet lord audley laghern to sir henry le scrope crickhowel to john pauncefort tretour to james berkley ahergavenny and harald ewyas

baron of bursord brawpton to brian de brampton and to sir john chandos the castle of snowdon rymer viii       the last public act relating to the insurrections of die marches was to empower the prince of wales to treat with certain cheshire idem     gentlemen about their fines for appearing in arms in the battle of shrowshury  on the   th and   th of the same month he gives power to william beauchamp to pardon certain of the vassals on his lands of abergavenny and ewyas harald who had appeared in arms in behalf of glyndwr and to the famous sir john oldcastle john ap henry and john fairsord clerk to pardon the inhabitants of brecknock built cancresselly hay glynbough and dynas to receive their weapons and to oblige them to take an oath of fidelity in this the king only secures their persons but reserves to himself their forfeited lands goods and chattels the first is dated from hereford the other from devenok idem     idem     0   notwithstanding the french king had consented conduct of the french through the necessity of his own affairs to a truce of thirty years with henry yet he never could be brought to acknowledge his title to the crown in his treaties charles styles him only notre cousin dangleterre idem  or henry of lancaster or our adversary of england or the successor of the late king richard carte ii      there is all the appearance of a correspondence between charles and the english and welsh insurgents in the last year and that the expedition toward shrewshury and an invasion of england by the french were concerted to distract the attention of henry their fleets hovered over our coasts under other pretenses they even landed in the isle of wight and did considerable damage to the country  an open war was daily expected with france the parliament took the safety of the kings person into consideration his household was regulated and in particular it was ordered that no frenchman or welshman should remain about his majestys person parliamentary hist ii      the wisdom of this provision soon became very apparent glyndwr sends ambassadors to charles vii a league offensive and defensive was formed between charles and owen owen sent his chancellor griffith young doctor of laws and his kinsman john hanmer ambassadors to the french their appointment is dated from dolgellu in a princely style datum apud doleguelii  0 die mensis maii mcccc quarto et principalus nostri quarto and begins owinus dei gratia princeps walliae etc rymer viii       charles received them with open arms the league was signed at paris on the   th of june the persons that acted on the part of charles were james bourbon earl of march and john bishop of carnot league concluded between them owens ambassadors signed their part on the   th of july in the house of ferdinand de corbey chancellor of france several prelates and persons of high rank attending as witnesses rymer viii              glyndwr ratified this treaty on the   th of    0  from his castle of lampadarn idem       the affairs of glyndwr bore so prosperous an aspect that about this time trovor bishop of st asaph revolted from henry and joined with his countryman whether actuated by remorse for his dealings with his old master or tempted by the hopes of preferment under a new government is not evident  owen opened the campaign of this year with vigor he laid waste the country of his enemies took several castles glyndwr reteats before the english among others those of harlech and aherystwyth some he dismantled and others he reserved and garrisoned he then directed his march into montgomeryshire and fell in with an english army at mynydd cwm du they attacked him slew many of his men and obliged him to retreat he soon repaired this disgrace for collecting his forces again he pursued the victors with such expedition defeats them that he overtook them at a place called craig y dorth near monmouth defeated and pursued them to the very gates of every town or castle they had fled to  the english historians mention the defeat of glyndwr they inform us that the english army was commanded by richard beauchamp earl of warwick who took the banner of glyndwr dugdales baron i      but are silent in respect of the revenge that so immediately followed the king undertook nothing this year against glyndwr beauchamp had large possessions in the county of monmouth and found it requisite to raise his vassals to preserve his country from desolation    0   this year opened with an attempt of a very extraordinary nature nothing less than to free from their confinement the young earl of march and his brother attempts to steal away the ear of march with the intent of setting up the title of the first first that of henry and to involve the whole kingdom in his quarrel there were many engaged in the design wales was to have been his asylum and glyndwr his protector such deep intelligence had he with the dissaffected even near the seat of the court march was kept in close custody at windsor a royal residence amidst guards and secured by every precaution that a jealous usurper could invent notwithstanding a plot was laid constance lady spencer widow to lord spencer and sister to the duke of york contrived their deliverance she procured false keys stole away the two youths and was hastening with them toward wales when they were seized and brought back the lady was imprisoned a severer fate attended the poor smith that made the keys who was beheaded after having both his hands chopped off holinshed       fortune now began to frown upon glyndwr the first experience he had of her mutability was on the   th of march battle of uske a body of his partisans to the amount of eight thousand had assembled out of glamorganshire uske netherwent and overwent as usual they began their march with desolating the country and burnt part of the town of grosmont in the county of monmouth henry prince of wales was at that time at heresord with the army entrusted to him by his father ready to open the campaign he there received an account of the defeat of these malcontents by a handful of men commanded by sir gilbert talbot joined by sir william newport and sir john greindre he transmitted the account to his father in a letter written in an uncommon strain of piety and dutifulness contradictory to the popular opinion of his early licentiousness for at that time he was only seventeen years of age he begins with imploring heaven for its favor toward his father je supply vraiement que dieu vous montre graciousment pour vous son miracle on toutes parties loez soit il en toutes ses ocures  il est bien voirs que la victoire nest pas en le multitude de people mes en la puissance de dieu  it seems that the welsh forgot the ancient spirit of their country and yielded an easy victory to the enemy eight hundred or a thousand were stain no quarter was given on the occasion except to one person un grant chiefteyn enter eulx the humanity of young henry appears to great advantage on this affair he tells his father that he would have sent the prisoner to him but that he could not yet ride with any ease i suppose on account of his wounds mes il ne poet chivacher uncore a son aise rymer viii   0   to repair this disaster glyndwr instantly sent one of his sons with another army they probably were reinforced by the fugitives from the last action of pwll melyn another battle was fought on the fifteenth of the same month at mynydd y pwll melyn in brecknockshire again fatal to the cause of owen fifteen hundred of his men were slain or taken prisoners among the last was his son among the first his brother tudor who resembled glyndwr so greatly that a report was spread of his death to the great dejection of his countrymen but on examining the dead body it was found to want a wart over the eye which distinguished our chieftain from his brother according to carte ii      young henry commanded at this battle  holinshed     mentions another defeat which the welsh sustained in the month of may in which gryffydd young owens chancellor was made prisoner i suspect that the historian confounds this action with that near grosmont but that the chancellor was the great chieftain there made prisoner must be a mistake for we find him witness the next year to a pardon granted by owen to one jeven goch  after these defeats all glamorganshire submitted to the king a few faithful friends only excepted who on discovering that owen was alive fled and joined him it was at this time that he suffered those distresses which the english attribute to the latter part of his life during this dispersion of his friends he was obliged to seek protection from a few trusty partisans and often to conceal himself in caves and desert places a cavern near the seaside in the parish of llangelynin in the county of merioneth is still called ogof owain in which he was secretly supported by ednyfed ap aaron of the tribe of ednowain ap bradwen  the bard jolo goch deplores his absence and calls him home from different parts of the globe to repossess himself of his principality he in one place supposes him to be at rome and entreats him to return laden with tokens from st peter  about this time the earl of northumberland began another conspiracy which was detected and several of his adherents were executed among others one sir john griffith a welsh knight which makes it probable that the earl and glyndwr still acted in concert the king by his activity quickly frustrated this plot seized on the earls castles and obliged him to fly into scotland for protection with him fled the bishops of st asaph and bangor ferdun scotichronicon ii      and the abbot of welbeck the two first were probably placed by glyndwr about the earl to consult the proper measures for the successful execution of their designs  henry then returned henry marchrs again into wales and marched into wales with an army of   000 men the same illfortune attended him in this as in former expeditions the weather proved so bad that he was obliged to make a hasty retreat to worcester aggravated with the loss of fifty of his carriages walsingham      shakespeare makes our chieftain thus vaunt the frequent defeats of his antagonist even before the battle of shrewshury  three times has henry bolingbreke made head against my

have found a sad change had not at this very period his ally charles vi feench assist owek sent him a most seasonable assistance which for a considerable time prolonged the war and delayed his total ruin a considerable armament was made in the ports of france it was planned by the duke of orleans histoire et regue de charles vi tom iv   0  regent of france during the insanity of charles the invasion was to have taken place the preceding year and as rapin observes seems to have been intended to coincide with the insurrection of scroope archbishop of york and other noblemen in the north their attempt proved fatal to them but the sleet consisting of a hundred and forty ships sailed from breast the latter end of june with an army of twelve thousand  according to the historian of this reign mademoiselle de lassan ibid  there were among them eight hundred men at arms six hundred crossbows and twelve hundred footsoldiers all chosen troops  our historians say that they were commanded by the marechal de montmorency but i cannot discover that any of that great houss was engaged in the expedition the fleet was under the command of renaud de try lord of serisontaine admiral of france the land forces under that of jean de rieux lord of rieux and rochsort marshal of france under him served jean or as moreri calls him aubert de hangest sire de hugueville master or the crossbows and who by reason of the age and infirmities of ricux seems to have been the acting general according to the genius of the nation the officers made the most brilliant appearance and hugueville actually sold to the church of paris his fine estate of agencourt near mondidier in order to furnish himself with a magnificent equipage histoire et regne de charles vi tom iv   0   the sleet had a very favorable passage but by neglect of providing sufficient quantity of fresh water most of the horses perished landin wales according to the best authority rymer viii  0   the forces landed under the command of hugueville in milsord haven he immediately marched toward caermarthen which he besieged and look by capitulation the garrison were suffered to depart and had liberty to take their effects with them walsingham       he declined making any attempt on pembroke by reason of the strength of the castle but sat down before haversordwest where the earl of arundel made so gallant a defense that the french were obliged to raise the siege with considerable loss glyndwr had by this time reached tenbigh with ten thousand men where he was joined by hugueville as soon as the necessary preparations were finished they marched through glamorganshire reached worcester and burnt the suburbs and ravaged the country round monstrelet   as soon as henry heard of the intended invasion he issued out a proclamation rymer viii  dated from westminster july  d in which he directs the lieutenants of several counties to raise forces to repel the foe lord berkley and henry pay admiral of the cinque ports commanded at sea and burnt according to our accounts fifteen of the french ships as they lay at anchor in milford haven and afterward joined by sir thomas swinborn took fourteen more in their passage to wales laden with ammunition and provisions for the army walsingbam     who adds that a marshal and seven captains were takes at the same time  mademoiselle de lussan takes notice of the first but heartily confesses that the french were so terrified with the appearance of thirty sail of our ships that they themselves directed the destruction of these vessels  in the beginning of august henry received advice that the french were landed and again sends out a proclamation dated from pontesract august  th addressed to the lieutenant of the county of hereford with orders to raise without delay his forces and repair with them to the city of hereford it is in this proclamation he expressly calls the french general lord of huguevilie  henry marched in person to oppose an enemy now grown so very formidable henry marches agaisst them but hugueville after plundering the country on the kings approach made a sudden retreat and posted himself on a high hill about three leagues from worcester with a deep valley between his and the royal army each endeavored to bring the enemy to make the attack and for eight days they respectively presented themselves in order of battle and so continued from morning till night but neither party ventured to descend from its advantageous situation during this time there were several skirmishes the loss on both sides was about two hundred besides numbers wounded the french lost patrouillart de try lord of mouci and plessis chamberlain to the king and brother to the admiral a gallant officer whose fate was much lamented by the army  moreri who says he fell a the attack of haversordwest  there fell that day also the lord of martelonne and the lord of la valle and as hall says the bastard of bourbon our historians seetn to exaggerate their loss adding to it that of five hundred other gentlemen but monstrelet asserts that on a review of the french troops when they returned home only sixty were found missing  the camp that owen is supposed to have possessed is on wobury hill in the parish of whittley exactly nine miles northwest of worcester it is surrounded with a single fosse and contains near twentyseven acres it probably had been an ancient british post but was extremely convenient for glyndwr not only by reason of its strength but as wales lay open to him he had it in his power to retreat among the mountains whenever he found it necessary i never had an opportunity of examining the nature of the ground and how far it suits the description given by monstrelet but the public will have their curiosity amply gratified by the pen of my friend dr nash now employed in forming the history of his native county  henry acted the part of a prudent general by cutting off the means of every supply from the enemy who worn with famine and fatigue in the midnight of the eighth day decamped with the utmost secrecy and retired into wales monstrelet    hail     monstrelet makes the king quit his station first and return the same night to worcester and adds that the french attacked him in his retreat and took from him eighteen wagons laden with provisions hall on the contrary assures us that henry chased the enemy from hills to dales from dales to woddes from woddes to marshes and yet could never have them at any advantage a world it was to see his quotidiane removyng his paynfull and busy wanderyng his troublesome and uncertayne abidyng his continual mocion his daily peregrinacion in the desert felles and craggy mountains of that barreine unfertile and depopulate country in the end the king unable any longer to subsi his army in a country which glyndwr had expressly destroyed to dutress his enemy was obliged to desist from his pursuit and to return to wercester and as hall owns in his retreat lost certain cariages laden with vitayle to his great displeasure and to the great comfort of the welsh  i must enquire when henry had leisure for so long and tedioas a campaign time of this campaign for i find him the   d of august at pontesrad the   th at worcester and the  th of september at heresord in four days from that time it appears he was at faxflete  at beverley the   th of the same month at bishopthorp in the same county from the   th to the   st the next day at cawoed after which there is an unaccounted gap of time till he appears again at worcester the  th of october i am thus minute to show that henry possessed a strength of body equal to his activity of mind otherwise he never could have slown with that rapidity from place to place nor have guarded against enemies so remote as the scots and welsh at nearly the same period  it seems as if all his forces destined to oppose the last were arrived at their places of rendezvous before the  th of october rymer viii   0 from that time he was in all probability engaged in this expedition hall assigning among other reasons for the kings desisting from his enterprise the approach of winter which rendered a campaign amidst the mountains highly unsafe accordingly we find him at dunstable on his road to london the  d of november idem      and at his palace at westminster soon after ibid   the french after their slight never made any farther attempt glyndwr placed them in quarters where they remained till they quitted the kingdom when he furnished the greater part with vessels to transport them to france french quit wales fifteen hundred remained in wales till the march following when they were carried home by a person styled by de lussan le begue de volay de lassan iv       after the defeat of gryssydd son of glyndwr by henry prince of wales that youthful warrior undertook the siege of llanbedr castle in the county of cardigan siege of llanbedr castle after some time the governor placed there by glyndwr agreed to give it up in case it was not relieved between the   th of october and the feast of all saints he was to surrender it in good condition not to injure the habitations in the town nor seize any ships that should be driven into the port by distress of weather that he should have free pardon and have liberty at the end of the term to depart with all his effects and those of his friends i observe among the instruments of war which were to be delivered up were canones anglice gunnes which had been invented by the french about twentysix years before this period he took the sacrament in witness of his sincerity and delivered hostages for the performance of his agreement he probably relied on the assistance of the french for relief henry apprehended the same but in order to frustrate any attempts of that kind he issued out a writ dated from cawood the   d of september to the lieutenants of devonshire and of other counties to raise their forces and to rendezvous at evesham on the  0th of october rymer viii          this caution took effect so far as to oblige rees ap gryffydd ap shenkin alias rees ap llewelyn to agree to the terms proposed but seemingly without any design of preserving them for no sooner was the prince departed than rees permitted glyndwr to turn him and his garrison out under pretense that they had been guilty of treason in submitting without his consent welsingham     holinshed       i must conclude the transactions of this year with remarking the solicitude of the lords and commons about the relief of the lord of coitie siege of coitie castle by glynwr then besieged in the castle of the same name seated near the river ogmore in glamorganshire henry was little concerned about his fate but several prelates and persons of rank in both houses offered a loan for the purpose of raising forces for his rescue at length it was agreed by king and parliament that those loans should be repaid out of the first payments of the subsidy at that time granted drakes parliamentary history ii    this was a very considerable fortress as appears by bucks view of it vol ii no         0   from the latter end of last year the affairs of glyndwr began to decline he had still strength sufficient to keep within his mountanous territories but was too weak to meditate any thing more than marauding invasions french send more forces the french continued to give him some assistance they sent a sleet of thirtyeight sail i imagine from the small number that they were wearied of their ally yet were willing to keep up for their own interest the spirit of the insurgents eight of these ships laden with men at arms were taken the rest escaped in great confusion to wales walsingham       about this time owen was considerably weakened by the defection of the inhabitants of ystrad tywy  the presence of that brave and active prince henry of monmouth who at the express request of parliament parliamentary hist ii    resided in some part of wales was no small check on the enterprizing temper of glyndwr nor a less terror to the welsh who had felt the force of his arms at the same time parliament sensible of the folly of the premature grants before made of the estates of the insurgents entered on record that no heritages conquered from the welsh be given away till one quarter of an year after ibid  so precarious seemed the tenure even in the declining state of our chiestain i may remark that he still had strength enough to give protection to the english fugitives the great earl of northumberland and lord bardels found here a hospitable asylum after the sts to whom they had entrusted themselves meditated the giving of them up to henry in exchange for certain prisoners sir david fleming of cumbernauld generously warned them of the intentions of his countrymen who in revenge took away his life walsingham       before the expiration of this year henry made a grant in fee to sir john tibetot speaker of the house of commons and father to the accomplished peer john earl of worcester of the estates of richard ap gryffydd ap vychan in the counties of caermarthen and cardigan forfeited by his adherence to the party of glyndwr parliamentary

witnesses are gryffydd his eldest son and gryffydd young his chancellor both of whom the english historians say were made prisoners and sent to the tower as henry showed no mercy to the partisans of owen it is  probable that these two would have escaped his rage had  ever been in his power the other two witnesses are meredith another of his sons and rhys ap tudur and gwillim ap   notwithstanding this ostentation of regal power his affairs decline the affairs of glyndwr evidently declined the garrisons placed in most of the different fortresses of north wales had kept the maritime parts from rising in any numbers in his favor in the island of auglesca he seems to have had a very strong party it does not appear that there ever was any battle in that island it is my opinion that the partisans of owen had passed the menai and while their zeal was warm had joined his army and like the custom in all feudal times returned to their homes when wearied with the campaign or satiated with plunder  by the latter end of this year they had submitted to the royal authority for i find from a transcript of a manuscript found among the papers of the learned edward llwyd of the musaeum this

harlech he was consined to the hills and seems never to have quitted his fastnesses but to make a praedatory war the earl or northumberland and lord bardols about this time apprehending that owen was too weak to protect them quitted wales and soon after lost their lives in a desperate effort to restore their cause on bramhammoor in yorkshire    0   in this year i discover nothing relative to the welsh affairs farther than a due compliment paid to the prince of wales by the commons who by their speaker desired the king to give public thanks to young henry for his great fatigue and good conduct in wales for which both king and prince returned their compliments again to the commons rymer viii         0   in this year glyndwr again began to make head makes head again by himself or his partisans he made great devastations on the marches and in those parts of wales that were well affected to the english government the estates of edward de charlion lord powys suffered grely henry therefore directs a write to  nobleman to raiss his sorces and supps in the most  manner this new disturbance ded as it appears by  himself and the bishop of st  lord pouys  the same time instructed

relates that rhys was taken before the justices condemned and drawn on a hurdle through the city to tyburn where he suffered the death of a traitor his quarters were sent to four other cities his head

expressly appointed for that purpose certis de causis ad ea omnia et singula quae ad officium marescalli angliae pertinent exercenda per litteras nostras patentes quam diu nobis placuerit duraturas deputavimus  toward the latter end of the year several of the officers of the lords marchers either through dislike to the war or for the sake of preserving their country from the fury of the welsh of their own authority formed a truce with glyndwr and his partisans this only served to enable them to make their inroads on other parts with more security many of the loyal borderers were slain and others plundered in consequence of these agreements henry was highly irritated and immediately issued out writs dated from northampton   d november to thomas earl of arundel sir richard lestrange lord of knockyn ellesmere and other borderirg manors edward charlton lord powys and reginald lord gray of ruthyn and to the deputylieutenant of heresordshire directing them to cause all such illegal compacts to be rescinded and glyndwr and his adherents to be pursued and attacked with the utmost vigor  from this period owen never made any attempts worthy of historic notice numbers of his followers deserted which obliged him to confine himself to the hills and to act entirely on the defensive notwithstanding his power was reduced he was far from being subdued the years    0 and      were passed without any memorable actions the english were content with the ease they enjoyed by restraining the outrages of the mountaneers glyndwr maintained that extensive tract that forms the alps of our country and kept his prisoners so securely consined that even henry in      was under the necessity of permitting by writ dated july   th rymer viii      his esquire llewelyn ap hoel father to the noted david gam to make use of sir john tiptoste and william botiller to treat with owen about the redemption of his son who was kept forti et dura prisona or to endeavor to seize foam of glyndwrs friends to exchange for gam treaty what the result of this affair was does not appear it serves though to disprove the opinion that david escaped to england after his infamous attempt in   0  for which as is now evident he suffered a most fevere but merited captivity of ten years from which all the power of his english friends could not release him  the prison where owen confined his captives was not far from his house the prison of glyndwr in the parish of llansanfraid glyndwrdwy and the place is to this day called carchardy owen glyndwrdwy some remains are still to be seen near the church which form part of a habitable house it consists of a room thirteen feet square and ten and a half high the sides consist of three horizontal beams with upright planks not four inches asunder mortised into them in these are grooves with holes in the bottom as if there had been originally crossbars or grates the roof is exceedingly strong composed of strong planks almost contiguous it seems as if there had been two stories but the upper part at present is evidently modern  it is singular that the government did not take advantage of two welshmen of rank whom they had this year in their power and whom they might have made the price of the liberty of their partizan these were rhys ap tudur of penmynydd in anglesea and his brother perhaps they were taken after the treaty had its effect perhaps their crimes were too enormous for pardon but whatsoever the case was they were both conveyed to chester and there put to death  i must not omit that in    0 henry prince of wales gave a free pardon to certain of his tenants in the comot of coleshill in the county of flint harleian mss no          for the share they had in what was styled the rebellion of glyndwr that county was much divided in those troubles howel gwynedd descended from edwin lord of tegengle a valiant gentleman who sided with our chieftain was in one of tire preceding years surprised by his enemies from the town of flint he probably was posted within the trenches of moel y gaer in the parish of northop on which he was without process beheaded        henry died in the beginning of this year heney dies and left his youthful successor so engaged in his preparations for the conquest of france as to lose ail thoughts of the entire subjection of his british dominions glyndwr remained still inaccessible but was so closely guarded as to cease to be tremendous the wsh who had submitted now began to indulge their revenge against such of the english who had slain or otherwise injured any of their relations or friends in the late war this revenge was taken by various kinds of distress and imprisonment till they had cleared themselves by compurgation or made some satisfactory agreement to remedy this henry the vth in his first year abolishes statutes at large ruffheads ed i     par un assach solonc la custom de gales dest a dire par la serement de ccc bommes see also leges wallicae     and seq the assach or oath of  00 men necessary according to the custom of wales to clear a person accused of any crime assach before that an englishman was liable to continue in jail for life as it seems impossible for one of that hated nation to procure even a far less number of compurgators than this strange law required for his acquittal henry made the attempt penal and the prosecutor liable to an imprisonment of two years to pay treble damages and to pay beside a fine and ransom before he could be released  this was the last of the many laws enacted against the welsh on occasion of this insurrection severe laws they were certainly very severe yet perhaps no more than what any government would have directed against a people that had submitted to conquest near a hundred and twenty years and who were considered in no other light than that of rebellious subjects  on the first insurrection conciliatory methods were tried and pardons offered after experience of the little effect these had on the minds of the welsh every lenient step was laid aside and laws of a very severe nature were put in force against them  the first was in the year   00 it was found expedient to prevent as much as possible all intercourse between the welsh and english the first were strongly attached to the cause of richard the last had many secret favorers of that unhappy prince among them there appeared much danger if the former were permitted to strengthen their interest in england a coalition fatal to the new government was apprehended as a preventative it was enacted that no person born on both sides of welsh parents should purchase lands or tenements near any of the cities or towns on the marches of wales on pain of forfeiting them to the lord paramount where such estates lay that no welshman should be received into any corporation town or if they had been settled in any such before they were to find security for their good and loyal behavior they were to be totally disqualified from any civil office and never allowed to carry any weapons  in case any welshman refused to restore to any englishman the cattle horses or the like which he had forcibly taken within seven days the englishman was allowed to retaliate  so little trust was there in justice from our countrymen that it was enacted that no englishman should be condemned at the suit of a welshman unless by english justices or english burgesses  so greatly did the government apprehend the seduction of english loyalty by the charms of our countrywomen that the english were prohibited from marrying with a welshwoman under the pain of being disqualified from holding any office in wales  in   0  there is a very particular statute intended to remedy the mischiefs resulting from some customs peculiar to wales this directs kymhortha that null westour rymour minstrall ne vagabond soit aucunement sustenuz en la terre de gales par fair kymorthas ou coillage sur le commune poeple illoeqes i cannot give a better translation than that in the observations on the ancient statutes by my esteemed friend the honorable daines barrington which is to this purpose that no host i beg leave to render the word westour differently it seems derived from the welsh gwestwr which signifies a person who kept a place of public entertainment and such a place was very proper for a rendezvous of this nature  rhymer minstrel or other vagabond should presume to assemble or collect together  the word kymhortha is misspelt from the welsh cymmorth or the plural cymmorthau assemblies of people to assist a neighbor in any work such are very frequently in use at present there are cymmorthan for spinning for works of husbandry for coalcarriage but at this time these meetings were mere pretenses and their end was the collecting a sufficient number of ablebodied men to make an insurrection of such a nature in old times were the huntingmatches in scotland the legislature in that part of great britain found the evils resulting from them and at length suppressed them by a law  but cymhorthau of our countrymen were at this period of a most tremendous nature they were composed of men the most dreaded by tyrants and usurpers of bards who animated our nation by recalling to mind the great exploits of our ancestors their struggles for liberty their successful contests with the saxon and norman race for upwards of eight centuries they rehearsed the cruelty of their antagonists and did not forget the savage policy of the first edward to their proscribed brethren they brought before their countrymen the remembrance of ancient prophecies they showed to them the hero glyndwr descended from the ancient race of our princes and pronounced that in him was to be expected the completion of every prediction of our oracular merlin the band of minstrels now struck up the harp the crwth and the pipe filled the measure of enthusiasm which the others had begun to inspire they rushed to battle fearless of events like their great ancestry moved by the druids songs and scorned death which conferred immortality in reward of their valor inde ruendi in ferrum mens prona viris animaeque capaces mortis et ignavum est rediturae parcere vitae lucan hence they no cares for this frail being feel but rush undaunted on the pointed steel provoke approaching fate and bravely scorn to spare that life which must so soon return rows  we find that glyndwr maintained his situation for two year longer in      his affairs bore so respectable an aspect that the king condescended to enter into a treaty with him and for that purpose deputed from the castle of porchester the writ is dated july  th rymer ix      sir gocrt talbot with full powers to negotiate with owen and even to offer him and his followers a free pardon in case they sliould request it some writers say that this grace was obtained by the mediation of david holbech deputy steward of the lordships of bromfield and yale diath of owen the event of this affair does not appear it is probable that it was interrupted by the death of our hero which happened on the  0th of september on the eve of st matthew in the sixtyfirst year of his age at the house of one of his daughters but whether that of his daughter scudamore or monnington is uncertain but according to the tradition of the county of hereford it may be supposed to have been at that of the last it is said that he was buried in the churchyard of monnington but there is no monument or any memorial of the spot that contains his remains  both the printed histories and the manuscript accounts represent his latter end to have been very miserable that he was dered from place to place in the habit of a shepherd in a l valle crucis abbey and forlorn condition and was even forced to take shelter in caves and desert places from the fury of his enemies rymir ix   0  this does not wear the face of probability for had his situation been so deplorable majesty would never have condescended to propose terms to such a scourge as glyndwr had been to his kingdom this retreat and the distresses he underwent were probably after the battle of pwll melyn in   0  from which he quickly emerged death alone deprived owen of the glory of accepting an offered accommodation the treaty was renewed by the same minister on the   th of february      with meredydd ap owen the son of glyndwr which it is to be supposed took effect and peace was restored to england after an indecisive struggle of more than fifteen years our chieftain died unsubdued unfortunate only in foreseeing a second subjugation of his country after the loss of the great supporter of its independency  having now collected every thing in my power relating to this celebrated briton i return by the same road cross the dee at llangollen and after a ride of about a mile turn a little out of the road in a fertile little vale to the abbey of  llanegwest abbey of valle crucis glynegwest monachlog or de valle crucis solemnly seated at the foot of the mountains on a small meadowy flat watered by a pretty stream and shaded with hanging woods this was a house of cistertians founded in the year   00 by madoc

the abbot of tallelechew and obtained a decision in favor of him and his successors but as there was some doubt about the patronage of the church of llandegla they allotted in lieu of it to the abbey

put under sequestration by orders of the commissioners from the ruling powers  there still remain the ruins of the church church and part of the abbey the last inhabited by a farmer the church was built in form of a cross in different styles of architecture the most ancient is that of the east end where the windows are in form of long and narrow slips pointed at top the window at the west end is large divided by stone tracery and above is a round window of elegant work above it is an inscription in memory of the person who repaired or rebuilt this part an honor frequently paid to benefactors of this kind it is in this form and adam dms fecit hoc opus pace beata quiescat amen and just beneath are the letters m d probably part of the date the rest being lost we cannot ascertain the person intended in this line he was probably one of the house of trevawr in which that name occurs more than once as adam or adda vawr of trevawr and adam or adda ap jorwerth ddu of pengwern  the capitals of the pilasters within the church are finished with elegant foliage in the north transept is a cloister of two arches an arch that once contained a tomb and near it a double benetoire or

it a small space where he might stand to hear the holy offices performed below  the lower part of the abbey is vaulted and supported by rows of low pillars now divided into different rooms in front is

valle crucis abbey   pillar of eliseg   about a quarter of a mile higher up the vale pillar of eaiseq in the hedge of a meadow i met with the remainder of a round column perhaps one of the most ancient of any british inscribed pillar now existing  it was entire till the civil wars of the last century when it was thrown down and broken by some ignorant fanatics who thought it had too much the appearance of a cross to be suffered to stand it probably bore the name of one for the field it lies in is still called llwynygroes or the grove of the cross from the wood that surrounded it it was erected at so early a period that there is nothing mavelous if we should perceive a tincture of the old idolatry or at left of the primeval customs of our country in the mode of it when perfect  the pillar never had been a cross notwithstanding folly and superstition might in later times imagine it to have been one and have paid it the usual honors it was a memorial of the dead an improvement on the rude columns of druidical times and cut into form and surrounded with inscription it is among the first lettered stones that succeeded the meinihirion meinigwr and llcchau it stood on a great tumulus perhaps always environed with wood as the mount is at present according to the custom of the most ancient times when standing pillars were placed under every green tree kings ii    see the learned rowlands      it is said that the stone when complete was twelve feet high it is now reduced to six feet eight the remainder of the capital is eighteen inches long it stood infixed in a square

county of caermarthen where the place in which a monumental stone stands is called pant y polion corruptly for pant pawlin from paulinus the person it was inscribed to  servator fidei patriaeque

old castle descended and after crossing the rill of the bran arrived in the valley of glisseg valley of glisseg long and narrow bounded on the right by the asbonishing precipices divided into numberless parallel strata of white limestone often giving birth to vast yewtrees and on the left by smooth and verdant hills bordered by pretty woods one of the principal of the glisseg rocks is honored with the name of craigarthur that at the end of the vale is called craig y forwyn or the maidens is bold precipitous and terminates with a vast natural column  this valley is chiefly inhabited happily by an independent race of warm and wealthy yeomanry undevoured as yet by the great men of the country  in order to get into the great road i pursued a path up a steep ascent to the left and about midway visited a house noted for being the residence of one edward davies a low partizan and plunderer on the side of the usurper during the civil wars he was best known in his own country by the title of cneifiwr glass cneipiwr glass or the blue shaver from his rapacity and the color of his clothes and was considered as a fit instrument of the tyranny of the times in      he was appointed by the commissioners for sequestration steward of the court leet within the manor of valle crucis being recommended to the office by colonel george twisleton the cneifiwr seems to have not been overtrue to his own party when his interest stood in the way he was accustomed to take even the royalists under his protection on receiving a proper reward he once concealed sir evan llwyd of bodidris at the time that a considerable sum was ordered for his apprehension he lodged him in a cellar below the parlor then summoning his people ordered them in a seeming rage to sally out in quest of sir evan stamping with his foot and declaring that if the knight was above ground he would have him  after continuing an ascent for a little space longer reach the pass called bwlch y rhiw velen bwlch y rhiw velen and fall again into the great road this place is distinguished by the deaths of two of the sons of llowarch hen llowarch hen the cumbrian prince of the sixth century who were slain in

midway between holt and eaton boat leave a little to the left a place called havod yr abad the site of one of the countryseats of the abbot of valle crucis close to the roadside lies tommen y rhodwydd once a fortress known by the name of the castle of yale powel  0   built by owen gwynedd about the year      powel  0   this is the place leland mistakenly calls a castle belonging to owen glyndwr it consists of a vast artificial mount with another still loftier near one end the keep of the place these are surrounded with a great fosse and rampart and have only a single entrance at present there are not the lest relics of the superstructure which was probably of wood for we are told that this shortlived castelet was burnt nine years after its erection by jorwerth goch ap meredydd powel  0    it is in this manner we must account for the total disappearance of many welsh castles whose names are preserved in history wooden castles and whose vestiges we have sought for in vain they were made of wood as was very customary with several ancient nations and with others of later date the persians on the approach of the spartans secured themselves within their wooden walls and caesar found great resistance from a tower in the alpine castle of larignum made of the timber of the larix or the larch which was found to be incombustible vitruvsius lib ii c   p     in later times the castle of bamborough was built originally by ida with wood the burgh of murray was fortified by the danes with the same material the people of the same county in      had castles of wood annals scotland     and a century after these more recent instances william de melton archbishop of york in      fortified the mount in that city called the old bale with planks eighteen inches thick  whenever we find an ancient fortress totally vanished and we cannot account for the disposal of the materials in the erecting of any neighboring buildings we must suppose that they had been constructed of wood and that they had been destroyed by fire either flung into them by means of torches or by veltae or vast masses of combustibles rolled against them by the force of numbers as was the practice of the ancient scandinavians described by olaus magnus  from tommen y rhodwydd i crossed the country for about two miles to the village of llandegla llandegla noted for its vast fairs for black cattle the church is dedicated to st tecla virgin and martyr who after her conversion by st paul suffered under nero at iconium  about two hundred yards from the church in a quillet called gwern degla rises a small spring with these letters cut on freestone a g  g st teclass well the water is under the tutelage of the saint and to this day held to be extremely beneficial in the clwyf tegla st teclas disease or the falling sickness the patient washes his limbs in the well makes an offering into it of four pence walks round it three times and thrice repeats the lords prayer these ceremonies are never begun till after sunset in order to inspire the votaries with greater awe if the afflicted be of the malesex like socrates he makes an offering of a cock to his aesculapius or rather to tecla hygeia if of the fairsex a hen the fowl is carried in a basket first round the well after that into the churchyard when the same orisons and the same circumambulations are performed round the church the votary then enters the church gets under the communion table lies down with the bible under his or her head is covered with the carpet or cloth and rests there till break of day departing after offering six pence and leaving the fowl in the church if the bird dies the cure is supposed to have been effected and the disease transferred to the devoted victim  from hence i visited the house of bodidris bodidris a large and ancient place belonging to evan lloyd vaughan esquire of corsygedol in right of his mother margaret daughter of sir evan lloyd baronet the last male of the family descended from ynyr ap

of eight or and gules for while he was talking to his prince after the fight with his left hand smeared with blood he accidentally drew it across his sword and left on it the marks of his four fingers the prince observing this ordered him to carry them on his shield and at the same time bestowed on him the township of gelligynan in this neighborhood as a more substantial mark of his favor  bodidris takes its name from idris son of llewelyn aurdorchog or of the goden torques the ancient lord of yale it stands in two counties flintshire and denbighshire the long table in the hall having an end in each  from hence i continued my journey to llanarmon llamarmon a village whose church is dedicated to st germanus bishop of auxerre who with st lupus contributed to gain the famous victoria alleluiatica over the picts and saxons near mold he was a most popular patron and has numbers of other churches in wales under his protection an image of an ecclesiastic still to be seen in the churchwall is called his in lelands days there was a great resort of pilgrims and large offerings at this place lelands itin v     and probably to this imaginary reseinblance of him  in the church is the tomb of a grandson of the bloodyfingered warrior above mentioned carrying on his shield the arms won by his ancestor inscribed around hic jacet grusudd ap lhewelyn ap ynyr at his feet lies a dog gnawing a heap of intestines the tradition of the country is that he engaged in a crusade in which he lost his life by a wound in the abdomen that his bowels fell out and were seized by a dog as expressed by the sculptor if he fell in the romantic cause of the holy sepulcher the artist must have forgot to have placed him crosslegged the monumental distinction of all such knightserrant the tomb is a chest cut out of one stone in which his body was put and sent home the lid is another stone with his effigies carved out of it  sepulcharal tumuli are very frequent in this parish tumili i was present at the opening of one composed of loose stones and earth covered with a layer of soil about two feet thick and over that a coat of verdant turf in the course of our search were discovered toward the middle of the tumulus several urns made of sunburned clay of a reddish color on the outside black within being stained with the ashes they contained each was placed with the mouth downwards on a flat stone above each was another to preserve them from being broken by the weight above mixed with the loose stones were numerous fragments of bones such as parts of the thighbones the armbones and even a scull these had escaped the effects of the fire of the funeral pile and were deposited about the urns which contained the residuum of the corpse that had been reduced to pure ashes  i shall mention in the following pages the high antiquity of this custom that it was in use with the most polished nations with the greeks and with the romans as well as with the most barbarous the ancient germans practiced this rite as appears from tacitus de moribus german  the druids observed the same with the wild addition of whatsoever was of use in this life under the notion that they would be wanted by the deceased in the world below and in confirmation of this arms and many singular things of unknown use are to this day discovered beneath the places of ancient sepulture mela lib iii c     the remote sarmatae and all the scandinavian nations agreed in the burning of the dead and the danes distinguished by this and the different funeral ceremonies three several epochs wormii mon danic  0   the first which was the same with that in question was called roisold and brendetiide or the age of burning  the second was styled hoigold and hoielsetiide or the age of tumuli or hillocks the corpse at this period was placed entire with all the ornaments which graced it during life the bracelets or arms and even the horse of the departed hero were placed beneath the heap money and all the rich property of the deceased used to be buried with him from the persuasion that the soul was immortal pomponius mela lib iii c   and would stand in need of these things in the other life such was the notion both of the gauls and of the northern nations among the last when pyracy was esteemed honorable these illustrious robbers directed that all their rich plunder should be deposited with their remains bartholinus antiq dan      in order to stimulate their offspring to support themselves and the glory of their name by deeds of arms hence it is we hear of the vast riches discovered in sepulchers and of the frequent violation of the remains of the dead in expectation of treasures even for centuries after this custom had ceased  the third age was called christendomsold when the introduction of christianity put a stop to the former customs for christians as the learned physician of norwich observes abhorred this species of obsequies and though they stickt not to give their bodies to be burnt in their lives detested that mode after death affecting rather depositure than absumption and properly submitted unto the sentence of god to return not unto ashes but to dust again  from the remarks of these able writers we may learn the time of the abolition of the custom of burning among the several nations for it ceased with paganism it therefore fell first into disuse with the britons for it was for some time retained by the saxons after their conquest of this kingdom but was left off on their receiving the light of the gospel the danes retained the custom of urnburial the last of any for of all the northern nations who had any footing in these kingdoms they were the latest who embraced the doctrines of christianity  i cannot establish any criterion by which a judgment may be made of the people to whom the different species of urns and tumuli belonged whether they are british roman saxon or danish  some of the tumuli consist of heaps of naked stones such as those in the isle of arran in many parts of scotland and in some parts of cornwall  others are composed like this of llanarmon with stones and earth nicely covered with earth and sod of these the base is in certain places level with the ground in others surrounded with a trench they were sometimes formed of earth only others are of a conoid form and some oblong of which there is an example in the neighborhood of bryn y pys called the giants grave finally other places of ancient sepulture consisted only of a flat area encompassed like the druidical circles with upright stones and such were those of ubbo and of king harald in sweden suecia antiqua et hodierna tab       the urns are also found placed in different manners with the mouth resting downwards upon a flat stone secured by another above or with the mouth upwards guarded in a like way  very frequently the urns are discovered lodged in a square cell composed of flags sometimes more than one of these cells are found beneath a carn or tumulus i have even met with near dupplin in perthshire not fewer than seventeen disposed in a circular form tour in scotland iii 0   when numbers are found together the tumulus was either a familycemetery or might have contained the relics of a number of heroes who perished with glory in the same cause for such honors were paid only to the great and good  the urns found in these cells are usually surrounded with the fragments of bones that had resisted the fire for the friends of the deceased were particularly careful to collect every particle which they placed with the remains of the charcoal about the urns thinking the neglect the utmost impiety we have no certainty of the ceremonies used by the ancient britons on these mournful occasions but from many circumstances which we continually discover in our tumuli there appear many analogous to those used in ancient greece and rome  the greeks first quenched the funeral pile with wine and the companions or relations of the departed performed the rest such was the ceremony at the funeral of patroclus  where yet the embers glow wide over the pile the sable wine they throw and deep subsides the ashy heap below next the white bones his sad companions place with tears collected in the golden vase the sacred relics to the tent they bore the urn a veil of linen covered over that done they bid the sepulcher aspire and cast the deep foundations round the pyre high in the midst they heap the swelling bed of rising earth memorial of the dead iliad lib xxiii l  pope the duty of collecting the bones

thou oh thou my souls first care shall with thy dear dishevelled locks be there r w i beg leave to add the account given by virgil of the funereal rites of pallas lib xi i      we find in it many ceremonies that were used by the northern nations animals of different species were burnt or deposited with the body the spoils of war and weapons of various kinds were placed on the pile the bones and ashes were collected together and a heap of earth or a tumulus flung over them each of these circumstances are continually discovered in our barrows horns and other relics of quadrupeds weapons of brass and of stone all placed under the very same sort of tombs as are described by homer and virgil perhaps the other ceremonies were not omitted but we have no record that will warrant us to assert that they were in all respects similar  jam pater aeneas etc the tuscan chief and trojan prince command to raise the funeral structures on the strand then to the piles as ancient rites ordain their friends convey the relics of the slain from the black flames the sullen vapors rise and smoke in curling volumes to the skies the foot thrice compass the highblazing pyres thrice move the horse in circles round the fires their tears as loud they howl at every round dim their bright arms and trickle to the ground a peal of groans succeeds and heaven rebounds to the mixed cries and trumpets martial sounds some in the flames the wheels and bridles throw the swords and helmets of the vanquishid foe some the known shields their brethren bore in vain and unsuccessful javlins of the slain now round the piles the bellowing oxen bled and bristly swine in honor of the dead the fields they drove the fleecy flocks they slew and on the greedy flames the victims threw pit since i am engaged in this funebrious subject it will be fit to observe that a discovery of an entire skeleton placed between flags of a proportionable size was made near this place this as well as others similar in different parts of our islands evinces that the ancient inhabitants did not always commit their bodies to the fire for besides this instance a skeleton thus enclosed was found in one of the orknies letter from the rev mr low of birsa  and others in the shire of murray and with one of the last was found an urn with ashes and several pieces of charcoal tour scotl      qarto ed whichshews that each practice was in use in the same age  from llanarmon i continued my journey along the bad roads of that parish the country now grows more contracted by the approximation of the hills on one side are the rocky ledges of limestone in the township of trer yrys rich in leadore and which is supposed to have taken its name from gyrys who made the first collection of welsh proverbs known by the name of madwaith ben gyrys o jal or the good work of old gyrys of yale  on the left are the clwydian hills which divide this country from the vale of clwyd these are cultivated pretty high are free from rocks covered with heath  there is a bwlch or pass through these hills of a most remarkable name lying between the summits called moel eithinen and moel fenlli in this parish this is called bwlch agricla or the pass of agriccla and since there is no other translation to be given of the welsh word we may conjecture this to have been his passage to mona that the romans were in aftertimes resident in these parts is evident from the number of coins found in the neighborhood particularly in the parish of llanverres where abundance of denarii have been met with  moel fenlli or benllis hill is remarkable for having on it a strong british post guarded as usual by dikes and fosses this probably was possessed by a chieftain of that name for nennius c xxx xxxi speaks of such a regulus of the country of yale but as too usual with our ancient historians blends so ridiculous a legend with the mention of him as would destroy belief of his existence did not the hill remain a possible evidence st germanus says the abbot designed to make this benlli a visit but meeting with a most inhospitable reception was kindly entertained by a servant of the king in his humble cottage who killed his only calf dressed and placed it before the saint and his companions this goodness met with its reward for lo the next morning the identical calf was found alive and well with its mother  a little beyond this pass entered the parish of llanverres rich in mineral pass through the village and by the church the last is dedicated to st berres britius disciple of st martin the hungarian and his succesor in the bishopric of tours the latter end of the fourth century the church at this time was rebuilding chiefly by the bounty of mrs catherine jones of clommendy  the east end of the old church was repaired in

long ascent passes bwlch penybarras a spot extremely worthy of the travellers attention on account of the beautiful view over the vale of clwyd  my route this time led me eastward along the great road into the county of flint  this spot being confirmed to it by the event of a most expensive lawsuit by the court of exchequer in      between the grosvenour family and the lords of the manor of mold the first claming it as part of his mineral grant of the hundred of yale the others affirming it to be part of the county of flint and within the parish of mold the decision which was in favor of the lords of mold is recorded on an arch over a noted stone called carreg carn march arthur which was then adjudged to be the boundary of the parish of mold in the county of flint and of llanverres in

name of hopesdale were annexed to the county of denbigh but in the   d year of the same monarch were given to flintsire  almost the whole is seen from this spot a delicious composition of rich land

of a small but rich plain the church is placed on an eminence and is of the time of henry viii adorned with a very handsome steeple built of late years before the reformation it belonged to the abbey of bustlesham or bysham in berkshire the living is a vicarage and has dependent on it the chapelries of nerquys and treuddyn  the architecture of the church is of the gothic of that period the windows large and their arches obtuse within and without is a row of animals carved as usual at that period the same may be observed on the old building over st winifredes well the inside is extremely elegant consists of a nave and two ailes supported by seven arches whose pillars are much to be admired for their lightness they consist of four round pilasters with the intermediate space hollowed and the capitals elegantly carved between the springs of every arch is an angel holding a shield on which are either the arms of benefactors or the instruments of the passion the arms of the stanlies who long possessed this manor are very frequent among the other sculptures is the veronica or face of our savior impressed on a handkerchief given to him by a woman on his way to the place of crucifixion he took it wiped his face and returned it with the miraculous impression this precious relic is preserved in st peters at rome and the woman worshipped as a saint under the name of the handkerchief which at first was called the vera icon or true image but becoming thus personified received the title of st veronica beneath two windows above the chancel are carved in a rude manner the nails pincers and other tokens of the crucifixion  at the eastern ends of the two ailes are three gothic niches elegantly carved they formerly were filled with images now destroyed the two in the south aile are almost hid with monuments among them is a very superb one in memory of robert davies esquire of llanerch with his figure in a standing attitude and dressed in a roman habit  near it is a mural monument of

prevent being flattered himself when dead by causing this small memorial to be set up in his lifetime  god be merciful to me a sinner heb dduw heb ddim  at the northend of the town stands the mount to which it owes the british and latin names yr wyddgrug and mons altus the lofty or conspicuous mount this is partly natural partly artificial our british ancestors and afterward the saxons and normans taking advantage of so defencible an eminence cut it into form and placed on it a castle it is possible that the romans might also have had some concern in it for a beautiful gold coin of vespasian was found here but this being the only proof of its having been possessed by them i shall not insist on it any farther than to urge the probability mold being in the neighborhood of many of their mines and of places where much of their money has been found  the mount is now called the baileyhill from the word ballium or castleyard it appears to have been strongly fortified by great ditches notwithstanding its arduous ascent it is divided into three parts the lower ballium or yard the upper and the keep or donjon the tops of the two first are levelled by art and all are separated by deep fosses the keep was on a part greatly and artificially elevated and around its edges are a few stones the only relics of the fortress on one side of the upper yard are found vast quantities of bones some human others of animals mostly domestic such as of oxen sheep horses and hogs and a few remnants of horns of stags and roebucks  the summit of this hill commands a short but most exquisite view of the circumjacent vale and to the west moel famma rises with aweful preeminence among the clwydian hills  the first certain account i have of this place is in the reign of william rufus when we find it in possession of eustace cruer powel      who then did homage for mold and hopedale he probably having been the person who had ravished them from the ancient owners  in the end of the reign of henry i or the beginning of that of stephen robert called from his residence at this place de montalto high steward of chester and one of the barons of the norman earls became owner of it we are informed that the castle was at this time very strong and that it had been often besieged but never taken till the welsh no longer able to bear the ravages of the garrison attempted in           the reduction of it under the conduct of their gallant prince owen gwynedd the garrison for a considerable time defended the place with great courage but at length it was taken by storm part of the defendants slain the others taken prisoners and the fortress razed to the ground idem       after this it was again restored for we find in the aerae cambrobritannicae at the end of llwyas commentariolum           that it was taken in the winter of      by llewelyn ap jorwerth and about the year      it was a third time besieged taken and demolished by gryffydd ap gwenwynwyn lord of powis  the gentry of ystradalun or molesdale were among the principal complainants of wrongs done to them by roger de clifford justiciary of chester and his deputy roger scrochil a little before our subjection by edward i they alleged that their lands were taken from them that they were grievously and unjustly fined on trivial occasions and that after paying a sum for exemption from english laws they were obliged to submit to a trial by jury or by twelve men contrary to the usage of their country powel       much of the country was in this reign so covered with woods that edward before his conquest of wales was obliged to cut a passage through them in the tract between mold and a place then called swerdewood and to direct that nothing should be required for the damage done to the owners rotuli wallia    anno   edwardi i febr       we find a similar order in rymer  i find he called in a number of cutters for this purpose and in the next year not fewer than two hundred cutters and

gentleman who was knighted by edward i on bringing the news of the birth of his son edward of caernarvon and who after our conquest adhered to the english till he thought their yoke intolerable rose

more of it as a place of defense matthew paris and dugdale m paris     dugdale baron i     confound it with hawarden and assert it to have been attacked or taken by david brother to the last llewelyn mold continued in possession of the posterity of robert   0  who did homage for it in   0  at chester to edward prince of wales      but in      the last baron in default of male issue conveyed it to isabel queen of edward ii for life and afterward to john of eltham younger brother to edward iii who died without issue and his possessions reverted to the crown  i am uncertain how long the crown reserved this lordship i find it was granted to the stanley family perhaps to sir john stanley by henry iv at the same time that he bestowed on him hope and hopedale the earls of derby possessed it till the execution of earl james after which both the manor of hope and mold were purchased by certain persons who enjoyed them till the restoration after that event a reference was made by his majesty in      to the lords respecting the repurchase of those manors by the earl of derby in which it had been agreed by his lordship to pay the parties on the   th of march      the sum of eleven thousand pounds and to be put into full possession of the manors the lords imagined that every thing had been adjusted but the earl of derby refusing to perform his part the referrees laid the affair before the king who on the   th of june      ordered that the former purchasers should remain in quiet possession the derby family by some means regained the lordship of hope but that of mold is at present the property of lady vincent the mineral advantages of the manor which have at times been very considerable are equally divided between her ladyship the trevors and mr lloyd of tyddyn  from mold i took the west side of the vale a tract filled with numbers of gentlemens seats of independent fortunes as yet not caught and absorbed in the gulphy vortex of our leviathans these are the remnants of the custom of gavelkind so prevalent formerly in north wales and which have remained unimproved by those accidents which by time and chance happen to many i digressed a little to the right

true specimen of the borderhouses on the confines of england and scotland a square tower of three stories in the lower still remains a staple in the ceiling a memorial of the rudeness of the times during the wars between the houses of york and lancaster this place was inhabited by reinallt ap gryffydd ap bleddyn one of the six gallant captains who defended harlech castle on the part of henry vi he and his people were in continual feud with the citizens of chester in      a considerable number of the latter came to mold fair a fray ensued between the two parties a dreadful slaughter was made on both sides but reinallt got the victory took prisoner robert bryne linendraper and mayor of chester in      whom he led to his tower and hung on the staple in his great hall an attempt was made afterward to seize reinallt and two hundred tall men sallied from chester for that purpose he retired from his house to a neighboring wood permitted part of his enemies to enter the building then rushing from his cover fastened the door and setting fire to the place burnt them without mercy he then attacked the rest pursued them to the seaside where those who escaped the sword perished in the channel his actions were celebrated at the time in poems still extant particularly by lewis glyn cothi in an awdl a cywydd and an awdl differ in these respects the first consists of couplets generally of seven syllables the last of stanas of different lengths of meter somewhat like a pindaric ode  in praise of reinallt it seems lewis had married a widow of chester against the consent of the inhabitants who spoiled him of all his effects this whetted the poets satyr who summons the ministry of angels and of devils to his assistance and pours a profusion of curses on caer lleon and its

most beautifully seated on a long rising insulated by the vale and finely wooded and cultivated the house stands on the southern extremity and commands a most elegant view of the valley divided by the insulated rock of caergwrle soaring out of the valley and capped with a ruined castle  a little further up the vale stands plasteg plasteg a singular house belonging to the trevors but for numbers of years occupied by farmers the trevors acquired it by the marriage of robert trevor of brynkinalt with katherine daughter of llewelyn ap ithel of the mold and plasteg it is built with great regularity and simple grandeur in the center is a hall fortythree feet long by twentythree a spacious staircase and above is a dining room of the same dimensions with the hall and twelve feet nine inches high at each corner of the house is a square wing or tower consisting as does the center of five floors in each is a room twentytwo feet six by nineteen six and within each of these rooms a closet thirteen feet seven inches square  this house was built in    0 by sir john trevor epitaph in hpe church  a second son of the branch of trevalun the design is attributed to inigo jones but i doubt the tradition it wants both the greciangothic ornaments of his worse days and the pure grecian of his best  from hence i pursued my journey to caergwrle caergwrle a village on the banks of the alun in the parish of hope or estyn whose form speaks it to have been a roman station which appears very evident to the antiquarian eye from the summit of the adjacent rock the site of the castle the precincts show themselves to have been rectangular with one side formed by the sope along the banks of the river here is yet preserved the ancient disposition in three broad streets running parallel and three narrower intersecting them at right angles it had been only a small place an outpost to deva but had the usual concomitants of roman luxury ro in camdens time   0  a hy was discovered near the place five else long four broad and half an ell high cut out of the live rock the soo was of brick set in mortar the roof supported by brick pillars and consisted of polished tiles perforated on these were laid certain brick tubes which conveyed the heat to the room above on some of those tiles were inbscribed legio xx camden ii      which point out the founders i have also been credibly informed that roman bricks were found in the ruins of the old house of hope the seat of the family of the same name i have also heard that large beds of iron cinders have been discovered near caer estyn in this parish the supposed works of the romans  besides these proofs here is the trace of a roman road pointing from the village toward mold and is visible in two or three places especially in the fields on this side of plasteg i think that part of the present road was a portion of the roman an artificial mount stands close on its course roads another road points toward hawarden which increases my suspicion of that having also been a roman outpost as the word street is generally a sign of a roman road there might have been a third on the wrexham side of caergwrle for we find on that road croes y street passing over a place called cesn y bed or the hill of the grave and leading to the castle these roads were one way into some of the mineral parts of wales where roman money had been found  mr edwards makes a happy conjecture respecting the etymology of the name of this place caer gawr lle or the camp of the giant legion lleon gawr for the britons bestowed that title on the twentieth legion to imply its power a turn analogous to victrix giving it the strength of a giant this gave rise to the fable of chester having been built by lleon gawr a mighty giant see p  0  mr camden by mistake calls the legion leon vawr   this place in the division of wales by roderic the great formed part of the cantref y rhiw when the saxons made a conquest of our borders they comprehended it in their hundred called exestan and added it to the county of chester we find in the doomsday book that hope which gives name to the parish was held at that period by one gislebert before by edwevi a freeman in after times this tract was known by the name of hopedale on the division of wales into counties by edward i it was annexed to flintshire was severed from it and added to denbighshire by henry viii and in the same reign restored to the former county it is a common notion in the country that the last was effected by the interest of the earl of derby in order to have his welsh estates in the same county for at that time the family was possessed of hawarden molesdale and this manor which had been granted on january  st   0  by henry iv to sir john stanley the family had at the same time the lordship of maelor saesneg which was a portion of flintshire since its first being formed into a county this manor of hope is the only one possessed at present in wales by the earl of derby  the castle of caergwrle stood on the summit of a great rock castle precipitous on one side and of steep ascent on the others some of the walls and part of a round tower still remain sufficient to show that its size was never great close to it on the accessible parts it was protected by very deep fosses cut through the rock on the northeast side there is a pretty extensive area and round its verge the vestiges of a rampart of earth and stones and a fosse such as usual in the british posts it may be therefore supposed that it had been possessed by the britons in early times and that it served to defend in conjunction with caer estyn caer estyn a british post of one rampart and ditch on the opposite side of the dale above the village the entrance through this pass into wales the vale almost closes in this place leaving only room enough for the alun to flow through its picturesque dingles till it gains the open country near the church of gresford  i cannot trace the founder of this castle founder it probably was one of the few welsh fortresses that we have to boast of its oblong form its comparative deficiency of towers and its general agreement in structure with others whole origin i am acquainted with make me willing to suppose it the work of our countrymen after they had recovered possession of this tract in the reign of owen gwynedd i find it part of the estates of gryffydd maelor powel       david brother to llewelyn last prince of wales held it from edward i david made great complaints of the injurious treatment he met with from roger de clifford the justiciary of chester who cut down his woods about hope and endeavored to dispossess him of his rights the same   0  when david took up arms in defense of his brother he left a garrison in this castle but in june      it surrendered to the english monarch as soon as it came into his possession he bestowed it with all its appertenances on his beloved consort eleonora ayloffs rot walliae     from which it acquired the name of queen hope the queen lodged here in her way to caernarvon where her husband sent her to give the welsh a ruler born among them either at this time or soon after the castle was burnt by a casual fire  in   0  the first of edward ii this castle and manor was granted to john de cromwell john de cromwell on condition that he should repair the castle then in a ruinous state and in      he

for most oconomic uses the sides abound in springs which descend in small rills to the great benefit of the inhabitants of the rich slopes  the church of kilken is remarkable for its carved roof killen church which is said to have been brought from the church at basingwere abbey on the dissolution and thus to have fulfilled a prophecy of our robin ddu who when he saw it put up by the monks observed it would do very well for a church beneath moel famma  in this parish on the side of the turnpike road not far from kilken hall is the noted fsynnon leinw or the flowing well fsynnon leinw a large oblong well with a double wall round it this is taken notice of by camden for its flux and reflux but the singularity has ceased since his time according to the best information i can receive  near this well is kilken hall a seat of a branch of the mastyns now the property of the reverend mr edwards of pentre in montgomeryshire in right of his wife charlotte mostyn heiress of the place  this fountain lies in the vale of nannerch vale of nannercu which extends one way to mold and at the other joins with that of bodvari the inlet into the vale of clwyd the wheeler a pretty stream rises on the east side and after a short course falls into the clwyd the house of penbedw the seat of watkin williams esquire is a great ornament to this little valley penbedw in this gentlemans library are some remains of the collection of sir kenelm digby some curious illuminated books and the superb pedigree mention is made of it in woods athenae oxon ii     and the brit blog iii      by permission of mr williams i caused several of the tombs to be copied and that of lady venetia digby to be engraven in the antiquarys reportery of the digby family and its alliances with all the arms and tombs that were extant painted in the most exquisite manner at the expense of above a thousand pounds a vast sum at the time of the compilation in the year       penbedw is seated in a manor of the same name granted in      by henry viii and witnessed by queen catherine parr to peter pyers ap howel alias peter mostyn of wespre in consideration of the payment of seventythree pounds in hand the grant recites that it had been parcel of the possessions of the earl of kent  in the meadows below the house british posts is part of a druidical circle and a small tumulus on one of the summits of the mountain at a great height above the house is a very strong british post with two ditches of prodigious depth with suitable dikes on the accessible sides and on that which is inaccessible is a smooth terras levelled along the hill probably a place for exercising the possessors this post is called moel arthur probably in honor of our celebrated prince moel arthur this is one of the chain of posts that defended the country of the ordovices and their successors against the inroads of invaders they are far from being peculiar to that nation but were the common mode of defense throughout the whole island i conjecture that their origin was very early but that they were occasionally made use of in after times even as low as that of owen glyndwr almost all are rendered defensible in the same manner by deep ditches and highbanks formed either of earth or of loose stones with one but generally two entrances in the description of that of caractacus by tacitus their formation is exactly shown tunc montibus arduis et si qua clementer accedi poterant in modum valli saxa praestruit taciti annals lib xii c     they are of no certain shape but the precinct conforms to that of the hill their uses they are generally destitute of water which evinces that they were not intended as places of long abode but merely temporary retreats for their families herds and flocks on a sudden invasion the fighting men kept the field while all that was dear or valuable was committed to these asyla under a proper garrison  they are always placed within sight of one another so that by fires or other signals notice might be given of the approach of an enemy firt moel hiraddig the first that forms this chain is moel hiraddig about two or three miles from the sea on a rocky hill in the parish of cwm possibly prior to the castle of diserth another post might have been on that rock and in such case should be esteemed the first post the guard of the shore and the great artificial mount above newmarket called cop yr golei or mount of light which may be seen from most of the others might be the spot from whence the signal might be given of the approach of the enemy by sea whether they were saxons or plundering scoti  the next to moel hiraddig moel y gaer is a moel y gaer in the parish of bodvari above the entrance of the inlet into the vale of clwyd  the third are the vast entrenchments on bryn y cloddiau or the hill of ditches bryn y cloddiau this is the largest we have being a mile and a half in circuit and defended by single double triple and even quadruple ditches according to the exigencies of the sides in the fosse next to the area are numbers of hollows as if designed for lodgments of men or a particular guard  moel arthur is the next almost opposite to it on helkin mountain moel y crio on the highest part is moel y crio a vast artificial mount that seems to be a middle post between this and the moel y gaer in northop parish second moel y gaer but our ignorance in the art military of those days prevents us from pointing out the immediate use  next succeeds meel fenlli moel fenlli and third moel y gaer beneath that is another post on a lesser hill which juts into the vale of clwyd and is called by the common name of moel y gaer these are all that seem destined for the defense of this part of the country  caerestyn caer estyn and the post opposite on caergwrle rock defended that front farther on was hawarden and still farther where the vale of cheshire gains upon our country was that of the rosts in the parish of gresford i could give a long list of these posts perhaps as far as the severn sea in the country of the silures and the transsbrine parts of the cornavii but their suffice for the present purpose i shall endeavor in mr ass map to point out the whole of these fastnesses of our ditant ancestors  soon after passing penbedw naneerch i reached nannerch a hamlet with a small church noted for little but a monument in memory of charlot theophila mostyn wife to richard mostyn esquire former owner of peabedw and daughter and coheiress with her siter magareta maria who married sir john conway of bediruddan to john digby son of the famous sir kenelm by which means several choice morsels of his collection came into our country  gratitude to the worthy rector of this place the reverend mr john lloyd for the many informations i received from him respecting the antiquities of our country urges me here to make my best acknowlegements few possess so large a share of the knowledge of our language and of our history and few have been so liberal in the communication  this valley is a boundary of the mineral tract of our county mineral tract i shall now take a kind of birds eye view of the whole which i surrounded beginning with the northern extremity the highland part may be divided into two first division the first is insulated by valley plain and sea the farther point is dalar goch or the rock of diserth bounded by the rich arable slats of rudland the course is continued southward through the parishes of cwm dimeirchion and caerwys bounded by the vale of clwyd and that of bodvari the parishes of ysgeiviog and nannerch succeed and after them a portion of kilken when this mineral tract takes a turn above the parish of mold at rhos esmor in that of northop and then faces the east in the parishes of halkin and holywell in those of whiteford llanasa gwaenyskar and meliden and makes a point toward the west where it unites with the rock of diserth  the second division is separated from the first by a deep depression of the country between rhos esmor second division and the parish of mold there is even in the lower parts on the west side a chain of mines but the land rises again at mold mountain and the mineral tract is continued through the parishes of llanverres the eastern sides of llanarmon llandegla the glisseg rocks and minera above wrexham  the middle of the first division is entirely limestone as is the western side from dalar goch to rhos esmor from thence or on the eastern side the strata alters limestone toward the skirts of the hills chert it changes to that flinty substance called chert more or less pure shale lower down it degenerates into shale of a black stone soon dissoluble in the air so far leadore is found sy after this strata freestone commences freestone and coals are found which continue to the shore and under the sea till they appear on the opposite side in the peninsula of wiral and again beyond the estuary of the mersey  the same observations might be made on the strata in the second division limestone beds are continued on the western side beyond the gliseg rocks and in their neighborhood on both sides of the dee the veins in minera lie in an impure gritty chert the sudden change of strata is very observable the transition may be immediately seen on each side of the narrow vale of nannerch limestone forming the one and the shattery slaty stone composing the other  was i to continue my aerial speculation i should see a discontinuance of the limestone strata till they rose on the opposite side of the vale of clwyd my eye would catch the most remote part on the northern side of red wharfbay in anglesea insulated far from any other the great promontories of llandudus and rhiwledin or the greater and lesser ormshead the first at times rich in copper would next appear penmaen rhos and the continued precipices along the coast of denbighshire succeed in the nearer view many of them productive of lead ore and finally the detatched rocks of henllan beyond denbigh and coed marchon beyond ruthyn which yield to the industrious farmer by their excellent lime a manure more certainly productive of wealth than the precarious search after the deephid minerals  the limestone and the chert of our mineral tracts are of unknown depth neither their bottom nor that of the fissars or veins which cross them have ever been discovered depth of veins the ore of lead has been followed to the depth of a hundred and thirty or a hundred and forty yards and then has ceased but the unprofitable vein appears below unclosed our mines as i have shown before have been worked from very early times p     but not without long interruptions but as several of our veins have been pursued for a hundred years past the point may be affirmed of the depth to which they bear ore in our country  the veins run either north and south or east and west their course but it is remarkable that the lead ore got in the first scarcely ever produces a quantity of silver worth the refiners labor the ores of mold mountain and minera yield scarcely any silver  the minerals of the tracts in question are ore of lead calamine or lapis calaminaris and a mineral that answers the same purpose called by the miners black jack  our ores of lead differ in quality the lamellated ores of lead their produce of lead or common kind usually named potters ore yields from fourteen to sixteen hundred and a quarter of lead from twenty hundred of the ore but the last produce is rare  the quantity of silver produced from our lead is also variable of silver the upper part of a vein of lead ore is always richest in silver the bottom in lead our refiners will assay any lead that will yield ten ounces in the ton of lead and upwards the usual produce is fourteen ounces sixteen have been gotten but acquisitions of that kind within this circuit are extremely uncommon  some years ago a green lead ore was discovered in the silver rake on halkin mountain green leadore only a small quantity was found which yielded about thirteen hundred and a quarter from a tun of the ore it was of a very stubborn quality and resisted the greatest powers of the blast furnace before it would yield any metal  the brown or whitish stoney species of ore called caulk brown or caulk produce from five hundred and a quarter to eleven hundred of lead from the ton the smelters likewise get from what is called waste or the hillocks which are the refuse of good ores so mixed with clay gravel stone or calamine as not to be separated but by fire from ten to thirteen hundred of lead per ton  we have had at different periods mines productive of vast wealth in several parts of this tract rich mines the richest vein was discovered about fifty years ago at rowleys rake or pant y pwll dwr on halkin mountain continued with some interruption into a small enclosure the property of sir george win of leeswood and the freehold of mr david hughes which in less than thirty years yielded to different proprietors adventurers and smelters above a million of money the reader will naturally expect to find in these parts a nation of craesuss but cito parta cito dilabuntur it is at this time an undetermined question whether more wealth has been gotten out of the earth or more lost in the search after the prizes in this subterraneous lottery  much of the ore obtained in our country is smelted in the several furnaces belonging to different companies much also is exported in the form of ore i wished to be acquainted with the annual quantity smelted from those of the country but found by reason of the ores imported from scotland and other parts that the computation would be of insuperable difficulty all the lead and ore is exported from the port of chester a small quantity excepted consumed by the plumbers and other trades in the adjacent parts i therefore refer the reader to pages         for the number of tuns sent from that port in the years           by the favor of mr jken collector i am permitted to say that from the year      to christmas      the following quantities have been entered in the customhouse foreign and coastways  lead       tons    c   qrs    lb   lead ore     0 t   c   litharge      t   c  i cannot ascertain the quantity of ounces of silver produced from our ores for the reasons just assigned i can only say that the company of a single smeltinghouse did obtain in the year           0 oz            oz            oz in            oz         0  oz            oz   the reader need not be told that the former were the years of mineral plenty and such which i must say are seldom known there are five other smelting houses but i believe none equalled this in the quality of silver this precious metal is chiefly bought by the artificers at sheffield and birmingham  calamine is found in great abundance in the veins of limestone and chert in the same manner as the ores of lead where there is plenty of the former there is little or none of the latter the calamine is also entirely confined to the eastern side of the country about a thousand tons of this mineral is annually exported i have mentioned in p    how little it was known in flintshire till within these sixty years and may here add that we were indebted to john barrow a native of somersetshire who being well acquainted with that mineral in his own country pointed out to us its uses  calamine assumes various shapes and colors green yellow red and black often has a stony appearance and often like the lattice work of bones the richest looks like beeswax but that species is not common any more than the curious crystallized specimens  the ores of zink called here black jack are met with in our mines we have it in a metallic form of a bluish gray color and again in form of the dark semipellucid ambers cromsted calls the first zincum ferro sulphurato mineralisatum the other zincum calciforme cum ferro sulphuratum no   a  these were engrossed by

cases if rubbed on the parts affected the miners call it ymenyn tylwyth teg or the fairies butter belonging to the benign species perhaps the same with those in superstitious days called knockers which by repeated strokes knockers were believed to direct the miners to a rich vein but in fact the noises often heard in mines are always discovered to proceed from the dropping of water these

calls them never infest our mines except in form of damps of both species the suffocating and the fire the last is very frequent in the coalpits but rare in the mines of lead unless in those parts where the shale begins or stone attendant on coal the first kills instantaneously by its mephitic vapor and is a disaster common to neglected vaults and drawwells the other is inflammable and burns and destroys in a dreadful manner firedamp as the colliers through negligence in not setting fire to the vapor before it gets to a head do often experience the most tremendous instance was on february  d      in a coalwork at mostyn which i shall relate from the philosophical transactions no     or vol ii     lowthorbs abridgement the account was drawn up by mr roger mostyn  and so conclude the account of our mineral concerns  the damp had been perceived for some time before in mostyn colliery resembling fiery blades darting and crossing each other from both sides of the pit the usual methods were taken to free the pit from this evil after a cessation of work for three days the steward thinking to fetch a compass about from the eye of the pit that came from the day and to bring wind by a secure way along with him that if it burst again it might be done without danger of mens lives went down and took two men along with him which served his turn for this purpose he was no sooner down but the rest of the workmen that had wrought there disdaining to be left behind in such a time of danger hasted down after them and one of them more indiscreet than the rest went headlong with his candle over the eye of the damppit at which the damp immediately catched and flew to and fro over all the hollows of the work with a great wind and a continual fire and as it went keeping a mighty great roaring noise on all sides  the men at first appearance of it had most of them fallen upon their faces and hid themselves as well as they could in the loose slack or smallcoal and under the shelter of posts yet nevertheless the damp returning out of the hollows and drawing toward the eye of the pit it came up with incredible force the wind and fire tore most of their clothes off their backs and singed what was left burning their hair faces and hands the blasts falling so sharp on their skin as if they had been whipped with cords some that had lest shelter were carried fifteen or sixteen yards from their first station and beaten against the roof of the coal and sides of the post and lay afterward a good while senseless so that it was long before they could hear or find one another as it drew up to the daypit it caught one of the men along with it that was next to the eye and up it comes with such a terrible crack not unlike but more shrill than a cannon that was heard fifteen miles off with the wind and such a pillar of smoke as darkened all the sky overhead for a good while the brow of the hill above the pit was eighteen yards high and on it grew trees of fourteen or fifteen yards long yet the mans body and other things from the pit were seen above the tops of the highest trees at least  00 yards on this pit stood a horseengine of substantial timber and strong iron work on which lay a trunk or barrel for winding the rope up and down of above  000 pounds weight it was then in motion one bucket going down and the other coming up full of water this trunk was fastened to that frame with locks and bolts of iron yet it was thrown up and carried a good way from the pit and pieces of it though bound with ironhoops and strong nails blown into the woods about so likewise were the two buckets and the ends of the rope after the buckets were blown from them stood a while upright in the air like pikes and then came leisurely drilling down the whole frame of the engine was stirred and moved out of its place and those mens clothes caps and hats that escaped were afterward found shattered to pieces and thrown amongst the woods a great way from the pit  from nannerch i continued my journey along the narrow vale picturesquely ornamented with hanging woods leave the church of skeiviog on the right in this parish was shot a few years ago hoopoe that singular bird the hoopoe vol i no  0 of british zoology this species is of the size of a stare easily distinguishable by its large crest long slender incurvated bill and by having only ten feathers in the tail i can add to my former account that the arabs call it the messenger bird not only from the resemblance which the crest bears to the plumes that decorate the caps of chaous or turkish messengers but also because the mahometans believe it to have been the bird which when birds could speak held a conversation with solomon and to have been the courier which carried on the epistolary correspondence between that wise monarch and the sabaean queen bochart hitroz pars ii p     also universal ancient hist iv  0  notes   at the junction of the vales of nannerch and bodvari i ascended to caerwys caerwys a town mouldering away with age it consists of four streets crossing each other at right angles answering to the four points of the compass the name as camden has long since observed savors of great antiquity caer the fortress and gws a summon which shows it had been in early times the place of judicature and it certainly had that honor long before it was removed to the countytown of flint i will not assert that it had been a roman station notwithstanding i am credibly informed that in the present century a number of copper coins were found in a bottom below the town and there still remains in the parish a latin inscription cut in rude letters on an unhewn upright stone to this effect hic jacit muli erbo obiit multitudes of tumuli are scattered over the neighborhood and one very near to it this plain probably had been a field of battle whether this inscription referred to any heroine that fell on this place i will not dare to affirm it is an unfinished piece hic jacit mulier bo  and at a distance the word obiit  caerwys powel   0  with a neighboring town now lost called tref edwyn and rhuddlan had been from very early time the seats of the judicature for these parts of wales in      the noblemen of tegengl laid before the archbishop of canterbury who came down on the christian design of reconciling the differences between edward i and llewelyn the infringement of their liberties in this particular asserting that it was the tenor of their privilege to be judged according to the laws of wales at those three places and that the best men of the country were taken because they desired to be judged at tref edwyn by the laws of wales ibid  how far their complaints were remedied does not appear but when justiciary courts were in after times appointed caerwys recovered its ancient honors in this town were held the great sessions it had its town hall and its jail and was the place of execution it remained the place of judicature till sometime past the middle of the last century when the courts were removed to flint  in the year      or the   th of henry iii that prince granted to the inhabitants of tegengl a charter mostyn mss  exempting them from the amobr but at the same time imposes on them an obligation to find twentyfour people who were to keep the peace of the country and obliges this town picton axton and other hamlets to find three men each to work three days in the harvest as they were wont in the days of the two preceding welsh princes this seems during some temporary advantage which henry had over the welsh  caerwys has the most considerable fairs for cattle sheep and horses in all the county they are of great antiquity the first john trevor bishop of st asaph appears among the subscribers to a charter for a market in      but the markets have now failed entirely since the increase of holywell  the earl of plymouth is lord of this manor and possesses by purchase of an ancestor the estate of the griffiths descended from ednowenbendew one of the fifteen tribes whose seat is still standing inhabited by tenants  but what gave a particular glory to the town of caerwys was the honor it had of being the place of the eisteddfod or the sessions of the bards and minstrels for many centuries it was the resort of those of a certain district as aberfraw in anglesea was of those of that island and the neighboring county and mathraval of those of the land of powys the reason that these places were thus distinguished was because the two last were the residence of princes and caerwys on account of the royal palace that stood below the town the residence of llewelyn ap gryffydd  these eisteddfods were the british olympics fired at first with generous emulation our poets crowded into the list and carried off the prize contented with the mere honor of victory at length when the competitors became numerous and the country became oppressed with the multitude new regulations of course took place the disappointed candidates were no longer suffered to torture the ears of the principality with their wretched compositions none but bards of merit were suffered to rehearse their pieces and minstrels of skill to perform these went through a long probation judges were appointed to decide on their respective abilities and degrees suitable were conferred and permissions granted for exercising their talents in the manner that will be related in the following pages the judges were appointed by commission from our princes and after the conquest of wales by the kings of england notwithstanding edward i exercised a political cruelty over the generation of bards of his time yet future princes thought fit to revive an institution so likely to soften the manners of a fierce people the crown had the power of nominating the judges who decided not only on the merit but the subject of the poems and like our modern lord chamberlains were certain of licensing only those which were agreeable to the english court  before i enter on the account of the succession of british eisteddsfods i shall just mention the high antiquity of the character that made ancient bards in after times the principal figure in these meetings the bardi the beirdds of the britons were of great authority among the celtic nations the germans were animated in battle by verses delivered in a deep and solemn tone tacitus de mor german lib vi      among the gauls strabo lib iv  0  athenaeus  they sung the actions of great men and particularly celebrated in their hymns the heroes who fell in fight  vos quoque qui fortes animas belloque peremtas laudibus in longum vates dimittis in aevum plurima fecuri fudistis carmina bardi lucan i you too ye bards whom sacred rapture fire to chaunt your heroes to your countrys lyre who consecrate in your immortal strain brave patriot souls in righteous battle slain securely now the tuneful task renew and noblest themes in deathless songs pursue row it is highly probable that the bards and minstrels were under certain regulations during the time of druidism but we find no proofs of them till long after in time of capwaladr till the days of cadwaladr last king of britain who died at rome about the year     of him it is said that being at an assembly of this nature with his nobles there came a minstrel and played in a key so displeasing that he and all his brethren were prohibited under a severe penalty from ever playing on it any more but were ordered to adopt that of mwynen gwynedd or the sweet key of gwynedd north wales   i imagine of arthur that previous to this there had been musical regulations in britain for i find that a tune called gosteg yr halen or the prelude of the salt was always played whenever the saltseller was placed before king arthurs knights at his round table mr morriss mss of british music   after cadwaladr the next princes who undertook the reform of our minstrelsie were bleddyn ap cynfyn and gryssydd ap cynan of gryffydd ap cynan the first was cotemporary with the conqueror the last with king stephen these enacted that no person should follow the profession of bard or minstrel but such only who were admitted by the eisteddfod which was held once in three years they were prohibited from invading one anothers province nor were they permitted to degrade themselves by following any other occupation neither of these were to demand above ten shillings in any article under pain of losing the whole besides being suspended from their profession for three years leges wallieae      after the times of the princes the great men their descendants took these people under their care and protection allowing them the liberty of circuiting their respective territories thrice a year viz at christmas easter and whitsuntide and the whole principality once in three years  the bards were in the highest repute i cannot give a stronger idea of the esteem they were in than by citing from the welsh laws the account of their rank in the princes court and the various rewards and fees they were entitled to and the severe penalties that were enacted to preserve their persons from insult they were supposed to be endowed with powers equal to inspiration they were the oral historians of all past transactions public and private they related the great events of the state and like the scalds of the northern nations retained the memory of numberless transactions which otherwise would have perished in oblivion they were likewise thoroughly acquainted with the works of the three primary bards viz myrddyn ap morfryn myrddyn emrys and taliesin ben beirdd but they had another talent which probably endeared them more than all the rest to the welsh nobility that of being most accomplished genealogists and flattering their vanity in singing the deeds of an ancestry derived from the most distant period  the bardd teulu or court bard held the eighth place in the princes court he possessed his land free the prince supplied him with a horse and woollen robe and the princess with linen leges wallicae     he sat next to the governor of the palace at the three great festivals for at those seasons the governor was to deliver him his harp the same    and    on the same festivals he was also to have the disdains or steward of the housholds garment for his fe  when a song is called for the cadeirfardd or the bard who has got the badge of the chair is first to sing a hymn in glory of god after that another in honor of the prince when those are over the teuluwr or bard of the hall is to sing some other subject  if the princess calls for a song after she has retired from table to her apartment the teuluwr must sing to her highness in a low voice least he should disturb the performers in the hall john dafydd rhys says that the subject was to be on death but i rather follow wotton who instead of angau which signifies death prefers the word amgen or a separate subject from what was sung in the hall  when the bard goes with the princes servants on a plundering expedition and performs before them his animating compositions he is to have the finest heifer of the booty and in case the detachment was drawn up in order of battle he was to sing at their head the praises of the british monarchy this was to remind them of their ancient right to the whole kingdom for their inroads being almost always on the english territories they thought they did no more than seize on their own  the prince bestowed on him an ivory chessboard others say a harp and the princess a golden ring his lodging was to be with the governor of the palace  when he is required to sing with other bards by way of distinction he is to have a double portion  if the bard asks any favor of the prince he must sing one of his compositions if of a nobleman three if of a common person he must sing till he is so weary as to rest on his elbow or to fall asleep this i fear shows our bards were a very importuning race and required a check yet still they were in high estimation their gwerth or compensation for their life was rated at cxxvi cows leges wallicae     and any injury done them at vi cows and cxx pence  the merchgobr of his daughter merchgobr or marriage fine of his daughter was cxx pence her cowyll argyffreu or nuptial presents was thirty shillings and her portion three pounds ibid     it is remarkable that the pencerdd gwlad or chief of the faculty was entitled to the merchgobr or amobr for the daughters of all the inferiors of the faculty within the district who paid xxiv pence on their marriage which not only shows the antiquity but the great authority of these people  the pencerdd was not among the ibid    officers of the court but occasionally sat in the tenth place he also had his land free was to perform much in the same manner as the court bard whom he seems to have taken place of whenever he attended for when the pencerdd was present the former sat only in the twelfth seat no other was to play without license from him his death was valued at cxxvi cows and any injury done him at vi cows and cxx pence each of the chief musicians was to receive from their lord the first a harp the second a crwth the third a pipe which on their deaths were to revert to the lord leges wallicae      the princes harp was valued at cxx pence and that of pencerdd at the same the key at xxiv pence a gentlemans harp was estimated at lx pence  powel     says that gryffydd ap cynan brought over with him out of ireland diverse cunning musicians who devised in a manner all the instrumental music now used with all respect to our sister kingdom i must imagine that if our instruments were not originally british we were copyists from the romans who again took their instruments from the greeks methinks i see the model of a harp in fig   tab lxxvi of the supplement of montfaucon volume iii of the crwth in doctor burnys psalter tab v fig   or his etruscan lyre fig  0 and of the pipe in several simple pipes before it received from us the addition of the horns from whence it got the title of pibgorn and the english name of cornet see figures of the crwt and pibgorn in archaeologia iii

were reckoned among the ignoble performers they were not allowed to sit down and had only a penny for their pains  the different degrees were comprehended in this list there were four in the poetical and five in the musical faculty the lowest or more properly what should be called a candidate or probationer was y dyscybl yspas or the lowest disciple who was obliged if a candidate for poetry to understand the contraction or five species of englyns and to compose them before a pencerdd who was to declare upon his conscience that he was endowed with a true poetical genius after this he commenced  dyscybl dyscyblaidd discipulus disciplinabilis here he becomes a graduate but must understand twelve of our different metres and produce specimens of each of his own composition and if in three years time he does not by his merit acquire the next degree he is degraded from this if he succeeds he then proceeds to the degree of  dyscybl penceirddiaidd or candidate for degree of pencerdd when he must understand the propriety of expressions and the different metres and compose in twentyone species and if in three years he does not attain by his own merit to the next degree he falls back into that of dyscybl dyscyblaidd otherwise he becomes a  penbardd or pencerdd chief of the faculty he was candidate in when it is necessary he should be accomplished in every branch of his art he then received the badge of the silverharp or that of a golden or silver chain which he wore upon his shoulder he also was placed with much ceremony on a magnificent chair part of the furnyture mentioned in the patent was there invested with his degree and then acquired the honorable name of cadeirfardd or bardd cadeiriawg  in instrumental music there were five degrees which differ nothing from those in the other faculty except in the two lowest i the dyscybl yspas heb radd or without a degree   dyscybl yspas graddawl or graduated   dyscybl dyscyblaidd   dyscybl penceirddiaidd   pencerdd these like the others were to be attained by their respective merits in the science but as then qualifications are expressed in technical terms of british music it is past my skill to give an explanation none but a pencerdd should presume to become an instructor the chief of our days is that uncommon genius the blind mr john parry of rhiwabon who has had the kingdom for his cylch clera or musical circuit and remains unrivalled  our pencerdds thus qualified were licensed to sing or to perform under certain restrictions by the law of our princes particular regard was paid to their morals they were to be no makebates no vagabonds no alehouse haunters no drunkards no brawllers no whorehunters no thieves nor companions of such in which things if they offend every man by the statute is made an officer and authorized to arrest and punish them yea and to take from them all that they have about them powel       they were prohibited from uttering any scandalous words in speech or whispers detraction mocking scoffing inventing lies or repeating them after others under pain of fine and imprisonment nor were they to make a song of any person without his consent nor to enter any mans house without formal leave first obtained  every penbardd and pencerdd was allowed to take in disciples for a certain space of time but not above one at a time a disciple was not qualified to make another each was to be with his teacher during lent unless prevented by sickness or imprisonment under pain of losing his degree he was obliged to show every composition to his teacher before it was publicly sung they were not to follow the practice of cler y dom i e dunghill bards and musicians or any other species of vagabond minstrels they were enjoined a month before each festival to settle their routs with their respective teachers least too many of them should crowd to the same places only one being allowed to go to a person who paid ten pounds a year rent and two to such who paid twenty pounds and so on in proportion to those of higher rank and every teacher was obliged to keep a copy of these rules to show and inculcate to his pupils in time of lent when they came for their instructions  no person was to mimic mock or scoff at the awenyddion on account of their mental absence or when they had on them the awen or poeticus furor from an opinion that no bard duly authorized could ever meditate on improper subjects  to whatsoever house they came in the time of wakes they must remain there while the feasting lasted unless they had leave from the master of the house or were invited by another if they wandered from house to house they were to be apprehended as strollers and vagabonds and to be deprived of their clera or their pay sometimes it signifies the act of their perambulation  which was forfeited to the use of the church if they got intoxicated they forfeited their reward but if they violated the chastity of wife or maid they were fined and imprisoned and lost their clera for seven years  their fees or rewards were regulated a dyscybl dyscyblaidd was entitled to   s   d for his cowydd  a dyscybl penceirddiaidd received for the same species of composition   s   d  his teacher or the pencerdd had no more only the master of the house usually presented him with a garment or some other mark of favor  the minstrels received these rewards a dyscybl yspas graddawl had only   s upon each of the great festivals  a dyscybl dyscyblaidd at the same seasons   s and a dyscybl penceirddiaidd   s   d  a pencerdd the same besides a voluntary gratuity he was also entitled to fees at royal and other weddings and upon their cylch clera which was permitted only once in three years but besides these fees in order to encourage the clerwyr to keep up the language and the memory of the exploits and pedigrees of the britons they were allowed a penny out of every ploughland and a halfpenny out of every half ploughland of their district  the penbardd and pencerdd in their circuits frequented only the houses of the gentry but if he degraded himself by visiting the commonalty he was only to expect the fee of a common clerwr whose province it was to visit the plebeian houses the following were the persons who were allotted to entertain the vulgar ears  a person laboring under any infirmity such as blindness lameness etc a dyscybl yspas a dyscybl dyscyblaidd and dyscybl penceirddiaidd the first regulation was founded on humanity  no public festivity great feast or wedding could be duly solemnized without the presence of the bards and minstrels a glorious emulation arose among them and prizes were bestowed on the most worthy in      the lord rhys prince of south wales made a great feast powel     at christmas on account of the finishing his new castle at aberteifi of which he proclaimed notice through all britain a year and a day before great was the resort of strangers who were nobly entertained so that none departed unsatisfied among deeds of arms and variety of spectacles rhys invited all the bards of wales and provided chairs for them which were placed in his hall where they fat and disputed and sang to show their skill in their respective faculties and bestowed great rewards and rich gifts on the victors the bards of north wales won the prizes but the minstrels of rhyss household excelled in their faculty on this occasion the brawdwr llys or judge of the court an officer fifth in rank declared aloud the victor and received from the bard for his fee a mighty drinkinghorn made of the horn of an ox a golden ring and the cushion on which he sat in his chair of dignity leges wellicae      the bards of those times often accompanied their voices with the harp as they were wont of old in the manner described by ammianus marcellinus lib xv    there was also another species of musician of an inferior kind called datceiniad who accompanied the musical instruments of others with his song he was inferior to both bard and minstrel yet it was requisite he should be possessed of a considerable degree of knowledge in both sciences he ought to be able to tune the harp and crwth to show his skill in playing several notes and keys and to be perfectly conversant in what are called the twentyfour measures of instrumental song and to be able to sing with judgment and melody he was likewise to be master of reading justly and writing correctly he was not only to understand the twentyfour modes of metrical compositions but to exhibit specimens of his own at left in three of them and if he met with any old song faultily transcribed he was to rectify it he was also to carry with him a harp or a crwth in a white case he was further required not only to be a ready waiter at table but to be an expert carver of every species of fowl at the weddings of any of the royal family his office was to wait on the bride  on those occasions i am reminded of another custom in which the bards were concerned after their nuptial feast a pencerdd was constituted cyff cler or pillar of the cler and seated in a chair surrounded by the other bards standing who made him the subject of their merry and ludicrous compositions to raise mirth in the company he was that day to make no reply but on the next he was to divert the hall at the expense of the inferior bards and was also to compose a poem upon a subject given him suitable to his dignity  the most inferior of the musical tribe was sometimes admitted datceiniad this was the datceiniad pen pastwn or he that sung to the sound of his club being ignorant of every other kind of instrument when he was permitted to be introduced he was obliged to stand in the middle of the hall and sing his cowydd or awdl beating time and playing the symphony with his pastwn or club but if there was a professor of music present his leave must be first obtained before he presumed to entertain the company with this species of melody wherever he came he must act as a menial servant to the bard or musician several parts of this account are translated from cambrobrytannicae cymraecaeve linguae institutiones a very rare book written by doctor john davydd rhys of llanfaethlu in anglesey printed in      he took his doctors degree at sienna but was educated at oxford he returned to his own country where he practiced with great success at the request of sir edward stradling of st donats he composed this book he tells us he wrote the first part at mr morgan meredydds in radnorshire the rest at a place of his own in brecknockshire as he says at the age

drayton poly olbion song iv  who elegantly and faithfully records the various personages concerned in the entertainments  mongst whom some there were bards that in their sacred rage recorded the descents and acts of every age some with their nimble joints that struck the warbling string in fingering some unskilled but used to sing to others harp of which you both might find great plenty and of both excelling in their kind that as the stethon ost obtained a victors praise had won the silver harp and worn apollos bays whose verses they deduced from those first golden times of sundry sorts of feet and sundry suits of rhimes in englins some there were that in their subject strain some makers that again affect a lostier vein rehearse their high conceits in cowyths other some in owdells theirs express as matter haps to come so varying still their moods observing yet in all their quantities their rests their ceasutes metrical for to that sacred art they most themselves apply addicted from their birth to so much poesy that in the mountains those who scarce have seen a book most skilfully will make as though from art they took finis additions page   basingwerk abey in an outhouse is

the welsh in      that the noble and best of the country be injured for that the king builded the castle of flynt upon their ground and the king commanded the justices to give the men as much and as
