0 on which day a sermon in defense of the athanasian creed was preached by mr hughes of jesus  college at st marys i was summoned by mr atwood of pembroke deputybeadle to appear before the vice chancellor the next day at three a clock in the afternoon accordingly i was that day about four a clock conducted into an upperroom of the vicechancellors lodge and appeared before dr roderick provost of kingscollege the vice chancellor sir john ellis knight master of caiuscollege dr james master of queens regius professor of divinity dr blithe master of clarehall dr balderston master of emanuel dr covel master of christs dr richardson master of peterhouse dr ashton master of jesus dr fisher master of sidney and dr lany master of pembroke the universityregister mr grove of st johns being there also where note that the lord bishop of chester master of catherinehall though newly come to town never appeared with the heads at any of their meetings about me but publicly at least kept himself wholly unconcerned in the matter  i came to the vicechancellors lodge with a friend whose presence and assistance i desired but he was not permitted to go up stairs so i was all alone before my judges i was then immediately showed a book by mr vice chancellor and asked whether i would look upon it and own it to be mine perceiving that it was the sermons and essays upon several subjects i replied that i would not answer any such questions nor would i so much as look upon the book affirming that all which i had to say was in a written paper in my hands neither would i make any other answer though then and all along many ensnaring questions were put to me but when i still persisted in the same answers the vice chancellor who with the rest seemed much surpised at this cautious conduct of mine was obliged to call for other evidence accordingly mr crownfield our printer who had been terrified and threatened with being turned out of his place by some of the heads for barely permitting his boy to carry the proposals for printing my primitive christianity revived to them was sent for and deposed so much as amounted to probable evidence that i had sent the small essay upon the epistles of ignatius to be dispersed in cambridge and that i had sent a letter to the vice chancellor which is set down p    etc of my historical preface and to plain proof that i desired his boy might carry the forementioned proposals to the several heads of colleges the tuesday before but could say nothing to the sermons and essays on several subjects the regius professor particularly wondered that i would not clear mr crownfield by owning the sending the proposals and intimated that he supposed the vice chancellor would also have an order from the chancery to oblige mr benjamin took the bookseller to come from london to prove the sermons and essays upon me and to inform them how they came to cambridge i said that it was not yet time to say all i intended but that when i made my proper answer it would be time enough to think of such things that i had been accustomed to reason arguments and testimonies but not to law so i had taken advice as to my answers and observed the same advice all along which he owned it was reasonable for me to do as one that he believed had never before been used to such legal proceedings he also took notice of an expression of mine in my letter to the vice chancellor beforementioned as if i were apprehensive of somewhat like persecution that might befall me and he added that he durst say no body there had any intention to persecute me about this time it was that the depositions of mr hughes and mr townsend of jesus of mr amyas and mr macro of caius and of mr thackham of kings which were in part if not wholly obtained by the vicechancellors procurement not by the voluntary appearance of the parties themselves were openly read to me as they here follow verbatim  certificates afterward deposed upon oath i well remember that hearing mr whiston one sunday in the afternoon at the parish church of st clements in the town of cambridge explaining the first article of the apostles creed having established the unity of the godhead by several proper arguments he asserted there was but one god and that god the father only was that one god that the father was in all the ancient and primitive creeds mentioned to be the only god that the son was indeed exalted above all creatures and made a partaker of many divine excellencies and perfections and as such he was to be worshipped with a sort or degree of divine worship this is the substance of what i heard the said mr whiston deliver in that lecture there were several other very black and aggravating expressions which in so long a space of time have slipped my memory but as to the truth of this i am ready and willing to give my oath  john hughes  in the year   0  in the parish church of st clements in cambridge i heard mr whiston in one of his carechetical lectures upon the apostles creed deliver these words or words to this effect viz as to the dignity of our saviors persons though he be a being of vastly great and immense perfections yet i cannot say as some do that he is equal to god the father because i should contradict my blessed savior himself who says expressly my father is greater than i neither can i assert that he is omniscient for if i should i should contradict my blessed savior himself who says he knew not of the day of judgment of that day and hour knows no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father neither can i assert that he is essentially good for then also i should contradict my blessed lord and savior himself who to a certain ruler that called him good master said why call thou me good none is good save one that is god  witness my hand sa townsend october       0 the two first articles mentioned by mr townsend i do likewise attest to which mr whiston at the same time added that all the old books of our religion witnessed the same or words to that effect  j amyas  i do declare that at the same place and time i heard mr whiston speak those words all abovementioned by mr townsend or words to that effect  witness my hand tho macro  october  0    0 memorand that at a meeting of the ministers concerning the charityschools at the old coffeehouse in cambridge about michaelmas last was twelvemonth mr townsend making a motion for the removal of mr whiston from the stewardship by reason of heretical tenets interspersed in his catechetical lectures mr whiston inquired what tenets they might be i replied the denial of the divinity of the son he said he owned him as god i asked whether as god ab aeterno he answered no nor had any of the fathers for the first three centuries  at another meeting about a quarter of a year since on the occasion and at the place abovementioned mr whiston offered a paper hereunto annexed in vindication of his alteration of the doxologies subjoined to dr bradys translation of the psalms a part whereof he was authorized to print for the use of the charityschools he having asserted his alteration to be such as we might all join in as in the paper is specified i asked him whether he could not join with us in this to father son and holy ghost one god whom we adorehe replied he would be a turk as soon  these several depositions i am ready to confirm by oath w thackham  nb the paper referred to in this last deposition is that inserted toward the end of my historical preface and observe that the last vehement expression of mine that i would be a turk as soon was to the best of my remembrance followed by these words or others to the same effect which are omitted by mr thackham viz that is a rash expression but i mean that this language is so entirely contrary to the nature of the christian religion that i cannot go into it for any consideration whatsoever  some time after these depositions were read i desired to know when it was a proper time to give in my answer which when it was intimated i publicly read this paper and delivered it in as follows verbatim  mr vice chancellor saving to my self all future legal advantages either as to the jurisdiction of this consistory to the form of proceedings therein or to any other matters whatsoever i do now desire that i may have a true copy of the statute upon which i am charged and of the articles and depositions given me i do also desire a competent time may be allowed me for making my defense which is never denied in cases of this nature and that i may have leave though it be termtime to go to london for some weeks where those my papers are out of which my defense is in good part to be made especially since i intend that that defense shall be very full and particular and drawn up by the best advice and i cannot but beg and hope that you will all hear and consider what i shall have hereafter to offer in my answer with that justice equity and candor which the laws of nature of the gospel and of the land require and particularly in so important a cause concerning the true christian faith and practice which your selves would expect to be heard with in the like case and which the certainty of all our appearing before christs own tribunal at the great day does demand from you  will whiston camb october       0 here follows also a true copy of the   th statute of the university upon which all these proceedings were grounded cap xlv de concionibus nullus concionator sit vel aliquam concionem pro gradu suo habeat nisi ad minimum diaconus sit octavo maij ad

exulabit    but to go on with my narrative  after i had delivered my paper desiring copies of the statute and of the depositions and competent time for my answer the former parts were readily granted me but the third much debated i desired six weeks time as not too long in a matter of such great importance and gave particular reasons for it i also assured them that the main of that answer would not be what they so much and often and earnestly feared and cautioned against the producing my original testimonies in way of justification of my opinions but would principally turn on those very two heads mr vice chancellor proposed as proper for it viz the showing that my doctrines were either not truly and completely represented or were not so contrary to the doctrine of the church of england as the vice chancellor and some others imagined i was answered that this consistorycourt used not to allow so long time as those at westminster and thev were by no means willing to allow any considerable time however the master of jesus was for a competent time that i might send for my papers from london and somebody hinted as if a week was more usually the time afforded in this consistory the master of peterhouse though he did not own the necessity of a very long time yet confessed that i must have time allowed me for my answer accordingly i fully expected such allowance and when the master of peterhouse left them it seems a weeks time was intended for that answer but all this notwithstanding when i was finally called in that master being gone i heard not a syllable more about it but was immediately ordered to appear again on wednesday to receive the main charge of which presently and for other farther proceedings and when i once spoke of going to london for advice or assistance the master of emanuel said it was fit i should go live elsewhere and remove from cambridge since i had there perverted some already the masters of sidney and pembroke not only seemed to grudge the least delay for my answer but would needs tell me what an answer i was to make i replied that i should not ask their advice for the making that answer but use my own judgment nay when the master of jesus plainly owned the reasonableness of some considerable time for my answer the master of pembroke seemed very angry at him for it yet when i once with some vehemence said there has somewhat been alleged here which i am surpised to find so many clergymen to say maning their assertion that the three persons collectively taken were the one god of the christian religion and not god the father contrary to all manner of sacred and primitive doctrine and language no notice was taken of it at all but to go on with the main narrative upon a second summons i appeared again on wednesday october   th but now in a lower parlour of the same lodge none being present but my judges as before dr covel and dr richardson being now absent and dr gower master of st johns the lady margaretss professor present in their room when i appear d expecting the allowance of time not only for my main answer but for the clearing the exceptions i had to make to their evidence and proceedings instead thereof i had only the sorementioned paper of the main charge given me and a solemn admonition therewith to leave my errors and return to the doctrine of the church of england or else on monday they would proceed to execute the statute upon me only i was allowed to read and deliver in what i had prepared as an answer so far or as my complaints of and exceptions against their proceedings these two papers the first delivered to me and the second by me here follow verbatim  positions published and spread about in the university of cambridge by mr will whiston contra religionem etc stat acad    vid postscript through out vid sermons and essays etc p     l    to    p     l           l    0       to    mr thackhams depos mr hughes depos mr townsend mr macro and mr amyass depositions vid sermon and essays p     l    to p     l      that the father alone is the one god of the christian religion in opposition to the three divine persons father son and holy ghost being the one god of the christian religion  this position is contrary to the     and  th of the    articles and to the nicene and athanasian creeds     that the creed commonly called the creed of st athanasius is a gross and antichristian innovation and corruption of the primitive purity and simplicity of the christian faith among us  this position is contrary to the rubric before the said creed and the  th article  vid sermon and essays etc note   p        that the canon of the scripture the rule and guide of a christians faith and practice is that contained in the last of the ecclesiastical canons ordinarily styled apostolical which all along appears to have been the standard of the primitive church in this matter i mean as including all the books we now own for canonical and also the two epistles of st clement and the constitutions of the apostles by st clement to which the pastor of hermas is to be added as well as we have already added the apocalypse of st john  proposals etc   side vol iii l  0  that the doctrine of the apostles appears to be a sacred book of the new testament long lost to the christian church  these two positions are contrary to the sixth of the    articles  proposals first side vol ii mr whiston undertakes to prove clearly that the apostolical constitutions are the most sacred part of the canonical scriptures of the new testament  vid postscript p    l ult mr whiston asserts that the doxology current in all these latter ages vid thackham his deposition glory be to the father and to the son and to the holy ghost was not the true christian doxology  this position is against the doxology received and established in the public liturgy  dated october       0 this paper was delivered to mr whiston the day and year abovewritten by mr vicechancellors order witness my hand robert grove  my answer or complaints of and exceptions to these proceedings delivered in the same day mr vice chancellor the accusation which now lies against me in this place gives me but too much occasion both for surprise and complaint for truly i cannot but be surpised that after all my care and concern to demean my self honestly and inoffensively both before god and men and to discharge my several duties as a man a christian a clergyman and a professor of the mathematics in this university after an uncommon search after and zeal for the pure original incorrupt doctrines and duties of christianity as they appear in the sacred books of the old and new testament and in all the most ancient and primitive fathers and yet as far as possible with a constant and regular compliance with the rules and orders of the church of england after my earnest endeavors to recover and retrieve several of the original sacred books of our religion long lost or despised or neglected in these latter ages at least in these western parts of christendom and after such great success in those and my other enquiries that of all the many learned persons who have perused my papers not any of them has undertaken to write an answer to them after all this i say i cannot but be surpised that without sending for any of those papers or at all examining them and without allowing me any public conference and disputation about the notions contained in them while every one else is permitted if not encouraged to preach and dispute against me upon all occasions i am forced to stand here as an offender and a criminal on account of them nicodemus though so timorous as to come to jesus by night only yet ventured to say in the midst of the rulers of the jews john vii  0    does our law judge any man before it hear him and know what he does and certainly it is not consistent with common justice with the nature of the christian doctrine nor with the honor of this learned body to censure or condemn either me or my opinions till upon a mature and solemn examination it plainly appears that those opinions are not only false but groundless and by consequence that i am grossly mistaken in them and ought to retract them and give me leave to say that this method of conference and examination is that which ought always to be and has ordinarily been used in such cases nor has it i suppose been any where denied among those that call themselves christians but in the popish inquision it self and this is certainly the only way to influence reasonable men in such matters and as to my self i promise that it shall influence me even to perpetual silence and the burning my own papers if the contrary doctrines can produce but one tenth part of that evidence that original evidence which i shall then allege for what i shall there defend nor will any other method at all weigh with me as to my faith or practice for i dare say you are all persuaded that i am not so insincere or fearful as to retract or renounce any thing which upon full examination i am really persuaded to be either a truth or a duty of the christian religion out of the apprehension of what any such tribunal as this can inflict upon me permit me mr vice chancellor to say farther that this way of conference and examination is that very method which is marked out by an ancient and famous precedent when this very statute now before you was first used i mean the case of professor cartwright in the days of queen elizabeth whom archbishop whitgift the then vice chancellor and the university would not proceed against till they had invited him to a conference and that in writing in order to his conviction but which he refused and was thereupon censured and expelled as the authentic record a copy of which is hereunto annexed will testify the case is here quite otherwise i am not only willing to accept of any such invitation but do here solemnly invite the university to this conference and examination nay i demand it as the right of the sacred truths of christianity and what this learned body cannot either in equity or honor deny that i be thus heard and my papers fairly and fully examined before any farther proceedings be had in this matter and to encourage your acceptance of this proposal i do sincerely declare that i will have no regard therein to victory or triumph but will alone seek for truth and genuine christianity for god is my witness that i am very unwilling to be in the least deceived my self or to deceive the church of christ and that i am always very desirous of the opportunity of improving and correcting my notions and papers that so the least syllable of the truths of christ jesus may not receive any diminution or misrepresentation by me when my papers come to be published  but then mr vice chancellor besides my surprise at the several things abovementioned with relation to this procedure i think i have great reason for complaint on many accounts also accordingly i must here take the liberty to complain that matters have a long while been very unfairly and clancularly managed against me that during the last two years and above half wherein it has been known that i have been upon those enquires whence the present accusation is taken no vice chancellor no public professor not any one of those in authority here which are known to be the most disatisfyd have ever sent for me and my papers and discoursed me freely or given me a friendly caution about them i think i have also reason to complain that so many and such improper ways have been tried to procure some censure upon me as if i were such a public enemy that all the methods that could be thought of were to be used for my destruction once a grace of the senate house was to be procured for my expulsion without my being heard at all when that did not do i have as i hear been threatened with the ecclesiastical court and with the assizes then advice was taken whether i could not with safety be legally convicted of heresy and so be expelled by mr lucass statutes and now a remote university statute not at all in its main and original design as i conceive reaching my case and such an one as if strained to the same rigor as to others might expel i believe much the greatest part of the university is at last produced against me this statute is de concionibus concerning public sermons and such like public acts and lectures before the university how can this statute possibly reach me since i never had the honor to preach before the university in my life i never kept any divinity act or opposed in the divinity schools since i was admitted my public lectures have been all mathematical and being most of them printed will show how remote they have been from any things of this nature this statute must therefore be strained beyond all reasonable construction ere it can affect me i have indeed formerly had an afternoon lecture in the town of cambridge by the bishops sole permission and upon his sole salary but it is the opinion of the best judges that whatever i said there can no way be used to my prejudice in this place the parish churches at least ordinarily when none but the inhabitants are supposed to be present being certainly under no other cognizance than of the right reverend the lord bishop of the diocese and accordingly one person of this university about a year and a half ago did once make some complaint to our diocesan for what happened in one of those churches who thereupon appointed us to appear before him at a certain hour the next day i came at the hour appointed and stayed about an hour expecting my accuser but he did not come till the bishop and my self were both gone which hindered any farther proceedings and sure i cannot be accused both before the bishop and before this consistory for the same pretended offenses in the same parish church i do therefore insist upon it that the true extent of this statute may be fully considered before any thing be done against me by virtue of it as also i desire it may be considered whether words pretended to be spoken so long ago especially where the time is either not specified at all or not nearer than that of a whole years space can be admitted against me and whether books published at london and private discourses elsewhere can come within the reach of this statute where the offenses punishable by it must be committed not only infra universitatem nostram in a place belonging to the university but must be done public docendo tractando vel defendendo in public and solemn sermons lectures or disputations before the same university i do also complain that the chancellor of the university has not as i believe been acquainted with this matter when the statute says all the proceedings upon it are to be cancellarii jussa and though in ordinary affairs the vice chancellor may have authority enough to act for the chancellor and may well enough exercise that authority yet certainly in a case of so uncommon a nature and of such mighty consequence the like whereto i will be bold to say never before came into this consistory it was but reasonable that the chancellor himself should be acquainted and his directions received before any proceedings should have been begun by the university i do also complain that the accusations or depositions against me relate generally to things long since past and gone without the pretense of any new offenses unless the civility of sending some inoffensive proposals to any of you can be esteemed of that nature i hope i may well call them inoffensive since they plainly are such and will appear such to every christian reader that peruses them i have also i think great reason to complain that i am as it were by this procedure prevented in my honest design recommended to me by a very learned and pious prelate of our own church and readily agreed to by me of laying all my papers before the convocation which is almost now ready to fit for their consideration and correction sure the university will never suppose or believe that the convocation will censure without examination nor is the university to prejudge a cause which most properly belongs to the cognizance and judgment of the convocation i do also complain that i have been so exceeding privately convened and particularly interrogated and not in the consistory before the university where all that desired might have been present and i might have had such assistance as law and equity do allow as if some mens hopes of oppressing me arose rather from the prospect of the terror i should be under in such circumstances and the unwary answers i should thereupon make than from the strength of the evidence and the notoriety of the offenses i could be proved to be guilty of i do lastly complain that as i am informed such a sort of determination has been lately made about the sense of that statute whereby i am charg d as might best reach my case before i have been any way heard or any legal advice has been taken concerning the true extent and meaning of it contrary i think to the plain rules of justice and equity in such a case  these mr vice chancellor are the principal occasions of that surprise and complaint which i at first mentioned not that they all directly affect your selves from whom i am willing to hope for nothing but fairness justice and equity but because they all belong to some members of this university and for a conclusion give me leave to say that these matters are of such mighty consequence they are become so very public and the fairness and necessity of a solemn examination are so generally owned by the archbishops and bishops and the rest of those learned men of all parties who have perused my papers that if the proceeding in this matter here be with haste precipitation and severity those that act in it will not only wound their own consciences commit an heinous offense against god and thereby expose themselves to severe punishment from his hand but there will hereby be laid a lasting an indelible blot and reproach upon the university as undertaking rashly and violently to punish me before it appears that i am at all guilty of any offense to deserve that punishment while at the same time i shall not only have the comfort of an innocent conscience for my support but shall also have the expectation of speedy relief and redress from the known justice and equity of those who represent her sacred majesty in her courts of judicature to which in that case i shall be obliged immediately to appeal  saving therefore to my self the liberty of making any other future exceptions to these proceedings against me the principal ones that i make at present are these i say    that i am charged with breaking that   th statute which i have been incapable of breaking because it only concerns such public universityexercises as i have never performed    that the place where most of the words are pretended to have been spoken st clements church is utterly out of the jurisdiction of the university and so no ways within this statute    that the want of the specification of the time or the too loose specification of it renders most of the depositions of no value    that words charged at so great a distance of time cannot be sworn to so particularly as is necessary to affect me    that words spoken in private conversation or at a coffeehouse or written in a private letter can no way be within this statute    that no books printed and published at london can be within this statute    that i ought to have been convened publicly in the consistory and evidence fairly there produced against me in an open court and not privately in a chamber been asked many ensnaring questions with the exclusion of even a single friend who was willing to have been there to assist and direct me    that any prior determination of the sense of this statute before i have had council allowed me or legal advice taken about its true extent and meaning is of no force at all against me  and i desire and demand that i may have time given me and council allowed me to argue the validity of these exceptions  will whiston october       0 nb the record herein referred to about professor cartwright is taken out of dr fullers history of the university of cambridge page     and runs thus ann reg eliz   ann dom     march    whereas it is reported that master cartwright offering disputations and conference touching the assertions uttered by him and subscribed with his hand and that he could not obtain his request therein this is to testify that in the presence of us whose names are here underwritten and in our hearing the said mr cartwright was offered conference of diverse and namely of mr doctor whitgift who offered that if the said mr cartwright would set down his assertions in writing and his reasons unto them he would answer the same in writing also the which master cartwright refused to do further the said dr whitgift at such time as mr cartwright was deprived of his lecture did in our presence ask the said mr cartwright whether he had both publicly and privately diverse times offered the same conference unto him by writing or not to which mr cartwright answered that he had been so offered and that he refused the same moreover the said mr cartwright did never offer any disputation but upon these conditions viz that he might know who should be his adversaries and who should be his judges meaning such judges as he himself could best like of neither was this kind of disputation denied unto him but only he was required to obtain license of the queens majesty or the council because his assertions be repugnant to the state of the commonwealth which may not be called into question by public disputation without license of the prince or his highnesss council  john whitgift vice chancellor john mey henry harvey thomas b   andrew pearne william chadderton edward hawford thomas f     note dr fuller says that this instrument is registered in cambridge    when i had read and delivered in this second paper i expected some answer thereto and some legal notice to have been taken of it but all to no purpose the torrent was too strong to be stopped by any such methods the vice chancellor pretended without the least regard to what i had said that they were agreed that the positions charged upon me were both plainly contrary to the churches doctrine and were sufficiently proved against me and so they would proceed i thereupon boldly desired to know whether every one there present for they were then the least number possible that could act in such a case had entirely agreed to both these propositions and particularly asked sir john elliss opinion he answered that he agreed that the paper delivered to me contained doctrines contrary to those of the church of england but whether they had sufficiently proved that those doctrines were chargeable upon me he did not determine but left that to others yet did they proceed as if sir john had equally agreed to both those particulars which it is certain he did not and that he declared he did not though he had hardly leave given him to finish that his declaration i was then very gravely and solemnly admonished again by the vice chancellor to leave my errors and return to the church of england or else he let me know that on monday at three a clock they would proceed to execute the statute against me without the least intimation of allowing me so much as one hours time to answer the charge which not till now was properly delivered to me as to my desire of conference and fair examination the vice chancellor said that the regius professor might take me to his lodgings and discourse with me if he pleased to which no answer was returned by any body the lady margarets professor also once upbraided me as if i denied things there which elsewhere i asserted which he looked on as no argument of that sincerity i pretended to upon this i openly desired not to be misunderstood but that i only required legal proof for what was alleged against me without being ensnared by their questions and without affirming or denying any thing my self about them whereupon he said no more of that matter and the regius professor who understood me so all along did me the justice to put that matter right and to explain in what sense he supposed i did not now own or assert any of the things charged upon me to which i fully assented and so that imputation came to nothing the margaret professor farther told me when i insisted on examination before censure that i knew well enough that when heretics arose it was not usual to argue with them but to quote some canon of a council which condemned them and so to anathematize them immediately i said to him but suppose that what i said about the apostolical constitutions etc should at last prove to be true he replied if so he would come and heartily beg my pardon the master of jesus thought time might be allowed me for my answer but so earnest and vehement was the vice chancellor in his proceedings that all such motions came to nothing the same master of jesus also asked me why i called the constitutions the most sacred book of the new testament i answered because they really were so and were so esteemed in the first ages i also said to him that they would repent their severity to me and that if he had been by when dr smalridge who had read my papers and of whom i believed he had a very good opinion and my self lately discoursed upon these matters he would scarce have been against their examination before they censured me on account of them upon which he owned that he had himself also seen some of my papers which i suppose was some time ago when mr hughes and mr townsend of the same college had the perusal of them i mean those which concern the trinity and incarnation only but finding the master of sidney exceeding hot against me i said to him that i believed he had not studied these matters he grew passionate and said that was my impudence i said i meant particularly as to the constitutions he replied that he had read them but however that he knew my assertions were contrary to those of the church of england which indeed he all along confined himself to insomuch that when on monday the vicechancellor had said with some moderation that my tenets were erroneous and contrary to the churches doctrine and that the fore i ought to retract them and i had replied let them be but once proved to be erroneous and i was most ready to retract them the master of sidney at whose elbow i stood told me they did not mean ecroneous but contrary to the doctrine of the church nay when i said to them will you condemn or censure while none either will or dare answer me somebody that was offended at that last word replied dare but without any farther addition and indeed great care was all along taken that the truth or falsehood of my doctrines should be wholly waved and all set upon their contrariety to those of the church of england without so much as a pretense that any body would answer the arguments and testimonies which i had to produce for them it was once urged that my affirming the constitutions and doctrine of the apostles to be sacred books of the new testament was contrary to the sixth article of our church i desired that article might be read which was done by the master of pembroke i said thereupon it is plain that this article owns the present sacred books being all the church then knew and that had they known of more they would have set them down also but that it is not affirmed in that article that there are no other than those and so my assertion is not contrary thereto yet did this pass as a clear contradiction to it and no wonder when in the paper given me from the vicechancellor the very nicene creed is it self quoted as condemning my calling god the farher the one god of the christian religion while yet that creed begins with a direct and solemn affirmation of it i believe in one god the father almighty after all when the vicechancellor perceived that i began to draw some of the heads into arguing and reasoning about these matters he took one of the candles himself and saying a few things to me about a recantation which i declared i could not make with a safe conscience he said he pitied me and then he fairly conducted me out of the lodge and so i took my leave having before hinted to them that i did not design to wait on them any more about these matters but to leave them to do as they pleased therein which resolution i kept till monday accordingly for when on sunday i was again summoned by mr atwood to appear the next day at three a clock i made this answer that i saw no occasion for appearing any more however for some reasons i afterward altered my mind and came and appeared again on monday in a lower room of the same lodge before the heads who were now twelve in number whose names will be set down presently and upon mr vicechancellors enquiring of me whether i came disposed to make a retractation of those my errors concerning which he had before admonished me upon leave given i read the following paper as my answer and delivered it in as follows verbatim  mr vicechancellor i did not think to have appeared to day at all because i understood that this meeting was appointed only for my retractation for which i have neither had any considerable time nor any proper motives for conviction afforded me and so to be sure i cannot be disposed for any such thing nay indeed i cannot allow that any doctrines contrary to those of the church of england and within your cognizance by the   th statute have been legally proved upon me however i have thought fit to appear according to the summons given me yesterday what i have at present to allege against these proceedings besides my former exceptions is that the advice for the study of divinity quoted against me was written about february   0   and that the depositions as to what i said in st clements church belong to the year   0  and that if i committed any offenses in either case they are fully and completely forgiven by the last act of her majestys most gracious general and free pardon which therefore i do here plead in bar to all farther proceedings and i do think the molestation already given me is penal by that act as to part of mr thackhams deposition which may seem to be a little later than that act it is not at all charged upon me in the paper delivered to me as the whole charge against me and so is of no force at all and as to the remaining charges that from the other part of mr thackhams deposition is only that i would not use a doxology which our church i think never uses nor enjoins and which stands on the alone footing of dr brady and mr tate or suchlike private persons and the other concerning the stiling god the father the one and only god it is so expressly the language of our church in the nicene creed and in the collect for the   th sunday after trinity that i am surprised at its being in this manner alleged against me but since you have given no time for the examination of my legal exceptions nor for my own answer i publicly protest against your proceedings and desire that my protestation may be entered into the records of the university  will whiston october  0    0 as soon as i had delivered this paper and had owned to the vicechancellor that it contained all that i had to say at present i took my leave whereupon the vicechancellor and the heads soon came to a resolution to banish or expel me as the following public act will inform the reader a true copy of which shall be here set down  october  0th    0 at a meeting of mr vicechancellor and the heads of colleges in the university of cambridge in the vicechancellors chamber in king s college in the said university whereas it has been proved before us that william whiston master of arts mathematick professor of this university has asserted and spread about in cambridge since the   th day of april   0  diverse tenets against religion received and established by public authority in this realm contrary to the forty fifth statute of this university and whereas the said william whiston being required and exhorted by mr vicechancellor to confess and retract his error and temerity in fo doing did refuse to make any such confession and retractation it is therefore agreed and resolved by us the vicechancellor and heads of colleges whose names are here underwritten that the said william whiston has incurred the penalty of the foresaid statute and that he be banished from this university according to the tenor of the same c

roberto grove not pub and almae universitatis praedictae registrario now the reader is here to observe that since all the depositions concerning st clements church are here given up as being long before the    th of april   0  the date for the act of pardon since the passages quoted out of the advice for the study of divinity were written still earlier and there is no pretense of the least evidence that i any way published it in cambridge and since one part of mr thackhams evidence is made no use of at all in this matter it is plain that this banishment or expulsion is solely grounded on these three things   my affirming with our savior st paul the nicene and all the original creeds and most ancient fathers that the one and only god of the christians is god the father john xvii     cor viii     my asserting an undoubted matter of fact that the original christian doxology was not the common one but glory be to the father through the son or and the son in the holy ghost   my proposing to prove that the constitutions and doctrine of the apostles are sacred books of the new testament and the former of them the most sacred of the canonical books which in time will appear to be undoubtedly true also and all this is done without the least offer at any examination into the truth or falsehood of the same assertions and so without knowing whether the whole proceeding be not directly fighting against god and opposing and persecuting the gospel and religion of christ jesus and if it prove so at last the authors had need to think of that timely repentance and retraction which they required at my hands lest their present authority and pretense of an university statute should be too little to excuse them at the day of judgment  but who should be the secret movers or what should be the secret reasons why after so long a forbearance the vicechancellor and the heads should all on a sudden in this violent manner resolve to censure and expel me is too deep a mystery for me authentickly to dive into and so i must leave it to another tribunal for certainly it could not be the vicechancellors own motion originally since he had forborne me all along and was now in a manner out of his office and was ever remarkable for caution and deliberation in all his proceedings especially when i suppose that neither himself nor indeed the major part of his assessors do at all pretend to have particularly examined the matters themselves concerning which they took upon them to be judges but went plainly at random by their own interpretation of an old statute to persecute an innocent person for the sake of what they rashly call orthodoxy i venture to style my self an innocent person notwithstanding this their sentence against me because i believe that every one of my judges acquits me in his own conscience from any base or sinister design and is satisfied that i did no other than what is certainly every christians duty viz the declaring plainly what upon the most complete examination i was satisfied were the certain truths and duties of christianity for which yet without such examination they have now ventured to censure and expel me which things i own i durst not have had a hand in in any like case for any consideration whatsoever but though they were my judges i am not theirs to their own master they must stand or fall romans xiv   and therefore i can only commit my cause to god the just judge of all the world and leave it in his righteous hands to determine between us however i do heartily wish and hope that as soon as my papers are published they will still seriously consider them and soberly reconsider this whole matter and that their sineere repentance and retractation will prevent the danger of any future punishment from god upon them from that god who desires not the death of a sinner but his repentance  thus ended this university prosecution and banishment of me at least this is all that has been done till the date of these papers without the least regard to mr lucass statutes or to my mathematick professorship depending thereon and so without the direct affecting me as mr lucass professor how plainly soever they have deprived me of that membership of the university which till now either by right or by courtesy i was entitled to so i shall go on no farther with this narration i say in the main affecting me as mr lucass professor only meaning thereby that i claim still notwithstanding this expulsion or banishment to be professor of the mathematics of mr lucass foundation and have accordingly a just right to the profits thereof upon my doing that duty by a deputy as my statutes direct on a long absence which i cannot so well do in person otherwise this expulsion must affect me sensibly enough in respect of my maintenance since the allowance to a deputy and the loss of the advantages formerly arising from the courses of experiments to say nothing of those from teaching privately in cambridge and the charges and losses of a removal cannot well be estimated under  0 l a year which is a great deduction out of a small subsistence nay there want not those who would strain this expulsion from the university to a deprivation as to my professorship and so would deprive me of almost all but what the charity and kindness of friends might afford me which last method of support is also by some envied and complained of beforehand as if there were no way to satisfy their zeal against me but my seeing me and my family reduced to the utmost poverty and distress without a friend to support and relieve me but before i conclude i can hardly avoid saying here that i take the true original cause of this severity to be plainly this that i have written several unanswerable books which are therefore a terrible eyesore to those who are more concerned for modern orthodoxy and the pretended power of the church in controversies of faith than for the pure and undefiled religion of christ jesus so that when it appeared as it has done for a considerable time that none of the learned could or durst undertake the answering me in the way of reason argument and testimony this method of ensnaring me by an old statute was thought of and i venture to say this the rather because that open that unanswerable challenge i made in the postscript of ignatius to the orthodox to show but one single catholic testimony before the days of athanasius which affirmed the father son and holy ghost to be one god or the one god of the christian religion while i promised above an hundred testimonies in the same time that god the father was that one god appears to have been the principal evidence against me and that which was most publicly and solemnly read to me by the master of pembroke as the main article of my charge and for which chiefly i am censured and expelled i call it an open and an unanswerable challenge and i here again make it to the whole body of the christian world and do venture in the most solemn manner to appeal to the consciences of all the truly learned whether what i have affirmed on this head be not undoubtedly and indisputably true and so whether i am not censured and expelled for owning my self a christian nay i may add for asserting the first and most fundamental doctrine of the whole christian religion i know this repeated challenge may be most easily answered in the same way that the former was by a repeated censure for in any other way i am sure it cannot and if that be again put in practice by any suchlike body of this church i shall only beg one favor that those who do it will deal plainly and declare that they are not nor do pretend to the christians but members of the church of england only or at least that they are just so far christians as the original doctrines and duties of christianity are agreeable to those that the xxxix articles the book of homilies and the common prayer book contain but no farther and then it will be some small satisfaction to have the world know that as in popish countries christianity is generally no farther believed and obeyed than it is agreeable to the decrees and practices of the church of rome so that in this protestant this reformed country the case is the very same only with this difference that the former pretends to that infallibility and dominion over conscience which the latter disclaims and by consequence that the latter is of the two in this matter the most plainly unjustifiable and inexcusable however as to my being condemned for asserting what was undeniable and unanswerable we have a famous parallel example in the sacred history for truly just so it was in the case of the protomartyr st stephen all due allowance for the great difference of the persons concerned and of their circumstances being still made for when the jews were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke act vi  0 etc they drew him into their consistory and accused him there and when they could not find any fair reply to the force of his reasoning they were cut to the heart and gnashed upon him with their teeth vii    and immediately without any other formality of law put him to a violent death then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord and cast him out of the city and stoned him v       whether this violence toward me may not end in some attempts not very different from that case i cannot tell however i shall venture to use his dying petition for all my persecutors lord lay not this sin to their charge v  0   but now if after all the reader be desirous to know what sort of answer i should have made to the present accusation had i had competent time allowed me i shall plainly tell him in a few words i intended therein to have stated some of my opinions more fully and clearly than the evidence produced did inform my judges and in order to show that then they were not so contrary to the doctrine and settlement of the church of england as they supposed i designed to have insisted on such heads as these  to have showed    that the protestant religion in general and the church of england in particular were begun upon this foot i mean the acknowledgment of the churches errors and the attempt for the correction os the same even with the hazard of the very lives themselves of the reformers    that they are both built on the foundation of the holy scriptures and most primitive writers and always own that all errors when discovered are to be amended by those original standards    that all protestants and particularly the members of this church do unanimously own the fallibility of all councils and churches and so cannot be surpised if in points never yet brought to a fair and public examination some errors be supposed still remaining among them    that accordingly they have generally found reason to alter their opinions in several doctrines of consequence as our church has in particular about the predestinarian points nay they have generally even our church her self found reason to alter several practices of consequence also since the time of the reformation and so it can seem no wonder if there should appear occasion for the like farther enquiries and alterations at this day    that in the grand point before us that of the trinity it self our church sometimes speaks according to those ancient notions which i advance nay commonly prays and practices agreeably thereto so that the corrections i plead for would rather be the rendering the churchs language and practice all of a piece than the entire subversion and alteration of the same    that the most learned and impartial both papists and protestants and those of our church in particular have in this last age been forced to leave the vulgar notions in that matter and to come still nearer and nearer to that most primitive and rational account which i plead for as appears by erasmus grotius petavius huetius dr cudworth bp pearson bp bull the bp of gloncester mr lock and many others so that my notions are so far from new that they are rather the proper and last result of the enquiries of the learned since the reformation    that since i have taken all along the most peaceable christian and inoffensive methods of bringing these important points to a fair examination and have still laid my papers before the governors of the church and the learned members of it for their consideration and the necessary corrections i have no way offended against the laws of the land or even the statutes of the university as to their main design and intention which can never be supposed to be the punishment of an honest and innocent man when in so fair quiet and open a manner he proposes sacred books doctrines and duties of the gospel to the serious consideration of the christian world however if the laws of the kingdom or statutes of the university be so expounded as to forbid any thing that the laws of god and of the gospel require i know which i am to obey whether it be right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god judge ye for we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard act iv     0   these were such heads as i intended more largely and fully to have pursued had i had time allowed me for my answer but since i was not afforded that i shall wave the farther prosecution of them and conclude not only with the declaration of the readiness of my submission to any punishment which my governors in any sort do legally inflict upon me but with my hearty thanks to the divine providence which has disposed of me into this kingdom of freedom and liberty where it is not very much that by the laws can be laid upon me sor the sake of my conscience where therefore with small legal hazard i can greatly promote the true religion os christ jesus and that i am not in spain or portugal or the like countries subject to the terror of a popish inquisition wherein the speaking or writing a small part of what i have here spoken and written would certainly have condemned me to a loathsome dungeon and to an ignominious death the utmost severities of which i hope i should yet by gods grace have endured rather than have retracted and renounced what upon such full and undoubted evidence i am entirely satisfied is part of the revelation of god by his son christ jesus if any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters yea and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple lu xiv       i end the whole with our saviors own words which in some small degree do now plainly belong to me blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven matt v  0 which blessedness i own i had rather have a share in than in all the dangerous and ensnaring pomp of this vain and transitory world  will whiston december       0 appendix when the university had thus banished me they seemed somewhat at a loss what they should do farther nor did they come to any resolution for near a year in which time i took the best advice i could what was fit for me to do and according to that advice and the power i had by mr lucass statutes i made a sufficient deputy mr christopher hussy fellow of trinity college to perform those duties of my place in the university which my banishment made it not fit for me to do my self who yet found the university in such a temper that he never durst venture actually to read for me dr jenkins indeed the new master of st johns college was so fair upon my worthy friend mr billers application to him on my account for his consent to my deputys reading for me that he declared he would consent if the rest of the heads were willing but not otherwise which answer i took very kindly from him as i think i had reason to do especially when i compare this civil treatment of his with that of some others for when i once during this interval and i think at the same time stayed at cambridge a few days and endeavored to make the heads easy in the admission of my deputy i had a beadle presently sent to me by dr lany master of pembroke hall the then deputyvicechancellor to know how i durst venture to appear even in the town of cambridge under my banishment from the university nay i was informed that one of the heads said i might be laid by the heels for my presumption about a year after my banishment dr lany who was again deputyvicechancellor for sir nathaniel lloyd the vicechancellor would never himself consent to it resolved to proceed to the election of another professor and accordingly put up a paper upon the doors of the public schools appointing a day for the filling up my professorship which was therein declared to have been vacated per bannitionem gulielmi whiston as i think the words were without any other deprivation according to mr lucass statutes by which yet alone surely i could be legally deprived thereof the person who was chosen was mr nicolas sanderson who has ever since taken upon him to be the mathematick professor in my room thus far the proceedings of the university were by their own authority but because they were not of themselves able to eject me out of the possession of the lands and profits of my professorship which though legally vested in trustees were yet in fact ever under the management of the professor himself they soon applied for assistance to the highcourt of chancery and after the necessary bills and answers were over the cause it self and its real merits seemed at last ready for a fair full and public hearing for which i justly hoped and had prepared my self accordingly the points of law as i all along apprehended were these two first whether an hasty banishment by an old university statute without hearing any legal exceptions or affording any council or time for a proper defense and answer to an accusation was statutable and legal secondly whether such banishment by an old university statute if legal could vacate a professorship which stood on an entirely different foundation and where i had the opinion of council learned in the law that it could have no such effect but instead of any such hearing we soon feared and found that the lordchancellor harcourt would take it for granted without a distinct hearing that what the heads of the university had done was within their power to do and so was done legally nay he was pleased though unwillingly to give the university costs against me for this very and only reason as he told the court that i had obliged the university to bring a cause before him in judgment which he could not hear which was all the hearing and determination i had there as to the legality of my banishment and as to the other question which was to me and my family of much greater moment viz whether such a banishment would vacate my mathematick professorship or not it never came to any thing like a hearing only the lord chancellor had been pleased on a former occasion to declare in court that although he could not determine a cause he had not heard yet he could not but think it strange that a professor of an university should be one that by banishment was no member of that university however finding soon that the torrent was then too strong against me and being promised if i submitted great good offices with the university by the beforementioned dr lany who then acted on their behalf i was prevailed on not only to deliver up my writings and to suffer the decree to pass against me which were done immediately but also to cast my self wholly upon the mercy of the university which i did a little after by the following petition which indeed dr lany undertook to present and to support on my behalf it was in the words following  to the worshipful the vice chancellor and the reverend the heads of the university of cambridge the humble representation and petition of william whiston late professor of the mathematics in the said university shows that your petitioner in order to render himself capable of being admitted mathematical professor did long ago surrender and lose the vicaridges of lowestoft and kessingland in the diocese of norwich of a considerably greater yearly value than the lands settled sor the maintenance of such professor  that by reason of landtaxes while your petitioner was professor his income was corsiderably less than either of his predecessors received and yet your petitioner expended in repairs during the same time near  0 l  that when with t any prejudice to the estate your petitioner had caused timber to be cut sufficient for reinbursing the moneys so by him expended as well as for the repairs then and now necessary your petitioner was hindered from disposing of any part thereof or reimbursing himself thereby by the injunction of the court of chancery so that your petitioner has now been near  0 l out of pocket for some years which has been a great hardship on him added to his other misfortunes  that by your petitioners interest and application the said estate has been for these last four years or thereabouts freed from the former taxes which though it has been of little or no advantage to himself may be very much so to those that succeed him  that during the time your petitioner was mathematical professor and before he had the misfortune of incurring the displeasure of the university and was banished from thence he is humbly confident that according to his abilities he duly performed the office of mathematical professor  that your petitioners banishment was not from any neglect of his duty as mathematical professor but merely for certain opinions in religion which he taking and believing to be true could not retract without doing the greatest violence to his conscience nor without being sensible if he had so done that he should have deserved a much greater punishment from god than has or can be inflicted on him by man  that the university having shown a zeal which possibly might have been expected from them for the established opinions by banishing your petitioner yet well hoping so long as he bumbly and quietly submitted to their sentence of banishment it might have been consistent with the goodness of the university to have permitted him to enjoy part of the profits of the said lands he appointed a sufficient deputy to perform the same office as your petitioner apprehended and was advised by his council he had a power to do by the statutes of the founder and when the university had thought proper to appoint another to read the mathematical lecture your petitioner readily offered to have named him his deputy and to have made a competent allowance for his pains therein  that although your petitioner was not indulged so far yet he has not sought any relief against the said sentence but has submitted thereto although the said sentence it continuing in force was the only ground of any advantage to be taken against your petitioner as he was advised  that your petitioners defending the suit in chancery against him was not out of any obstinacy or ill will to those that prosecuted it or to him for whose benefit that suit was brought but out of a sense of that justice and care which your petitioner owed to his family whose main support the rents of the lands in question were and for preservation whereof your petitioner was advised by his council to make such defense not without hopes of success therein  that yet your petitioners friends advising him to relinquish all legal advantages and to cast himself upon the mercy of the university rather than to contend with them any further and your petitioners council not being averse thereto your petitioner with all readiness complied with that advice and gave orders accordingly and immediately delivered up the principal writings before any decree for so doing  that your petitioner does now in pursuance of that resolution submit to the decree of the high court of chancery in the premises in humble confidence that according to the hopes then given to your petitioners friends that the vicechancellor and the heads of the same university will have regard to the premises and consider his case to which end your petitioner makes this humble representation thereof and further in all humble manner shows  that there is a clause in the statutes of mr lucas s foundation which directs that such moderation should be showed to his professor that should be deprived without his own fault that if he had behaved himself worthily during his continuance in the place and had not one hundred pounas a year of his own estate that he should have a third part of the annual salary during his life as by a copy of the said clause underwritten appears  that whatever fault the university has judged your petitioner guilty of with relation to his opinions in religion or public profession thereof yet your petitioner having performed the office of professor unblameably as he humbly hopes and the said sentence of banishment regarding only his said opinions and not the discharge of his office and your petitioner not having any thing like such yearly income as mentioned in the aforecited clause  your petitioner therefore humbly hopes the university will judge his case to come within the equity of the said clause and will make him the allowance therein mentioned or somewhat equivalent thereto which will be a great comfort and relief to your petitioner and his family in their present circumstances  and moreover your petitioner humbly prays that in regard of the premiss aforesaid the university would be pleased to remit the costs decreed against him and the rather for that the the court on making the said decree was pleased twice to declare that the university ought not to ask them or to that effect and for that your petitioner has cheerfully referred himself and does hereby refer himself wholly to the equity and mercy of the university and he cannot but be in expectation of a favorable answer  and your petitioner shall pray etc and now if the reader enquire what kindness and relief i met with from the university upon this petition i mean besides this that they have not yet demanded of me the costs of the suit for turning me out as by the rigor of the decree in chancery they might have done he will easily guess at it when i solemnly affirm and i appeal to the conscience of every member of that body now alive that were then concerned whether that affirmation and this whole account be not the exact truth that to the best of my remembrance i neither then nor any other time since my banishment have been once vouchsafed an answer to any such applications i have made the vicechancellor and heads of the university whether it were for justice or mercy to this very day  will whiston nov        a
