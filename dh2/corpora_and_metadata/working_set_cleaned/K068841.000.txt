an essay on the virtue and efficient cause of magnetical cures  to which is added a new method for curing wounds without pains and without the application of remedies  hitherto kept as a secret in private families  written originally in latin by the famous dr herman boerhaave professor at the university of leyden in holland but never published till now  by a relation of the said doctor for the good of the public  london printed in the year mdccxliii  the preface of the editor every body is convinced that men are created for societysake and no body is ignorant that without the assistance of a great many others he would be more miserable than a beast itself but every body is not convinced that it is naturally impossible to become happy or rich without contributing proportionably toward the happiness or riches of others at least the experience we have every day of a great many peoples building their happiness and riches upon the ruins of others evidenceth clearly that either they must be stark mad or are not convinced that in so doing they are acting against their own interest nevertheless there is nothing more true and nothing more deserving our attention than the welfare of others in case we have a mind to be happy ourselves it is nothing else but a prevention to think that riches do consist in the sole possession of a great quantity of goods and that such a quantity of goods has a sovereign virtue to free ourselves from all troubles and accidents since men are not able to live without the personal ministry of others true riches have no other virtue than what is given them by the will the power and the number of such who are to make use thereof they have no value and no price in themselves but what they receive from this number and accordingly as this will this power and this number is preserved accordingly our pretended riches have an estimation without it they are no more than dust  an infinite number of examples as well ancient as modern do convince us thereof and i have in a particular treatise on the way and means to get rich now ready for the press purposely endeavored to give a full demonstration of this truth where i remit the curious reader i shall only in this place draw a conclusion from what i have said which is that if our riches have no other value and estimation than what is given them by an infinite number of others and if we cannot be rich without them it is evident that instead of ruining others contrary to our interest we ought proportionably to contribute toward the preservation of this will this power and this number and in case we really do intend to get rich and happy we ought to be in harmony with such as are to give a value and a price to our substance and as we do not know precisely who is to give a value to our possessions we ought to regard every body as such  if every body is to be considered to be of the number of such as are to give a value to our riches and if without the personal ministry of men we cannot live it is our interest to have them in a condition to render the same if this number lives for us their condition must be perfect in consequence that their service may be perfect and entire their bodies must be brought to the degree of natural perfection that their organs may be well disposed to receive the commandments of understanding and will wherewith they are animated for our service and for our preservation and that the inactivity and the defects of their bodies may not hinder the activity of their understanding  this is the total sum of the obligations we lie under in case we love our own interest it is therefore a pernicious enviousness in some who being master of some good invention for shortening and making easy the labors and fatigues of their fellow creatures choose rather to keep it in their closets as an idle object of their curiosity than to have the public reap the advantage thereof which consequently would be beneficial to themselves by reason of the maxim i have before advanced  if such an enviousness is to be blamed in respect of inventions for shortening and making easy the labors and fatigues of men it is the more in respect of discoveries tending toward the preservation and restoring of health and i may boldly say that such as are backwards therein are in some measure answerable for the languishings and sufferings of their fellow creatures the life and health of a single person is more precious than all what vulgarly we understand under the notion of riches not so much for reason of the excellency of the structure of a man but because wealth and riches can never exist without a number of people who are to give it its value and estimation without it it is a chimaera and no more than dust consequently the more this number increases the more value our pretended riches are receiving and consequently the more richer we actually become  few are ignorant of the great uncertainty we labor under in physics and i should think it would not be out of the way if physicians would follow the example of painters who for the more excelling in their art have divided themselves in several branches some apply themselves only to painting of faces some of landskips some of battle pieces and even some only to paint flowers etc by this way each one comes to a degree of perfection the object of physic being the restoring and preserving of our health a consideration far surpassing all others of what nature soever it is evident that the art of physic instead of being founded only upon probabilities would attain to a degree of certainty if each physician would direct his attention only to certain diseases and publish the discoveries made in curing them dum singuli pugnant omnes vincuntur  the most ablest physicians do acknowledge that oftentimes they are at a loss in forming a solid judgment of the diseases of their patients and i am sure that not seldom the remedy prescribed in such a perplexity is worse than the disease itself why do we refuse then to make use of magnetical remedies experienced by our ancestors and left by them upon record to posterity and why do we refuse to make a farther enquiry into the virtues of such remedies the use thereof would at least never be detrimental nor is there to be apprehended that the practice of such remedies is liable to prove more fatal than the disease itself  a great deal more could be said in praise of magnetical cures but as experientia semel instituta plus valet quam mill rations i appeal to the authors quoted in this treatise and content myself to have fulfilled the duty every body lies under which is to contribute proportionably to the happiness of others in case we pretend to be happy ourselves and as the method discovered for curing wounds without pains and without an immediate application of remedies has been sufficiently experienced and always found to answer the purpose i hope it will be received with the same candor as it is discovered  an essay on the virtue and efficient cause of magnetical cures it is needless to give a definition of what is understood by magnetical cures since the invention of a certain powder made of vitriol calcined or rather exsiccated by the reverberation of the sunbeams commonly called sympathetical powder people seem almost to be convinced that there is another way for curing chiefly certain wounds than by an immediate application of certain remedies to the part afflicted only the difference lies herein that a great many either out of prevention or perhaps sometimes out of ignorance or selfinterest stiffly maintain that the cause of such cures is in nothing else to be looked for than in the superstition of certain people some go still farther and do ascribe the virtue to certain ceremonies and even to charms of the last opinion are at th day few more of the first and it seems as if this opinion was supported by the experience itself made by many people with the said sympathetical powder to no purpose which has given room to them to say that the effects of this powder if there are any are only visible according to the more or lesser share of superstition the person is possessed with who makes use thereof moreover the little practice made with this powder though nothing at all expensive and though the advantage of novelty it has is again an other argument by which they strive to evidence that there is no relying at all on this remedy  in my opinion both parties are equally to be blamed the one for ascribing to a thing more than really is in it or can be produced by its intervention though all imaginable care is taken in the preparation of it and the other for deriding every thing they are not able to comprehend with their senses my intention is therefore here to consider on the efficient cause of magnetical cures which will be a means to prove the possibility thereof and this being done i shall conclude with publishing for the good of the public a method to be depended upon and hitherto kept as a secret in private families for magnetically curing certain wounds without pains and without the application of any remedy  there is a kind of affection between all and every thing by virtue of which they alter or affect one another without a visible touching the daily experience convinces us thereof and who denies it ostendi solemn postulat ille sibi  the examination and knowledge of these qualities and hidden virtues in nature is called natural magic founded upon the sympathies of things and who is acquainted with the concord or discord therein is called skilful in magicks and able to produce many marvelous effects appearing to the vulgar to be contrived by the help of demons though this mystery is nothing else but a science of the sympathies and antipathies between superior and inferior things  sympathy is a mutual consent between physical and natural things by which they friendly embrace one another called by some a compassion galen uses the word of friendship pliny concord and tully a convenience and natural continuation for though the bodies of iron and a loadstone are distant from one another nevertheless nature is also continued in them that they agree or meet in one the same calls it an affinity in nature and bapt porta a consent by others it is metaphorically named a symphony or harmony antipathy is a mutual affection between things by virtue of which they shun abhor or are against one another galen and pliny are calling it a fighting and discord others a dissenting enmity variance and hatred others a resistance as hindering or resisting actives to be applied to passives  as from the sympathy of superior and celestial virtues arises a drawing attractio and conveying deductio to the terrene and inferior body also from antipathy a resistance plato calls therefore magic the attraction or drawing of one thing from another caused by an affinity in nature  now all the parts of this world or all the members of one animal depending from one author and principle are joined together by one and the same nature in us the brain heart lungs liver and the rest draw something from one another and mutually assist one another also that if one of them suffers the others are likewise suffering or compatising the same it is in respect of all the bodies in this world joined together they likewise serve and are served mutually by one another and from this common alliance or affinity arises a common love and from this common love a common attraction or drawing this is the reason that the loadstone draws iron unto it and the sun many flowers this is the reason that heliotropium turns with the sun both at rising and going down and selinetropium with the moon  we ought to consider sun moon and the rest according to the terrene quality and stones vegetables and animals according to the celestial quality and so we will find that what is above has connection with what is below and what is below with what is above for by the fatal law given by our creator the terrene body is to serve the celestial and as every individual part of the first is endued with a matrix adapted to bring forth its like so the last is appointed to animate it continually with a certain substance which is able to cause its engendering and begetting without intermission the sympathy and antipathy so notable in animals minerals and vegetables is therefore to nothing else to be ascribed than to the influence of the celestial bodies and their impression according to the constitution of each species and individual being either in general or sometimes according to the singular fabric of one species in particular also a sapphire to speak generally is no where offensive to the eyes but nevertheless there has been found one who did strike the sight of the eye by the first application  but by what means some natural things join together is very difficult to demonstrate out of common philosophy because what is joined or coupled to a thing is of the same being or essence or is of the quality of this being or is in it as the form is in the subject or appertains to it or touches it either like a thing transmuting in respect to what is transmuted or like art in respect of the subject matter moses seems to have clearly expounded to us five things fastened or knit together heaven and earth earth and voidness a bottomless gulf and darkness the spirit of god and the waters light and bodies the first way of this connection is signified by the earth empty and void for an empty and void earth is its matter before it is supplied with a form from elsewhere  the second way of connection is signified by darkness all over the face of the bottomless gulf  the third by light springing up rising or coming upon the bodies  the fourth by heaven and earth the one being joined to the other as actives to passives or as a thing transmuting to what is to be transmuted  the fifth by the spirit of the lord  but let us see how this is in us earth is a terrene body empty of life void of sense above it are darkness dullness death stupidity and no feeling  light is life which quickens moves stirs and gives sense to it  heaven is the soul and the spring of this light  the spirit of god is the understanding the brightness of the divine countenance the reason of this joining or connection is this the body is void in itself has its darkness then it is joined to light through light to heaven through heaven to a spiritual substance as appears by the following viz  the bottomless gulf darkness void of life earth void of sense light quickening and giving life heaven the spring of light the spirit here we see in what order things created are knit together here we see the bond and knot of the natural benevolence but what philosophy is this you will say certainly not a vulgar one which judges of things by sense matter and manifest qualities but a heavenly more subtle and an abstrase one  body and soul being substances very far distant from one another there was need of a mean bond to join these distant substances together and to this purpose is that thin and spiritual small body appointed which physicians as well as philosophers call spirit this copulating spirit is more excellent than the elements and even answers to heaven aristoteles speaks of this proportion thus like as all the virtue of the heavens is conveyed to the earth by the vehicle of light also all the faculties of the soul viz life motion and senses are by the help of this bright spirit conveyed and transferred to the terrene body that all what i have said may be more convincing i shall produce some memorable examples of antipathys and sympathys which authors of no little authority have left to posterity  first of all we meet with a notable antipathy in poisons not every antidote resists all sorts of poison according to galen  de antid each kind of poison has its particular antidote  the scythians were used to besmear their arrows and sabres with a certain poison composed of human blood and a matter coming out of putrefaction corrupt and filthy blood of vipers a slight wound with an instrument also prepared was deadly and nothing could help but cantharides which against all other poisons is ineffectual according to galen and dioscorides  according to pliny there is no greater poison for trees than wild parsnip because being near them it takes not only all the substance away but it boreth and pierces holes like as with a sword through the very roots of the trees  galen i de theriaca ad pison affirms that a herb called trifoly boiled and applied to bitings of vipers is to take immediately away all pains but if applied on sound people that it causes the same pains people suffer being bit by vipers scaliger endeavors to give a reason of this mystery but it is more according to the subtilty of his genius than a true one so much of poisons  but what shall we say of the invincible hardness of a diamond which contemptibly withstands the two greatest forces in nature and notwithstanding yields to goats blood being steeped therein when it is fresh and warm  is not this a surprising example of a natural variance or discord by what ingenuity has this been found out by what accident or what conjecture was there only to experiment such an immense secret chiefly in a goat the filthiest of all animals  a lion feared by all animals and who cares neither tiger nor bear is notwithstanding astonished at the sight of a far weaker animal a cock do you ask the reason thereof perhaps there is a certain strength in the eyes of a cock as some think repugnant to the eyes of a lion certainly we cannot look for the reason of it in the matter or senses otherwise we would fall into endless perplexities but we must look for it in the contemplation of things above us i remit my readers to proclus in his book of magicks where he gives a reason ex professo of this seeming prodigy  who knows not the discord between a spider and a toad or serpent the first perceiving one of the last under the shade of a tree after having it artfully entangled in its web pierces its brains with such a force that it is no more able to disentangle itself from its prison nor dothit find an end thereof till it is dead  the antipathy between an ashtree and a serpent has been so much experimented that we know from thence that a serpent will always shun even the morning and evening shade of this tree and fly from it so far that a fire being made on one side and on the other a semicircle of leaves and branches of an ashtree it rather will jump and endeavor to escape through the fire than pass the ashtree  i proceed to vegetables where equally we meet with an evident and notable discord for an oaktree will not prosper in places where olives grow and an olive tree leaves in groves of oaks such offensive roots which actually do kill the oaktrees the same being planted near wallnuttrees either dies itself or remains always weak or causes the same effects in the wallnut  the hatred between colewort or cabbage and vines is more visible for a vine with its crooked tendrels does tie and bind itself to every thing that it does catch only it refuses the same to cabbage and being near it it bends to the opposite side colewort or cabbage being boiling if only a few drops of wine are poured upon it will immediately cease to boil and the cabbage will lose its color the same will dry through and through if cyclamen a kind of briony or origan or wild marjorum is near it and vines will become worse in the neighborhood of baytrees  there is such an antipathy between a crab and polypody that this herb being applied will cause its throwing off the shell wherewith it is covered or at least its claws fern and reeds are so repugnant to one another that neither of them will suffer the other near it which is the reason that we neither find fern in places where reeds grow nor reeds in ferny grounds  homer pliny and dioscorides do report that alysson st johns wort and rue or herbgrace are of such a natural repugnancy against malignant spirits that like heads of wolves affixed to gates so these herbs hanged up in houses do secure men and beasts against all kinds of sorcery or poison homer who by his travels got a great skill in magicks relates that mercurius armed ulysses against the enchantments of circe by the use of rue or herbgrace and in the history of toby delivered to us by sacred writ we find that the angel taught toby to take part of the heart of a fish drawn out of the river and to cast it upon coals the smoke of which was to rid men and women of all kinds of demons we ought therefore not to call in question the like amulets grounded on natural reasons since a certain substance is issuing out from them which according to experience is capable effectually to repair the strength of bodies and to resist poisons or any thing else that is offensive  the root of white peony and the hoof of an elk are of an antipathy against the falling sickness the seed of melanthium against rheums or falling down of raw humors wolfs dung against colicks not by virtue of charms as some very ignorantly think but because some vapors like atoms issue from their substance which sent forth to the brain do dry it and alter the cause of the sickness by their own virtue galen after many trials speaks thereof that we are to depend upon the like amulets as working by their own substance and not by the virtue of imaginary charms l   and  0 de simplic medic  the hand of a fisherman is stupifyd as soon as he touches a fish called the cramp fish though it be with a long pole a little fish half a foot in length called a suckstone or sea lamprey cleaving to the keel of a ship hinders the course thereof though wind and weather is favorable this is not done by virtue of charms but by reasons i have just now mentioned it is certainly a stupendous miracle of nature that such a small fish is capable to stay a like bulk and to hinder the course of a great ship though in full sail by no other means than by cleaving to it  pliny reports that the imperial ship wherein antony did intend to circuit and to exhort his people was stayed by such a fish and that he was obliged to go into another ship mean while that his fleet was driven a great way off caiuss gally bound for antium an ancient city in italy and rowed by four hundred hands had the same fate and it seems this fish to be ominous since this prince soon after his coming back was deadly wounded there was no longer room to dive into the reason of this staying as soon as this fish was found cleaving to the stern of the ship but being brought into the ship it proceeded and it is particularly to be admired why it was able to stay the ship by cleaving to it and could not do the same after being brought into the ship we must acknowledge that nature here is intricate and cannot be understood by our senses for besides what i have said it seems as if she knowing of an approaching danger did intend to remove it the ship wherein the ambassadors of periander were sent for having the noble boys gelded was stayed in its course as if nature did judge it detestable to rob men of what is given them to their preservation the ship of caius caesar not long after assassinated at rome was stayed as if nature commiserating caesars fate would keep him back from this misfortune and hinder his unhappy course as much of sea lampreys  it has been found by experience that a living duck applied to the belly asswageth the gripings  a living spider enclosed in a walnut shell and tied to the neck to cure the quartan ague the pairings of a sick persons nails of hand and feet tied upon the back of a living crawfish and also thrown into flowing water to expel a tertian ague  a tooth of a living mole to cure the toothache only by touching the afflicted part therewith  a little bone found in the ham of a hares leg behind the knee to resist the stone or gravel in the reins and cramps or convulsions shrinking or plucking of the sinews and arising either of too much fullness or overmuch emptiness  galgalus a galbus a bird which being looked upon by one who has the yellow jaundice cures the person and dies it self  the heart of a raven carried about to hinder sleep and the heart of a bat to provoke it  the bones of the head of a mare affixed upon a post in a garden to chase palmer or cankerworms  a herb called dogstooth having seven knots mentioned by dioscorides under the name of coronopus if tied to ones head effectually cures the headache  a man falling sick at the time when violets or a herb called cicuta the juice of this herb through extreme cold is poison and therefore the athenians used it to kill men in common executions  much like our hemlock is bearing flowers though he is cured will certainly relapse as soon as he has a smell thereof i cannot pass over what pliny recites out of pythagoras crateva democritus appollodorus cleemporus and many others of the wonderful virtue and power or some herbs an herb called adamantis growing in armenia and cappadocia an herb which cannot be brayed of the nature of an adamant or diamond from whence if has received its name being held near lions causes them turn upside down with a yawning an unpleasant open sound  arianis an herb growing with a people in scythia called ariani from whence it has its name of a color shining like fire when gathered the sun being in leo will by touching wood set it on fire the same wood being before thoroughly anointed with oil  aeshynomene an herb so bashful that it shrinks in the leaves as soon as one comes near it with the hand  theangelis an herb growing in syria babylon and many other places makes people prophesy having drunk of a liquor poured upon this herb  gelotophillus an herb growing about borysthenes being drunk with wine and myrrh causes laughing which never cease except kernels of a pine apple with pepper and honey are taken in datewine  aethiopis an herb growing in aethiopia like a lettice wherewith according to pliny enchanters will open any lock turn any stream and dry any river  ophiusa an herb in aethiopia dangerous to look on being drunk it does so terrify the mind with a sight of angry and dreadful serpents that condemned persons for fear thereof did kill themselves and therefore it was used to be given to such as had committed sacrilege  a kind of spider that has in his legs three knots or joints whose sting is perilous and deadly called phalangium immediately dies by touching a certain herb we know by the name of crocis  oenotheris a kind of herb strewed on wild beasts tameth them  achimenis a kind of poley which in time of battle being cast into an army causes them to fear  latace an herb which the king of persia did give to the ambassadors to the end they should never lack necessary food wherever they came  the ancient history does report of aemilianus scipio otherwise called africanus minor that he opened the gates of carthage with a peculiar herb and dried moors and fennish places with aethiopis an herb before mentioned and who has ever come near all the hidden virtues of nature who has ever been able to give reasons thereof or at least what conjectures could there be to experience or make experiments of all these things certainly we must acknowledge it to have been delivered by a particular blessing of the supreme being  the presence of a diamond hinders the loadstone to draw iron unto it and the presence of oil hinders amber to draw straw unto it and if we consider the enmity between things to hurt one another it is not unlikely that our ancestors did infer from thence that perhaps some remedy for their own use might lie concealed under it the success has answered their conjectures and we are obliged to reverence likewise something hidden in sympathies which is of a confederate virtue either to keep at a distance or to expel something that is bad  every day we meet with a notable concord between herbs and the celestial bodies we are assured of the solar presence by the flowers of an herb called cichoreum succory which at the rising of the sun opens and at its setting closes itself up again  lapinus a kind of pulse is daily turned about with the sun also that the sky being cloudy husbandmen know by it what of clock it is the herb mallows conforms itself likewise to the motion of the sun  authors of no small credit unanimously affirm that thunder and lightning never hurts a bay or fig tree nor an hide of a seacalf or hyaena nor a white vine octavius agustus therefore arming himself with the last and tiberius caesar by wearing a crown made of bay leaves secured themselves against thunder because these things are not only of a nature to refist the vehemence of lightning but also to throw back the blasts of it there is a wonderful sympathy between metals and the minersrod or a little twig with two branches cut off a hasletree by the help of which miners search after gold and silver veins it would be in vain to seek for the cause thereof in the manifest qualities  the sympathy subsisting between stones and the celestial bodies is still greater their power is more extensive than that of herbs because they seem not only to command the celestial bodies but also men who is ignorant of the pilots needle a piece of iron rubbed with the lodestone always pointing to the arctic pole selenites a stone found in arabia has a white in it which decreaseth and increases as the moon does  a turquois according to theophrastus and proclus does change and wax very pale being worn by a sick or decaying person but it is more to be wondered at that the precious color of this stone is changed into a sooty and smoaky one or receives some spots or appears to be chinkd when there is a considerable danger approaching the person it is worn by  and for antipathies the same authors do report that the emerald effectually does resist fevers and poisons and that it breaks being overcome by poison  androdamas a precious stone hard and heavy bright like silver and in form of diverse little squares puts away the fury of anger and rage of letchery  genianes a precious stone procures punishment to a mans enemy  dendritis a precious stone which being put under a tree makes that the ax in cutting it should hot be dulled  siderites a stone like iron has power to cause variance amongst men no doubt these stones do actually spout or drive out an invisible hidden power and though they are solid things nevertheless the native heat and rubbing and touching draws out a virtue which it communicates to the heart and brains there are medicines of a great use by reason of their resemblance we see them daily prevail against many diseases for no other reason but because the have one anothers anatomy and signatura this is a way of making demonstrations by resemblance by which the creator of all things oftentimes discovers sublime and hidden things to instruct us by the idea of their resemblance to what they have been from the beginning destinated  all herbs flowers trees etc are magical signs granted by their author the knowledge whereof brings us to the true physic i e signatum because the signs externally discovered by nature are tokens of certain internally hidden virtues and that signatum and the inward kernel is always signified by the outward physiognomy  what is the reason that many diseases cannot be cured with every remedy because they proceed from an astral impression of the firmament there is need of an astronomical influence that is to say of things which have an analogy between the great and lesser world herein does consist the true magnetical virtue of the firmament and the means to resist diseases caused by such impressions this influence and signatura we observe in some plants the notablest and most evident do appear in hypericon and persicaria the first is pierced or bored with small holes and the other spotted with red spots as if blood had dropped upon it  the same signaturae so very useful to the judgment of diseases are likewise to be met with in other vegetables and it is not sufficient for a botanicus to search into the external signaturae of plants their time and place of growing but he ought also to concern himself about the inward principle and their virtue which is the image of god implanted in things created this principle is known by many names some call it the balsam of nature vital sulphur radical seed first matter some natural heat mercury of life universal spirit it never is destroyed in the corruption of things the elements and all mixed bodies being dissolved it will nevertheless remain this balsam does occupy the whole anatomy of bodies in living creatures and plants in some animals rather a certain part as the heart etc and according to the diversity of impressions tincture abundance of humors quality and difference it produces different and diverse actions by virtue of this balsam some plants and parts of animals are of an antipathy against diseases and by the virtue and power of this balsam some parts of animals are of a sympathy with some parts of the human body aiding strengthening and preserving it in its radical vigor  who neglects this principle the signature of things without overcoming a thorough knowledge thereof is unworthy of the name of a physician if there were nothing else the knowledge of this mystery would make a physician excel in his art according to what hippocrates says of those who know beforehand which can be cured and which must die  it cannot be denied that every disease has its particular signs procuring the knowledge thereof to us and the same signs are to be found in the remedies also marked by nature we may therefore say in general and with a great deal of truth that this disease is a disease for this remedy and this remedy is a remedy for this disease the herb tussilago is a remedy for obstructed lungs because it wears the same mark the herbs lingua cervina and scolopendrium are a remedy against a puffdup or swollen milt because they represent the figure of the milt the makes appear that it is possible to overcome a knowledge of nature by the signs of the remedies and that the mystery of sympathies and antipathies in respect of things as well as their qualities are of a vast benefit for a physician  these who are skilful in this secret philosophy and have watched opportunities to experience natures strength are capable of producing many wonderful effects and as the way of their proceedings as in many other things is hidden and concealed the unskilful not seldom ascribe the cause of their actions to the delusions of demons that is to say to magic called goetia from mourning because it is an invocation of evil spirits near tombs and germansisters to necromancy which for calling the souls of the dead requires the effusion of humane or some other blood of black cattle wherewith demons are delighted  true magic grounded upon natural causes is nothing else but a thorough knowledge of the concord or discord between stones herbs minerals animals and the stars which exactly to learn requires a great deal of wisdom and is in no way contrary to divine laws  this natural magic has always been honored and approved of by diligent searchers in the celestial and sublunar beings as tending to the admiration of the works of god who is diving therein cannot but overcome a knowledge of an infinite number of things impossible to be understood by any other means  it will add a great deal of light to the further unfolding of our mystery to make mention in this place of some experiments made with rings of gold silver latten or any other metal dedicated to ceeial bodies whose virtue one intends to procure to himself i say of rings in whose cavity is fastened a stone and under it an herb of a sympathy with the same star trallianus gordonius mesue and many others do report that the virtue thereof is to rejoice the heart and to expel diseases  gyges a king of lydia got a stone taken out of the head of a dragon enclosed in his ring which when he turned to the palm of his hand he could be seen of none but he himself could see every one whence the proverb gygis annulus by the help of this ring it is said he flew candaules and committed adultery with his wife alexander trallianus tells us that the image of hercules strangling a lion set in a ring cures the cholick the philosopher eudaemus is said to have prepared rings against stingings of serpents charms and diseases josephus in his antiquities reports to have seen in the presence of the emperor vespasianus one eleazar a jew apply to the nose of one possessed with a demon a ring under the seal of which was laid a root found by solomon and that this eleazar did draw out of the nose the demon who immediately falling on the ground was banished by him upon reciting solomons conjuring hymn against demons the same does tell us that solomon has been very skilful in magicks and that moses the lawgiver of the jews did begin to learn magicks in egypt where he made rings of love and forgetfulness the ring of forgetfulness he gave to the egyptian women to forget him which caused his free returning from egypt this was not performed by the help of prohibited magic as apollonius and lysimachus have taxed moses with and therefore been refuted by the said josephus but by the help of a thorough knowledge of the celestial and sublunar beings their destination and virtues and it is known that empedocles pythagoras democritus and plato himself learned magicks from the egyptian priests  it is therefore not generous to call entirely in question all cures performed by characters graven images tied to the neck etc because their operation is natural and performed by the wonderful influence of the celestial bodies agreeing with our bodies it is not reasonable entirely to deny credit to what our ancestors diligent searchers in natures closet have left to posterity in respect of characters and seals wrought at certain times according to the virtue and influence of the bodies above us without any superstition which is framed only by the ignorance of this mystery without any profanation or offense to the name of god and without any violation of faith or religion that this useful knowledge has in aftertimes been so very much hidden and seems at this day almost entirely lost can be ascribed to no other reason but to the misuse of these characters men falling to superstition and not understanding the reason of their working did attribute more to them than our creator had granted and intended to discover thereby i am very far off to attribute to these images a virtue in themselves nor do i affirm that characters or names graven under constellations have a virtue by reason of the figure because the figure number bigness situation and the solution of what is continual are no principles of actions i would entirely deny their virtue in case there were nothing else acting or moving by whose authority characters are powerful i have been obliged to enlarge upon this subject for reason to make appear what is true it being the perfection of our understanding and to show what difference there is between true and physical signaturae and superstitious and unlawful ones which for contemplationsake we may know but nowhere but in practice there is no virtue in heaven and earth which has not its offspring from god also medicines are visible to the body words invisible to the body now if herbs or words are curing the cause is notwithstanding in god therefore the herb itself is not the medicine but it is hidden in it invisibly by god it shows a great deal of ignorance to condemn or to deride things remote or distant from our senses and not fit to be comprehended by them who is not astonished at the wonderful effects of precious stones nevertheless we cannot deny that there is a great natural power in them chiefly when under certain constellations certain figures and signatures are graved therein it is false what some report that the effects of precious stones are produced by a magical virtue and not by a natural one it proceeds from the school of magicians who used precious stones graven under certain constellations for a pretext of their enchantments it is sufficiently known that an emerald gets loose from the finger at the death of the person it is worn by and that a stone which comes from new spain known by the name of lapis nephriticus is of great efficacy against the stone in the kidneys if but bound to ones arm who does not admire the virtues of a turquois and an infinite number of experiments made with precious stones as well as herbs could be quoted which if they do not everywhere and not always answer nevertheless do not deserve to be called in question because not every thing does everywhere and always concur and the rarity or singularity of effects does never take away the cause in nature for wonderful things in nature are performed by a due application of actives to passives hereunto disposed so closely and so secretly that the cause thereof seems exceedingly remote or distant it is outrageous to ascribe every thing immediately to the works of beelzebub which are remote from our senses as if a hidden virtue in nature the instrument of the divine power was not able to produce many wonderful things without the assistance of this prince of evil spirits it is likewise outrageous in such who entirely given to superstition either out of ignorance or out of a foolish doubtfulness maintain the most evident things to proceed from hidden causes who besides the color and taste ascribe no other virtues to plants as if a particular concord or agreement between them and something above us was not capable to produce besides their first sensual virtues some hidden ones witness the daily experience i take it therefore to be very indiscreet to assign in singular facts no other cause than what seems to us to be for who can deny that either by some inspiration or by chance and mere accidents effects are produced semblable to natural ones and it is sufficient for one who understands or sets out the causes of things natural to have showed such a semblable effect to be the effect of natural causes either always or for the most part and though the event does not always answer nevertheless the power and motion in nature is not to be denied because all causes for producing one effect do seldom concur which is to be seen in things which for reason of their fewness variety and singularity are considered as miracles and prodigies for these things have natural causes but they are seldom disposed or ready for the like effects if therefore the effect is natural the cause must be the same and also contrariwise now the effects of images graven under the constellation of certain celestial bodies are natural consequently the cause thereof must likewise be natural and though this cause is hidden and hard to be understood and very remote from our outward senses nevertheless there is no occasion to have recourse to a diabolical power but we ought attentively to consider by what help and by what concurrence of causes such an effect is produced or not produced and we ought rather to take an opportunity from these mavelous causes and the natural effects produced by them to acknowledge and to proclaim the wonderful power of god who having evidently implanted such mavelous virtues in nature how wonderful must he appear in things entirely hidden from us  having sent this before i proceed to the seals themselves the image of jupiter is graved in a white or clear stone or pure silver or pewter for procuring a healthful life honor and riches  the image

a stone of the nature of saturn it will make him who wears it powerful with a continual increase of power  the image of jupiter is a man sitting on a throne or chair with four feet having in one hand a rod and in the other a globe and at his feet an eagle but the doctors of magicks form it otherwise viz the figure of a man with a rams head withered heels and a little breast which being graved in a stone chiefly in one called krabatus is to make him who wears it fortunate beloved and respected by religious people and to raise him to honor and dignity  the image of mars is diversely figured sometimes with a banner or flag in his hand sometimes with a lance or any other warlike instrument but always armed and sometimes on horseback the virtue of a stone wherein such a figure is graved is

moon with horns sometimes in a chariot as a girl with a quiver of arrows with dogs persecuting a stag the virtue of this image is to cause success in expeditions honor and wealth a celerity and facility in all undertakings and the bringing of every thing to the desired end but it ought to be observed that the planet whose image you intend to have graved and set in a convenient ring is to be well disposed that is to say not burnt retrograde oppressed or touched by malignant beams but he ought to be in a good place either toward the east or the middle of the firmament agreeing with jupiter or venus otherwise your image or seal will be of no signification  for procuring love you make use of favorable aspects and for provoking hatred of averse or unfavourable ones the image of saturn is therefore to be graved when it exists in capricorn or aquarius of jupiter in sagittarius or pisces of mars in aries and scorpio of sol in leo of venus in taurus and libra of mercury in gemini and virgo luna in cancer also the image of leo or cancer is to be graved or set in a ring when sol is going through leo and luna through cancer but also that both of them be free from all impediments chiefly from the beams of saturn or mars it is to be observed that each sign as long as sol is in it is strong and rules over the others consequently is of a more prevailing virtue and more to be perceived than the others you ought therefore always to direct the planet to the place that is to say the sign face and degree which sol does illustrate  so much of magical images of the ancient sophi which i have inserted chiefly for reason to demonstrate thereby that these as well as many more which could be mentioned were founded upon nothing else than magical philosophy that is to say upon the principles of a true and natural magic though i do not deny that superstition has creepd into a good many of them  usus habet laudem crimen abusus habet the same is to be said of thin plates of gold and silver round square or triangular wherein characters and signatures are ingravd under certain constellations according to the desire one has to procure to himself the favor and the influence of some planets and it is sufficiently known that such plates being duly wrought and prepared and hanged about the neck or born about have a virtue and power against some evil but it is exactly to be observed that the planet whose influence is desired be at the time of the graving strong and fortunate that is to say in a proper house exaltation eastward or in the middle of the firmament free from the malignant beams of saturn or mars supported by venus or jupiter or joined by them direct swift in his course not burnt etc  but why and wherefore rings images and figures graved in certain metals and stones have the virtues i have recited is a question not to be decided by the temperament or manifest qualities nor is it to be assigned to the substance itself but to a heavenly and magical one that is to say to a superior and mo re sublime cause which some not unfitly have called a spiritual vehicle and bond by the help of it body and soul substance very distant and remote from one another are joined and by the intervention or intercession of this vehicle the loadstone draws iron unto it and cichoreum follows the motion of the sun  not every philosophical demonstration is to be taken from the senses and qualities a manifest proof thereof is in the color of a white rose from whence does its color proceed if you ascribe the cause thereof to a colder temperament what will you say of the red one a kind of intybus gives a milky juice which you ascribe to a cold quality but what will you say of tithymalus a herb called sealettice wolfesmilk or milkthistle which gives likewise a milky juice and is hot enough the bitterness of aloe you say does proceed because it is of a hot nature but opium which kills by its pernicious coldness has likewise a great bitterness it is in vain to ascribe every thing to the manifest qualities scalciger calls it a great impudence and shows the insufficiency of such reasons only in the several kinds of poisons  thus far we have considered the principles and causes of marvelous and hidden actions in nature it remains now to make an application of these principles to the method of curing wounds i am going to publish  i believe every body is convinced by what i have said that plants roots stones metals the spirit and celestial signs are by a divine law as it were partaking and conspiring together seemingly for no other reason than as plato says because to each species is a peculiar celestial sign like the pole to the loadstone by our creator consecrated and dedicated also that each plant each metal and each precious stone is of a sympathy with a certain star or celestial sign but the more sublime this position is the farther we are to go back to the beginning and the more diligent search we are to make therein we do all agree that heaven and every thing has been immediately created by god and that every thing has received and does keep its virtue as well for preserving itself as for bringing forth its like because god who ever works by the most compendious way has after having given every things its particular virtue appointed the heavens for the farther continual working thereby now as the seed is endued with a vital power which prepares disposes and makes fit the matter for bringing forth its like also that at all times it may receive and draw unto itself that animating and spiritual power from heaven which is the very cause of the support of all what is created we may say that the seed furnishes the matter and heaven puts on the form also a man does beget a man the man by virtue of the seed procures and brings together the apparel and is causa proxima the spirit and the warmth which is in the seed prepares the matter of the seed first it causes a mingling and tempering together consonant to each signal part which is to be made thereof and then it gives the structure conformity and posture lastly it diffuseth itself through all the parts and abides therein as a ruler and refuses to forsake what it has tempered formed and composed the other efficient cause of a mans being and indeed the first and principal one is which gives a species form or shape to this single prepared matter which is heaven for the species of things are cast in by heaven and not by the matter itself  the sayings of the ancients deum per naturas esse divisum and deorum plena esse omnia are to be understood that the virtue received and infused by god remains in every thing that a godly virtue is in every thing by whose power every thing comes forth but otherwise in heaven and otherwise in things which are not able to bear up themselves in such it is more obscure but in heaven more evident and more excellent to the generation of things what therefore god has created in heaven and earth is entirely maintained and ruled by him the celestial ones immediately by himself and the terrestrial ones by the subordination of the heavens appointed for the procreation and conservation of all sublunary beings the species forms or shapes of all living creatures roots stones and metals which ever have been or can be are compassed by the power heaven is endued with which being big as it were with an innumerable number of species or forms ingenders every thing and by this way one power and faculty has in itself the virtues of all the bodies below heaven therefore produces without seed many things but no seed is able to bring forth any thing without heaven but it being duly prepared and set in order heaven casts into it its species and perfection it raises up life in every thing by the interceding of the bright universal spirit for this is the carrier between heaven and earth diffused throughout the whole universe who communicates to all and every thing at one and the same time its species and native vital heat accommodated to its ingendring it is he who does contain every thing and does cherish it with heat and life through his power and help things without life do subsist and animate things have a soul according to each kind a nourishing one some have a sensual one and some a soul endued with or partaking of reason but this power descending from heaven does accommodate itself to every thing it serves each one with as much as its nature desires and never gives more than the condition of each subject can bear neither is this virtue always like unto itself nor does it always and in the same manner exhibit itself to every thing but variousty according to the station of the stars and their different casting forth of beams who for the most part do vary very much though this carrier i say this universal spirit is always the same and of a not changing substance  it is therefore not likely as some think that this spirit of the world can impart to every thing life and form without being in want of the assistance of the celestial bodies or the stars for if this was possible he would engender always the like in one and the same way that is to say in the same measure and perpetually for he carries with him a vital soul and nature itself and makes lively all what he enters but all this according to the nature condition disposition and preparation of each subject  it being evident by what i have said that the celestial bodies do concur to the procreation and preservation of all things and that all parts of the world do cleave or are joined together or embrace one another by this common carrier the universal spirit being of a middling substance between heaven and the sublunar beings and that there is no one thing in the world so abject upon which this spirit does not bestow some virtue and quality with which it is infused by heaven and the celestial bodies that as this spirit meddleth with the bringing forth of all things every thing must be comprehended in it i say as all this is evident by what i have advanced who can doubt of the possibility of curing wounds without applying any remedy only by anointing the instrument wherewith such a wound is made or who can deny that such cures are natural certainly they can be demonstrated out of the very principles of nature itself and who denies it is either ignorant thereof or thinks proper to measure every thing with his senses for these cures are performed merely by nature and a magnetical power drawing attractio and conveying deductio the influence of celestial bodies working by the elements and this so often mentioned carrier the universal spirit who as the mean bond induces from proper constellations a sympathy knitting together or convenience as tully says out of which next a healing virtue is derived to the instrument from whence afterward it goes out and is continued and conveyed to the wounded part lastly by the action of this spiritual virtue the effect ensues for between the wound and the instrument is a magnetical drawing and conveying power attractrix and deductrix the first tends to the part afflicted or the wound that is to say the drawing attractio goes to the wounded part and the conveying of the virtue deductio to the instrument anointed  but there is objected that the space coming between the time and place does hinder this conveying or healing and that nothing can act beyond its limited space moreover that it is necessary the body to be healed should be touched by that which is to heal and properly touching cannot be said but of things whose extremities or ends meet together now such a touching does not happen between the wound and the instrument anointed consequently no cure can be performed  nobody will argue in this manner but sensual philosophers but it is very easy to confute their arguments who knows not that many things act at a distance whose outsides or superficies can never be joined and notwithstanding they meet together viz the sun and a mans body though their superficies can never be joined together nevertheless the beams being between actually do join them for no natural actives can act in extremum before acting in medium because every physical or natural action is performed by touching the sun warmeth the inferior world by the orb of the moon though it never touches it nor warmeth the sphere of the moon also all bodies between which is a sympathy or antipathy mutually affect one another and work upon one another without any visible touching that is to say the virtue of one is carried to the other by the intervention or intercession of the universal spirit also that though the space is very great this virtue is nevertheless not altered nor dispersed by winds nor dissolved by a cold and moist air but by reason of its natural communion accord and bond preserved and continued  also in contagions bodies do not touch one another and in pestilential fevers many are infected who never come near sick people that is to say their extreme parts do not meet for the malignant and corrupt quality of these fevers defiles the bodies by propagating and diffusing itself and continuing therefore who communicates to another a disease needs not to touch him but the corrupt breath or vapors may be sent and hidden in garments and other things witness the daily experience and infect another many days after and though we cannot properly say that such an infected one has been touched by another nevertheless we can without doubt affirm that no disease can be communicated from one to another without a body that is to say they cannot be carried or conveyed without the intervention of a spiritual substance or humor it is therefore undeniable that there are many actions performed without a visible touching and that many bodies act upon one another mutually without meeting together by the touching of their bodies but of their virtues and this virtue which bodies make use of and put forth at a distance is a quality without a body wherein the whole power lies also the power issuing from this ointment does not spread itself out in the stone in iron or wood with which it has no affinity but propagateth itself to the wound by virtue of its mover  the first thing which moves in this ointment is the balsamic power hidden in the blood and in the moss which by the intervention of the spiritual bond is continued to the wound and except the distance is too great becomes one and the same with it by joining both forms i say they join because their forms do extend themselves and mutually meeting they unite together both what moves and what is moved becomes one either by an immediate application and joining of both superficies or the virtue of one is conveyed to the superficies consequently to the body of the other let it be done by light beams or any other hidden quality and spiritual touching therefore this ointment reaches the wound or is joined to the wound as an efficient power or as actives to passives or as a thing transmuting or altering to a body to be transmuted in the same manner heaven is joined to earth which nevertheless according to its superficies is not contiguous with it that is to say the extremities of heaven and earth do not touch one another  the vulgar physical canons are therefore not to be understood without exceptions viz that the extremities of actives and passives do always touch one another and that actives have no power upon passives except their superficial outsides or extremities touch together for the quality or the celestial and magnetical virtue by the help of this conveying spirit is in the ointment the cause and as it were the vehicle which being moved the thing to be carried is likewise moved in the vehicle is required that it may be apt for carrying and for carrying is nothing more apt than the celestial magnetical virtue which as it were intercedeth between the instrument and the wounded place moving and directing every thing for obtaining the desired effect for between this virtue and vehicle is first of all a sympathy which afterward is conveyed to the instrument from thence to the wound by reason of the familiarity and similitude for this is the efficient cause why things are wrapped and tied together therefore nobody can deny that there is a touching between the instrument and the wound though it is not performed immediately by joining the extremities together because there is no necessity for it in this mystery the principles which are acting in this case not being corporeal there is likewise no corporeal touching required the virtue is brought to the wound mediately by interceding as i have often repeated of a more sublime and incorporeal power which the doctors of natural magicks have called a magnetical one  it remains nothing but to give a description of the ointment wherewith magnetical cures of wounds without pains and without an immediate application of any remedy are performed baptista porta gives a description of some such composition and introduces paracelsus for its author but this composition is very defective as every body may see by comparing it to the following besides it has been contradicted by many that paracelsus could be the author thereof which joined to the credulity wherewith the said porta has collected and published a great many compositions nothing at all to be depended upon gives room to believe that he was unable to assure the veracity of his description by any other means than by introducing paracelsus for its author i believe therefore the following description will be the more acceptable as by long experience of different persons it has been found to answer the end for which it is designed  the description is as follows viz  of sanicle lat sanicula which is spotted and has the signature of the lungs  of bugle lat consolida media buglum bugla bugula both being gathered fresh and dried in the shade and afterward made to powder you take of each one ounce  oil of linseed  turpentine  armeniac bolus of each two drachms  human fat four ounces  genuine mummy  human blood being yet warm  of the moss which grows upon the skull of a man being hanged and left hanging of each one ounce  all being well mixed in a mortar must be kept close in a glass or earthen vessel with a narrow neck being glazed within  the whole is to be made when the sun does exist in libra but the moss is to be gathered when the moon increases and does exist in the house of venus if possible not in saturn or mars if you cannot expect the moons existing in the house of venus you are diligently to observe when luna is in the sign of pisces to gather the moss at that time because this sign is the most convenientest by reason of jupiters dwelling place and venuss exaltation the next after it is taurus and libra  by this ointment also prepared all manner of wounds given by instruments either pierced or stricken or blown are cured if only the instrument can be had but such wounds are excepted where the arteries or some of the principal members as the heart brains etc are hurted  the instrument with which the wound is made or in want thereof a piece of wood or a little bough of willow steeped in the bloody opening is to be plunged in the ointment and therein to be left the wounded person meanwhile has only to wash the wound daily once with his urine or fresh water and to cover it with a piece of clean linen always wiping away the filth and the wound will heal and consolidate without any pains if the instrument wherewith the wound is made cannot be had another instrument is to be steeped in the wound and after it is anointed on both sides with this instrument it is to be kept in a clean and temperate place because if it is exposed to the air or too much cold the wound will begin to smart it is likewise to be observed if the wound is made edgling or pointingly in the last case the instrument is to be anointed from the point toward the handle in the first from the edge toward the back and in all cases the instrument is diligently to be covered if it does not appear how deep the instrument has been in the wound all is to be anointed but if it appears only the part which was plunged in the wound  as for the moss growing upon the skull of a man being hanged it may seem to many to be a useless nicety and that perhaps any other though not grown upon the skull of a man hanged may do the same but the following reason with which i conclude may be given for why the last has a preference in the composition of this magnetical remedy the vital spirits of a man to be strangled by reason of the presence of his unhappy chance do retire to the head and brains and the violent constriction hinders their going back to their principles they remain also there and mingle and are confounded with the spirits and the balsam of the head and brains and though all animal functions do cease nevertheless there remains a certain heat or warmness in the bones nerves and the other similar parts which is in stones and in pepper that is to say an elemental one now after this mixture and through the help of this heat and the joint working of a heavenly influence moss like a vegetable growing upon the skull of a man being hanged must needs be of a greater force than such as grows upon the head of another who died of some disease  finis
