the power of gold displayed in the humane proposal of the right hon william pit chancellor of the exchequer  to bring forward  an act to put his majesty into the disagreeable situation of signing a decree that no sick or lame person or diseased cattle in great britain shall have a medicine of repute without paying tribute which the writer contends is not justifiable either by the law of god or man and is a disgraceful impost as it places the life of a human being in competition with a threepenny or sixpenny stamp etc  by frs spilsbury  it is the cause of humanity i plead  london sold at the dispensary soho square  price  d   entered at stationers hall  to the booksellers of great britain who had imposed on the public stamps with the common medicines only through fear of an exchequer threat gentlemen is there occasion to address myself once more on this mournful subject to persuade you to act as men endowed with reason as citizens of a free country blessed with the name of britons survey your fetters woven by imaginary power rivetted by terror which have disgraced yourselves and reflect no credit either on your king or country the barons of the exchequer the guardians of constitutional freedom are now your friends they have declared from the bench of justice no such acts as the medicine act is which operates only by fear in a partial manner on the subject contrary to the dictates of reason justice and humanity founded on no decree of the legislature ought to exist in this land at the same time they observed the more they read the act the less they understood it and with alacrity granted messrs wray a new trial who had been found guilty of the heinous crimes of selling two tooth brushes with tooth powder  gentlemen have i not reason to rejoice have i not reason to triumph who at the first commencement of this ambiguous illshapen act opposed its monstrous stride and whose leviathan maw was only to be satiated with all that a man or a minister of state should hold worth preserving viz the honor of his king the liberty of the subject the dignity of his country for these have i pleaded for these have i braved danger in my tracts advice to booksellers discursory thoughts etc how could you ye men of books sacrifice to fear your known good opinion of your monarch how could you believe his royal heart delighted to add distress to misery what have you observed in your king to credit the disgraceful story a king signing an act that when his subject was bit by a mad dog it demanded a tribute from the terrified sufferer or no medicine to heal his wound or that his majestys finances were so reduced as to oblige him to countenance an edict which bows to the prostitute in pleasing view by her that baneful curse of health shall spread its poignant sting which demands inevitably the swift aid of medicine fettered with a stamp would rome have thus chid her sons who had indiscreetly sacrificed to natures laws no  it is only at a stamp office where hamans fell principles in epitome are remembered can you reconcile to your minds a king and such a paternal king as ours is blessed with a queen an amiable queen whom even slander never whispered surmise of ill could her king and our monarch sign so ungracious an act which wrests a tax from the helpless female servant because the imbecility of her sex demands the friendly aid of medicine at certain times it is not possible can a king take against his own subjects and exult in their misery is royalty a bar to disease will fevers gout dropsy consumption evil leprosy stone cholic stand at a distance nor dare invade the palace then may we suppose that kings feel not as common men is it not enough for human nature to bear the ills which sickness disease or accidents create without being tortured by forward cruel servants of the crown who to gratify the lust of power trample on all laws human and divine whilst they reprobate a highwaymans proceedings they act on the same principle only diversified in the application for have not servants of the crown demanded of you by threats to act contrary to the constitution of this country which militated against yourselves and aggrandized your neighbor which must transfer your business to another shop where no crossed stamp marked the threshold who would have credited the report should it have been foretold that ministers of this country would have insisted on their servants to go round the kingdom with the exchequer cudgel in their hand and threaten booksellers to commit an act which human nature revolts at to refuse a woman in labor a cheap medicine to ease her pains without paying for a stamp let her die first is the language of the stamp office or well exchequer you again find a parallel in any history state or country of the following impost i challenge all the antiquarians of the age to do it a tax proclaim not the disgraceful badge which the officers of the crown of great britain have demanded in the kings name on a pot of ointment to cure the itch and insisted the polluted outcast wretch though scarce clothes to cover his nakedness should pay threepence for a stamp or his disease should worry him to death or what would turn to a better profit for the stamp office he might infect other persons and then joyful sound more stamps would be disposed of  these are the decrees formed under the construction of the kings stamp office are these deeds proper to be ranged in the historians page as acts of george the iiid why then not procure a law that whatever person is shipwrecked on your coast he shall take so many stamps or those persons who have their houses burnt down they shall be obliged to buy your paper currency id est stamps these acts ministers may say are disgraceful and no nation but an abandoned one would enact them are they so not more than the imaginary medicine act which is so pious so loyally construed for the honor and interest of the king and he that will not gulp the creed down is flagelated with the exchequer scourge to urge the bookseller to be upon the watch where if he sees a fellow creature fall from his horse and bruise himself the unfortunate person must purchase a stamp before he can receive a medicine to sooth his pain can there be to britons i appeal a more humiliating disgraceful circumstance in this country than to see a set of loyal subjects pointed at by a malignant partiality founded in a jealous surmise harrassed by the stamp office under the shadow of an act of parliament to commit actions which are almost as unnatural as if they were required to sell their children yet no act of parliament exists which will warrant such encroachments on the subject for the dignity of human nature for the honor of my king and country i have pleaded and opposed these arbitrary unjustifiable deeds which heretofore were never countenanced in this or any other free country  who will join issue and say such heavy imposts torn from the sick the lame the diseased part of the community are to be countenanced in this christian land not the house of commons not the house of lords not his majesty nor even the hon wm pit chancellor of the exchequer whose great power stands unrivalled witness britons wearing a stamp on their heads then if there is no act of legislature to justify these shameful pilfering depredations from the people why does a minister withhold his protection one sessions after another from a set of men only sufferers because they are loyal because they are conscientious men because they are fearful to contend with government is it for the honor of a minister to sport his strength with the man unarmed by power naked as to riches and whom he can terrify with the anathema wrote in exchequer form in like manner as the approach of a wolf spreads terror to the flock do ministers of the crown expect the people to act virtuously to live honestly to possess integrity let ministers look at the medicine act there they will see oppression stalk with gigantic stride treading on the liberty of the subject laughing at justice and sacrificing humanity to malignancy and avarice why will ministers of state form such crippled paths for the inferior ranks of mankind to walk on why will not the rulers of the nation when they find errors in their acts of parliament show a readiness to correct them for interest they will do it has then honor nor justice no claim to attention is it not ye guardians of the land a sore affliction to the owner of cattle to hear his beast low with pain is that beast or is an infant dying with disease an object of taxation i only ask the question are they fit objects for sport if they are throw off the mask enact a law that every person shall consume a stamp between his bread and butter every morning or that the people inhabiting great britain shall be bled four times a year or take a stamp these laws these acts would be more honorable more equitable than your proceedings on the medicine act where you doom a fellow creature to death rather than lose selling a stamp with a common medicine conveyed by a bookseller although no act of legislature exists to justify such proceedings to tax quacks or any other titulary traders if hurtful to the community i am not concerned but when i observe his majestys honorable commissioners of the stamp office breathing a language instead of villainous deceitful quack it is now dear brother good creature sell your medicines sell your stuff sell your poisons or what you will only sell our stamps when i hear that men in so honorable a station send their emissaries round the country insisting on booksellers taking out a five shilling license on pain of being exchequered and oblige them to sell stamps and say you are the persons government meant to tax as we construe it so and so and at the same time let a next door neighbor sell without stamps the same commodity can a person unless he is lost to all seeling which adorns the soul do less than reprobate such actions which disgrace man mar the beauty of our constitution and render our monarch the object of pity reflection awake not lest thou bring to remembrance what this country was a few years back when the people paid their taxes as cheerful as one who gives his corn to be ground and received flour in return but now our corn is demanded and bran is thought a sufficient recompense  in former administrations justice and humanity adorned our superiors councils but now an avaricious deceitful principle sways the officers of the crown who luxuriously bask in the thought of the vast wedges of gold which are produced from scraps of paper forgetting that the gold is wrung from their own bankers the people the strength of the nation for this country at this present moment is fast consuming its vital principle on which its very existence as a state depends and a little time will loudly proclaim the deep decline of this once flourishing empire  n b the foregoing letter was partly printed when i read the medicine act was to be cancelled and a new one introduced of a more extensive nature by the right hon william pit chancellor of the exchequer in all my strictures on the act i never dictated what i thought was proper to be done on the occasion being persuaded whenever the medicine act came to be discussed it would at once appear with such a horrid aspect that no minister nor no other person who had retained the principles of honor and humanity would patronize the act in any shape  the new medicine act considered as now substituted in the house of commons july        by the new proposed bill as stated in the public prints i observe the medicine act is to be equalized the rich as well as the poor are to swallow stamps with their medicines without exceptions so far this may be thought just does it alter the principles of the act reconcile it to your minds you who consider medicines as only articles fit for traffic i abhor the act a tax on medicines is but a title but it has an object as a warrant has which ends with an order for the execution of a fellow creature does it militate against pleasure no  luxury no  or healthy persons no it is an act which eyes the sink of corruption settled in the limb of a fellow creature gladdens in the reverberated sound of distress achs pains and groans are music to the spirit of the act they are its very life illness or disease are its proper food for what is an act to raise specie without it is made productive frequent alarms of the people being in danger of fevers may be raised and the usual time of quarantine dispensed with that the plague may spread its baneful insluence the wells of water contaminated then men women and children will be seen in the streets grasping medicines most gorgeously decorated with stamps whilst the table of the illustrious supporters of this most amiable christian device shall smoke with the fat of venison and rich viands grace the board equal to the lordly despots  to those who judge of these matters by what quantity of bullion this act produces this act will not want for embellishing titles any more than the marble monument a polish to render it pleasing to the sight which covers a rotten carcass call the medicine act by what name you please i will protest against it it is armed with a sting against distress groaning under insupportable agony it is a brutal act  a brutal act did i say  from whence borrowed we that idea  do brutes prey on the same denominated race  will lions welter in the blood of lions no  will a tiger seek a tiger to mangle his limbs for food no  whence then the term brutal  beast acts toward beast agreeable to the laws of nature it is only man who feeds on man who talks of reformation of more refined notions yet this man arrayed in scarlet or in purple does not always remember the dignity of his station but ferrits tortures nay for interest  devours his fellow creature then which deserves the epithet of brute most man or beast  such a proposed medicine act no heathen jew or mohammedan minister was ever recorded to have even brooded such a detested thought of much more dare stand up in a collective assembly to propose to force a tribute from women with child children afflicted with the smallpox colds sore throats convulsions and from men afflicted with ulcerated legs from whence purulent matter ouzes in hot steams so virulent as to scald the seeming sound part of the skin or with other maladies which our tinder constitutions are likely to catch even from the air we breathe in this glorious discovery this friendly act of commisseration which is to act as the salvator of the nation verging on bankruptcy a christian claims the honor not a professor of the roman catholic religion no a purer one than that the reformed one a protestant of the church of england who will credit the story does a minister of great britain will they say think to impose on the kings understanding and cloud his sensibility with golden arguments to sign the decree against his doleful subjects who stand in need of all the protection either care or power can bestow that like a ship which has been tossed by cross winds and storms puts into port to fit it once more to combat the boisterous wave they become renovated so as to pursue the course of life  let foreign nations whom yet humanity blesses reject the report with scorn as when a traveller relates he saw a lamb forsake the grass and feed on vultures prey if fame in pity to britannia refuses to sound avarices triumph let truth declare last week the senators of great britain met where it was proposed in parliament under the sanction of a medicine tax to raise supplies from a spoil extorted from his majestys most piteous unfortunate subjects stretched on the tenterhook of pain tormented with diseases which terrify the poor or rich wretch worse than any torments hell can inflict as far as we know or have a right to think  harsh and ungenerous would be the sojourners surmise whom night had overtaken in a lonely place should he find a hospitable roof where himself and beast are bade a hearty welcome expressed by officious care should he imagine all this courteous kindness was but a prelude to some horrid purpose when fast in sleep his outward sentinels are locked yet thus ungrateful man often judges of his creators bounty ere he sheds the encumbered mantle how will he smile at his childish fears when robing with immortality whilst experimentally he feels the attributes of a god  a tax on illness  set dogs to gnaw a human creature bears no comparison to those pains mankind feel when thus diseased for dogs lead to mercy in their gripe they introduce that blessed friend death the great deliverer from oppression tyranny disease and misery  who can behold even a dog in pain that can avoid pity if he cannot relieve but to see officers of the crown harrassing a fellow creature worried with the evil with a cancerous gashing wound with a scald head a human body covered with ulcers stinking most disgustfully horrible detested by its inmate the soul chained to so vile a pestilential body which is shunned by society and whose corrupted form breathes poisonous vapors which petrify the man by profession bred a champion in natures cause  walking familiar with disease yet here pauses and shrinks from power so dreadfully armed is a sorry sight whilst from such diseased objects and from diseased cattle a minister of state with as much composure as a ratcatcher kills vermin meditated an act of parliament which would pointedly militate against the welfare of the human and brute creation loaded with insupportable infirmities for he enacted that medicines of established reputation which were administered either by outward or inward application should not be applied unless they gave a stipulated sum for a piece of paper  what is this decree but a secondary one to nebuchadnezzars which threatened death to those who did not bow to the idol of gold yet this medicine act under the dispensation of the gospel is far more cruel does christian power act here like a samaritan to pour oil into the wound how reversed does it act like the levite and priest who are held up by the savior of the world as men actuated by selfish principles void of compassion no  the priest and the levite if they did not relieve the wounded man were not as yet such hardened monsters as to take advantage of his distress formerly kings of albion delighted to act the physicians part and invested the unhappy mortal afflicted with the evil with a piece of gold heaven sanctified the deed now a minister urges his majesty to levy on his own diseased subject a piece of money or neither he nor yet his beast if ill shall be entitled to the general benefits of medicine heavens gift which by providence was designed to be as free for all natures children as the air we breathe or the water of the earth the wretch who taxes one would could his unhumanized soul find means curse the other with his official breath  for lucre  the medicine act whilst in debate is the ministers but when the king signs the mandate it is then clothed with royalty it speaks majestic and awes the subject to compliance with tremendous voice the inhabitants of great britain must hear a king speak to his officers of state agreeable to the act let no one of my subjects who are grievously tormented with pains mortifications gangrene wounds fluxes and other deadly diseases have certain medicines they desire unless they pay a tribute on pain of my displeasure and the heavy penalties the act prescribes  is not this a fair delineation of the intended act  divines say bad thoughts and diabolical actions originate below from whence we pretend to borrow colors to paint an infernal scene but the original design i am inclined to think is too often borrowed from earth  suppose a minister should have power to persuade the king to approve of the edict  what is this edict man may style it a medicine act but i call it a redemptory act  what says the act pay a tribute or no medicine woe to the man who dares let any person have a medicinal packet without a stamp here is your redemption or rather a passport to show you have the kings leave  to live  courteous royal bequest  what wonderful condescension is not this the true explanation and intent of the act fabricated in this once truly honored island the envy of all foreign powers rather than thus inflict the sickly diseased subject i ask the minister i ask the rt hon william pit whether it would not redound more to his honor as a man as minister of collossian power to send round a party of guards to the healthy persons and demand of them to give sixpence for the emblazoned paper or put them to death rather than go to the sick man expiring with disease tormented with ulcers and carious bones and insist on his taking the official stamps by which the gold already produced being sufficient to turn any ministers brain he imagines he is in character of the kings huntsman head over the hounds hunting deer instead of his majestys people  what sentiments do ministers imbibe by attending a kings throne is the life of a briton to be put in competition with a threepenny sixpenny or a one shilling stamp britons there was a time you were not held so cheap but now if no stamp at hand no medicine or perhaps the needy shopkeeper may have a stamp which may be turned to money sells an old decayed medicine which buys a loaf to feed a famished child whilst the parent of a worthy family falls a sacrifice to the degenerate humanity of ministers who enjoined a medicine to be embalmed in red stripes true emblem of the merciless act  wherewithal shall a minister find a charm to fascinate a king to sign an act which inadvertently may cost hundreds of his subjects their lives  of what materials do ministers suppose our sovereign is composed of  has not his majesty amiable fair daughters  are they not women  are they not princely flowers nursed with peculiar state  yet all the care art and nature can bestow sometimes those pretty plants will droop nay die  if pain attacks them does their royal birth fortify them to be indifferent as to the effects or consequences  they are attended in stately forms physic arrayed in pomp do the courts of princes make the power of physicians equal to the desires and the necessities of their royal patients suppose they do what are the thousands of females who reside in the inferior walk of life to do who cannot afford to charm the dispenser of health to visit them  reason and experience hint a cheap remedy which may shorten their pains and restore them to health how horrid the idea ye servants of the crown to take advantage of the frailties of the semale sex not brought on by choice by accident or by remissness to raise a revenue is it not sporting with the great creator who ordained these causes for most important ends which none but fools would mention but with solemnity but to raise money under pretense of supporting the honor of a king and the dignity of the nation by such means who would suggest and countenance  to apologize for such a noxious act specious reasons will not be wanted money may be the ministers plea for such an unprecedented step it may bring in thousands of pounds to the treasury let it bring in more gold than all the nations worth not all the gold which earth can produce can wipe away the stain  great britain bartering honor and humanity for gold  let ministers use all the art they are masters of to harmonise the canibal deed which muzzles the noble science of physic and proclaims in tyrannical accents to the sick you shall swallow our stamps or linger under your disease i trust this unexampled mode of taxation will not find patrons in the house of lords  the right hon mr pit may plead he only corrects the medicine act first formed by lord john cavendish against the five patent medicines but now extends it to all medicines pharmaceutical ones excepted is this justice why tax one medicine more than another because the one has gone through an expensive trial before it has gained universal approbation to stamp its credit as the best remedy we can ascertain for such and such complaints or for a better reason because ye know the afflicted will as regularly turn to the advertised medicine for redress as the cattle go to the river to quench their thirst when the usual fountain ceases to relieve their wants is that mr pitts excuse let him enjoy it let him turn his thoughts to that stately monument in westminster abbey reared by national gratitude to the earl of chatham whereon is inscribed under whose administration divine providence exalted great britain to an height of prosperity and glory unknown to any former age and let this question be asked him if it would be agreeable to his feelings as a minister to the love he bears his country to his zeal for the kings honor to let the sculptor add the son of this illustrious nobleman who was prime minister proposed to his sovereign      to raise a subsidy under the tenor of a medicine act from the inhabitants of great britain who were afflicted with the itch stone gout leprosy ulcers weak eyes sore throats diseased cattle and other complaints of a nature too bad to describe in this sanctuary this second inscription which points to the lamentable changes of state maxims and affairs is a memento of the sudden transition of worldly grandeur  if the right hon mr pit is not the proposer chief patron and engineer  who raises on this occasion this unnatural barrier in the afflicteds road who wish to gain a little ease a small respite before they are numbered with the dead  i do most respectfully beg his pardon for introducing any idea that may appear personal  the reviewers have said i am warm on the occasion happy should i be could i find a friend to prove the medicine act bowed only to reason and good policy not swayed by lucre at first the plea was the dart was levied at quacks a supposed nefarious unprincipled set of beings was that the case how poor how abject a minister would render his monarch to persuade him to become their patron a nominal sharer of the spoil is not this to a witness a god kissing carrion to heaven i appeal i had rather see all quackery or what you please to call it banished from the land than live to see a british state dependent on such vile prostitution to support its existence as a kingdom  may heaven preserve our king in health although his majesty should be constrained by looking through false mediums to extort a tax from an unfortunate yet loyal subject because through accident he may be bit by a mad dog or infected with some dangerous loathsome disease  dispensary soho square july         francis spilsbury  postscript the proposed medicine act i have read perhaps it may now lay before that venerable truly honorable house of lords for their consideration either to countenance or reject  cool and dispassionate as if now before their lordships i solemnly declare in my humble opinion the medicine act as now engrossed cannot with propriety be complied with it requires moral impossibilities and has many absurdities let it be tried by the penetration of wisdom it is an impolitic proposal it militates powerfully against the interest of government and the life of the subject unhappy consequences will prove its baneful effects nor shall i wonder when a womans mind is agitated with the cries of her infant she seeks the usual remedy on these occasions and is told the king demands a tax for a stamp or no medicine your child may perish in astonishment she forgets the mother when she hears the monarch has forgot he is a father  drops her child insensibly and marks the earth with blood is there justice in the act  no  justice is violated the poor sick man is the glorious prize which this act drags in triumph  will benevolence patronize the deed  no  cruelty stands confessed mark the essence of the words the very criterion of the act to tax all medicinal nostrums which are used either to heal the human body by internal or external application when diseased heavens what a crime it is now deemed to endeavor to restore health the fountain of strength and beauty to the sons and daughters of the land rather say what a heart that man must have if man you can call him who could dictate these inimical wishes with a view to stamp them into a law let the prosecuted wretch who steals for bread plead this illustrious example of depravity in a higher power then let government put to death the victim and be satisfied he suffered justly in the sight of his maker reason and equity will declare him murdered will christianity adopt this maxim of taxation for one of her precepts  no  nor no other religion in the world nor can there be even a faint trace of any state nation or human being so unhappily divested of the feelings of humanity since the world began as the authors of this uncharitable mode of taxation what is this but engrafting the tenets of an inquisition on a british stock exact money or let a person remain in torture define it otherwise candor if you can inquisitors of spain would abhor the idea of adding distress to the afflicted for the sake of gain they would abjure such a doctrine as the one now proposed by the minister of great britain not to let a sick or lame or diseased person have a medicine to remedy his pain his complaint and render himself once more a useful member to society without paying a tribute what a language does this refined system of taxation display in this land boasting of a superlative degree of piety toward god it is an awful circumstance and a new phenomenon to behold the hand writing of a king acting partially to his innocent subjects first cut off from the general society of the world by illness now made the proposed objects of singular chastisement of their sovereign let britain talk no more of virtue honor valor humanity charity or whatever enobles man exalts a state or dignifies a king that scrawl indented on the parchment that hostile declaration against all diseased subjects or whatsoever preserves the human body from decay if enforced cancels all pretensions to greatness or whatsoever is praiseworthy  if the arguments of sensibility intimately connected with the distresses of mankind cannot prevail against the only strong irresistible plea a ministers salvo  the treasury wants food  then ye sick and diseased victims of power be composed ye shall on this occasion be honorably embalmed and most royally entombed  finis
