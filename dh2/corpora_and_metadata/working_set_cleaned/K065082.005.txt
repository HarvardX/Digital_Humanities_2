ambrose  first civil war against maximus  character administration and penance of theodosius  death of valentinian ii  second civil war against eugenius  death of theodosius the fame of gratian before he had accomplished the twentieth year of his age was equal to that of the most celebrated character and conduct of the emperor gratian a d          princes his gentle and amiable disposition endeared him to his private friends the graceful affability of his manners engaged the affection of the people the men of letters who enjoyed the liberality acknowledged the taste and eloquence of their sovereign his valor and dexterity in arms were equally applauded by the soldiers and the clergy considered the humble piety of gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues the victory of colmar had delivered the west from a formidable invasion and the grateful provinces of the east ascribed the merits of theodosius to the author of his greatness and of the public safety gratian survived those memorable events only four or five years but he survived his reputation and before he fell a victim to rebellion he had lost in a great measure the respect and confidence of the roman world  the remarkable alteration of his character or his defects conduct may not be imputed to the arts of flattery which had besieged the son of valentinian from his infancy nor to the headstrong passions which that gentle youth appears to have escaped a more attentive view of the life of gratian may perhaps suggest the true cause of the disappointment of the public hopes his apparent virtues instead of being the hardy productions of experience and adversity were the premature and artificial fruits of a royal education the anxious tenderness of his father was continually employed to bestow on him those advantages which he might perhaps esteem the more highly as he himself had been deprived of them and the most skilful masters of every science and of every art had labored to form the mind and body of the young prince valentinian was less attentive to the religion of his son since he entrusted the education of gratian to ausonius a professed pagan mem de lacademie des inscriptions tom xv p          the poetical fame of ausonius condemns the taste of his age  the knowledge which they painfully communicated was displayed with ostentation and celebrated with lavish praise his soft and tractable disposition received the fair impression of their judicious precepts and the absence of passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason his preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of ministers of state ausonius was successively promoted to the praetorian praefecture of italy a d     and of gaul a d     and was at length invested with the consulship a d     he expressed his gratitude in a servile and insipid piece of flattery actio gratiarum p          which has survived more worthy productions  and as they wisely dissembled their secret authority he seemed to act with firmness with propriety and with judgment on the most important occasions of his life and reign but the influence of this elaborate instruction did not penetrate beyond the surface and the skilful preceptors who so accurately guided the steps of their royal pupil could not infuse into his feeble and indolent character the vigorous and independent principle of action which renders the laborious pursuit of glory essentially necessary to the happiness and almost to the existence of the hero as soon as time and accident had removed those faithful counselors from the throne the emperor of the west insensibly descended to the level of his natural genius abandoned the reins of government to the ambitious hands which were stretched forwards to grasp them and amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications a public sale of favor and injustice was instituted both in the court and in the provinces by the worthless delegates of his power whose merit it was made sacrilege to question disputare de principali judicio non oportet sacrilegii enim instar est dubitare an is dignus sit quem elegerit imperator codex justinian l ix tit xxix leg   this convenient law was revived and promulgated after the death of gratian by the feeble court of milan  the conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and bishops ambrose composed for his instruction a theological treatise on the faith of the trinity and tillemont hist des empereurs tom v p         ascribes to the archbishop the merit of gratians intolerant laws  who procured an imperial edict to punish as a capital offense the violation the neglect or even the ignorance of the divine law qui divinae legis sanctitatem nesciendo omittunt aut negligendo violant et offendunt sacrilegium committunt codex justinian l ix tit xxix leg   theodosius indeed may claim his share in the merit of this comprehensive law  among the various arts which had exercised the youth of gratian he had applied himself with singular inclination and success to manage the horse to draw the bow and to dart the javelin and these qualifications which might be useful to a soldier were prostituted to the viler purposes of hunting large parks were enclosed for the imperial pleasures and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts and gratian neglected the duties and even the dignity of his rank to consume whole days in the vain display of his dexterity and boldness in the chase the pride and wish of the roman emperor to excel in an art in which he might be surpassed by the meanest of his slaves reminded the numerous spectators of the examples of nero and commodus but the chaste and temperate gratian was a stranger to their monstrous vices and his hands were stained only with the blood of animals ammianus xxxi  0 and the younger victor acknowledge the virtues of gratian and accuse or rather lament his degenerate taste the odious parallel of commodus is saved by licet incruentus and perhaps philostorgius l x c  0 and godefroy p     had guarded with some similar reserve the comparison of nero   the behavior of gratian which degraded his discontent of the roman troops a d     character in the eyes of mankind could not have disturbed the security of his reign if the army had not been provoked to resent their peculiar injuries as long as the young emperor was guided by the instructions of his masters he professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers many of his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp and the health the comforts the rewards the honors of his faithful troops appeared to be the object of his attentive concern but after gratian more freely indulged his prevailing taste for hunting and shooting he naturally connected himself with the most dexterous ministers of his favorite amusement a body of the alani was received into the military and domestic service of the palace and the admirable skill which they were accustomed to display in the unbounded plains of scythia was exercised on a more narrow theater in the parks and enclosures of gaul gratian admired the talents and customs of these favorite guards to whom alone he entrusted the defense of his person and as if he meant to insult the public opinion he frequently showed himself to the soldiers and people with the dress and arms the long bow the sounding quiver and the fur garments of a scythian warrior the unworthy spectacle of a roman prince who had renounced the dress and manners of his country filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation zosimus l iv p     and the younger victor ascribe the revolution to the favor of the alani and the discontent of the roman troops dum exercitum negligeret et paucos ex alanis quos ingenti auro ad se transtulerat anteferret veteri ac romano militi  even the germans so strong and formidable in the armies of the empire affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of the savages of the north who in the space of a few years had wandered from the banks of the volga to those of the seine a loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and garrisons of the west and as the mild indolence of gratian neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent the want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of fear but the subversion of an established government is always a work of some real and of much apparent difficulty and the throne of gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom law religion and the nice balance of the civil and military powers which had been established by the policy of constantine it is not very important to enquire from what causes the revolt of britain was produced accident is commonly the parent of disorder the seeds of rebellion happened to fall on a soil which was supposed to be more fruitful than any other in tyrants and usurpers britannia fertilis provincia tyrannorum is a memorable expression used by jerome in the pelagian controversy and variously tortured in the disputes of our national antiquaries the revolutions of the last age appeared to justify the image of the sublime bossuet cette isle plus orageuse que les mers qui lenvironment  the legions of that sequestered island had been long famous for a spirit of presumption and arrogance zosimus says of the british soldiers   and the name of maximus was revolt of maximus in britain proclaimed by the tumultuary but unanimous voice both of the soldiers and of the provincials the emperor or the rebel for his title was not yet ascertained by fortune was a native of spain the countryman the fellowsoldier and the rival of theodosius whose elevation he had not seen without some emotions of envy and resentment the events of his life had long since fixed him in britain and i should not be unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage which he is said to have contracted with the daughter of a wealthy lord of caernarvonshire helena the daughter of eudda her chapel may still be seen at caersegont now caernarvon cartes hist of england vol i p     from rowlands mona antiqua the prudent reader may not perhaps be satisfied with such welsh evidence  but this provincial rank might justly be considered as a state of exile and obscurity and if maximus had obtained any civil or military office he was not invested with the authority either of governor or general cambden vol i introduct p ci appoints him governor of britain and the father of our antiquities is followed as usual by his blind progeny pacatus and zosimus had taken some pains to prevent this error or fable and i shall protect myself by their decisive testimonies regali habitu exulem suum illi exules orbis induerunt in panegyr vet xii    and the greek historian still less equivocally  maximus  l iv p      his abilities and even his integrity are acknowledged by the partial writers of the age and the merit must indeed have been conspicuous that could extort such a confession in favor of the vanquished enemy of theodosius the discontent of maximus might incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign and to encourage perhaps without any views of ambition the murmurs of the troops but in the midst of the tumult he artfully or modestly refused to ascend the throne and some credit appears to have been given to his own positive declaration that he was compelled to accept the dangerous present of the imperial purple sulpicius severus dialog ii   orosius l vii c    p     they both acknowledge sulpicius had been his subject his innocence and merit it is singular enough that maximus should be less favorably treated by zosimus the partial adversary of his rival   but there was danger likewise in refusing the flight and death of gratian empire and from the moment that maximus had violated his allegiance to his lawful sovereign he could not hope to reign or even to live if he confined his moderate ambition within the narrow limits of britain he boldly and wisely resolved to prevent the designs of gratian the youth of the island crowded to his standard and he invaded gaul with a fleet and army which were long afterward remembered as the emigration of a considerable part of the british nation archbishop usher antiquitat britan eccles p  0   0  has diligently collected the legends of the island and the continent the whole emigration consisted of  0000 soldiers and  00000 plebeians who settled in bretagne their destined brides st ursula with   000 noble and  0000 plebeian virgins mistook their way landed at cologne and were all most cruelly murdered by the huns but the plebeian sisters have been defrauded of their equal honors and what is still harder john trithemius presumes to mention the children of these british virgins  the emperor in his peaceful residence of paris was alarmed by their hostile approach and the darts which he idly wasted on lions and bears might have been employed more honorably against the rebels but his feeble efforts announced his degenerate spirit and desperate situation and deprived him of the resources which he still might have found in the support of his subjects and allies the armies of gaul instead of opposing the march of maximus received him with joyful and loyal acclamations and the shame of the desertion was transferred from the people to the prince the troops whose station more immediately attached them to the service of the palace abandoned the standard of gratian the first time that it was displayed in the neighborhood of paris the emperor of the west fled toward lions with a train of only three hundred horse and in the cities along the road where he hoped to find a refuge or at least a passage he was taught by cruel experience that every gate is shut against the unfortunate yet he might still have reached in safety the dominions of his brother and soon have returned with the forces of italy and the east if he had not suffered himself to be fatally deceived by the perfidious governor of the lyonnese province gratian was amused by protestations of doubtful fidelity and the hopes of a support which could not be effectual till the arrival of andragathius the general of the cavalry of maximus put an end to his suspense that resolute officer executed without remorse the orders or the intentions of the usurper gratian as he rose from supper was delivered into the hands of the assassin and his body was denied to the pious and pressing entreaties of his brother a d     aug    valentinian zosimus l iv p         has transported the death of gratian from lugdunum in gaul lions to singidunum in moesia some hints may be extracted from the chronicles some lies may be detected in sozomen l vii c    and socrates l v c    ambrose is our most authentic evidence tom i enarrat in psalm lxi p     tom ii epist xxiv p     etc and de obitu valentinian consolat no    p       the death of the emperor was followed by that of his powerful general mellobaudes the king of the franks who maintained to the last moment of his life the ambiguous reputation which is the just recompense of obscure and subtle policy pacatus xii    celebrates his sidelity while his treachery is marked in prospers chronicle as the cause of the ruin of gratian ambrose who has occasion to exculpate himself only condemns the death of vallio a faithful servant of gratian tom ii epist xxiv p     edit benedict  these executions might be necessary to the public safety but the successful usurper whose power was acknowledged by all the provinces of the west had the merit and the satisfaction of boasting that except those who had perished by the chance of war his triumph was not stained by the blood of the romans he protested nullum ex adversariis nisi in acie occubuisse sulp severus in vit b martin c    the orator of theodosius bestows reluctant and therefore weighty praise on his clemency si cui ille pro ceteris sceleribus suis minus crudelis fuisse videtur panegyr vet xii      the events of this revolution had passed in such rapid succession that it would have been impossible for theodosius to march to the relief treaty of peace between maximus and theodosius a d          of his benefactor before he received the intelligence of his defeat and death during the season of sincere grief or ostentatious mourning the eastern emperor was interrupted by the arrival of the principal chamberlain of maximus and the choice of a venerable old man for an office which was usually exercised by eunuchs announced to the court of constantinople the gravity and temperance of the british usurper the ambassador condescended to justify or excuse the conduct of his master and to protest in specious language that the murder of gratian had been perpetrated without his knowledge or consent by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers but he proceeded in a firm and equal tone to offer theodosius the alternative of peace or war the speech of the ambassador concluded with a spirited declaration that although maximus as a roman and as the father of his people would choose rather to employ his forces in the common defense of the republic he was armed and prepared if his friendship should be rejected to dispute in a field of battle the empire of the world an immediate and peremptory answer was required but it was extremely difficult for theodosius to satisfy on this important occasion either the feelings of his own mind or the expectations of the public the imperious voice of honor and gratitude called aloud for revenge from the liberality of gratian he had received the imperial diadem his patience would encourage the odious suspicion that he was more deeply sensible of former injuries than of recent obligations and if he accepted the friendship he must seem to share the guilt of the assassin even the principles of justice and the interest of society would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of maximus and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve the artificial fabric of government and once more to replunge the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age but as the sentiments of gratitude and honor should invariably regulate the conduct of an individual they may be overbalanced in the mind of a sovereign by the sense of superior duties and the maxims both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of an atrocious criminal if an innocent people would be involved in the consequences of his punishment the assassin of gratian had usurped but he actually possessed the most warlike provinces of the empire the east was exhausted by the misfortunes and even by the success of the gothic war and it was seriously to be apprehended that after the vital strength of the republic had been wasted in a doubtful and destructive contest the feeble conqueror would remain an easy prey to the barbarians of the north these weighty considerations engaged theodosius to dissemble his resentment and to accept the alliance of the tyrant but he stipulated that maximus should content himself with the possession of the countries beyond the alps the brother of gratian was confirmed and secured in the sovereignty of italy africa and the western illyricum and some honorable conditions were inserted in the treaty to protect the memory and the laws of the deceased emperor ambrose mentions the laws of gratian quas non abrogavit hostis tom ii epist xvii p      according to the custom of the age the images of the three imperial colleagues were exhibited to the veneration of the people nor should it be lightly supposed that in the moment of a solemn reconciliation theodosius secretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge zosimus l iv p         we may disclaim his odious suspicions but we cannot reject the treaty of peace which the friends of theodosius have absolutely forgotten or slightly mentioned   the contempt of gratian for the roman soldiers baptism and orthodox edicts of theodosius a d   0 feb    had exposed him to the fatal effects of their resentment his profound veneration for the christian clergy was rewarded by the applause and gratitude of a powerful order which has claimed in every age the privilege of dispensing honors both on earth and in heaven their oracle the archbishop of milan assigns to his pupil gratian an high and respectable place in heaven tom ii de obit val consol p       the orthodox bishops bewailed his death and their own irreparable loss but they were soon comforted by the discovery that gratian had committed the scepter of the east to the hands of a prince whose humble faith and fervent zeal were supported by the spirit and abilities of a more vigorous character among the benefactors of the church the fame of constantine has been rivalled by the glory of theodosius if constantine had the advantage of erecting the standard of the cross the emulation of his successor assumed the merit of subduing the arian heresy and of abolishing the worship of idols in the roman world theodosius was the first of the emperors baptized in the true faith of the trinity although he was born of a christian family the maxims or at least the practice of the age encouraged him to delay the ceremony of his initiation till he was admonished of the danger of delay by the serious illness which threatened his life toward the end of the first year of his reign before he again took the field against the goths he received the sacrament of baptism for the baptism of theodosius see sozomen l vii c   socrates l v c   and tillemont hist des empereurs tom v p     from acholius the orthodox bishop of thessalonica ascolius or acholius was honored by the friendship and the praises of ambrose who styles him murus fidei atque sanctitatis tom ii epist xv p   0 and afterward celebrates his speed and diligence in running to constantinople italy etc epist xvi p     a virtue which does not appertain either to a wall or a bishop  and as the emperor ascended from the holy font still glowing with the warm feelings of regeneration he dictated a solemn edict which proclaimed his own faith and prescribed the religion of his subjects it is our pleasure such is the imperial style that all the nations which are governed by our clemency and moderation should steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by st peter to the romans which faithful tradition has preserved and which is now professed by the pontiff damasus and by peter bishop of alexandria a man of apostolic holiness according to the discipline of the apostles and the doctrine of the gospel let us believe the sole deity of the father the son and the holy ghost under an equal majesty and a pious trinity we authorize the followers of this doctrine to assume the title of catholic christians and as we judge that all others are extravagant madmen we brand them with the infamous name of heretics and declare that their conventicles shall no longer usurp the respectable appellation of churches besides the condemnation of divine justice they must expect to suffer the severe penalties which our authority guided by heavenly wisdom shall think proper to inflict upon them codex theodos l xvi tit i leg   with godefroys commentary tom vi p      such an edict deserved the warmest praises of baronius auream sanctionem edictum pium et salutare  sic itur ad astra  the faith of a soldier is commonly the fruit of instruction rather than of enquiry but as the emperor always fixed his eyes on the visible landmarks of orthodoxy which he had so prudently constituted his religious opinions were never affected by the specious texts the subtle arguments and the ambiguous creeds of the arian doctors once indeed he expressed a faint inclination to converse with the eloquent and learned eunomius who lived in retirement at a small distance from constantinople but the dangerous interview was prevented by the prayers of the empress flaccilla who trembled for the salvation of her husband and the mind of theodosius was confirmed by a theological argument adapted to the rudest capacity he had lately bestowed on his eldest son arcadius the name

orders that the rustic priest should be instantly driven from his presence but while the guards were forcing him to the door the dexterous polemic had time to execute his design by exclaiming with a loud voice such is the treatment o emperor which the king of heaven has prepared for those impious men who affect to worship the father but refuse to acknowledge the equal majesty of his divine son

joyful confidence by the baptism and edict of theodosius and they impatiently waited the effects of his gracious promise their hopes were speedily accomplished and the emperor as soon as he had finished the operations of the campaign made his public entry into the capital at the head of a victorious army the next day after his arrival he summoned damophilus to his prefence and offered that arian prelate the hard alternative of subscribing the nicene creed or of instantly resigning to the orthodox believers the use and possession of the episcopal palace the cathedral of st sophia and all the churches of constantinople the zeal of damophilus which in a catholic saint would have been justly applauded embraced without hesitation a life of poverty and exile socrates l v c   and sozomen l

profitable to submit  and his removal was immediately followed by the purification of the imperial city the arians might complain with some appearance of justice that an inconsiderable congregation of sectaries should usurp the hundred churches which they were insufficient to fill whilst the far greater part of the people was cruelly excluded from every place of religious worship theodosius was still inexorable but as the angels who protected the catholic cause were only visible to the eyes of faith he prudently reinforced those heavenly legions with the more effectual aid of temporal and carnal weapons and the church of st sophia was occupied by a large body of the imperial guards if the mind of gregory was susceptible of pride he must have felt a very lively satisfaction when the emperor conducted him through the streets in solemn triumph and with his own hand respectfully placed him on the archiepiscopal throne of constantinople but the saint who had not subdued the imperfections of human virtue was deeply affected by the mortifying consideration that his entrance into the fold was that of a wolf rather than of a shepherd that the glittering arms which surrounded his person were necessary for his safety and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great party whom as men and citizens it was impossible for him to despise he beheld the innumerable multitude of either sex and of every age who crowded the streets the windows and the roofs of the houses he heard the tumultuous voice of rage grief astonishment and despair and gregory fairly

sufferings of their holy confessors might claim the pity of the disinterested reader yet there is reason to imagine that the violence of zeal and revenge was in some measure eluded by the want of resistance and that in their adversity the arians displayed much less firmness than had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of constantius and valens the moral character and conduct of the hostile sects appear to have been governed by the same common principles of nature and religion but a very material circumstance may be discovered which tended to distinguish the degrees of their theological faith both parties in the schools as well as in the temples acknowledged and worshipped the divine majesty of christ and as we are always prone to impute our own sentiments and passions to the deity it would be deemed more prudent and respectful to exaggerate than to circumscribe the adorable perfections of the son of god the disciple of athanasius exulted in the proud confidence that he had entitled himself to the divine favor while the follower of arius must have been tormented by the secret apprehension that he was guilty perhaps of an unpardonable offense by the scanty praise and parsimonious honors which he bestowed on the judge of the world the opinions of arianism might satisfy a cold and speculative mind but the doctrine of the nicene creed most powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion was much better adapted to become popular and successful in a believing age  the hope that truth and wisdom would be the council of constantinople a d     may found in the assemblies of the orthodox clergy induced the emperor to convene at constantinople a synod of one hundred and fifty bishops who proceeded without much difficulty or delay to complete the theological system which had been established in the council of nice the vehement disputes of the fourth century had been chiefly employed on the nature of the son of god and the various opinions which were embraced concerning the second were extended and transferred by a natural analogy to the third person of the trinity le clerc has given a curious extract bibliotheque universelle tom xviii p      0  of the theological sermons which gregory nazianzen pronounced at constantinople against the arians eunomians macedonians etc he tells the macedonians who deified the father and the son without the holy ghost that they might as well be styled tritheists as ditheists gregory himself was almost a tritheist and his monarchy of heaven resembles a wellregulated aristocracy  yet it was found or it was thought necessary by the victorious adversaries of arianism to explain the ambiguous language of some respectable doctors to confirm the faith of the catholics and to condemn an unpopular and inconsistent sect of macedonians who freely admitted that the son was consubstantial to the father while they were fearful of seeming to acknowledge the existence of three gods a final and unanimous sentence was pronounced to ratify the equal deity of the holy ghost the mysterious doctrine has been received by all the nations and all the churches of the christian world and their grateful reverence has assigned to the bishops of theodosius the second rank among the general councils the first general council of constantinople now triumphs in the vatican but the popes had long hesitated and their hesitation perplexes and almost staggers the humble tillemont mem eccles tom ix p      00  their knowledge of religious truth may have been preserved by tradition or it may have been communicated by inspiration but the sober evidence of history will not allow much weight to the personal authority of the fathers of constantinople in an age when the ecclesiastics had scandalously degenerated from the model of apostolical purity the most worthless and corrupt were always the most eager to frequent and disturb the episcopal assemblies the conflict and fermentation of so many opposite interests and tempers inflamed the passions of the bishops and their ruling passions were the love of gold and the love of dispute many of the same prelates who now applauded the orthodox piety of theodosius had repeatedly changed with prudent flexibility their creeds and opinions and in the various revolutions of the church and state the religion of their sovereign was the rule of their obsequious faith when the emperor suspended his prevailing influence the turbulent synod was blindly impelled by the absurd or selfish motives of pride hatred and resentment the death of meletius which happened at the council of constantinople presented the most favorable opportunity of terminating the schism of antioch by suffering his aged rival paulinus peaceably to end his days in the episcopal chair the faith and virtues of paulinus were unblemished but his cause was supported by the western churches and the bishops of the synod resolved to perpetuate the mischiefs of discord by the hasty ordination of a perjured candidate before the death of meletius six or eight of his most popular ecclesiastics among whom was flavian had abjured for the sake of peace the bishopric of antioch sozomen l vii c      socrates l v c   tillemont thinks it his duty to disbelieve the story but he owns that there are many circumstances in the life of flavian which seem inconsistent with the praises of chrysostom and the character of a saint mem eccles tom x p      rather than to betray the imagined dignity of the east which had been illustrated by the birth and death of the son of god

exercised the functions of president in a word  gregory nazianzen himself the harsh and ungenerous treatment which he experienced see gregory tom ii de vita sua p        the fourteenth twentyseventh

east and the west etc is pathetic and almost sublime  instead of derogating from the truth of his evidence affords an additional proof of the spirit which actuated the deliberations of the synod their unanimous suffrage had confirmed the pretensions which the bishop of constantinople derived from the choice of the people and the approbation of the emperor but gregory soon became the victim of malice and envy the bishops of the east his strenuous adherents provoked by his moderation in the affairs of antioch abandoned him without support to the adverse faction of the egyptians who disputed the validity of his election and rigorously asserted the obsolete canon that prohibited the licentious practice of episcopal translations the pride or the humility of gregory prompted him to decline a contest which might have been imputed to ambition and avarice and he publicly offered not without some mixture of indignation to renounce the government of a church which had been restored and almost created by his labors his resignation was accepted by the synod and by the emperor with more readiness than he seems to have expected at the time when he might have hoped to enjoy the fruits of his victory his episcopal throne was filled by the senator nectarius and the new archbishop accidentally recommended by his easy temper and venerable aspect was obliged to delay the ceremony of his consecration till he had previously dispatched the rites of his baptism the whimsical ordination of nectarius is attested by sozomen l vii c   but tillemont observes mem eccles tom ix p     apres tout ce narre de sozomene est si honteux pour tous ceux quil y mele et surtout pour theodose quil vaut mieux travailler a le detruire qua le soutenir an admirable canon of criticism  after this remarkable experience of the ingratitude of princes and prelates gregory retired once more to his obscure solitude of cappadocia where he employed the remainder of his life about eight years in the exercises of poetry and devotion the title of saint has been added to his name but the tenderness of his heart i can only be understood to mean that such was his natural temper when it was not hardened or inflamed by religious zeal from his retirement he exhorts nectarius to prosecute the heretics of constantinople  and the elegance of his genius reflect a more pleasing luster on the memory of gregory nazianzen  it was not enough that theodosius had suppressed edicts of theodosius against the heretics a d   0      the insolent reign of arianism or that he had abundantly revenged the injuries which the catholics sustained from the zeal of constantius and valens the orthodox emperor considered every heretic as a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven and of earth and each of those powers might exercise their peculiar jurisdiction over the soul and body of the guilty the decrees of the council of constantinople had ascertained the true standard of the faith and the ecclesiastics who governed the conscience of theodosius suggested the most effectual methods of persecution in the space of fifteen years he promulgated at least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics see the theodosian code l xvi tit v leg       with godefroys commentary on each law and his general summary or paratition tom vi p  0     0  more especially against those who rejected the doctrine of the trinity and to deprive them of every hope of escape he sternly enacted that if any laws or rescripts should be alleged in their favor the judges should consider them as the illegal productions either of fraud or forgery the penal statutes were directed against the ministers the assembles and the persons of the heretics and the passions of the legislator were expressed in the language of declamation and invective i the heretical teachers who usurped the sacred titles of bishops or presbyters were not only excluded from the privileges and emoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clergy but they were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation if they presumed to preach the doctrine or to practice the rites of their accursed sects a fine of ten pounds of gold above four hundred pounds sterling was imposed on every person who should dare to confer or receive or promote an heretical ordination and it was reasonably expected that if the race of pastors could be extinguished their helpless flocks would be compelled by ignorance and hunger to return within the pale of the catholic church ii the rigorous prohibition of conventicles was carefully extended to every possible circumstance in which the heretics could assemble with the intention of worshipping god and christ according to the dictates of their conscience their religious meetings whether public or secret by day or by night in cities or in the country were equally proscribed by the edicts of theodosius and the building or ground which had been used for that illegal purpose was forfeited to the imperial domain iii it was supposed that the error of the heretics could proceed only from the obstinate temper of their minds and that such a temper was a fit object of censure and punishment the anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civil excommunication which separated them from their fellowcitizens by a peculiar brand of infamy and this declaration of the supreme magistrate tended to justify or at least to excuse the insults of a fanatic populace the sectaries were gradually disqualified for the possession of honorable or lucrative employments and theodosius was satisfied with his own justice when he decreed that as the eunomians distinguished the nature of the son from that of the father they should be incapable of making their wills or of receiving any advantage from testamentary donations the guilt of the manichaean heresy was esteemed of such magnitude that it could be expiated only by the death of the offender and the same capital punishment was inflicted on the audians or quartodecimans they always kept their easter like the jewish passover on the fourteenth day of the first moon after the vernal equinox and thus pertinaciously opposed the roman church

of augustine pope leo etc which tillemont swallows like a child and lardner refutes like a man may suggest some candid suspicions in favor of the older gnostics  priscillian who wandered about the world in the company of his spiritual sisters was accused of praying starknaked in the midst of the congregation and it was confidently asserted that the effects of his criminal intercourse with the daughter of euchrocia had been suppressed by means still more odious and criminal but an accurate or rather a candid enquiry will discover that if the priscillianists violated the laws of nature it was not by the licentiousness but by the austerity of their lives they absolutely condemned the use of the marriage bed and the peace of families was often disturbed by indiscreet separations they enjoined or recommended a total abstinence from all animal food and their continual prayers fasts and vigils inculcated a rule of strict and perfect devotion the speculative tenets of the sect concerning the person of christ and the nature of the human soul were derived from the gnostic and manichaean system and this vain philosophy which had been transported from egypt to spain was ill adapted to the grosser spirits of the west the obscure disciples of priscillian suffered languished and gradually disappeared his tenets were rejected by the clergy and people but his death was the subject of a long and vehement controversy while some arraigned and others applauded the justice of his sentence it is with pleasure that we can observe the humane inconsistency of the most illustrious saints and bishops ambrose of milan ambros tom ii epist xxiv p      and martin of tours in the sacred history and the life of st martin sulpicius severus uses some caution but he declares himself more freely in the dialogues iii    martin was reproved however by his own conscience and by an angel nor could he afterward perform miracles with so much ease  who on this occasion asserted the cause of toleration they pitied the unhappy men who had been executed at treves they refused to hold communion with their episcopal murderers and if martin deviated from that generous resolution his motives were laudable and his repentance was exemplary the bishops of tours and milan pronounced without hesitation the eternal damnation of heretics but they were surprised and shocked by the bloody image of their temporal death and the honest feelings of nature resisted the artificial prejudices of theology the humanity of ambrose and martin was confirmed by the scandalous irregularity of the proceedings against priscillian and his adherents the civil and ecclesiastical ministers had transgressed the limits of their respective provinces the secular judge had presumed to receive an appeal and to pronounce a definitive sentence in a matter of faith and episcopal jurisdiction the bishops had disgraced themselves by exercising the function of accusers in a criminal prosecution the

motives of interest since the death of priscillian the rude attempts of persecution have been refined and methodised in the holy office which assigns their distinct parts to the ecclesiastical and secular powers the devoted victim is regularly delivered by the priest to the magistrate and by the magistrate to the executioner and the inexorable sentence of the church which declares the spiritual guilt of the offender is expressed in the mild language of pity and intercession  among the ecclesiastics who illustrated the ambrose archbishop of milan a d          reign of theodosius gregory

ambrose to his own surprise and to that of the world was suddenly transformed from a governor to an archbishop without the least mixture as it is said of art or intrigue the whole body of the people unanimously saluted him with the episcopal title the concord and perseverance of their acclamations were ascribed to a praeternatural impulse and the reluctant magistrate was compelled to undertake a spiritual office for which he was not prepared by the habits and occupations of his former life but the active force of his genius soon qualified him to exercise with zeal and prudence the duties of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction and while he cheerfully renounced the vain and splendid trappings of temporal greatness he condescended for the good of the church to direct the conscience of the

exercise of his religion and she proposed to the archbishop as a moderate and reasonable concession that he should resign the use of a single church either in the city or suburbs of milan but the conduct of ambrose was governed by very different principles his own representation of his principles and conduct tom ii epist xx xxi xxii p        0 is one of the curious monuments of ecclesiastical antiquity it contains two letters to his sister marcellina with a petition to valentinian and the sermon de basilicis non tradendis  the palaces of the earth might indeed belong to caesar but the churches were the houses of god and within the limits of his diocese he himself as the lawful successor of the apostles was the only minister of god the privileges of christianity temporal as well as spiritual were confined to the true believers and the mind of ambrose was satisfied that his own theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy the archbishop who refused to hold any conference or negotiation with the instruments of satan declared with modest firmness his resolution to die a martyr rather than to yield to the impious sacrilege and justina who resented the refusal as an act of insolence and rebellion hastily determined to exert the imperial prerogative of her son as she desired to perform her public devotions on the approaching festival of easter ambrose was ordered to appear before the council he obeyed the summons with the respect of a faithful subject but he was followed without his consent by an innumerable people they pressed with impetuous zeal against the gates of the palace and the affrighted ministers of valentinian instead of pronouncing a sentence of exile on the archbishop of milan humbly requested that he would interpose his authority to protect the person of the emperor and to restore the tranquillity of the capital but the promises which ambrose received and communicated were soon violated by a perfidious court and during six of the most solemn days which christian piety has set apart for the exercise of religion the city was agitated by the irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism the officers of the household were directed to prepare first the portian and afterward the new basilica for the immediate reception of the emperor and his mother the splendid canopy and hangings of the royal seat were arranged in the customary manner but it was found necessary to defend them by a strong guard from the insults of the populace the arian ecclesiastics who ventured to show themselves in the streets were exposed to the most imminent danger of their lives and ambrose enjoyed the merit and reputation of rescuing his personal enemies from the hands of the enraged multitude  but while he labored to restrain the effects of their zeal the pathetic vehemence of his sermons continually inflamed the angry and seditious temper of the people of milan the characters of eve of the wife of job of jezabel of herodias were indecently applied to the mother of the emperor and her desire to obtain a church for the arians was compared to the most cruel persecutions which christianity had endured under the reign of paganism the measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the evil a fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the corporate body of merchants and manufacturers an order was signified in the name of the emperor to all the officers and inferior servants of the courts of justice that during the continuance of the public disorders they should strictly confine themselves to their houses and the ministers of valentinian imprudently confessed that the most respectable part of the citizens of milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop he was again solicited to restore peace to his country by a timely compliance with the will of his sovereign the reply of ambrose was couched in the most humble and respectful terms which might however be interpreted as a serious declaration of civil war his life and fortune were in the hands of the emperor but he would never betray the church of christ or degrade the dignity of the episcopal character in such a cause he was prepared to suffer whatever the malice of the demon could inflict and he only wished to die in the presence of his faithful flock and at the foot of the altar he had not contributed to excite but it was in the power of god alone to appease the rage of the people he deprecated the scenes of blood and confusion which were likely to ensue and it was his fervent prayer that he might not survive to behold the ruin of a flourishing city and perhaps the desolation of all italy retz had a similar message from the queen to request that he would appease the tumult of paris it was no longer in his power etc a quoi jajoutai tout ce que vous pouvez vous imaginer de respect de douleur de regret et de soumission etc memoires tom i p   0 certainly i do not compare either the causes or the men yet the coadjutor himself had some idea p    of imitating st ambrose  the obstinate bigotry of justina would have endangered the empire of her son if in this contest with the church and people of milan she could have depended on the active obedience of the troops of the palace a large body of goths had marched to occupy the basilica which was the object of the dispute and it might be expected from the arian principles and barbarous manners of these foreign mercenaries that they would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most sanguinary orders they were encountered on the sacred threshold by the archbishop who thundering against them a sentence of excommunication asked them in the tone of a father and a master whether it was to invade the house of god that they had implored the hospitable protection of the republic the suspense of the barbarians allowed some hours for a more effectual negotiation and the empress was persuaded by the advice of her wisest counselors to leave the catholics in possession of all the churches of milan and to dissemble till a more convenient season her intentions of revenge the mother of valentinian could never forgive the triumph of ambrose and the royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation that his own servants were ready to betray him into the hands of an insolent priest  the laws of the empire some of which were a d     inscribed with the name of valentinian still condemned the arian heresy and seemed to excuse the resistance of the catholics by the influence of justina an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the provinces which were subject to the court of milan the free exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the faith of rimini and the emperor declared that all persons who should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution should be capitally punished as the enemies of the public peace sozomen alone l vii c    throws this luminous fact into a dark and perplexed narrative  the character and language of the archbishop of milan may justify the suspicion that his conduct soon afforded a reasonable ground or at least a specious pretense to the arian ministers who watched the opportunity of surprising him in some act of disobedience to a law which he strangely represents as a law of blood and tyranny a sentence of easy and honorable banishment was pronounced which enjoined ambrose to depart from milan without delay whilst it permitted him to choose the place of his exile and the number of his companions but the authroity of the saints who have preached and practiced the maxims of passive loyalty appeared to ambrose of less moment than the extreme and pressing danger of the church he boldly refused to obey and his refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful people excubabat pia plebs in ecclesia mori parata cum episcopo suo nos adhuc frigidi excitabamur tamen civitate attonita atque turbata augustine confession l ix c    they guarded by turns the person of their archbishop the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly secured and the imperial troops who had formed the blockade were unwilling to risk the attack of that impregnable fortress the numerous poor who had been relieved by the liberality of ambrose embraced the fair occasion of signalising their zeal and gratitude and as the patience of the multitude might have been exhausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils he prudently introduced into the church of milan the useful institution of a loud and regular psalmody while he maintained this arduous contest he was instructed by a dream to open the earth in a place where the remains of two martyrs gervasius and protasius tillemont mem eccless tom ii p        many churches in italy gaul etc were dedicated to these unknown martyrs of whom st gervase seems to have been more fortunate than his companion  had been deposited above three hundred years immediately under the pavement of the church two perfect skeletons were found invenimus mirae magnitudinis viros duos ut prisca aetas ferebat tom ii epist xxii p     the size of these skeletons was fortunately or skilfully suited to the popular prejudice of the gradual decrease of the human stature which has prevailed in every age since the time of homer  grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris    with the heads separated from their bodies and a plentiful effusion of blood the holy relics were presented in solemn pomp to the veneration of the people and every circumstance of this fortunate discovery was admirably adapted to promote the designs of ambrose the bones of the martyrs their blood their garments were supposed to contain a healing power and the praeternatural influence was communicated to the most distant objects without losing any part of its original virtue the extraordinary cure of a blind man ambros tom ii epist xxii p     augustine confess l ix c   de civitat dei l xxii c   paulin

of the church i should recommend this miracle to our divines if it did not prove the worship of relics as well as the nicene creed  and the reluctant confessions of several daemoniacs appeared to justify the faith and sanctity of ambrose and the truth of those miracles is attested by ambrose himself by his secretary paulinus and by his proselyte the celebrated augustine who at that time professed the art of rhetoric in milan the reason of the present age may possibly approve the incredulity of justina and her arian court who derided the theatrical representations which were exhibited by the contrivance and at the expense of the archbishop paulin in vit st ambros c   in append benedict p    their effect however on the minds of the people was rapid and irresistible and the feeble sovereign of italy found himself unable to contend with the favorite of heaven the powers likewise of the earth interposed in the defense of ambrose the disinterested advice of theodosius was the genuine result of piety and friendship and the mask of religious zeal concealed the hostile and ambitious designs of the tyrant of gaul tillemont mem eccles tom x p   0   0 he partially allows the mediation of theodosius and capriciously rejects that of maximus though it is attested by prosper sozomen and theodoret   the reign of maximus might have ended in maximus invades italy a d     august peace and prosperity could he have contented himself with the possession of three ample countries which now constitute the three most flourishing kingdoms of modern europe but the aspiring usurper whose sordid ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms considered his actual forces as the instruments only of his future greatness and his success was the immediate cause of his destruction the wealth which he extorted the modest censure of sulpicius dialog iii    inflicts a much deeper wound than the feeble declamation of pacatus xii       from the oppressed provinces of gaul spain and britain was employed in levying and maintaining a formidable army of barbarians collected for the most part from the fiercest nations of germany the conquest of italy was the object of his hopes and preparations and he secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth whose government was abhorred and despised by his catholic subjects but as maximus wished to occupy without resistance the passes of the alps he received with perfidious smiles domninus of syria the ambassador of valentinian and pressed him to accept the aid of a considerable body of troops for the service of a pannonian war the penetration of ambrose had discovered the snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship esto tutior adversus hominem pacis involucro tegentem was the wise caution of ambrose tom ii p     after his return from his second embassy  but the syrian domninus was corrupted or deceived by the liberal favor of the court of treves and the council of milan obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger with a blind confidence which was the effect not of courage but of fear the march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador and they were admitted without distrust into the fortresses of the alps but the crafty tyrant followed with hasty and silent footsteps in the rear and as he diligently intercepted all intelligence of his motions the gleam of armor and the dust excited by the troops of cavalry first announced the hostile approach of a stranger to the gates of milan in this extremity justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence and the perfidious arts of maximus but they wanted time and force and resolution to stand against the gauls and germans either in the field or within the walls of a large and disaffected city flight was their only hope aquileia their only refuge and as maximus now displayed his genuine character the brother of gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same assassin maximus entered milan in triumph and if the wise archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connection with the usurper he might indirectly contribute to the success of his arms by inculcating from the pulpit the duty of resignation rather than that of resistance baronius a d     no    applies to this season of public distress some of the penitential sermons of the archbishop  the unfortunate justina reached aquileia in safety but she distrusted the strength of the fortifications she dreaded the event of a siege and she resolved to implore the protection of the great theodosius whose power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the west a vessel was secretly provided to transport the imperial family they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure harbors of venetia or istria traversed the whole extent of the hadriatic and ionian seas turned the extreme promontory of peloponnesus and after a long but successful navigation reposed themselves in the port of thessalonica all the subjects of valentinian deserted the cause of a prince who by his abdication had absolved flight of valentinian them from the duty of allegiance and if the little city of aemona on the verge of italy had not presumed to stop the career of his inglorious victory maximus would have obtained without a struggle the sole possession of the western empire  instead of inviting his royal guests to the palace theodosius takes arms in the cause of valentinian a d     of constantinople theodosius had some unknown reasons to fix their residence at thessalonica but these reasons did not proceed from contempt or indifference as he speedily made a visit to that city accompanied by the greatest part of his court and senate after the first tender expressions of friendship and sympathy the pious emperor of the east gently admonished justina that the guilt of heresy was sometimes punished in this world as well as in the next and that the public profession of the nicene faith would be the most efficacious step to promote the restoration of her son by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth and in heaven the momentous question of peace or war was referred by theodosius to the deliberation of his council and the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honor and justice had acquired since the death of gratian a considerable degree of additional weight the persecution of the imperial family to which theodosius himself had been indebted for his fortune was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition of maximus and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures instead of prolonging the blessings of peace would expose the eastern empire to the danger of an hostile invasion the barbarians who had passed the danube had lately assumed the character of soldiers and subjects but their native fierceness was yet untamed and the operations of a war which would exercise their valor and diminish their numbers might tend to relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression notwithstanding these specious and solid reasons which were approved by a majority of the council theodosius still hesitated whether he should draw the sword in a contest which could no longer admit any terms of reconciliation and his magnanimous character was not disgraced by the apprehensions which he felt for the safety of his infant sons and the welfare of his exhausted people in this moment of anxious doubt while the fate of the roman world depended on the resolution of a single man the charms of the princess galla most powerfully pleaded the cause of her brother valentinian the flight of valentinian and the love of theodosius for his sister are related by zosimus l iv p         tillemont produces some weak and ambiguous evidence to antedate the second marriage of theodosius hist des empereurs tom v p   0 and consequently to refute ces contes de zosime qui seroient trop contraires a la piete de theodose  the heart of theodosius was softened by the tears of beauty his affections were insensibly engaged by the graces of youth and innocence the art of justina managed and directed the impulse of passion and the celebration of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil war the unfeeling critics who consider every amorous weakness as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and orthodox emperor are inclined on this occasion to dispute the suspicious evidence of the historian zosimus for my own part i shall frankly confess that i am willing to find or even to seek in the revolutions of the world some traces of the mild and tender sentiments of domestic life and amidst the crowd of fierce and ambitious conquerors i can distinguish with peculiar complacency a gentle hero who may be supposed to receive his armor from the hands of love the alliance of the persian king was secured by the faith of treaties the martial barbarians were persuaded to follow the standard or to respect the frontiers of an active and liberal monarch and the dominions of theodosius from the euphrates to the hadriatic resounded with the preparations of war both by land and sea the skilful disposition of the forces of the east seemed to multiply their numbers and distracted the attention of maximus he had reason to fear that a chosen body of troops under the command of the intrepid arbogastes would direct their march along the banks of the danube and boldly penetrate through the rhaetian provinces into the center of gaul a powerful fleet was equipped in the harbors of greece and epirus with an apparent design that as soon as the passage had been opened by a naval victory valentinian and his mother should land in italy proceed without delay to rome and occupy the majestic seat of religion and empire in the mean while theodosius himself advanced at the head of a brave and disciplined army to encounter his unworthy rival who after the siege of aemona had fixed his camp in the neighborhood of siscia a city of pannonia strongly fortified by the broad and rapid stream of the save  the veterans who still remembered the long defeat and death of maximus a d     june  august resistance and successive resources of the tyrant magnentius might prepare themselves for the labors of three bloody campaigns but the contest with his successor who like him had usurped the throne of the west was easily decided in the term of two months see godefroys chronology of the laws cod theodos tom i p cxix  and within the space of two hundred miles the superior genius of the emperor of the east might prevail over the feeble maximus who in this important crisis showed himself destitute of military skill or personal courage but the abilities of theodosius were seconded by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and active cavalry the huns the alani and after their example the goths themselves were formed into squadrons of archers who fought on horseback and confounded the steady valor of the gauls and germans by the rapid motions of a tartar war after the fatigue of a long march in the heat of summer they spurred their foaming horses into the waters of the save swam the river in the presence of the enemy and instantly charged and routed the troops who guarded the high ground on the opposite side marcellinus the tyrants brother advanced to support them with the select cohorts which were considered as the hope and strength of the army the action which had been interrupted by the approach of night was renewed in the morning and after a sharp conflict the surviving remnant of the bravest soldiers of maximus threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror without suspending his march to receive the loyal acclamations of the citizens of aemona theodosius pressed forwards to terminate the war by the death or captivity of his rival who fled before him with the diligence of fear from the summit of the julian alps he descended with such incredible speed into the plain of italy that he reached aquileia on the evening of the first day and maximus who found himself encompassed on all sides had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city but the gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy and the despair the disaffection the indifference of the soldiers and people hastened the downfall of the wretched maximus he was dragged from his throne rudely stripped of the imperial ornaments the robe the diadem and the purple slippers and conducted like a malefactor to the camp and presence of theodosius at a place about three miles from aquileia the behavior of the emperor was not intended to insult and he showed some disposition to pity and forgive the tyrant of the west who had never been his personal enemy and was now become the object of his contempt our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the misfortunes to which we are exposed and the spectacle of a proud competitor now prostrate at his feet could not fail of producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the victorious emperor but the feeble emotion of involuntary pity was checked by his regard for public justice and the memory of gratian and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the soldiers who drew him out of the imperial presence and instantly separated his head from his body the intelligence of his defeat and death was received with sincere or welldissembled joy his son victor on whom he had conferred the title of augustus died by the order perhaps by the hand of the bold arbogastes and all the military plans of theodosius were successfully executed when he had thus terminated the civil war with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally expect he employed the winter months of his residence at milan to restore the state of the afflicted provinces and early in the spring he made after the example of constantine and constantius his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the roman empire

might furnish the subject of a sincere and ample panegyric the wisdom of his laws and the success of his arms rendered his administration respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies he loved and practiced the virtues of domestic life which seldom hold their residence in the palaces of kings theodosius was chaste and temperate he enjoyed without excess the sensual and social pleasures of the table and the warmth of his amorous passions was never diverted from their lawful objects the proud titles of imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of a faithful husband an indulgent father his uncle was raised by his affectionate esteem to the rank of a second parent theodosius embraced as his own the children of his brother and sister and the expressions of his regard were extended to the most distant and obscure branches of his numerous kindred his familiar friends were judiciously selected from among those persons who in the equal intercourse of private life had appeared before his eyes without a mask the consciousness of personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental distinction of the purple and he proved by his conduct that he had forgotten all the injuries while he most gratefully remembered all the favors and services which he had received before he ascended the throne of the roman empire the serious or lively tone of his conversation was adapted to the age the rank or the character of his subjects whom he admitted into his society and the affability of his manners displayed the image of his mind theodosius respected the simplicity of the good and virtuous every art every talent of an useful or even of an innocent nature was rewarded by his judicious liberality and except the heretics whom he persecuted with implacable hatred the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by the limits of the human race the government of a mighty empire may assuredly suffice to occupy the time and the abilities of a mortal yet the diligent prince without aspiring to the unsuitable reputation of profound learning always reserved some moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement of reading history which enlarged his experience was his favorite study the annals of rome in the long period of eleven hundred years presented him with a various and splendid picture of human life and it has been particularly observed that whenever he perused the cruel acts of cinna of marius or of sylla he warmly expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity and freedom his disinterested opinion of past events was usefully applied as the rule of his own actions and theodosius has deserved the singular commendation that his virtues always seemed to expand with his fortune the season of his prosperity was that of his moderation and his clemency appeared the most conspicuous after the danger and success of the civil war the moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat of the victory and a small number of the most obnoxious criminals suffered the punishment of the law but the emperor showed himself much more attentive to relieve the innocent than to chastise the guilty the oppressed subjects of the west who would have deemed themselves happy in the restoration of their lands were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to their losses and the liberality of the conqueror supported the aged mother and educated the orphan daughters of maximus ambros tom ii epist xl p     pacatus from the want of skill or of courage omits this glorious circumstance  a character thus accomplished might almost excuse the extravagant supposition of the orator pacatus that if the elder brutus could be permitted to revisit the earth the stern republican would abjure at the feet of theodosius his hatred of kings and ingenuously confess that such a monarch was the most faithful guardian of the happiness and dignity of the roman people pacat in panegyr vet xii  0   yet the piercing eye of the founder of the republic must have discerned two essential imperfections faults of theodosius which might perhaps have abated his recent love of despotism the virtuous mind of theodosius was often relaxed by indolence zosimus l iv p         his partial evidence is marked by an air of candor and truth he observes these vicissitudes of sloth and activity not as a vice but as a singularity in the character of theodosius  and it was sometimes inflamed by passion this choleric temper is acknowledged and excused by victor sed habes says ambrose in decent and manly language to his sovereign naturae impetum quem si quis lenire velit cito vertes ad misericordiam si quis stimulet in magis exsuscitas ut cum revocare vix possis tom ii epist li p     theodosius

accomplished or the danger was surmounted the hero sunk into inglorious repose and forgetful that the time of a prince is the property of his people resigned himself to the enjoyment of the innocent but trifling pleasures of a luxurious court the natural disposition of theodosius was hasty and choleric and in a station where none could resist and few would dissuade the fatal consequence of his resentment the humane monarch was justly alarmed by the consciousness of his infirmity and of his power it was the constant study of his life to suppress or regulate the intemperate sallies of passion and the success of his efforts enhanced the merit of his clemency but the painful virtue which claims the merit of victory is exposed to the danger of deseat and the reign of a wise and merciful prince was polluted by an act of cruelty which would stain the annals of nero or domitian within the space of three years the inconsistent historian of theodosius must relate the generous pardon of the citizens of antioch and the inhuman massacre of the people of thessalonica  the lively impatience of the inhabitants of antioch was never satisfied with their own situation the sedition of antioch a d     or with the character and conduct of their successive sovereigns the arian subjects of theodosius deplored the loss of their churches and as three rival bishops disputed the throne of antioch the sentence which decided their pretensions excited the murmurs of the two unsuccessful congregations the exigencies of the gothic war and the inevitable expense that accompanied the conclusion of the peace had constrained the emperor to aggravate the weight of the public impositions and the provinces of asia as they had not been involved in the distress were the less inclined to contribute to the relief of europe the auspicious period now approached of the tenth year of his reign a festival more grateful to the soldiers who received a liberal donative than to the subjects whose voluntary offerings had been long since converted into an extraordinary and oppressive burden the edicts of taxation interrupted the repose and pleasures of antioch and the tribunal of the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant crowd who in pathetic but at first in respectful language solicited the redress of their grievances they were gradually incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers who treated their complaints as a criminal resistance their satirical wit degenerated into sharp and angry invectives and from the subordinate powers of government the invectives of the people insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor himself their fury provoked by a feeble opposition discharged itself on the feb    images of the imperial family which were erected as objects of public veneration in the most conspicuous places of the city the statues of theodosius of his father of his wife flaccilla of his two sons arcadius and honorius were insolently thrown down from their pedestals broken in pieces or dragged with contempt through the streets and the indignities which were offered to the representations of imperial majesty sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the populace the tumult was almost immediately suppressed by the arrival of a body of archers and antioch had leisure to reflect on the nature and consequences of her crime the christians and pagans agreed in believing that the sedition of antioch was excited by the demons a gigantic woman says sozomen l vii c    paraded the streets with a scourge in her hand an old man says libanius orat xii p     transformed himself into a youth then a boy etc  according to the duty of his office the governor of the province dispatched a faithful narrative of the whole transaction while

notwithstanding the diligence of the imperial posts the guilty city was severely punished by a long and dreadful interval of suspense every rumor agitated the hopes and fears of the antiochians and

offended that the dependent city of seleucia should presume to intercede for them  the baths the circus and the theaters were shut and that every source of plenty and pleasure might at the same time

and of those who had not prevented the destruction of the sacred statues the tribunal of hellebicus and caesarius encompassed with armed soldiers was erected in the midst of the forum the noblest and most wealthy of the citizens of antioch appeared before them in chains the examination was assisted by the use of torture and their sentence was pronounced or suspended according to the judgment of these extraordinary magistrates the houses of the criminals were exposed to sale their wives and children were suddenly reduced from affluence and luxury to the most abject distress and a bloody

has represented as a lively image of the last and universal judgment of the world but the ministers of theodosius performed with reluctance the cruel task which had been assigned them they dropped a gentle tear over the calamities of the people and they listened with reverence to the pressing solicitations of the monks and hermits who descended in swarms from the mountains chrysostom opposes their courage which was not attended with much risk to the cowardly flight of the cynics  hellebicus and caesarius were persuaded to suspend the execution of their sentence and it was agreed that the former should remain at antioch while the latter returned with all possible speed to constantinople and presumed once more to consult the will of his sovereign the resentment of clemency of theodosius theodosius had already subsided the deputies of the people both the bishop and the orator had obtained a favorable audience and the reproaches of the emperor were the complaints of injured friendship rather than the stern menaces of pride and power a free and general pardon was granted to the city and citizens of antioch the prisondoors were thrown open the senators who despaired of their lives recovered the possession of their houses and estates and the capital of the east was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and splendor theodosius condescended to praise the senate of

expressions of his respect and gratitude a thousand new statues arose to the clemency of theodosius the april    applause of his subjects was ratified by the approbation of his own heart and the

productive of much more dreadful consequences that great city the metropolis of all the illyrian provinces had been protected from the dangers of the gothic war by strong fortifications and a numerous garrison botheric the general of those troops and as it should seem from his name a barbarian had among his slaves a beautiful boy who excited the impure desires of one of the charioteers of the circus the insolent and brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of botheric and he sternly rejected the importunate clamours of the multitude who on the day of the public games lamented the absence of their favorite and considered the skill of a charioteer as an object of more importance than his virtue the resentment of the people was embittered by some previous disputes and as the strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service of the italian war the feeble remnant whose numbers were reduced by desertion could not save the unhappy general from their licentious fury botheric and several of his principal officers were inhumanly murdered their mangled bodies were dragged about the streets and the emperor who then resided at milan was surprised by the intelligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty of the people of thessalonica the sentence of a dispassionate judge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of the crime and the merit of botheric might contribute to exasperate the grief and indignation of his master the fiery and choleric temper of theodosius was impatient of the dilatory forms of a judicial enquiry and he hastily resolved that the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood of the guilty people yet his mind still fluctuated between the counsels of clemency and of revenge the zeal of the bishops had almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a general pardon his passion was again inflamed by the flattering suggestions of his minister rufinus and after theodosius had dispatched the messengers of death he attempted when it was too late to prevent the execution of his orders the punishment of a roman city was blindly committed to the undistinguishing sword of the barbarians and the hostile preparations were concerted with the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal conspiracy the people of thessalonica were treacherously invited in the name of their sovereign to the games of the circus and such was their insatiate avidity for those amusements that every consideration of fear or suspicion was disreguarded by the numerous spectators as soon as the assembly was complete the soldiers who had secretly been posted round the circus received the signal not of the races but of a general massacre the promiscuous carnage continued three hours without discrimination of strangers or natives of age or sex of innocence or guilt the most moderate accounts state the number of the slain at seven thousand and it is affirmed by some writers that more than fifteen thousand victims were sacrificed to the manes of botheric a foreign merchant who had probably no concern in his murder offered his own life and all his wealth to supply the place of one of his two sons but while the father hesitated with equal tenderness while he was doubtful to choose and unwilling to condemn the soldiers determined his suspense by plunging their daggers at the same moment into the breasts of the defenseless youths the apology of the assassins that they were obliged to produce the prescribed number of heads serves only to increase by an appearance of order and design the horrors of the massacre which was executed by the commands of theodosius the guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent residence at thessalonica the situation of the unfortunate city the aspect of the streets and buildings the dress and faces of the inhabitants were familiar and even present to his imagination and theodosius possessed a quick and lively sense of the existence of the people whom he destroyed the original evidence of ambrose tom ii epist li p     augustine de civitat dei v    and paulinus in vit ambros c    is delivered in vague expressions of horror and pity it is

of theodosius most unaccountably passes over in silence the worst of his actions   the respectful attachment of the emperor for influence and conduct of ambrose a d     the orthodox clergy had disposed him to love and admire the character of ambrose who united all the episcopal virtues in the most eminent degree the friends and ministers of theodosius imitated the example of their sovereign and he observed with more surprise than displeasure that all his secret counsels were immediately communicated to the archbishop who acted from the laudable persuasion that every measure of civil government may have some connection with the glory of god and the interest of the true religion the monks and populace of callinicum an obscure town on the frontier of persia excited by their own fanaticism and by that of their bishop had tumultuously burnt a conventicle of the valentinians and a synagogue of the jews the seditious prelate was condemned by the magistrate of the province either to rebuild the synagogue or to repay the damage and this moderate sentence was confirmed by the emperor but it was not confirmed by the archbishop of milan see the whole transaction in ambrose tom ii epist xl xli p          and his biographer paulinus c    bail and barbeyrac morales des peers c xvii p     etc have justly condemned the archbishop  he dictated an epistle of censure and reproach more suitable perhaps if the emperor had received the mark of circumcision and renounced the faith of his baptism ambrose considers the toleration of the jewish as the persecution of the christian religion boldly declares that he himself and every true believer would eagerly dispute with the bishop of callinicum the merit of the deed and the crown of martyrdom and laments in the most pathetic terms that the execution of the sentence would be fatal to the fame and salvation of theodosius as this private admonition did not produce an immediate effect the archbishop from his pulpit his sermon is a strange allegory of jeremiahs rod of an almondtree of the woman who washed and anointed the feet of christ but the peroration is direct and personal  publicly addressed the emperor on his throne hodie episcope de me proposuisti ambrose modestly confessed it but he sternly reprimanded timasius general of the horse and foot who had presumed to say that the monks of callinicum deserved punishment  nor would he consent to offer the oblation of the altar till he had obtained from theodosius a solemn and positive declaration which secured the impunity of the bishop and monks of callinicum the recantation of theodosius was sincere yet five years afterward when theodosius was absent from his spiritual guide he tolerated the jews and condemned the destruction of their synagogue cod theodos l xvi tit viii leg   with godefroys commentary tom vi p      and during the term of his residence at milan his affection for ambrose was continually increased by the habits of pious and familiar conversation  when ambrose was informed of the massacre penance of theodosius a d   0 of thessalonica his mind was filled with horror and anguish he retired into the country to indulge his grief and to avoid the presence of theodosius but as the archbishop was satisfied that a timid silence would render him the accomplice of his guilt he represented in a private letter the enormity of the crime which could only be effaced by the tears of penitence the episcopal vigor of ambrose was tempered by prudence and he contented himself with signifying ambros tom ii epist li p       00  his epistle is a miserable rhapsody on a noble subject ambrose could act better than he could write his compositions are destitute of taste or genius without the spirit of tertullian the copious elegance of lactantius the lively wit of jerome or the grave energy of augustine an indirect sort of excommunication by the assurance that he had been warned in a vision not to offer the oblation in the name or in the presence of theodosius and by the advice that he would confine himself to the use of prayer without presuming to approach the altar of christ or to receive the holy eucharist with those hands that were still polluted with the blood of an innocent people the emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches and by those of his spiritual father and after he had bewailed the mischievous and irreparable consequences of his rash fury he proceeded in the accustomed manner to perform his devotions in the great church of milan he was stopped in the porch by the archbishop who in the tone and language of an ambassador of heaven declared to his sovereign that private contrition was not sufficient to atone for a public fault or to appease the justice of the offended deity theodosius humbly represented that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide david the man after gods own heart had been guilty not only of murder but of adultery you have imitated david in his crime imitate then his repentance was the reply of the undaunted ambrose the rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted and the public penance of the emperor theodosius has been recorded as one of the most honorable events in the annals of the church according to the mildest rules of ecclesiastical discipline which were established in the fourth century the crime of homicide was expiated by the penitence of twenty years according to the discipline of st basil canon lvi the voluntary homicide was four years a mourner five an hearer seven in a prostrate state and four in a standing posture i have the original beveridge pandect tom ii p         and a translation chardon hist des sacremens tom iv p          of the canonical epistles of st basil  and as it was impossible in the period of human life to purge the accumulated guilt of the massacre of thessalonica the murderer should have been excluded from the holy communion till the hour of his death but the archbishop consulting the maxims of religious policy granted some indulgence to the rank of his illustrious penitent who humbled in the dust the pride of the diadem and the public edification might be admitted as a weighty reason to abridge the duration of his punishment it was sufficient that the emperor of the romans stripped of the ensigns of royalty should appear in a mournful and suppliant posture and that in the midst of the church of milan he should humbly solicit with sighs and tears the pardon of his sins the penance of theodosius is authenticated by ambrose tom vi de obit theodos c    p   0  augustine de

ambrose employed the various methods of mildness and severity after a delay of about eight months theodosius was restored to the communion of the faithful and the edict which interposes a salutary interval of thirty days between the sentence and the execution may be accepted as the worthy fruits of his repentance codex theodos l ix tit xl leg    the date and circumstances of this law are

sanguinary passions the cause of humanity and that of persecution have been asserted by the same ambrose with equal energy and with equal success  after the defeat and death of the tyrant of generosity of theodosius a d          gaul the roman world was in the possession of theodosius he derived from the choice of gratian his honorable title to the provinces of the east he had acquired the west by the right of conquest and the three years which he spent in italy were usefully employed to restore the authority of the laws and to correct the abuses which had prevailed with impunity under the usurpation of maximus and the minority of valentinian the name of valentinian was regularly inserted in the public acts but the tender age and doubtful faith of the son of justina appeared to require the prudent care of an orthodox guardian and his specious ambition might have excluded the unfortunate youth without a struggle and almost without a murmur from the administration and even from the inheritance of the empire if theodosius had consulted the rigid maxims of interest and policy his conduct would have been justified by his friends but the generosity of his behavior on this memorable occasion has extorted the applause of his most inveterate enemies he seated valentinian on the throne of milan and without stipulating any present or future advantages restored him to the absolute dominion of all the provinces from which he had been driven by the arms of maximus to the restitution of his ample patrimony theodosius added the free and generous gift of the countries beyond the alps which his successful valor had recovered from the assassin of gratian  is the niggard praise of zosimus himself l iv p     augustine says with some happiness of expression valentinianum misericordissima veneratione restituit  satisfied with the glory which he had acquired by revenging the death of his benefactor and delivering the west from the yoke of tyranny the emperor returned from milan to constantinople and in the peaceful possession of the east insensibly relapsed into his former habits of luxury and indolence theodosius discharged his obligation to the brother he indulged his conjugal tenderness to the sister of valentinian and posterity which admires the pure and singular glory of his elevation must applaud his unrivalled generosity in the use of victory  the empress justina did not long survive her return to italy and though she beheld the character of valentinian a d     triumph of theodosius she was not allowed to influence the government of her son sozomen l vii c    his chronology is very irregular  the pernicious attachment to the arian sect which valentinian had imbibed from her example and instructions were soon erased by the lessons of a more orthodox education his growing zeal for the faith of nice and his filial reverence for the character and authority of ambrose disposed the catholics to entertain the most favorable opinion of the virtues of the young emperor of the west see ambrose tom ii de obit valentinian c    etc p      c    etc p      when the young emperor gave an entertainment he fasted himself he refused to see an handsome actress etc since he ordered his wild beasts to be killed it is ungenerous in philostorgius l xi c   to reproach him with the love of that amusement  they applauded his chastity and temperance his contempt of pleasure his application to business and his tender affection for his two sisters which could not however seduce his impartial equity to pronounce an unjust sentence against the meanest of his subjects but this amiable youth before he had accomplished the twentieth year of his age was oppressed by domestic treason and the empire was again involved in the horrors of a

the victory mastergeneral of the armies of gaul his real merit and apparent fidelity had gained the confidence both of the prince and people his boundless liberality corrupted the allegiance of the troops and whilst he was universally esteemed as the pillar of the state the bold and crafty barbarian was secretly determined either to rule or to ruin the empire of the west the important commands of the army were distributed among the franks the creatures of arbogastes were promoted to all the honors and offices of the civil government the progress of the conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the presence of valentinian and the emperor without power and without intelligence insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent condition of a captive gregory of tours l ii c   p

arise only from the rash and impatient temper of youth may be heartily ascribed to the generous spirit of a prince who felt that he was not unworthy to reign he secretly invited the archbishop of milan to undertake the office of a mediator as the pledge of his sincerity and the guardian of his safety he contrived to apprise the emperor of the east of his helpless situation and he declared that unless theodosius could speedily march to his assistance he must attempt to escape from the palace or rather prison of vienna in gaul where he had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile faction but the hopes of relief were distant and doubtful and as every day furnished some new provocation the emperor without strength or counsel too hastily resolved to risk an immediate contest with his powerful general he received arbogastes on the throne and as the count approached with some appearance of respect delivered to him a paper which dismissed him from all his employments my authority replied arbogastes with insulting coolness does not depend on the smile or the frown of a monarch and he contemptuously threw the paper on the ground the indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the guards which he struggled to draw from its scabbard and it was not without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using the deadly weapon against his enemy or against himself a few days after this extraordinary quarrel in which he had exposed his death a d     may    his resentment and his weakness the unfortunate valentinian was found strangled in his apartment

supported by the gravity of his manners recommended him to the esteem of the people and the reluctance with which he seemed to ascend the throne may inspire a favorable prejudice of his virtue and moderation the ambassadors of the new emperor were immediately dispatched to the court of theodosius to communicate with affected grief the unfortunate accident of the death of valentinian and without mentioning the name of arbogastes to request that the monarch of the east would embrace as his lawful colleague the respectable citizen who had obtained the unanimous suffrage of the armies and provinces of the west zosimus l iv p     mentions this embassy but he is diverted by another story from relating the event  theodosius was justly provoked that the perfidy of a barbarian should have destroyed in a moment the labors and the fruit of his former victory and he was excited by the tears of his beloved wife  zosim l iv p     he afterward says p   0 that galla died in childbed and

conquest of the west was a task of difficulty and danger he dismissed with splendid presents and an ambiguous answer the ambassadors of eugenius and almost two years were consumed in the preparations of the civil war before theodosius prepares for war he formed any decisive resolution the pious emperor was anxious to discover the will of heave and as the progress of christianity had silenced the oracles of delphi and dodona he consulted an egyptian monk who possessed in the opinion of the age the gift of miracles and the knowledge of futurity eutropius one of the favorite eunuchs of the

gave audience to the crowd of suppliants who successively flowed from every part of the christian world the eunuch of theodosius approached the window with respectful steps proposed his questions

occupy without resistance the provinces of pannonia as far as the foot of the julian alps and even the passages of the mountains were negligently or perhaps artfully abandoned to the bold invader he

military skill the spirit of arbogastes would have disdained a pardon his guilt extinguished the hope of a negotiation and theodosius was impatient to satisfy his glory and revenge by the chastisement of the assassins of valentinian without weighing the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts the emperor of the east immediately attacked the fortifications of his rivals assigned the post of honorable danger to the goths and cherished a secret wish that the bloody conflict might diminish the pride and numbers of the conquerors ten thousand of those auxiliaries and bacurius general of the iberians died bravely on the field of battle but the victory was not purchased by their blood the gauls maintained their advantage and the approach of night protected the disorderly flight or retreat of the troops of theodosius the emperor retired to the adjacent hills where he passed a disconsolate night without sleep without provisions and without hopes theodoret affirms that st john and st philip appeared to the waking or sleeping emperor on horseback etc this is the first instance of apostolic chivalry which afterward became so popular in spain and in the crusades  except that strong assurance which under the most desperate circumstances the independent mind may derive from the contempt of fortune and of life the triumph of eugenius was celebrated by the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp whilst the active and vigilant arbogastes secretly detached a considerable body of troops to occupy the passes of the mountains and to encompass the rear of the eastern army the dawn of day discovered to the eyes of theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger but his apprehensions were soon dispelled by a friendly message from the leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination to desert the standard of the tyrant the honorable and lucrative rewards which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy were granted without hesitation and as ink and paper could not easily be procured the emperor subscribed on his own tablets the ratification of the treaty the spirit of his soldiers was revived by this seasonable reinforcement and they again marched with confidence to surprise the camp of a tyrant whose principal officers appeared to distrust either the justice or the success of his arms in the heat of the battle a violent tempest

enemy disordered their ranks wrested their weapons from their hands and diverted or repelled their ineffectual javelins this accidental advantage was skilfully improved the violence of the storm was magnified by the superstitious terrors of the gauls and they yielded without shame to the invisible powers of heaven who seemed to militate on the side of the pious emperor his victory was decisive and the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the difference of their characters the rhetorician eugenius who had almost acquired the dominion of the world was reduced to implore the mercy of the conqueror and the unrelenting soldiers separated his head from his body as he lay prostrate at the feet of theodosius arbogastes after the loss of a battle in which he had discharged the duties of a soldier and a general wandered several days among the mountains but when he was convinced that his cause was desperate and his escape impracticable the intrepid barbarian imitated the example of the ancient romans and turned his sword against his own breast the fate of the empire was determined in a narrow corner of italy and the legitimate successor of the house of valentinian embraced the archbishop of milan and graciously received the submission of the provinces of the west those provinces were involved in the guilt of rebellion while the inflexible courage of ambrose alone had resisted the claims of successful usurpation with a manly freedom which might have been fatal to any other subject the archbishop rejected the gifts of eugenius declined his correspondence and withdrew himself from milan to avoid the odious presence of a tyrant whose downfall he predicted in disoreet and ambiguous language the merit of ambrose was applauded by the conqueror who secured

represented by philostorgius l xi c   as the effect of sloth and intemperance for which photius calls him an impudent liar godefroy dissert p      the strength of theodosius was unable to support the sudden and violent transition from the palace to the camp and the increasing symptoms of a dropsy announced the speedy dissolution of the emperor the opinion and perhaps the interest of the public had confirmed the division of the eastern and western empires and the two royal youths arcadius and honorius who had already obtained from the tenderness of their father the title of augustus were

west from the hands of his dying father the arrival of honorius at milan was welcomed by a splendid exhibition of the games of the circus and the emperor through he was oppressed by the weight of his disorder contributed by his presence to the public joy but the remains of his strength were exhausted by the painful effort which he made to assist at the spectacles of the morning honorius supplied during the rest of the day the place of his father and the great theodosius expired in the ensuing night notwithstanding the recent animosities of a civil war his death was universally lamented the barbarians whom he had vanquished and the churchmen by whom he had been subdued celebrated with loud and sincere applause the qualities of the deceased emperor which appeared the most valuable in their eyes the romans were terrified by the impending dangers of a feeble and divided administration and every disgraceful moment of the unfortunate reigns of arcadius and honorius revived the memory of their irreparable loss  in the faithful picture of the virtues of theodosius corruption of the times his imperfections have not been dissembled the act of cruelty and the habits of indolence which tarnished the glory of one of the greatest of the roman princes an historian perpetually adverse to the fame of theodosius has exaggerated his vices and their pernicious effects he boldly asserts that every rank of subjects imitated the effeminate manners of their sovereign that every species of corruption polluted the course of public and private life and that the feeble restraints of order and decency were insufficient to resist the progress of that degenerate spirit which sacrifices without a blush the consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of sloth and appetite zosimus l iv p      the complaints of contemporary writers who deplore the increase of luxury and depravation of manners are commonly expressive of their peculiar temper and situation there are few observers who possess a clear and comprehensive view of the revolutions of society and who are capable of discovering the nice and secret springs of action which impel in the same uniform direction the blind and capricious passions of a multitude of individuals if it can be affirmed with any degree of truth that the luxury of the romans was more shameless and dissolute in the reign of theodosius than in the age of constantine perhaps or of augustus the alteration cannot be ascribed to any beneficial improvements which had gradually increased the stock of national riches a long period of calamity or

the pen of a military writer who had accurately studied the genuine and ancient principles of roman discipline it is the just and important observation of vegetius that the infantry was invariably covered with defensive armor from the foundation of the city to the reign of the emperor gratian the relaxation of discipline and the disuse of exercise rendered the soldiers less able and less willing to support the fatigues of the service they complained of the weight of the armor which they seldom wore and they successively obtained the permission of laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets the heavy weapons of their ancestors the short sword and the formidable pilum which had subdued the world insensibly dropped from their feeble hands as the use of the shield is incompatible with that of the bow they reluctantly marched into the field condemned to suffer either the pain of wounds or the ignominy of flight and always disposed to prefer the more shameful alternative the cavalry of the goths the huns and the alani had felt the benefits and adopted the use of defensive armor and as they excelled in the management of missile weapons they easily overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions whose heads and breasts were exposed without defense to the arrows of the barbarians the loss of armies the destruction of cities and the dishonor of the

 and may therefore deserve to be considered as a singular event in the history of the human mind the christians more especially the clergy had impatiently supported the prudent delays of constantine and the equal toleration of the elder valentinian nor could they deem their conquest perfect or secure as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist the influence which ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the youth of gratian and the piety of theodosius was employed to infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their imperial proselytes two specious principles of religious jurisprudence were established from whence they deduced a direct and rigorous conclusion against the subjects of the empire who still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors that the magistrate is in some measure guilty of the crimes which he neglects to prohibit or to punish and that the idolatrous worship of fabulous deities and real demons is the most abominable crime against the supreme

civil dignities of proconsul of africa and prefect of the city the breast of symmachus was animated by the warmest zeal for the cause of expiring paganism and his religious antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius and the inefficacy of his moral virtues as if any one says prudentius in symmach i     should dig in the mud with an instrument of gold and ivory even saints and polemic saints

cautiously avoids every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his sovereign humbly declares that prayers and entreaties are his only arms and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of rhetoric rather than from those of philosophy symmachus endeavors to seduce the imagination of a young prince by displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory he insinuates that the confiscation of the revenues which were consecrated to the service of the gods was a measure unworthy of his liberal and disinterested character and he maintains that the roman sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy if they were no longer celebrated at the expense as well as in the name of the republic even skepticism is made to supply an apology for superstition the great and incomprehensible secret of the universe eludes the enquiry of man where reason cannot instruct custom may be permitted to guide and every nation seems to consult the dictates of prudence by a faithful attachment to those rites and opinions which have received the sanction of ages if those ages have been crowned with glory and prosperity if the devout people has frequently obtained the blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods it must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary practice and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any rash innovations

could only tend to discourage the improvements of art and to replunge the human race into their original barbarism from thence gradually rising to a more lofty and theological tone he pronounces that

senate the emperor proposed according to the forms of the republic the important question whether the worship of jupiter or that of christ should be the religion of the romans the liberty of suffrages

success of his first experiments against the pagans encouraged the pious emperor to reiterate and enforce his edicts of proscription the same laws which had been originally published in the provinces

christian emperors who violated the precepts of humanity and of the gospel the experience of ages had betrayed the weakness as well as folly of paganism the light of reason and of faith had already

basest and most ungenerous artifice the prosecution was conducted with an appearance of equity and moderation which flattered tatian with the hope of a favorable event his confidence was fortified by

dominions of arcadius a feeble youth whom the imperious prefect considered as his pupil rather than his sovereign regardless of the public opinion he indulged his passions without remorse and without

at the expense of the fairest part of his patrimony the honors and emoluments of some provincial government the lives and fortunes of the unhappy people were abandoned to the most liberal purchaser and the public discontent was sometimes appeased by the sacrifice of an unpopular criminal whose punishment was profitable only to the prefect of the east his accomplice and his judge if avarice were not the blindest of the human passions the motives of rufinus might excite our curiosity and we might be tempted to inquire with what view he violated every principle of humanity and justice to accumulate those immense treasures which he could not spend without folly nor possess without danger perhaps he vainly imagined that he labored for the interest of an only daughter on whom he intended to bestow his royal pupil and the august rank of empress of the east perhaps he deceived himself by the opinion that his avarice was the instrument of his ambition he aspired to place his fortune on a secure and independent basis which should no longer depend on the caprice of the young emperor yet he neglected to conciliate the hearts of the soldiers and people by the liberal distribution of those riches which he had acquired with so much toil and with so much guilt the extreme parsimony of rufinus left him only the reproach and envy of illgotten wealth his dependents served him without attachment the universal hatred of mankind was repressed only by the influence of servile fear the fate of lucian proclaimed to the east that the prefect whose industry was much abated in the dispatch of ordinary business was active and indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge lucian the son of the prefect florentius the oppressor of gaul and the enemy of julian had employed a considerable part of his inheritance the fruit of rapine and corruption to purchase the friendship of rufinus and the high office of count of the east but the new magistrate imprudently departed from the maxims of the court and of the times disgraced his benefactor by the contrast of a virtuous and temperate administration and presumed to refuse an act of injustice which might have tended to the profit of the emperors uncle arcadius was easily persuaded to resent the supposed insult and the prefect of the east resolved to execute in person the cruel vengeance which he meditated against this ungrateful delegate of his power he performed with incessant speed the journey of seven or eight hundred miles from constantinople to antioch entered the capital of syria at the dead of night and spread universal consternation among a people ignorant of his design but not ignorant of his character the count of the fifteen provinces of the east was dragged like the vilest malefactor before the arbitrary tribunal of rufinus notwithstanding the clearest evidence of his integrity which was not impeached even by the voice of an accuser lucian was condemned almost without a trial to suffer a cruel and ignominious punishment the ministers of the tyrant by the order and in the presence of their master beat him on the neck with leather thongs armed at the extremities with lead and when he fainted under the violence of the pain he was removed in a close litter to conceal his dying agonies from the eyes of the indignant city no sooner had rufinus perpetrated this inhuman act the sole object of his expedition than he returned amidst the deep and silent curses of a trembling people from antioch to constantinople and his diligence was accelerated by the hope of accomplishing without delay the nuptials of his daughter with the emperor of the east  caetera segnis ad facinus velox penitus regione remotas impiger ire vias this allusion of claudian in rufin i     is again explained by the circumstantial narrative of zosimus l v p             but rufinus soon experienced that a prudent he is disappointed by the marriage of arcadius a d     april    minister should constantly secure his royal captive by the strong though invisible chain of habit and that the merit and much more easily the favor of the absent are obliterated in a short time from the mind of a weak and capricious sovereign while the prefect satiated his revenge at antioch a secret conspiracy of the favorite eunuchs directed by the great chamberlain eutropius undermined his power in the palace of constantinople they discovered that arcadius was not inclined to love the daughter of rufinus who had been chosen without his consent for his bride and they contrived to substitute in her place the fair eudoxia the

latter for want of authentic materials has given too much credit to the legend of metaphrastes  eagerly listened to the artful and flattering descriptions of the charms of eudoxia he gazed with impatient ardour on her picture and he understood the necessity of concealing his amorous designs from the knowledge of a minister who was so deeply interested to oppose the consummation of his happiness soon after the return of rufinus the approaching ceremony of the royal nuptials was announced to the people of constantinople who prepared to celebrate with false and hollow acclamations the fortune of his daughter a splendid train of eunuchs and officers issued in hymeneal pomp from the gates of the palace bearing aloft the diadem the robes and the inestimable ornaments of the future empress the solemn procession passed through the streets of the city which were adorned with garlands and filled with spectators but when it reached the house of the sons of promotus the principal eunuch respectfully entered the mansion invested the fair eudoxia with the imperial robes and conducted her in triumph to the palace and bed of arcadius this story zosimus l v p   0 proves that the hymeneal rites of antiquity were still practiced without idolatry by the christians of the east and the bride was forcibly conducted from the house of her parents to that of her husband our form of marriage requires with less delicacy the express and public consent of a virgin  the secresy and success with which this conspiracy against rufinus had been conducted imprinted a mark of indelible ridicule on the character of a minister who had suffered himself to be deceived in a post where the arts of deceit and dissimulation constitute the most distinguished merit he considered with a mixture of indignation and fear the victory of an aspiring eunuch who had secretly captivated the favor of his sovereign and the disgrace of his daughter whose interest was inseparably connected with his own wounded the tenderness or at least the pride of rufinus at the moment when he flattered himself that he should become the father of a line of kings a foreign maid who had been educated in the house of his implacable enemies was introduced into the imperial bed and eudoxia soon displayed a superiority of sense and spirit to improve the ascendant which her beauty must acquire over the mind of a fond and youthful husband the emperor would soon be instructed to hate to fear and to destroy the powerful subject whom he had injured and the consciousness of guilt deprived rufinus of every hope either of safety or comfort in the retirement of a private life but he still possessed the most effectual means of defending his dignity and perhaps of oppressing his enemies the prefect still exercised an uncontrouled authority over the civil and military government of the east and his treasures if he could resolve to use them might be employed to procure proper instruments for the execution of the blackest designs that pride ambition and revenge could suggest to a desperate statesman the character of rufinus seemed to justify the accusations that he conspired against the person of his sovereign to seat himself on the vacant throne and that he had secretly invited the huns and the goths to invade the provinces of the empire and to increase the public confusion the subtle prefect whose life had been spent in the intrigues of the palace opposed with equal arms the artful measures of the eunuch eutropius but the timid soul of rufinus was astonished by the hostile approach of a more formidable rival of the great stilicho the general or rather the master of the empire of the west zosimus l v p   0 orosius l vii c    and the chronicle of marcellinus claudian in rufin ii     00 paints in lively colors the distress and guilt of the prefect   the celestial gift which achilles obtained and character of stilicho the minister and general of the western empire alexander envied of a poet worthy to celebrate the actions of heroes has been enjoyed by stilicho in a much higher degree than might have been expected from the declining state of genius and of art the muse of claudian stilicho directly or indirectly is the perpetual theme of claudian the youth and private life of the hero are vaguely expressed in the poem on his first consulship       0

benefactor in the review of a period indifferently supplied with authentic materials we cannot refuse to illustrate the annals of honorius from the invectives or the panegyrics of a contemporary writer but as claudian appears to have indulged the most ample privilege of a poet and a courtier some criticism will be requisite to translate the language of fiction or exaggeration into the truth and simplicity of historic prose his silence concerning the family of stilicho may be admitted as a proof that his patron was neither able nor desirous to boast of a long series of illustrious progenitors and the slight mention of his father an officer of barbarian cavalry in the service of valens seems to countenance the assertion that the general who so long commanded the armies of rome was descended from the savage and perfidious race of the vandals vandalorum imbellis avarae perfidae et dolosae gentis genere editus orosius l vii c    jerome tom i ad gerontiam p    calls him a semibarbarian  if stilicho had not possessed the external advantages of strength and stature the most flattering bard in the presence of so many thousand spectators would have hesitated to affirm that he surpassed the measure of the demigods of antiquity and that whenever he moved with lofty steps through the streets of the capital the astonished crowd made room for the stranger who displayed in a private condition the awful majesty of a hero from his earliest youth he embraced the profession of arms his prudence and valor were soon distinguished in the field the horsemen and archers of the east admired his superior dexterity and in each degree of his military promotions the public judgment always prevented and approved the choice of the sovereign he was named by theodosius to ratify a solemn treaty with the monarch of persia he supported during that important embassy the dignity of the roman name and after his return to constantinople his merit was rewarded by an intimate and honorable alliance with the imperial family theodosius had been prompted by a pious motive of fraternal affection to adopt for his own the daughter of his brother honorius the beauty and accomplishments of serena claudian in an imperfect poem has drawn a fair perhaps a flattering portrait of serena that favorite niece of theodosius was born as well as her sister thermantia in spain from whence in their earliest youth they were honorably conducted to the palace of constantinople were universally admired by the obsequious court and stilicho obtained the preference over a crowd of rivals who ambitiously disputed the hand of the princess and the favor of her adoptive father some doubt may be entertained whether this adoption was legal or only metaphorical see ducange fam byzant p    an old inscription gives stilicho the singular title of progener divi theodosii  the assurance that the husband of serena would be faithful to the throne which he was permitted to approach

dilectus equorum and the gemino mox idem culmine duxit agmina the inscription adds count of the domestics an important command which stilicho in the height of his grandeur might prudently retain  and

liberality of the state the beautiful lines of claudian in i cons stilich ii     display his genius but the integrity of stilicho in the military administration is much more firmly established by the unwilling evidence of zosimus l v p      the valor and conduct which he afterward displayed in the defense of italy against the arms of alaric and radagaisus may justify the fame of his early achievements and in an age less attentive to the laws of honor or of pride the roman generals might yield the preeminence of rank to the ascendant of superior genius  si bellica moles ingrueret

the roman achilles offered to the manes of another patroclus the virtues and victories of stilicho deserved the hatred of rufinus and the arts of calumny might have been successful if the tender and vigilant serena had not protected her husband against his domestic foes whilst he vanquished in the field the enemies of the empire compare the poem on the first consulship i         with the laus screnae          where it unfortunately breaks off we may perceive the deep inveterate malice of rufinus  theodosius continued to support an unworthy minister to whose diligence he delegated the government of the palace and of the east but when he marched against the tyrant eugenius he associated his faithful general to the labors and glories of the civil war and in the last moments of his life the dying monarch recommended to stilicho the care of his sons and of the republic  quem fratribus ipse discedens clypeumque defensoremque dedisti yet the nomination iv cons hon     was private iii cons hon     cunctos discedere jubet and may therefore be suspected zosimus and suidas apply to stilicho and rufinus the same equal title of  guardians or procurators    the ambition and the abilities of stilicho were not unequal to the important trust and he claimed the guardianship of the two empires during the minority of arcadius and honorius the roman law distinguishes two sorts of minority which expired at the age of fourteen and of twentyfive the one was subject to the tutor or guardian of the person the other to the curator or trustee of the estate heineccius antiquitat

considered by the byzantine court as an act of hostility the prompt and unexpected obedience of the general of the west convinced the vulgar of his loyalty and moderation and as he had already engaged the affection of the eastern troops he recommended to their zeal the execution of his bloody design which might be accomplished in his absence with less danger perhaps and with less reproach stilicho left the command of the troops of the east to gainas the goth on whose fidelity he firmly relied with an assurance at least that the hardy barbarian would never be diverted from his purpose by any consideration of fear or remorse the soldiers were easily persuaded to punish the enemy of stilicho and of rome and such was the general hatred which rufinus had excited that the fatal secret communicated to thousands was faithfully preserved during the long march from thessalonica to the gates of constantinople as soon as they had resolved his death they condescended to flatter his pride the ambitious prefect was seduced to believe that those powerful auxiliaries might be tempted to place the diadem on his head and the treasures which he distributed with a tardy and reluctant hand were accepted by the indignant multitude as an insult rather than as a gift at the distance of a mile from the capital in the field of mars before the palace of hebdomon the troops halted and the emperor as well as his minister advanced according to ancient custom respectfully to salute the power which supported their throne as rufinus passed along the ranks and disguised with studied courtesy his innate haughtiness the wings insensibly wheeled from the right and left and enclosed the devoted victim within the circle of their arms before he could reflect on the danger of his situation gainas gave the signal of death a daring and forward soldier plunged his sword into the breast of the guilty prefect and rufinus fell groaned and expired at the feet of the affrighted emperor if the

invested with the command of africa his ambition soon usurped the administration of justice and of the finances without account and without control and he maintained during a reign of twelve years the possession of an office from which it was impossible to remove him without the danger of a civil war during those twelve years the provinces of africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant who seemed to unite the unfeeling temper of a stranger with the partial resentments of domestic faction the forms of law were often superseded by the use of poison and if the trembling guests who were invited to the table of gildo presumed to express their fears the insolent suspicion served only to excite his fury and he loudly summoned the ministers of death gildo alternately indulged the passions of

guardians of his throne in the civil war between theodosius and eugenius the count or rather the sovereign of africa maintained a haughty and suspicious neutrality refused to assist either of the contending parties with troops or vessels expected the declaration of fortune and reserved for the conqueror the vain professions of his allegiance such professions would not have satisfied the master

diadem and to supply rome with the customary tribute or rather subsidy of corn in every division of the empire the five provinces of africa were invariably assigned to the west and gildo had consented to govern that extensive country in the name of honorius but his knowledge of the character and designs of stilicho soon engaged him to address his homage to a more distant and feeble sovereign the

preservation to the strength of her seven gates than to the eager haste of alaric who advanced to occupy the city of athens and the important harbor of the piraeus the same impatience urged him to prevent the delay and danger of a siege by the offer of a capitulation and as soon as the athenians heard the voice of the gothic herald they were easily persuaded to deliver the greatest part of their wealth as the ransom of the city of minerva and its inhabitants the treaty was ratified by solemn oaths and observed with mutual fidelity the gothic prince with a small and select train was

expiring paganism has confidently asserted that the walls of athens were guarded by the goddess minerva with her formidable aegis and by the angry phantom of achilles such perhaps as homer iliad xx     has so nobly painted him  and that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence of the hostile deities of greece in an age of miracles it would perhaps be unjust to dispute the claim of the historian zosimus to the common benefit yet it cannot be dissembled that the mind of alaric was ill prepared to receive either in sleeping or waking visions the impressions of greek superstition the songs of homer and the fame of achilles had probably never reached the ear of the illiterate barbarian and the christian faith which he had devoutly embraced taught him to despise the imaginary deities of rome

general are displayed with more genuine luster than in the tumult of a day of battle to extricate himself from the prison of peloponnesus it was necessary that he should pierce the intrenchments which surrounded his camp that he should perform a difficult and dangerous march of thirty miles as far as the gulf of corinth and that he should transport his troops his captives and his spoil over an arm

negociated with the ministers of constantinople the apprehension of a civil war compelled stilicho to retire at the haughty mandate of his rivals from the dominions of arcadius and he respected in the

introduced into the military service the citizens and subjects had purchased an exemption from the indispensable duty of defending their country which was supported by the arms of barbarian mercenaries the fugitives of scythia were permitted to disgrace the illustrious dignities of the empire their ferocious youth who disdained the salutary restraint of laws were more anxious to acquire the riches than to imitate the arts of a people the object of their contempt and hatred and the power of the goths was the stone of tantalus perpetually suspended over the peace and safety of the devoted state the measures which synesius recommends are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot he exhorts the emperor to revive the courage of his subjects by the example of manly virtue to banish luxury from the court and from the camp to substitute in the place of the barbarian mercenaries an army of men interested in the defense of their laws and of their property to force in such a moment of public danger the mechanic from his shop and the philosopher from his school to rouse the indolent citizen from his dream of pleasure and to arm for the protection of agriculture the hands of the laborious husbandman at the head of such troops who might deserve the name and would display the spirit of romans he animates the son of theodosius to encounter a race of barbarians who were

lacedaemonians formerly imposed on the captive helots synesius de regno p         the court of arcadius indulged the zeal applauded the eloquence and neglected the advice of synesius perhaps the philosopher who addresses the emperor of the east in the language of reason and virtue which he might have used to a spartan king had not condescended to form a practicable scheme consistent with the temper and circumstances of a degenerate age perhaps the pride of the ministers whose business was seldom interrupted by reflection might reject as wild and visionary every proposal which exceeded the measure of their capacity and deviated from the forms and precedents of office while the oration of synesius and the downfall of the barbarians were the topics of popular conversation an edict was published at constantinople which declared the promotion of alaric to the rank of mastergeneral of the eastern illyricum the roman provincials and the allies who had respected the faith of treaties were justly indignant that the ruin of greece and epirus should be so liberally rewarded the gothic conqueror was received as a lawful magistrate in the cities which he had so lately besieged the fathers whose sons he had massacred the husbands whose wives he had violated were subject to his authority and the success of his rebellion encouraged the ambition of every leader of the foreign mercenaries the use to which alaric applied his new command distinguishes the firm and judicious character of his policy he issued his orders to the four magazines and manufactures of offensive and defensive arms margus ratiaria naissus and thessalonica to provide his troops with an extraordinary supply of shields helmets swords and spears the unhappy provincials were compelled to forge the instruments of their own destruction and the barbarians removed the only defect which had sometimes disappointed the efforts of their courage  qui foedera rumpit ditatur qui servat eget vastator

his army with the accumulated spoils of three hundred triumphs alpibus italiae ruptis penetrabis ad urbem  this authentic prediction was announced by alaric or at least by claudian de bell getico

thessalonica through the warlike and hostile country of pannonia as far as the foot of the julian alps his passage of those mountains which were strongly guarded by troops and intrenchments the siege of aquileia and the conquest of the provinces of istria and venetia appear to have employed a considerable time unless his operations were extremely cautious and slow the length of the interval would suggest a probable suspicion that the gothic king retreated toward the banks of the danube and reinforced his army with fresh swarms of barbarians before he again attempted to penetrate into the heart of italy since the public and important events escape the diligence of the historian he may amuse himself with contemplating for a moment the influence of the arms of alaric on the fortunes of two obscure individuals a presbyter of aquileia and an husbandman of verona the learned rufinus who was summoned by his enemies to appear before a roman synod tantum romanae urbis judicium fugis ut magis

drawn from the life  who had passed his simple and innocent life in the neighborhood of verona was a stranger to the quarrels both of kings and bishops his pleasures his desires his knowledge were confined within the little circle of his paternal farm and a staff supported his aged steps on the same ground where he had sported in his infancy yet even this humble and rustic felicity which claudian describes with so much truth and feeling was still exposed to the undistinguishing rage of war his trees his old contemporary trees ingentem meminit parvo qui germine quercum aequaevumque

botanist has concealed the oaks under a more general expression    must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country a detachment of gothic cavalry might sweep away his cottage and his family and the power of alaric could destroy this happiness which he was not able either to taste or to bestow fame says the poet encircling with terror her gloomy wings proclaimed the march of the barbarian army and filled italy with consternation the apprehensions of each individual were increased in just proportion to the measure of his fortune and the most timid who had already embarked their valuable effects meditated their escape to the island of sicily or the african coast the public distress was aggravated by the fears and reproaches of superstition claudian de bell get          he may seem prolix but fear and superstition occupied as large a space in the minds of the italians  every hour produced some horrid tale of strange and portentous accidents the pagans deplored the neglect of omens and the interruption of sacrifices but the christians still derived some comfort from the powerful intercession of the saints and martyrs from the passages of paulinus which baronius has

existed on the earth any power presumptuous enough to invade the repose of the successor of augustus the arts of flattery concealed the impending danger till alaric approached the palace of milan but when the sound of war had awakened the young emperor instead of flying to arms with the spirit or even the rashness of his age he eagerly listened to those timid counselors who proposed to convey his sacred person and his faithful attendants to some secure and distant station in the provinces of gaul stilicho alone solus erat stilicho etc is the exclusive commendation which claudian bestows de bell get     without condescending to except the emperor how insignificant must honorius have appeared in his own court had courage and authority to resist this disgraceful measure which would have abandoned rome and italy to the barbarians but as the troops of the palace had been lately detached to the rhaetian frontier and as the source of new levies was slow and precarious the general of the west could only promise that if the court of milan would maintain their ground during his absence he would soon return with an army equal to the encounter of the gothic king without losing a moment while each moment was so important to the public safety stilicho hastily embarked on the larian lake ascended the mountains of ice and snow amidst the severity of an alpine winter and suddenly repressed by his unexpected presence the enemy who had disturbed the tranquillity of rhaetia the face of the country and the hardiness of stilicho are finely described de bell get   0       the barbarians perhaps some tribes of the alemanni respected the firmness of a chief who still assumed the language of command and the choice which he condescended to make of a select number of their bravest youth was considered as a mark of his esteem and favor the cohorts who were delivered from the neighboring foe diligently repaired to the imperial standard and stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of the west to advance by rapid marches to the defense of honorius and of italy the fortresses of the rhine were abandoned and the safety of gaul was protected only by the faith of the germans and the ancient terror of the roman name even the legion which had been stationed to guard the wall of britain against the caledonians of the north was hastily recalled venit et extremis legio praetenta britannis quae scoto dat frena truci de bell get      yet the most rapid march from edinburgh or newcastle to milan must have required a longer space of time than claudian seems willing to allow for the duration of the gothic war    and a numerous body of the cavalry of the alani was persuaded to engage in the service of the emperor who anxiously expected the return of his general the prudence and vigor of stilicho were conspicuous on this occasion which revealed at the same time the weakness of the falling empire the legions of rome which had long since languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage were exterminated by the gothic and civil wars and it was found impossible without exhausting and exposing the provinces to assemble an army for the defense of italy  when stilicho seemed to abandon his sovereign he is pursued and besieged by the goths in the unguarded palace of milan he had probably calculated the term of his absence the distance of the enemy and the obstacles that might retard their march he principally depended on the rivers of italy the adige the mincius the oglio and the addua which in the winter or spring by the fall of rains or by the melting of the snows are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous torrents every traveller must recollect the face of lombardy see fontenelle tom v p     which is often tormented by the capricious and irregular abundance of waters the austrians before genoa were encamped in the dry bed of the polcevera ne sarebbe says muratori may passato per mente a que buoni alemanni che quel

could traverse without impediment the wide and stony beds whose center was faintly marked by the course of a shallow stream the bridge and passage of the addua were secured by a strong detachment of the gothic army and as alaric approached the walls or rather the suburbs of milan he enjoyed the proud satisfaction of seeing the emperor of the romans fly before him honorius accompanied by a feeble train of statesmen and eunuchs hastily retreated toward the alps with a design of securing his person in the city of arles which had often been the royal residence of his predecessors but honorius

proposed the indignity of a capitulation the imperial captive was suddenly relieved by the fame the approach and at length the presence of the hero whom he had so long expected at the head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard stilicho swam the stream of the addua to gain the time which he must have lost in the attack of the bridge the passage of the po was an enterprise of much less hazard and difficulty and the successful action in which he cut his way through the gothic camp under the walls of asta revived the hopes and vindicated the honor of rome instead of grasping the fruit of his victory the barbarian was gradually invested on every side by the troops of the west who successively issued through all the passes of the alps his quarters were straightened his convoys were intercepted and the vigilance of the romans prepared to form a chain of fortifications and to besiege the lines of the besiegers a military council was assembled of the longhaired chiefs of the gothic nation of aged warriors whose bodies were wrapped in furs and whose stern countenances were marked with honorable wounds they weighed the glory of persisting in their attempt against the advantage of securing their plunder and they recommended the prudent measure of a seasonable retreat in this important debate alaric displayed the spirit of the conqueror of rome and after he had reminded his countrymen of their achievements and of their designs he concluded his animating speech by the solemn and positive assurance that he was resolved to find in italy either a kingdom or a grave hanc ego

order and a field of battle and as soon as they had recovered from their astonishment the pious confidence that the god of the christians would assert their cause added new strength to their native valor in this engagement which was long maintained with equal courage and success the chief of the alani whose diminutive and savage form concealed a magnanimous soul approved his suspected loyalty by the zeal with which he fought and fell in the service of the republic and the fame of this gallant barbarian has been imperfectly preserved in the verses of claudian since the poet who celebrates his virtue has omitted the mention of his name his death was followed by the flight and dismay of the squadrons which he commanded and the defeat of the wing of cavalry might have decided the victory of alaric if stilicho had not immediately led the roman and barbarian infantry to the attack the skill of the general and the bravery of the soldiers surmounted every obstacle in the evening of the

the identity of the cimbric and gothic fields must be understood like virgils philippi georgic i   0 according to the loose geography of a poet vercellae and pollentia are sixty miles from each other

patron boldness and retreat of alaric but his reluctant and partial muse bestows more genuine praise on the character of the gothic king his name is indeed branded with the reproachful epithets of pirate and robber to which the conquerors of every age are so justly entitled but the poet of stilicho is compelled to acknowledge that alaric possessed the invincible temper of mind which rises superior to every misfortune and derives new resources from adversity after the total defeat of his infantry he escaped or rather withdrew from the field of battle with the greatest part of his cavalry entire and unbroken without wasting a moment to lament the irreparable loss of so many brave companions he left his victorious enemy to bind in chains the captive images of a gothic king et

committing the fate of the republic to the chance of another battle he proposed to purchase the absence of the barbarians the spirit of alaric would have rejected such terms the permission of a retreat and the offer of a pension with contempt and indignation but he exercised a limited and precarious authority over the independent chieftains who had raised him for their service above the rank of his equals they were still less disposed to follow an unsuccessful general and many of them were tempted to consult their interest by a private negotiation with the minister of honorius the king submitted to the voice of his people ratified the treaty with the empire of the west and repassed the po with the remains of the flourishing army which he had led into italy a considerable part of the roman forces still continued to attend his motions and stilicho who maintained a secret correspondence with some of the barbarian chiefs was punctually apprised of the designs that were formed in the camp and council of alaric the king of the goths ambitious to signalize his retreat by some splendid achievement had resolved to occupy the important city of verona which commands the principal passage of the rhaetian alps and directing his march through the territories of those german tribes whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength to invade on the side of the rhine the wealthy and unsuspecting provinces of gaul ignorant of the treason which had already betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise he advanced toward the passes of the mountains already possessed by the imperial troops where he was exposed almost at the same instant to a general attack in the front on his flanks and in the rear in this bloody action at a small distance from the walls of verona the loss of the goths was not less heavy than that which they had sustained in the defeat of pollentia and their valiant king who escaped by the swiftness of his horse must either have been slain or made prisoner if the hasty rashness of the alani had not disappointed the measures of the roman general alaric secured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks and prepared himself with undaunted resolution to maintain a siege against the superior numbers of the enemy who invested him on all sides but he could not oppose the destructive progress of hunger and disease nor was it possible for him to check the continual desertion of his impatient and capricious barbarians in this extremity he still found resources in his own courage or in the moderation of his adversary and the retreat of the gothic king was considered as the deliverance of italy the getic war and the sixth consulship of honorius obscurely connect the events of alarics retreat and losses  yet the people and even the clergy incapable of forming any rational judgment of the business of peace and war presumed to arraign the policy of stilicho who so often vanquished so often surrounded and so often dismissed the implacable enemy of the republic the first moment of the public safety is devoted to gratitude and joy but the second is diligently occupied by envy and calumny tacco de alarico saepe victo saepe concluso semperque

pupil they applauded the pomp of a triumph which was not stained like that of constantine or of theodosius with civil blood the procession passed under a lofty arch which had been purposely erected

gifts to the shrines of the apostles the senate who in the triumphal procession had been excused from the humiliating ceremony of preceding on foot the imperial chariot was treated with the decent reverence which stilicho always affected for that assembly the people was repeatedly gratified by the attention and courtesy of honorius in the public games which were celebrated on that occasion with a magnificence not unworthy of the spectator as soon as the appointed number of chariotraces was concluded the decoration of the circus was suddenly changed the hunting of wild beasts afforded a various and splendid entertainment and the chase was succeeded by a military dance which seems in the lively description of claudian to present the image of a modern tournament  in these games of

overwhelmed under a shower of stones but the madness of the people soon subsided they respected the memory of telemachus who had deserved the honors of martyrdom and they submitted without a murmur to the laws of honorius which abolished for ever the human sacrifices of the amphitheatre the citizens who adhered to the manners of their ancestors might perhaps insinuate that the last remains of a martial spirit were preserved in this school of fortitude which accustomed the romans to the sight of blood and to the contempt of death a vain and cruel prejudice so nobly confuted by the valor of

usefully applied to reveal the secret and remote causes of the fall of the roman empire the extensive territory to the north of the great wall was possessed after the flight of the huns by the victorious sienpi who were sometimes broken into independent tribes and sometimes reunited under a supreme chief till at length styling themselves topa or masters of the earth they acquired a more solid consistence and a more formidable power the topa soon compelled the pastoral nations of the eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of their arms they invaded china in a period of weakness and intestine discord and these fortunate tartars adopting the laws and manners of the vanquished people founded an imperial dynasty which reigned near one hundred and sixty years over the northern provinces of the monarchy some generations before they ascended the throne of china one of the topa princes had enlisted in his cavalry a slave of the name of moko renowned for his valor but who was tempted by the fear of punishment to desert his standard and to range the desert at the head of an hundred followers this gang of robbers and outlaws swelled into a camp a tribe a numerous people distinguished by the appellation of geougen and their hereditary chieftains the posterity of moko the slave assumed their rank among the scythian monarchs the youth of toulun the greatest of his descendants was exercised by those misfortunes which are the school of heroes he bravely struggled with adversity broke the imperious yoke of the topa and became the legislator of his nation and the conqueror of tartary his troops were distributed into regular bands of an hundred and of a thousand men cowards were stoned to death the most splendid honors were proposed as the reward of valor and toulun who had knowledge enough to despise the learning of china adopted only such arts and institutions as were favorable to the military spirit of his government his tents which he removed in the winter season to a more southern latitude were pitched during the summer on the fruitful banks of the selinga his conquests stretched from corea far beyond the river irtish he vanquished in the

the huns who were oppressed by the arms of the geougen soon withdrew from the presence of an insulting victor the countries toward the euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes and their hasty flight which they soon converted into a bold attack would more naturally be directed toward the rich and level plains through which the vistula gently flows into the baltic sea the north must

barbarians the senate and people trembled at their approach within an hundred and eighty miles of rome and anxiously compared the danger which they had escaped with the new perils to which they were exposed alaric was a christian and a soldier the leader of a disciplined army who understood the laws of war who respected the sanctity of treaties and who had familiarly conversed with the subjects of the empire in the same camps and the same churches the savage radagaisus was a stranger to the manners the religion and even the language of the civilized nations of the south the fierceness of his temper was exasperated by cruel superstition and it was universally believed that he had bound himself by a solemn vow to reduce the city into and threatens rome a heap of stones and ashes and to sacrifice the most illustrious of the roman senators on the altars of those gods who were appeased by human blood the public danger which should have reconciled all domestic animosities displayed the incurable madness of religious faction the oppressed votaries of jupiter and mercury respected in the implacable enemy of rome the character of a devout pagan loudly declared that they were more apprehensive of the sacrifices than of the arms of radagaisus and secretly rejoiced in the calamities of their country which condemned the faith of their christian adversaries yet the jupiter of radagaisus who worshipped thor and woden was very different from the olympic or capitoline jove the accommodating temper of polytheism might unite those various and remote deities but the genuine romans abhorred the human sacrifices of gaul and germany   florence was reduced to the last extremity and the fainting courage of the citizens was supported only by the authority of st ambrose defeat and destruction of his army by stilicho a d  0  who had communicated in a dream the promise of a speedy deliverance paulinus in vit ambros c  0 relates this story which he received from the mouth of pansophia herself a religious matron of florence yet the archbishop soon ceased to take an active part in the business of the world and never became a popular saint  on a sudden they beheld from their walls the banners of stilicho who advanced with his united force to the relief of the faithful city and who soon marked that fatal spot for the grave of the barbarian host the apparent contradictions of those writers who variously relate the defeat of radagaisus may be reconciled without offering much violence to their respective testimonies orosius and augustine who were intimately connected by friendship and religion ascribe this miraculous victory to the providence of god rather than to the valor of man augustine de civitat dei v    orosius l vii c    p          the two friends wrote in africa ten or twelve years after the victory and their authority is implicitly followed by isidore of seville in chron p     edit grot how many interesting facts might orosius have inserted in the vacant space which is devoted to pious nonsense  they strictly exclude every idea of chance or even of bloodshed and positively affirm that the romans whose camp was the scene of plenty and idleness enjoyed the distress of the barbarians slowly expiring on the sharp and barren ridge of the hills of faesulae which rise above the city of florence their extravagant assertion that not a single soldier of the christian army was killed or even wounded may be dismissed with silent contempt but the rest of the narrative of augustine and orosius is consistent with the state of the war and the character of stilicho conscious that he commanded the last army of the republic his prudence would not expose it in the open field to the headstrong fury of the germans the method of surrounding the enemy with strong lines of circumvallation which he had twice employed against the gothic king was repeated on a larger scale and with more considerable effect the examples of caesar must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the roman warriors and the fortifications of dyrrachium which connected twentyfour castles by a perpetual ditch and rampart of fifteen miles afforded the model of an intrenchment which might confine and starve the most numerous host of barbarians franguntur montes planumque per ardua caesar ducit opus pandit fossas turritaque summis disponit castella jugis

tuscany could supply many thousand peasants who would labor though perhaps they would not fight for the salvation of their native country the imprisoned multitude of horses and men the rhetorical expressions of orosius in arido et aspero montis jugo in unum ac parvum verticem are not very suitable to the encampment of a great army but faesulae only three miles from florence might afford space for the headquarters of radagaisus and would be comprehended within the circuit of the roman lines was gradually destroyed by famine rather than by the sword but the romans were exposed during the progress of such an extensive work to the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy the despair of the hungry barbarians would precipitate them against the fortifications of stilicho the general might sometimes indulge the ardour of his brave auxiliaries who eagerly pressed to assault the camp of the germans and these various incidents might produce the sharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the narrative of zosimus and the chronicles of prosper and marcellinus see zosimus l v p     and the chronicles of prosper and marcellinus  a seasonable supply of men and provisions had been introduced into the walls of florence and the famished host of radagaisus was in its turn besieged the proud monarch of so many warlike nations after the loss of his bravest warriors was reduced to confide

more criminal the paulisper detentus deinde interfectus of orosius is sufficiently odious  but the death of the royal captive who was ignominiously beheaded disgraced the triumph of rome and of christianity and the short delay of his execution was sufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and deliberate cruelty orosius piously inhuman sacrifices the king and people agag and the amalekites without a symptom of compassion the bloody actor is less detestable than the cool unfeeling historian  the famished germans who escaped the fury of the auxiliaries were sold as slaves at the contemptible price of as many single pieces of gold but the difference of food and climate swept away great numbers of those unhappy strangers and it was observed that the inhuman purchasers instead of reaping the fruits of their labor were soon obliged to provide the expense of their interment stilicho informed the emperor and the senate of his success and deserved a second time the

baltic miserably perished under the walls of florence such indeed was the fate of radagaisus himself of his brave and faithful companions and of more than onethird of the various multitude of sueves and vandals of alani and burgundians who adhered to the standard of their general a luminous passage of prospers chronicle in tres parts per diversos principes divisus exercitus reduces the miracle of florence and connects the history of italy gaul and germany  the union of such an army might excite our surprise but the causes of separation are obvious and forcible the pride of birth the insolence of valor the jealousy of command the impatience of subordination and the obstinate conflict of opinions of interests and of passions among so many kings and warriors who were untaught to yield or to obey after the defeat of radagaisus two parts of the german host which must have exceeded the number of one hundred thousand men still remained in arms between the apennine and the alps or between the alps and the danube it is uncertain whether they attempted to revenge the death of their general but their irregular fury was soon diverted by the prudence and firmness of stilicho who opposed their march and facilitated their retreat who considered the safety of rome and italy as the great object of his care and who sacrificed with too much indifference the wealth and tranquillity of the distant provinces orosius and jerome positively charge him with instigating the invasion excitatae a stilichone gentes etc they must mean indirectly he saved italy at the expense of gaul  the barbarians acquired from the junction of some pannonian deserters the knowledge of the country and of the roads and the invasion of gaul which alaric had designed was executed by the remains of the great army of

standard of their barbarian allies they paid the penalty of their rashness and twenty thousand vandals with their king godigisclus were slain in the field of battle the whole people must have been extirpated if the squadrons of the alani advancing to their relief had not trampled down the infantry of the franks who after an honorable resistance were compelled to relinquish the unequal contest the victorious confederates pursued their march and on the last day of the year in a season when the waters of the rhine were most probably frozen they entered without opposition the defenseless provinces of gaul this memorable passage of the suevi the vandals the alani and the burgundians who never afterward retreated may be considered as the fall of the roman empire in the countries beyond

predestination soon became the serious employment of the latin clergy the providence which had decreed or foreseen or permitted such a train of moral and natural evils was rashly weighed in the imperfect and fallacious balance of reason the crimes and the misfortunes of the suffering people were presumptuously compared with those of their ancestors and they arraigned the divine justice which did not exempt from the common destruction the feeble the guiltless the infant portion of the human species these idle disputants overlooked the invariable laws of nature which have connected peace with innocence plenty with industry and safety with valor the timid and selfish policy of the court of ravenna might recall the palatine legions for the protection of italy the remains of the stationary troops might be unequal to the arduous task and the barbarian auxiliaries might prefer the unbounded license of spoil to the benefits of a moderate and regular stipend but the provinces of gaul were filled with a numerous race of hardy and robust youth who in the defense of their houses their families and their altars if they had dared to die would have deserved to vanquish the knowledge of their native country would have enabled them to oppose continual and insuperable obstacles to the progress of an invader and the deficiency of the barbarians in arms as well as in discipline removed the only pretense which excuses the submission of a populous country to the inferior numbers of a veteran army when france was invaded by charles the fifth he enquired of a prisoner

the western provinces he landed at boulogne with an inconsiderable force and after he had reposed himself some days he summoned the cities of gaul which had escaped the yoke of the barbarians to acknowledge their lawful sovereign they obeyed the summons without reluctance the neglect of the court of ravenna had absolved a deserted people from the duty of allegiance their actual distress encouraged them to accept any circumstances of change without apprehension and perhaps with some degree of hope and they might flatter themselves that the troops the authority and even the name of a roman emperor who fixed his residence in gaul would protect the unhappy country from the rage of the barbarians the first successes of constantine against the detached parties of the germans were magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive victories which the reunion and insolence of the enemy soon reduced to their just value his negociations procured a short and precarious truce and if some tribes of the barbarians were engaged by the liberality of his gifts and promises to undertake the defense of the rhine these expensive and uncertain treaties instead of restoring the pristine vigor of the gallic frontier served only to disgrace the majesty of the prince and to exhaust what yet remained of the treasures of the republic elated however with this imaginary triumph

events of peace and war have undoubtedly been diminished by the narrow and imperfect view of the historians of the times who were equally ignorant of the causes and of the effects of the most

superficial reader  the execution of the ambitious design which was either stipulated or implied in the articles of the treaty appears to have been suspended by the formidable irruption of radagaisus and the neutrality of the gothic king may perhaps be compared to the indifference of caesar who in the conspiracy of catiline refused either to assist or to oppose the enemy of the republic after the defeat of the vandals stilicho resumed his pretensions to the provinces of the east appointed civil magistrates for the administration of justice and of the finances and declared his impatience to lead to the gates of constantinople the united armies of the romans and of the goths the prudence however of stilicho his aversion to civil war and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state may countenance the suspicion that domestic peace rather than foreign conquest was the object of his policy and that his principal care was to employ the forces of alaric at a distance from italy this design could not long escape the penetration of the gothic king who continued to hold a doubtful and perhaps a treacherous correspondence with the rival courts who protracted like a dissatisfied mercenary his languid operations in thessaly and epirus and who soon returned to claim the extravagant reward of his ineffectual services from his camp near aemona see zosimus l v p         he

have been concealed in the impenetrable darkness of the cabinet if the debates of a popular assembly had not thrown some rays of light on the correspondence of alaric and stilicho the necessity of finding some artificial support for a government which from a principle not of moderation but of weakness was reduced to negociate with its own subjects had insensibly revived the authority of the roman senate and the minister of honorius respectfully consulted the legislative council of the republic stilicho assembled the senate in the palace of the caesars represented in a studied oration the actual state of affairs proposed the demands of the gothic king and submitted to their consideration the choice of peace or war the senators as if they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred years appeared on this important occasion to be inspired by the courage rather than by the wisdom of their predecessors they loudly declared in regular speeches or in tumultuary acclamations that it was unworthy of the majesty of rome to purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a barbarian king and that in the judgment of a magnanimous people the chance of ruin was always preferable to the certainty of dishonor the minister whose pacific intentions were seconded only by the voices of a few servile and venal followers attempted to allay the general ferment by an apology for his own conduct and even for the demands of the gothic prince the payment of a subsidy which had excited the indignation of the romans ought not such was the language of stilicho to be considered in the odious light either of a tribute or of a ransom extorted by the menaces of a barbarian enemy alaric had faithfully asserted the just pretensions of the republic to the provinces which were usurped by the greeks of constantinople he modestly required the fair and stipulated recompense of his services and if he had desisted from the prosecution of his enterprise he had obeyed in his retreat the peremptory though private letters of the emperor himself these contradictory orders he would not dissemble the errors of his own family had been procured by the intercession of serena the tender piety of his wife had been too deeply affected by the discord of the royal brothers the sons of her adopted father and the sentiments of nature had too easily prevailed over the stern dictates of the public welfare these ostensible reasons which faintly disguise the obscure intrigues of the palace of ravenna were supported by the authority of stilicho and obtained after a warm debate the reluctant approbation of the senate the tumult of virtue and freedom subsided and the sum of four thousand pounds of gold was granted under the name of a subsidy to secure the peace of italy and to conciliate the friendship of the king of the goths lampadius alone one of the most illustrious members of the assembly still persisted in his dissent exclaimed with a loud voice this is not a treaty of peace but of servitude zosimus l v p         he repeats the words of lampadius as they were spoke in latin non est ista pax sed pactio servitutis and then translates them into greek for the benefit

might perceive the symptoms intrigues of the palace a d  0  may of his approaching disgrace the generous boldness of lampadius had been applauded and the senate so patiently resigned to a long servitude rejected with disdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom the troops who still assumed the name and prerogatives of the roman legions were exasperated by the partial affection of stilicho for the barbarians and the people imputed to the mischievous policy of the minister the public misfortunes which were the natural consequence of their own degeneracy yet stilicho might have continued to brave the clamours of the people and even of the soldiers if he could have maintained his dominion over the feeble mind of his pupil but the respectful attachment of honorius was converted into fear suspicion and hatred the crafty olympius he came from the coast of the euxine and exercised a splendid office  his actions justify his character which zosimus l v p   0 exposes

praises which the african saint so unworthily bestows might proceed as well from ignorance as from adulation  who concealed his vices under the mask of christian piety had secretly undermined the benefactor by whose favor he was promoted to the honorable offices of the imperial palace olympius revealed to the unsuspecting emperor who had attained the twentyfifth year of his age that he was without weight or authority in his own government and artfully alarmed his timid and indolent disposition by a lively picture of the designs of stilicho who already meditated the death of his sovereign with the ambitious hope of placing the diadem on the head of his son eucherius the emperor was instigated by his new favorite to assume the tone of independent dignity and the minister was astonished to find that secret resolutions were formed in the court and council which were repugnant to his interest or to his intentions instead of residing in the palace of rome honorius declared that it was his pleasure to return to the secure fortress of ravenna on the first intelligence of the death of his brother arcadius he prepared to visit constantinople and to regulate with the

sally of active diligence but the dangerous project of showing the emperor to the camp of pavia which was composed of the roman troops the enemies of stilicho and his barbarian auxiliaries remained

ascribed to his own intercession the merit of their pardon after this tumult honorius embraced for the last time the minister whom he now considered as a tyrant and proceeded on his way to camp of pavia where he was received by the loyal acclamations of the troops who were assembled for the service of the gallic war on the morning of the fourth day he pronounced as he had been taught a military oration in the presence of the soldiers whom the charitable visits and artful discourses of olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy at the first signal they massacred the friends of stilicho the most illustrious officers of the empire two praetorian praefects of gaul and of italy two mastersgeneral of the cavalry and infantry the master of the offices the quaestor the treasurer and the count of the domestics many lives were lost many houses were plundered the furious sedition continued to rage till the close of the evening and the trembling emperor who was seen in the streets of pavia without his robes or diadem yielded to the persuasions of his favorite condemned the memory of the slain and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of their assassins the intelligence of the massacre of pavia filled the mind of stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions and he instantly summoned in the camp of bologna a council of the confederate leaders who were attached to his service and would be involved in his ruin the impetuous voice of the assembly called aloud for arms and for revenge to march without a moments delay under the banners of a hero whom they had so often followed to victory to surprise to oppress to extirpate the guilty olympius and his degenerate romans and perhaps to fix the diadem on the head of their injured general instead of executing a resolution which might have been justified by success stilicho hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost he was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor he distrusted the fidelity of his own party and he viewed with horror the fatal consequences of arming a crowd of licentious barbarians against the soldiers and people of italy the confederates impatient of his timorous and doubtful delay hastily retired with fear and indignation at the hour of midnight sarus a gothic warrior renowned among the barbarians themselves for his strength and valor suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor plundered the baggage cut in pieces the faithful huns who guarded his person and penetrated to the tent where the minister pensive and sleepless meditated on the dangers of his situation stilicho escaped with difficulty from the sword of the goths and after issuing a last and generous admonition to the cities of italy to shut their gates against the barbarians his confidence or his despair urged him to throw himself into ravenna which was already in the absolute possession of his enemies olympius who had assumed the dominion of honorius was speedily informed that his rival had embraced as a suppliant the altar of the christian church the base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was incapable of pity or remorse but he piously affected to elude rather than to violate the privilege of the sanctuary count heraclian with a troop of soldiers appeared at the dawn of day before the gates of the church of ravenna the bishop was satisfied by a solemn oath that the imperial mandate only directed them to secure the person of stilicho but as soon as the unfortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy threshold he produced the warrant for his instant execution stilicho supported with calm resignation the injurious names of traitor and parricide repressed the unseasonable zeal of his followers who were ready to attempt an ineffectual rescue and with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the roman generals submitted his neck to the sword of heraclian zosimus l v p          has copiously though not clearly related the disgrace and death of stilicho

the praise which zosimus reluctantly bestows of his virtues  the pride and power of stilicho constituted his real guilt an honorable reluctance to shed the blood of his countrymen appears to have contributed to the success of his unworthy rival and it is the last humiliation of the character of honorius that posterity has not condescended to reproach him with his base ingratitude to the guardian of his youth and the support of his empire  among the train of dependents whose wealth the poet claudian and dignity attracted the notice of their own times our curiosity is excited by the celebrated name of the poet claudian who enjoyed the favor of stilicho and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron the titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the imperial court he was indebted to the powerful intercession of serena for his marriage with a very rich heiress of the province of africa at the nuptials of orpheus a modest comparison all the parts of animated nature contributed their various gifts and the gods themselves enriched their favorite claudian had neither flocks nor herds nor vines or olives his wealthy bride was heiress to them all but he carried to africa a recommendatory letter from serena his juno and was made happy epist ii ad serenam  and the statue of claudian erected in the forum of trajan was a monument of the taste and liberality of the roman senate claudian feels the honor like a man who deserved it in praefat bell get the original inscription on marble was found at rome in the fifteenth century in the house of pomponius laetus the statue of a poet far superior to claudian should have been erected during his lifetime by the men of letters his countrymen and contemporaries it was a noble design  after the praises of stilicho became offensive and criminal claudian was exposed to the enmity of a powerful and unforgiving courtier whom he had provoked by the insolence of wit he had compared in a lively epigram the opposite characters of two praetorian praefects of italy he contrasts the innocent repose of a philosopher who sometimes resigned the hours of business to slumber perhaps to study with the interested diligence of a rapacious minister indefatigable in the pursuit of unjust or sacrilegious gain how happy continues claudian how happy might it be for the people of italy if mallius could be constantly awake and if hadrian would always sleep see epigram xxx  mallius indulget somno noctesque diesque insomnis pharius sacra profana rapit omnibus hoc italae gentes exposcite votis mallius ut vigilet dormiat ut

philosophy claud in mall theodor cons            the repose of mallius was not disturbed by this friendly and gentle admonition but the cruel vigilance of hadrian watched the opportunity of revenge and easily obtained from the enemies of stilicho the trifling sacrifice of an obnoxious poet the poet concealed himself however during the tumult of the revolution and consulting the dictates of prudence rather than of honor he addressed in the form of an epistle a suppliant and humble recantation to the offended prefect he deplores in mournful strains the fatal indiscretion into which he had been hurried by passion and folly submits to the imitation of his adversary the generous examples of the clemency of gods of heroes and of lions and expresses his hope that the magnanimity of hadrian will not trample on a defenseless and contemptible foe already humbled by disgrace and poverty and deeply wounded by the exile the tortures and the death of his dearest friends see claudians first epistle yet in some places an air of irony and indignation betrays his secret reluctance  whatever might be the success of his prayer or the accidents of his future life the period of a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet but the name of hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion while claudian is read with pleasure in every country which has retained or acquired the knowledge of the latin language if we fairly balance his merits and his defects we shall acknowledge that claudian does not either satisfy or silence our reason it would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet of sublime or pathetic to select a verse that melts the heart or enlarges the imagination we should vainly seek in the poems of claudian the happy invention and artificial conduct of an interesting fable or the just and lively representation of the characters and situations of real life for the service of his patron he published occasional panegyrics and invectives and the design of these slavish compositions encouraged his propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature these imperfections however are compensated in some degree by the poetical virtues of claudian he was endowed with the rare and precious talent of raising the meanest of adorning the most barren and of diversifying the most similar topics his coloring more especially in descriptive poetry is soft and splendid and he seldom fails to display and even to abuse the advantages of a cultivated understanding a copious fancy an easy and sometimes forcible expression and a perpetual flow of harmonious versification to these commendations independent of any accidents of time and place we must add the peculiar merit which claudian derived from the unfavourable circumstances of his birth in the decline of arts and of empire a native of egypt national vanity has made him a florentine or a spaniard but the first epistle of claudian proves him a native of alexandria fabricius bibliot latin

auxiliaries who had been attached to the person of stilicho lamented his death but the desire of revenge was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their wives and children who were detained as hostages in the strong cities of italy where they had likewise deposited their most valuable effects at the same hour and as if by a common signal the cities of italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of universal massacre and pillage which involved in promiscuous destruction the families and fortunes of the barbarians exasperated by such an injury which might have awakened the

invitation of the malcontents who urged the king of the goths to invade italy was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries and he might speciously complain that the imperial ministers still delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of gold which had been granted by the roman senate either to reward his services or to appease his fury his decent firmness was supported by an artful moderation which contributed to the success of his designs he required a fair and reasonable satisfaction but he gave the strongest assurances that as soon as he had obtained it he would immediately retire he refused to trust the faith of the romans unless aetius and jason the sons of two great officers of state were sent as hostages to his camp but he offered to deliver in exchange several of the noblest youths of the gothic nation the modesty of alaric was interpreted by the ministers of ravenna as a sure evidence of his weakness and fear they disdained either to negociate a treaty or to assemble an army and with a rash confidence derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war while they expected in sullen silence that the barbarians should evacuate the confines of italy alaric with bold and rapid marches passed the alps and the po hastily pillaged the cities of aquileia altinum concordia and cremona which yielded to his arms increased his forces by the accession of thirty thousand auxiliaries and without meeting a single enemy in the field advanced as far as the edge of the morass which

familiarly conversant the judicious reader will not always approve the asperity of censure the choice of circumstances or the style of expression he will perhaps detect the latent prejudices and personal resentments which soured the temper of ammianus himself but he will surely observe with philosophic curiosity the interesting and original picture of the manners of rome it is incumbent on me

the rare and almost incredible alliance of virtue character of the roman nobles by ammianus marcellinus and of fortune the long period of her infancy was employed in a laborious struggle against the tribes of italy the neighbors and enemies of the rising city in the strength and ardour of youth she sustained the storms of war carried her victorious arms beyond the seas and the mountains and brought home triumphal laurels from every country of the globe at length verging toward old age and sometimes conquering by the terror only of her name she sought the blessings of ease and tranquillity the venerable city which had trampled on the necks of the fiercest nations and established a system of laws the perpetual guardians of justice and freedom was content like a wise and wealthy parent to devolve on the caesars her favorite sons the care of governing her ample patrimony claudian who seems to have read the history of ammianus speaks of this great revolution in a much less courtly style  postquam jura ferox in se communia caesar transtulit et lapsi mores desuetaque priscis artibus in gremium pacis servile recessi de bell gildonico       a secure and profound peace such as had been once enjoyed in the reign of numa succeeded to the tumults of a republic while rome was still adored as the queen of the earth and the subject nations still reverenced the name of the people and the majesty of the senate but this native splendor continues ammianus is degraded and sullied by the conduct of some nobles who unmindful of their own dignity and of that of their country assume an unbounded license of vice and folly they contend with each other in the empty vanity of titles and surnames and curiously select or invent the most lofty and sonorous appellations reburrus or fabunius pagonius or tarrasius the minute diligence of antiquarians has not been able to verify these extraordinary names i am of opinion that they were invented by the historian himself who was afraid of any personal satire or application it is certain however that the simple denominations of the romans were gradually lengthened to the number of four five or even seven pompous surnames as for instance marcus maecius maemmius furius balburius caecilianus plaeidus see noris cenotaph pisan dissert iv p      which may impress the ears of the vulgar with astonishment and respect from a vain

distinction first granted to acilius the consul after he had subdued by his arms and counsels the power of king antiochus the ostentation of displaying of magnifying perhaps the rentroll of the estates which they possess in all the provinces from the rising to the setting sun provokes the just resentment of every man who recollects that their poor and invincible ancestors were not distinguished from the meanest of the soldiers by the delicacy of their food or the splendor of their apparel but the modern nobles measure their rank and consequence according to the loftiness of their chariots the carrucae or coaches of the romans were often of solid silver curiously carved and engraved and the trappings of the mules or horses were embossed with gold this magnificence continued from the reign of nero to that of honorius and the appian way was covered with the splendid equipages of the nobles who came out to meet st melania when she returned to rome six years before

driving round the immense space of the city and suburbs whenever these persons of high distinction condescend to visit the public baths they assume on their entrance a tone of loud and insolent command and appropriate to their own use the conveniences which were designed for the roman people if in these places of mixed and general resort they meet any of the infamous ministers of their pleasures they express their affection by a tender embrace while they proudly decline the salutations of their fellowcitizens who are not permitted to aspire above the honor of kissing their hands or

egyptians and jews the servile temper of the asiatics and the dissolute effeminate prostitution of the syrians were mingled in the various multitude which under the proud and false denomination of

sufficient plenty of corn was not extended beyond that necessary article of human subsistence and when the popular clamor accused the dearness and scarcity of wine a proclamation was issued by the grave reformer to remind his subjects that no man could reasonably complain of thirst since the aqueducts of agrippa had introduced into the city so many copious streams of pure and salubrious water

reckoned in the baths of diocletian olympiodor apud phot p      the walls of the lofty apartments were covered with curious mosaics that imitated the art of the pencil in the elegance of design and

plebeians without shoes and without a mantle who loitered away whole days in the street or forum to hear news and to hold disputes who dissipated in extravagant gaming the miserable pittance of their wives and children and spent the hours of the night in obscure taverns and brothels in the indulgence of gross and vulgar sensuality ammianus l xiv c   and l xxviii c   after describing the luxury and pride of the nobles of rome exposes with equal indignation the vices and follies of the common people   but the most lively and splendid amusement of the idle multitude depended on the frequent exhibition of public games and spectacles the games and spectacles piety of christian princes had suppressed the inhuman combats of gladiators but the roman people still considered the circus as their home their temple and the seat of the republic the impatient crowd rushed at the dawn of day to secue their places and there were many who passed a sleepless and anxious night in the adjacent porticos from the morning to the evening careless of the sun or of the rain the spectators who sometimes amounted to the number of four hundred thousand remained in eager attention their eyes fixed on the horses and charioteers their minds agitated with hope and fear for the success of the colors which they espoused and the happiness of rome appeared to hang on the event of a race juvenal satir xi

these occasions flocked to the city  the same immoderate ardour inspired their clamours and their applause as often as they were entertained with the hunting of wild beasts and the various modes of theatrical representation these representations in modern capitals may deserve to be considered as a pure and elegant school of taste and perhaps of virtue but the tragic and comic muse of the romans

thousand female dancers and by three thousand singers with the masters of the respective chorusses such was the popular favor which they enjoyed that in a time of scarcity when all strangers were banished from the city the merit of contributing to the public pleasures exempted them from a law which was strictly executed against the professors of the liberal arts ammianus l xiv c   he complains

forgotten that the form of the city was almost that of a circle the geometrical figure which is known to contain the largest space within any given circumference ii the architect vitruvius who flourished in the augustan age and whose evidence on this occasion has peculiar weight and authority observes that the innumerable habitations of the roman people would have spread themselves far beyond the narrow limits of the city and that the want of ground which was probably contracted on every side by gardens and villas suggested the common though inconvenient practice of raising the houses to a considerable height in the air in ea autem majestate urbis et civium infinita frequentia innumerabiles habitationes opus fuit explicare ergo cum recipere non posset area plana tantam

buildings which often consisted of hasty work and insufficient materials was the cause of frequent and fatal accidents and it was repeatedly enacted by augustus as well as by nero that the height of private edifices within the walls of rome should not exceed the measure of seventy feet from the ground the successive testimonies of pliny aristides claudian rutilius etc prove the insufficiency of

rich acquired at an enormous expense the ground which they covered with palaces and gardens but the body of the roman people was crowded into a narrow space and the different floors and apartments of the same house were divided as it is still the custom of paris and other cities among several families of plebeians iv the total number of houses in the fourteen regions of the city is accurately stated in the description of rome composed under the reign of theodosius and they amount to fortyeight thousand three hundred and eightytwo this sum total is composed of    0 domus or great houses of

intercepted all communication with the adjacent country and vigilantly guarded the navigation of the tyber from which the romans derived the surest and most plentiful supply of provisions the first emotions of the nobles and of the people were those of surprise and indignation that a vile barbarian should dare to insult the capital of the world but their arrogance was soon humbled by misfortune and their unmanly rage instead of being directed against an enemy in arms was meanly exercised on a defenseless and innocent victim perhaps in the person of serena the romans might have respected the niece of theodosius the aunt nay even the adoptive mother of the reigning emperor but they abhorred the widow of stilicho and they listened with credulous passion to the tale of calumny which accused her of maintaining a secret and criminal correspondence with the gothic invader actuated or overawed by the same popular frenzy the senate without requiring any evidence of her guilt pronounced the sentence of her death serena was ignominiously strangled and the infatuated multitude were astonished to find that this cruel act of injustice did not immediately produce the retreat of the barbarians and the deliverance of the city that unfortunate city famine gradually experienced the distress of scarcity and at length the horrid calamities of famine the daily allowance of three pounds of bread was reduced to onehalf to onethird to nothing and the price of corn still continued to rise in a rapid and extravagant proportion the poorer citizens who were unable to purchase the necessaries of life solicited the precarious charity of the rich and for a while the public misery was alleviated by the humanity of laeta the widow of the emperor gratian who had fixed her residence at rome and consecrated to the use of the indigent the princely revenue which she annually received from the grateful successors of her husband the mother of laeta was named pissumena her father family and country are unknown ducange fam byzantin p     but these private and temporary donatives were insufficient to appease the hunger of a numerous people and the progress of famine invaded the marble palaces of the senators themselves the persons of both sexes who had been educated in the enjoyment of ease and luxury discovered how little is requisite to supply the demands of nature and lavished their unavailing treasures of gold and silver to obtain the coarse and scanty sustenance which they would formerly have rejected with disdain the food the most repugnant to sense or imagination the aliments the most unwholesome and pernicious to the constitution were eagerly devoured and fiercely disputed by the rage of hunger a dark suspicion was entertained that some desperate wretches fed on the bodies of their fellow creatures whom they had secretly murdered and even mothers such was the horrid conflict of the two most powerful instincts implanted by nature in the human breast even mothers are said to have tasted the flesh of their slaughtered infants ad nefandos cibos erupit esurientium rabies et sua invicem membra laniarunt dum matter non parcit lactenti infantiae et recipit

henriade and the journal de henri iv tom i p        and observe that a plain narrative of facts is much more pathetic than the most labored descriptions of epic poetry  many thousands of the inhabitants of rome expired in their houses or in the streets for want of sustenance and as the public sepulchers without the walls were in the power of the enemy the stench which arose from so many putrid and unburied carcasses infected the air and the miseries of famine were succeeded and aggravated by the contagion of a pestilential disease the assurances plague of speedy and effectual relief which were repeatedly transmitted from the court of ravenna supported for some time the fainting resolution of the romans till at length the despair of any human aid tempted them to accept the offers of a praeternatural deliverance pompeianus superstition prefect of the city had been persuaded by the art or fanaticism of some tuscan diviners that by the mysterious force of spells and sacrifices they could extract the lightning from the clouds and point those celestial fires against the camp of the barbarians zosimus l v p         speaks of these ceremonies like a greek unacquainted with the national superstition of rome and tuscany i suspect that they consisted of two parts the secret and the public the former were probably an imitation of the arts and spells by which numa had drawn down

senate when it was proposed as an essential condition that those sacrifices should be performed in the capitol by the authority and in the presence of the magistrates the majority of that respectable assembly apprehensive either of the divine or of the imperial displeasure refused to join in an act which appeared almost equivalent to the public restoration of paganism sozomen l ix c   insinuates

and already conspicuous in the administration of provinces and to john the first tribune of the notaries who was peculiarly qualified by his dexterity in business as well as by his former intimacy with the gothic prince when they were introduced into his presence they declared perhaps in a more lofty style than became their abject condition that the romans were resolved to maintain their dignity either in peace or war and that if alaric refused them a fair and honorable capitulation he might sound his trumpets and prepare to give battle to an innumerable people exercised in arms and animated by despair the thicker the hay the easier it is mowed was the concise reply of the barbarian and this rustic metaphor was accompanied by a loud and insulting laugh expressive of his contempt for the menaces of an unwarlike populace enervated by luxury before they were emaciated by famine he then condescended to fix the ransom which he would accept as the price of his retreat from the walls of rome all the gold and silver in the city whether it were the property of the state or of individuals all the rich and precious movables and all the slaves who could prove their title to the name of barbarians the ministers of the senate presumed to ask in a modest and suppliant tone if such o king are your demands what do you intend to leave us your lives replied the haughty conqueror they trembled and retired yet before they retired a short suspension of arms was granted which allowed some time for a more temperate negotiation the stern features of alaric were insensibly relaxed he abated much of the rigor of his terms and at length consented to raise the siege on the immediate payment of five thousand pounds of gold of thirty thousand pounds of silver of four thousand robes

the great estates in italy and the provinces were intercepted by the calamities of war the gold and gems had been exchanged during the famine for the vilest sustenance the hoards of secret wealth were still concealed by the obstinacy of avarice and some remains of consecrated spoils afforded the only resource that could avert the impending ruin of the city as soon as the romans had satisfied the rapacious demands of alaric they were restored in some measure to the enjoyment of peace and plenty several of the gates were cautiously opened the importation of provisions from the river and the adjacent country was no longer obstructed by the goths the citizens resorted in crowds to the free market which was held during three days in the suburbs and while the merchants who undertook this gainful trade made a considerable profit the future subsistence of the city was secured by the ample magazines which were deposited in the public and private granaries a more regular discipline than could have been expected was maintained in the camp of alaric and the wise barbarian justified his regard for the faith of treaties by the just severity with which he chastised a party of licentious goths who had insulted some roman citizens on the road to ostia his army enriched by the contributions of the capital slowly advanced into the fair and fruitful province of tuscany where he proposed to establish his winter quarters and the gothic standard became the refuge of forty thousand barbarian slaves who had broke their chains and aspired under the command of their great deliverer to revenge the injuries and the disgrace of their cruel servitude about the same time he received a more honorable reinforcement of goths and huns whom adolphus this gothic chieftain is called by

relating the military exploits of the conquerors of rome without presuming to investigate the motives of their political conduct in the midst of his apparent prosperity alaric was conscious perhaps of some secret weakness some internal defect or perhaps the moderation which he displayed was intended only to deceive and disarm the easy credulity of the ministers of honorius the king of the goths repeatedly declared that it was his desire to be considered as the friend of peace and of the romans three senators at his earnest request were sent ambassadors to the court of ravenna to solicit the exchange of hostages and the conclusion of the treaty and the proposals which he more clearly expressed during the course of the negociations could only inspire a doubt of his sincerity as they might seem inadequate to the state of his fortune the barbarian still aspired to the rank of mastergeneral of the armies of the west he stipulated an annual subsidy of corn and money and he chose the provinces of dalmatia noricum and venetia for the seat of his new kingdom which would have commanded the important communication between italy and the danube if these modest terms should be rejected alaric showed a disposition to relinquish his pecuniary demands and even to content himself with the possession of noricum an exhausted and impoverished country perpetually exposed to the inroads of the barbarians of germany zosimus l v p              but the hopes of peace were disappointed by the weak obstinacy or interested views of the minister olympius without listening to the salutary remonstrances of the senate he dismissed their ambassadors under the conduct of a military escort too numerous for a retinue of honor and too feeble for an army of defense six thousand dalmatians the flower of the imperial legions were ordered to march from ravenna to rome through an open country which was occupied by the formidable myriads of the barbarians these brave legionaries encompassed and betrayed fell a sacrifice to ministerial folly their general valens with an hundred soldiers escaped from the field of battle and one of the ambassadors who could no longer claim the protection of the law of nations was obliged to purchase his freedom with a ransom of thirty thousand pieces of gold yet alaric instead of resenting this act of impotent hostility immediately renewed his proposals of

of idleness and want his troops were soon habituated to severe exercise and plentiful subsistence and his private generosity often supplied the rewards which were denied by the avarice or poverty of the court of ravenna the valor of gennerid formidable to the adjacent barbarians was the firmest bulwark of the illyrian frontier and his vigilant care assisted the empire with a reinforcement of ten thousand huns who arrived on the confines of italy attended by such a convoy of provisions and such a numerous train of sheep and oxen as might have been sufficient not only for the march of an army but for the settlement of a colony but the court and councils of honorius still remained a scene of weakness and distraction of corruption and anarchy instigated by the prefect jovius the guards rose in furious mutiny and demanded the heads of two generals and of the two principal eunuchs the generals under a perfidious promise of safety were sent on shipboard and privately executed while the favor of the eunuchs procured them a mild and secure exile at milan and constantinople eusebius the eunuch and the barbarian allobich succeeded to the command of the bedchamber and of the guards and the mutual jealousy of these subordinate ministers was the cause of their mutual destruction by the insolent order of the count of the domestics the great chamberlain was shamefully beaten to death with sticks before the eyes of the astonished emperor and the subsequent assassination of allobich in the midst of a public procession is the only circumstance of his life in which honorius discovered the faintest symptom of courage or resentment yet before they fell eusebius and allobich had contributed their part to the ruin of the empire by opposing the conclusion of a treaty which jovius from a selfish and perhaps a criminal motive had negociated with alaric in a personal interview under the walls of rimini during the absence of jovius the emperor was persuaded to assume a lofty tone of inflexible dignity such as neither his situation nor his character could enable him to support and a letter signed with the name of honorius was immediately dispatched to the praetorian prefect granting him a free permission to dispose of the public money but sternly refusing to prostitute the military honors of rome to the proud demands of a barbarian this letter was imprudently communicated to alaric himself and the goth who in the whole transaction had behaved with temper and decency expressed in the most outrageous language his lively sense of the insult so wantonly offered to his person and to his nation the conference of rimini was hastily interrupted and the prefect jovius on his return to ravenna was compelled to adopt and even to encourage the fashionable opinions of the court by his advice and example the principal officers of the state and army were obliged to swear that without listening in any circumstances to any conditions of peace they would still persevere in perpetual and implacable war against the enemy of the republic this rash engagement opposed an insuperable bar to all future negotiation the ministers of honorius were heard to declare that if they had only invoked the name of the deity they would consult the public safety and trust their souls to the mercy of heaven but they had sworn by the sacred head of the emperor himself they had touched in solemn ceremony that august seat of majesty and wisdom and the violation of their oath would expose them to the temporal penalties of sacrilege and rebellion zosimus l v p

encompassed on every side by the gothic arms was conducted in tumultuous procession to the palace of augustus and trajan after he had distributed the civil and military dignities among his favorites and followers attalus convened an assembly of the senate before whom in a formal and florid speech he asserted his resolution of restoring the majesty of the republic and of uniting to the empire the provinces of egypt and the east which had once acknowledged the sovereignty of rome such extravagant promises inspired every reasonable citizen with a just contempt for the character of an unwarlike usurper whose elevation was the deepest and most ignominious wound which the republic had yet sustained from the insolence of the barbarians but the populace with their usual levity applauded the change of masters the public discontent was favorable to the rival of honorius and the sectaries oppressed by his persecuting edicts expected some degree of countenance or at least of toleration from a prince who in his native country of ionia had been educated in the pagan superstition and who had since received the sacrament of baptism from the hands of an arian bishop we may admit the evidence of sozomen for the arian baptism and that of philostorgius for the pagan education of attalus the visible joy of zosimus and the discontent which he imputes to the anician family are very unfavourable to the christianity of the new emperor  the first days of the reign of attalus were fair and prosperous an officer of confidence was sent with an inconsiderable body of troops to secure the obedience of africa the greatest part of italy submitted to the terror of the gothic powers and though the city of bologna made a vigorous and effectual resistance the people of milan dissatisfied perhaps with the absence of honorius accepted with loud acclamations the choice of the roman senate at the head of a formidable army alaric conducted his royal captive almost to the gates of ravenna and a solemn embassy of the principal ministers of jovius the praetorian prefect of valens master of the cavalry and infantry of the quaestor potamius and of julian the first of the notaries was introduced with martial pomp into the gothic camp in the name of their sovereign they consented to acknowledge the lawful election of his competitor and to divide the provinces of italy and the west between the two emperors their proposals were rejected with disdain and the refusal was aggravated by the insulting clemency of attalus who condescended to promise that if honorius would instantly resign the purple he should be permitted to pass the remainder of his life in the peaceful exile of some remote island he carried his insolence so far as to declare that he should mutilate honorius before he sent him into exile but this assertion of zosimus is destroyed by the more impartial testimony of olympiodorus who attributes the ungenerous proposal which was absolutely rejected by attalus to the baseness and perhaps the treachery of jovius  so desperate indeed did the situation of the son of theodosius appear to those who were the best acquainted with his strength and resources that jovius and valens his minister and his general betrayed their trust infamously deserted the sinking cause of their benefactor and devoted their treacherous allegiance to the service of his more fortunate rival astonished by such examples of domestic treason honorius trembled at the approach of every servant at the arrival of every messenger he dreaded the secret enemies who might lurk in his capital his palace his bedchamber and some ships lay ready in the harbor of ravenna to transport the abdicated monarch to the dominions of his infant nephew the emperor of the east  but there is a providence such at least was the opinion of the historian procopius procop de bell vandal l i c    that watches he is degraded by alaric a d   0 over innocence and folly and the pretensions of honorius to its peculiar care cannot reasonably be disputed at the moment when his despair incapable of any wise or manly resolution meditated a shameful flight a seasonable reinforcement of four thousand veterans unexpectedly landed in the port of ravenna to these valiant strangers whose fidelity had not been corrupted by the factions of the court he committed the walls and gates of the city and the slumbers of the emperor were no longer disturbed by the apprehension of imminent and internal danger the favorable intelligence which was received from africa suddenly changed the opinions of men and the state of public affairs the troops and officers whom attalus had sent into that province were defeated and slain and the active zeal of heraclian maintained his own allegiance and that of his people the faithful count of africa transmitted a large sum of money which fixed the attachment of the imperial guards and his vigilance in preventing the exportation of corn and oil introduced famine tumult and discontent into the walls of rome the failure of the african expedition was the source of mutual complaint and recrimination in the party of attalus and the mind of his protector was insensibly alienated from the interest of a prince who wanted spirit to command or docility to obey the most imprudent measures were adopted without the knowledge or against the advice of alaric and the obstinate refusal of the senate to allow in the embarkation the mixture even of five hundred goths betrayed a suspicious and distrustful temper which in their situation was neither generous nor prudent the resentment of the gothic king was exasperated by the malicious arts of jovius who had been raised to the rank of patrician and who afterward excused his double perfidy by declaring without a blush that he had only seemed to abandon the service of honorius more effectually to ruin the cause of the usurper in a large plain near rimini and in the presence of an innumerable multitude of romans and barbarians the wretched attalus was publicly despoiled of the diadem and purple and those ensigns of royalty were sent by alaric as the pledge of peace and friendship to the son of

lives of the unresisting citizens and to respect the churches of the apostles st peter and st paul as holy and inviolable sanctuaries amidst the horrors of a nocturnal tumult several of the christian goths displayed the fervor of a recent conversion and some instances of their uncommon piety and moderation are related and perhaps adorned by the zeal of ecclesiastical writers orosius l vii c    p

apostles such was the style of the seventh century two hundred years before the fame and merit had been ascribed not to the apostles but to christ  while the barbarians roamed through the city in quest of prey the humble dwelling of an aged virgin who had devoted her life to the service of the altar was forced open by one of the powerful goths he immediately demanded though in civil language all the gold and silver in her possession and was astonished at the readiness with which she conducted him to a splendid hoard of massy plate of the richest materials and the most curious workmanship the barbarian viewed with wonder and delight this valuable acquisition till he was interrupted by a serious admonition addressed to him in the following words these said she are the consecrated vessels belonging to st peter if you presume to touch them the sacrilegious deed will remain on your conscience for my part i dare not keep what i am unable to defend the gothic captain struck with reverential awe dispatched a messenger to inform the king of the treasure which he had discovered and received a peremptory order from alaric that all the consecrated plate and ornaments should be transported without damage or delay to the church of the apostle from the extremity perhaps of the quirinal hill to the distant quarter of the vatican a numerous detachment of goths marching in order of battle through the principal streets protected with glittering arms the long train of their devout companions who bore aloft on their heads the sacred vessels of gold and silver and the martial shouts of the barbarians were mingled with the sound of religious psalmody from all the adjacent houses a crowd of christians hastened to join this edifying procession and a multitude of fugitives without distinction of age or rank or even of sect had the good fortune to escape to the secure and hospitable sanctuary of the vatican the learned work concerning the city of god was professedly composed by st augustine to justify the ways of providence in the destruction of the roman greatness he celebrates with peculiar satisfaction this memorable triumph of christ and insults his adversaries by challenging them to produce some similar example of a town taken by storm in which the fabulous gods of antiquity had been able to protect either themselves or their deluded votaries see augustine de civitat dei l i c      he particularly appeals to the examples of troy syracuse and tarentum   in the sack of rome some rare and extraordinary examples of barbarian virtue had been pillage and fire of rome deservedly applauded but the holy precincts of the vatican and the apostolic churches could receive a very small proportion of the roman people many thousand warriors more especially of the huns who served under the standard of alaric were strangers to the name or at least to the faith of christ and we may suspect without any breach of charity or candor that in the hour of savage license when every passion was inflamed and every restraint was removed the precepts of the gospel seldom influenced the behavior of the gothic christians the writers the best disposed to exaggerate their clemency have freely confessed that a cruel slaughter was made of the romans jerome tom i p     ad principiam has applied to the sack of rome all the strong expressions of virgil

and whenever the barbarians were provoked by opposition they extended the promiscuous massacre to the feeble the innocent and the helpless the private revenge of forty thousand slaves was exercised without pity or remorse and the ignominious lashes which they had formerly received were washed away in the blood of the guilty or obnoxious families the matrons and virgins of rome were exposed to injuries more dreadful in the apprehension of chastity than death itself and the ecclesiastical historian has selected an example of female virtue for the admiration of future ages sozomen l ix c  0 augustine de civitat dei l i c    intimates that some virgins or matrons actually killed themselves to escape violation and though he admires their spirit he is obliged by his theology to condemn their rash presumption perhaps the good bishop of hippo was too easy in the belief as well as too rigid in the censure of this act of female heroism the twenty maidens if they ever existed who threw themselves into the elbe when magdeburgh was taken by storm have been multiplied to the number of twelve hundred see hartes history of gustavus adolphus vol i p  0   a roman lady of singular beauty

efforts respectfully conducted her to the sanctuary of the vatican and gave six pieces of gold to the guards of the church on condition that they should restore her inviolate to the arms of her husband such instances of courage and generosity were not extremely common the brutal soldiers satisfied their sensual appetites without consulting either the inclination or the duties of their female captives and a nice question of casuistry was seriously agitated whether those tender victims who had inflexibly refused their consent to the violation which they sustained had lost by their misfortune the glorious crown of virginity see augustine de civitat dei l i c       he treats the subject with remarkable accuracy and after admitting that there cannot be any crime where there is no consent he adds sed quia non solum quod ad dolorem verum etiam quod ad libidinem pertinet in corpore alieno perpetrari potest quicquid tale factum fuerit etsi retentam constantissimo animo pudicitiam

physical virginity  there were other losses indeed of a more substantial kind and more general concern it cannot be presumed that all the barbarians were at at all times capable of perpetrating such amorous outrages and the want of youth or beauty or chastity protected the greatest part of the roman women from the danger of a rape but avarice is an insatiate and universal passion since the enjoyment of almost every object that can afford pleasure to the different tastes and tempers of mankind may be procured by the possession of wealth in the pillage of rome a just preference was given to gold and jewels which contain the greatest value in the smallest compass and weight but after these portable riches had been removed by the more diligent robbers the palaces of rome were rudely stripped of their splendid and costly furniture the sideboards of massy plate and the variegated wardrobes of silk and purple were irregularly piled in the wagons that always followed the march of a gothic army the most exquisite works of art were roughly handled or wantonly destroyed many a statue was melted for the sake of the precious materials and many a vase in the division of the spoil was shivered into fragments by the stroke of a battleaxe the acquisition of riches served only to stimulate the avarice of the rapacious barbarians who proceeded by threats by blows and by tortures to

prosperous fortune were suddenly reduced to the miserable condition of captives and exiles as the barbarians had more occasion for money than for slaves they fixed at a moderate price the redemption of their indigent prisoners and the ransom was often paid by the benevolence of their friends or the charity of strangers multi christiani in captivitatem ducti sunt augustine de civ dei l i c    and

the goths was incapable of bearing the salutary yoke of laws and civil government from that moment i proposed to myself a different object of glory and ambition and it is now my sincere wish that the

miserable remnant which the enemy had spared was cruelly ravished by their pretended allies yet some specious colors were not wanting to palliate or justify the violence of the goths the cities of gaul which they attacked might perhaps be considered as in a state of rebellion against the government of honorius the articles of the treaty or the secret instructions of the court might sometimes be alleged in favor of the seeming usurpations of adolphus and the guilt of any irregular unsuccessful act of hostility might always be imputed with an appearance of truth to the ungovernable spirit of a

prepared to invade italy and his fleet when it cast anchor at the mouth of the tyber indeed surpassed the fleets of xerxes and alexander if all the vessels including the royal galley and the smallest boat did actually amount to the incredible number of three thousand two hundred orosius composed his history in africa only two years after the event yet his authority seems to be overbalanced by the

nature he was probably ignorant of the causes and events which preserved him from these impending dangers and as italy was no longer invaded by any foreign or domestic enemies he peaceably existed in the palace of ravenna while the tyrants beyond the alps were repeatedly vanquished in the name and by the lieutenants of the son of theodosius the materials for the lives of all these tyrants are

precaution of observing in this place that he survived the last siege of rome about thirteen years  the usurpation of constantine who received revolutions of gaul and spain a d  0       the purple from the legions of britain had been successful and seemed to be secure his title was acknowledged from the wall of antoninus to the columns of hercules and in the midst of the public disorder he shared the dominion and the plunder of gaul and spain with the tribes of barbarians whose destructive progress was no longer checked by the rhine or pyrenees stained with the blood of the kinsmen of honorius he extorted from the court of ravenna with which he secretly corresponded the ratification of his rebellious claims constantine engaged himself by a solemn promise to deliver italy from the goths advanced as far as the banks of the po and after alarming rather than assisting his pusillanimous ally hastily returned to the palace of arles to celebrate with intemperate luxury his vain and ostentatious triumph but this transient prosperity was soon interrupted and destroyed by the revolt of count gerontius the bravest of his generals who during the absence of his son constans a prince already invested with the imperial purple had been left to command in the provinces of spain for some reason of which we are ignorant gerontius instead of assuming the diadem placed it on the head of his friend maximus who fixed his residence at tarragona while the active count pressed forwards through the pyrenees to surprise the two emperors constantine and constans before they could prepare for their defense the son was made prisoner at vienna and immediately put to death and the unfortunate youth had scarcely leisure to deplore the elevation of his family which had tempted or compelled him sacrilegiously to desert the peaceful obscurity of the monastic life the father maintained a siege within the walls of arles but those walls must have yielded to the assailants had not the city been unexpectedly relieved by the approach of an italian army the name of honorius the proclamation of a lawful emperor astonished the contending parties of the rebels gerontius abandoned by his own troops escaped to the confines of spain and rescued his name from oblivion by the roman courage which appeared to animate the last moments of his life in the middle of the night a great body of his perfidious soldiers surrounded and attacked his house which he had strongly barricaded his wife a valiant friend of the nation of the alani and some faithful slaves were still attached to his person and he used with so much skill and resolution a large magazine of darts and arrows that above three hundred of the assailants lost their lives in the attempt his slaves when all the missile weapons were spent fled at the dawn of day and gerontius if he had not been restrained by conjugal tenderness might have imitated their example till the soldiers provoked by such obstinate resistance applied fire on all sides to the house in this fatal extremity he complied with the request of his barbarian friend and cut off his head the wife of gerontius who conjured him not to abandon her to a life of misery and disgrace eagerly presented her neck to his sword and the tragic scene was terminated by the death of the count himself who after three ineffectual strokes drew a short dagger and sheathed it in his heart the praises which sozomen has bestowed on this act of despair appear strange and scandalous in the mouth of an ecclesiastical historian he observes p     that the wife of gerontius was a christian and that her death was worthy of her religion and of immortal fame  the unprotected maximus whom he had invested with the purple was indebted for his life to the contempt that was entertained of his power and abilities the caprice of the barbarians who ravaged spain once more seated this imperial phantom on the throne but they soon resigned him to the justice of honorius and the tyrant maximus after he had been shown to the people of ravenna and rome was publicly executed  the general constantius was his name who character and victories of the general constantius raised by his approach the siege of arles and dissipated the troops of gerontius was born a roman and this remarkable distinction is strongly expressive of the decay of military spirit among the subjects of the empire the strength and majesty which were conspicuous in the person of that general  is the expression of olympiodorus which he seems to have borrowed from aeolus a tragedy of euripides of which some fragments only are now extant euripid barnes tom ii p     ver    this allusion may prove that the ancient tragic poets were still familiar to the greeks of the fifth century  marked him in the popular opinion as a candidate worthy of the throne which he afterward ascended in the familiar intercourse of private life his manners were cheerful and engaging nor would he sometimes disdain in the license of convivial mirth to vie with the pantomimes themselves in the exercises of their ridiculous profession but when the trumpet summoned him to arms when he mounted his horse and bending down for such was his singular practice almost upon the neck fiercely rolled his large animated eyes round the field constantius then struck terror into his foes and inspired his soldiers with the assurance of victory he had received from the court of ravenna the important commission of extirpating rebellion in the provinces of the west and the pretended emperor constantine after enjoying a short and anxious respite was again besieged in his capital by the arms of a more formidable enemy yet this interval allowed time for a successful negotiation with the franks and alemanni and his ambassador edobic soon returned at the head of an army to disturb the operations of the siege of arles the roman general instead of expecting the attack in his lines boldly and perhaps wisely resolved to pass the rhone and to meet the barbarians his measures were conducted with so much skill and secrecy that while they engaged the infantry of constantius in the front they were suddenly attacked surrounded and destroyed by the cavalry of his lieutenant ulphilas who had silently gained an advantageous post in their rear the remains of the army of edobic were preserved by flight or submission and their leader escaped from the field of battle to the house of a faithless friend who too clearly understood that the head of his obnoxious guest would be an acceptable and lucrative present for the imperial general on this occasion constantius behaved with the magnanimity of a genuine roman subduing or suppressing every sentiment of jealousy he publicly acknowledged the merit and services of ulphilas but he turned with horror from the assassin of edobic and sternly intimated his commands that the camp should no longer be polluted by the presence of an ungrateful wretch who had violated the laws of friendship and hospitality the usurper who beheld from the walls of arles the ruin of his last hopes was tempted to place some confidence in so generous a conqueror he required a solemn promise for his security and after receiving by the imposition of hands the sacred character of a christian presbyter he ventured to open the gates of the city but he soon experienced that the principles of honor and integrity which might regulate the ordinary conduct of constantius were superseded by the loose doctrines of political morality the roman death of the usurper constantine a d     nov    general indeed refused to sully his laurels with the blood of constantine but the abdicated emperor and his son julian were sent under a strong guard into italy and before they reached the palace of ravenna they met the ministers of death  at a time when it was universally confessed fall of the usurpers jovinus sebastian and attaius a d          that almost every man in the empire was superior in personal merit to the princes whom the accident of their birth had seated on the throne a rapid succession of usurpers regardless of the fate of their predecessors still continued to arise this mischief was peculiarly felt in the provinces of spain and gaul where the principles of order and obedience had been extinguished by war and rebellion before constantine resigned the purple and in the fourth month of the siege of arles intelligence was received in the imperial camp that jovinus had assumed the diadem at mentz in the upper germany at the instigation of goar king of the alani and of guntiarius king of the burgundians and that the candidate on whom they had bestowed the empire advanced with a formidable host of barbarians from the banks of the rhine to those of the rhone every circumstance is dark and extraordinary in the short history of the reign of jovinus it was natural to expect that a brave and skilful general at the head of a victorious army would have asserted in a field of battle the justice of the cause of honorius the hasty retreat of constantius might be justified by weighty reasons but he resigned without a struggle the possession of gaul and dardanus the praetorian prefect is recorded as the only magistrate who refused to yield obedience to the usurper sidonius apollinaris l v epist   p     and not sirmond p    after stigmatising the inconstancy of constantine the facility of jovinus the perfidy of gerontius continues to observe that all the vices of these tyrants were united in the person of dardanus yet the prefect supported a respectable character in the world and even in the church held a devout correspondence with st augustine and st jerome and was complimented by the latter tom iii p    with the epithets of christianorum nobilissime and nobilium christianissime  when the goths two years after the siege of rome established their quarters in gaul it was natural to suppose that their inclinations could be divided only between the emperor honorius with whom they had formed a recent alliance and the degraded attalus whom they reserved in their camp for the occasional purpose of acting the part of a musician or a monarch yet in a moment of disgust for which it is not easy to assign a cause or a date adolphus connected himself with the usurper of gaul and imposed on attalus the ignominious task of negociating the treaty which ratified his own disgrace we are again surprised to read that instead of considering the gothic alliance as the firmest support of his throne jovinus upbraided in dark and ambiguous language the officious importunity of attalus that scorning the advice of his great ally he invested with the purple his brother sebastian and that he most imprudently accepted the service of sarus when that gallant chief the soldier of honorius was provoked to desert the court of a prince who knew not how to reward or punish adolphus educated among a race of warriors who esteemed the duty of revenge as the most precious and sacred portion of their inheritance advanced with a body of ten thousand goths to encounter the hereditary enemy of the house of balti he attacked sarus at an

of the goths executed his promise without difficulty or delay the helpless brothers unsupported by any personal merit were abandoned by their barbarian auxiliaries and the short opposition of valentia

abandoned to his fate but when the gothic king withdrew his protection he was restrained by pity or contempt from offering any violence to the person of attalus the unfortunate attalus who was left without subjects or allies embarked in one of the ports of spain in search of some secure and solitary retreat but he was intercepted at sea conducted to the presence of honorius led in triumph through the streets of rome or ravenna and publicly exposed to the gazing multitude on the second step of the throne of his invincible conqueror the same measure of punishment with which in the days of his prosperity he was accused of menacing his rival was inflicted on attalus himself he was condemned after the amputation of two fingers to a perpetual exile in the isle of lipari where he was supplied with the decent necessaries of life the remainder of the reign of honorius was undisturbed by rebellion and it may be observed that in the space of five years seven usurpers had yielded to

successfully repelled the frequent attempts of the barbarians but no sooner had the national troops been compelled to resign their post to the honorian bands in the service of constantine than the

mercenary guards of the pyrenees to desert their station to invite the arms of the suevi the vandals and the alani and to swell the torrent which was poured with irresistible violence from the frontiers of gaul to the sea of africa the misfortunes of spain may be described in the language of its most eloquent historian who has concisely expressed the passionate and perhaps exaggerated declamations of contemporary writers idatius wishes to apply the prophecies of daniel to these national calamities and is therefore obliged to accommodate the circumstances of the event to the terms of the prediction  the irruption of these nations was followed by the most dreadful calamities as the barbarians exercised their indiscriminate cruelty on the fortunes of the romans and the spaniards and ravaged with equal fury the cities and the open country the progress of famine reduced the miserable inhabitants to feed on the flesh of their fellow creatures and even the wild beasts who multiplied without control in the desert were exasperated by the taste of blood and the impatience of hunger boldly to attack and devour their human prey pestilence soon appeared the inseparable companion of famine a large proportion of the people was swept away and the groans of the dying excited only the envy of their surviving friends at length the barbarians satiated with carnage and rapine and afflicted by the contagious evils which they themselves had introduced fixed their permanent seats in the depopulated country the ancient gallicia whose limits included the kingdom of old castille was divided between the suevi and the vandals the alani were scattered over the provinces of carthagena and lusitania from the mediterranean to the atlantic ocean and the fruitful territory of boetica was allotted to the silingi another branch of the vandalic nation after regulating this partition the conquerors contracted with their new subjects some reciprocal engagements of protection and obedience the lands were again cultivated and the towns and villages were again occupied by a captive people the greatest part of the spaniards was even disposed to prefer this new condition of poverty and barbarism to the severe oppressions of the roman government yet there were many who still asserted their native freedom and who refused more especially in the mountains of gallicia to

seaports of gaul and gently pressed his march toward the pyrenees this mixture of force and persuasion may be fairly inferred from comparing orosius and jornandes the roman and the gothic historian  he passed the mountains and surprised in the name of the emperor the city of barcelona the fondness of adolphus for his roman bride was not abated by time or possession and the birth of a son surnamed from his illustrious grandsire theodosius appeared to fix him for ever in the interest of the republic the loss of that infant whose remains were deposited in a silver coffin in one of the churches near barcelona afflicted his parents but the grief of the gothic king was suspended by the labors of the field and the course of his victories was soon interrupted by domestic treason he had imprudently received into his service one of the followers of sarus a barbarian of a daring spirit but of a diminutive stature whose secret desire of revenging the death of his beloved patron was

of the ostrogoths in some distant parts of germany or seythia  and a stranger to the royal race singeric the brother of sarus himself was seated on the gothic throne the first act of his reign was the inhuman murder of the six children of adolphus the issue of a former marriage whom he tore without pity from the feeble arms of a venerable bishop the murder is related by olympiodorus but the number of the children is taken from an epitaph of suspected authority  the unfortunate placidia instead of the respectful compassion which she might have excited in the most savage breasts was treated with cruel and wanton insult the daughter of the emperor theodosius confounded among a crowd of vulgar captives was compelled to march on foot above twelve miles before the horse of a barbarian the assassin of an husband whom placidia loved and lamented the death of adolphus was celebrated at constantinople with illuminations and circensian games see chron alexandrin it may seem doubtful whether

to a roman ambassador whose proposals were enforced by the real or supposed approach of a numerous army under the conduct of the brave constantius a solemn treaty was stipulated and observed placidia was honorably restored to her brother six hundred thousand measures of wheat were delivered to the hungry goths this supply was very acceptable the goths were insulted by the vandals of spain with the epithet of truli because in their extreme distress they had given a piece of gold for a trula or about half a pound of flour olympiod apud phot p      and wallia engaged to draw his sword in the service of the empire a bloody war was instantly excited among the barbarians of spain and the contending princes are said to have addressed their letters their ambassadors and their hostages to the throne of the western emperor exhorting him to remain a tranquil spectator of their contest the events of which must be favorable to the romans by the mutual slaughter of their common enemies orosius inserts a copy of these pretended letters tu cum omnibus pacem habe omniumque obsides accipe nos nobis confligimus nobis perimus tibi vincimus immortalis vero quaestus erat reipublicae tuae si utrique pereamus the idea is just but i cannot persuade myself that it was entertained or expressed by the barbarians  the spanish war was obstinately supported during three campaigns with desperate valor and various success and the martial achievements of wallia diffused through the empire the superior renown of the gothic hero he exterminated the silingi who had irretrievably ruined the elegant plenty of the province of boetica he slew in battle the king of the alani and the remains of those scythian wanderers who escaped from the field instead of choosing a new leader humbly sought a refuge under the standard of the vandals with whom they were ever afterward confounded the vandals themselves and the suevi yielded to the efforts of the invincible goths the promiscuous multitude of barbarians whose retreat had been intercepted were driven into the mountains of gallicia where they still continued in a narrow compass and on a barren soil to exercise their domestic and implacable hostilities in the pride of victory wallia was faithful to his engagements he restored his spanish conquests to the obedience of honorius and the tyranny of the imperial officers soon reduced an oppressed people to regret the time of their barbarian servitude while the event of the war was still doubtful the first advantages obtained by the arms of wallia had encouraged the court of ravenna to decree the honors of a triumph to their feeble sovereign he entered rome like the ancient conquerors of nations and if the monuments of servile corruption had not long since met with the fate which they deserved we should probably find that a crowd of poets and orators of magistrates and bishops applauded the fortune the wisdom and the invincible courage of the emperor honorius romam triumphans ingreditur is the

families their slaves and their cattle and the trembling natives relinquished with a sigh the inheritance of their fathers yet these domestic misfortunes which are seldom the lot of a vanquished

colonies of italy and distributed their lands and houses to the veterans who revenged the death of caesar and oppressed the liberty of their country two poets of unequal fame have deplored in similar circumstances the loss of their patrimony but the legionaries of augustus appear to have surpassed in violence and injustice the barbarians who invaded gaul under the reign of honorius it was not

arbitrary will of a master the independence of britain and armorica was soon confirmed by honorius himself the lawful emperor of the west and the letters by which he committed to the new states the care of their own safety might be interpreted as an absolute and perpetual abdication of the exercise and rights of sovereignty this interpretation was in some measure justified by the event after the

with some appearance of truth the most enlightened and civilized portion of the human species the form of government was a pure and simple monarchy the name of the roman republic which so long preserved a faint tradition of freedom was confined to the latin provinces and the princes of constantinople measured their greatness by the servile obedience of their people they were ignorant how much this passive disposition enervates and degrades every faculty of the mind the subjects who had resigned their will to the absolute commands of a master were equally incapable of guarding their lives and fortunes against the assaults of the barbarians or of defending their reason from the terrors of superstition  the first events of the reign of arcadius and administration and character of eutropius a d          honorius are so intimately connected that the rebellion of the goths and the fall of rufinus have already claimed a place in the history of the west it has already been observed that eutropius barthius who adored his author with the blind superstition of a commentator gives the preference to the two books which claudian composed against eutropius above all his other productions baillet jugemens des savans tom iv p     they are indeed a very elegant and spirited satire and would be more valuable in an historical light if the invective were less vague and more temperate  one of the principal eunuchs of the palace of constantinople succeeded the haughty minister whose ruin he had accomplished and whose vices he soon imitated every order of the state bowed to the new favorite and their tame and obsequious submission encouraged him to insult the laws and what is still more difficult and dangerous the manners of his country under the weakest of the predecessors of arcadius the reign of the eunuchs had been secret and almost invisible they insinuated themselves into the confidence of the prince but their ostensible functions were confined to the menial service of the wardrobe and imperial bedchamber they might direct in a whisper the public counsels and blast by their malicious suggestions the fame snd fortunes of the most illustrious citizens but they never presumed to stand forward in the front of empire after lamenting the progress of the eunuchs in the roman palace and defining their proper functions claudian adds   a front recedant  imperii  in eutrop i      yet it does not appear that the eunuch had assumed any of the officient offices of the empire and he is styled only praepositus sacricubiculi in the edict of his banishment see cod theod l ix tit xl leg       or to profane the public honors of the state eutropius was the first of his artificial sex who dared to assume the character of a roman magistrate and general jamque oblita sui nec sobria divitiis mens in miseras leges hominumque negotia ludit judicat cunuchus arma etiam violare parat claudian i        0 with that mixture of indignation and humor which always pleases in a satiric poet describes the insolent folly of the eunuch the disgrace of the empire and the joy of the goths   gaudet cum viderit hostis et sentit jam deesse viros   sometimes in the presence of the blushing senate he ascended the tribunal to pronounce judgment or to repeat elaborate harangues and sometimes appeared on horseback at the head of his troops in the dress and armor of a hero the disregard of custom and decency always betrays a weak and illregulated mind nor does eutropius seem to have compensated for the folly of the design by any superior merit or ability in the execution his former habits of life had not introduced him to the study of the laws or the exercises of the field his awkward and unsuccessful attempts provoked the secret contempt of the spectators the goths expressed their wish that such a general might always command the armies of rome and the name of the minister was branded with ridicule more pernicious perhaps than hatred to a public character the subjects of arcadius were exasperated by the recollection that this deformed and decrepid eunuch the poets lively description of his deformity i   0      is confirmed by the authentic testimony of chrysostom tom iii p     edit montfaucon who observes that when the paint was washed away the face of eutropius appeared more ugly and wrinkled than that of an old woman claudian remarks i     and the remark must have been founded on experience that there was scarcely any interval between the youth and the decrepid age of an eunuch  who so perversely mimicked the actions of a man was born in the most abject condition of servitude that before he entered the imperial palace he had been successively sold and purchased by an hundred masters who had exhausted his youthful strength in every mean and infamous office and at length dismissed him in his old age to freedom and poverty eutropius appears to have been a native of armenia or assyria his three services which claudian more particularly describes were these   he spent many years as the catamite of ptolemy a groom or soldier of the imperial stables   ptolemy gave him to the old general arintheus for whom he very skilfully exercised the profession of a pimp   he was given on her marriage to the daughter of arintheus and the future consul was employed to comb her hair to present the silver ewer to wash and to fan his mistress in hot weather see l i          while these disgraceful stories were circulated and perhaps exaggerated in private conversations the vanity of the favorite was flattered with the most extraordinary honors in the senate in the capital in the provinces the statues of eutropius were erected in brass or marble decorated with the symbols of his civil and military virtues and inscribed with the pompous title of the third founder of constantinople he was promoted to the rank of patrician which began to signify in a popular and even legal acceptance the father of the emperor and the last year of the fourth century was polluted by the consulship of an eunuch and a slave this strange and inexpiable prodigy claudian l i in eutrop       after enumerating the various prodigies of monstrous births speaking animals showers of blood or stones double suns etc adds with some exaggeration  omnia cesserunt eunucho consule monstra the first book concludes with a noble speech of the goddess of rome to her favorite honorius deprecating the new ignominy to which she was exposed   awakened however the prejudices of the romans the effeminate consul was rejected by the west as an indelible stain to the annals of the republic and without invoking the shades of brutus and camillus the colleague of eutropius a learned and respectable magistrate fl mallius theodorus whose civil honors and philosophical works have been celebrated by claudian in a very elegant panegyric  sufficiently represented the different maxims of the two administrations  the bold and vigorous mind of rufinus seems his venality and injustice to have been actuated by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit but the avarice of the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the prefect  drunk with riches is the forcible expression of zosimus l v p  0  and the avarice of eutropius is equally execrated in the lexicon of suidas and the chronicle of marcellinus chrysostom had often admonished the favorite of the vanity and danger of immoderate wealth tom iii p      as long as he despoiled the oppressors who had enriched themselves with the plunder of the people eutropius might gratify his covetous disposition without much envy or injustice but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had been acquired by lawful inheritance or laudable industry the usual methods of extortion were practiced and improved and claudian has sketched a lively and original picture of the public auction of the state the impotence of the eunuch says that agreeable satirist has served only to stimulate his avarice the same hand which in his servile condition was exercised in petty thefts to unlock the coffers of his master now grasps the riches of the world and this infamous broker of the empire appreciates and divides the roman provinces from mount haemus to the tigris one man at the expense of his villa is made proconsul of asia a second purchases syria with his wifes jewels and a third laments that he has exchanged his paternal estate for the government of bithynia in the antichamber of eutropius a large tablet is exposed to public view which marks the respective prices of the provinces the different value of pontus of galatia of lydia is accurately distinguished lycia may be obtained for so many thousand pieces of gold but the opulence of phrygia will require a more considerable sum the eunuch wishes to obliterate by the general disgrace his personal ignominy and as he has been sold himself he is desirous of selling the rest of mankind in the eager contention the balance which contains the fate and fortunes of the province often trembles on the beam and till one of the scales is inclined by a superior weight the mind of the impartial judge remains in anxious suspense  certantum saepe duorum diversum suspendit onus cum pondere judex vergit et in geminas nutat provincia lances claudian i       0  so curiously distinguishes the circumstances of the sale that they all seem to allude to particular anecdotes    such continues the indignant poet are the fruits of roman valor of the defeat of antiochus and of the triumph of pompey this venal prostitution of public honors secured the impunity of future crimes but the riches which eutropius derived from confiscation were already stained with injustice since it was decent to accuse and to condemn the proprietors of the wealth which he was impatient to confiscate some noble blood was shed by the hand of the executioner and the most inhospitable extremities of the empire were filled with innocent and illustrious exiles among the generals and consuls ruin of abundantius of the east abundantius claudian i        0 mentions the guilt and exile of abundantius nor could he fail to quote the example of the artist who made the first trial of the brazen bull which he presented to phalaris see zosimus l v p  0  jerome tom i p    the difference of place is easily reconciled but the decisive authority of asterius of amasia orat iv p    apud tillemont hist des empereurs tom v p     must turn the scale in favor of pityus had reason to dread the first effects of the resentment of eutropius he had been guilty of the unpardonable crime of introducing that abject slave to the palace of constantinople and some degree of praise must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favorite who was satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor abundantius was stripped of his ample fortunes by an imperial rescript and banished to pityus on the euxine the last frontier of the roman world where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the barbarians till he could obtain after the fall of eutropius a milder exile at sidon in phoenicia the destruction of timasius suidas most probably from the history of eunapius has given a very unfavourable picture of timasius the account of his accuser the judges trial etc is perfectly agreeable to the practice of ancient and modern courts see zosimus l v p          00 i am almost tempted to quote the romance of a great master fieldings works vol iv p    etc  vo edit which may be considered as the history of human nature of timasius required a more serious and regular mode of attack that great officer the mastergeneral of the armies of theodosius had signalised his valor by a decisive victory which he obtained over the goths of thessaly but he was too prone after the example of his sovereign to enjoy the luxury of peace and to abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers timasius had despised the public clamor by promoting an infamous dependent to the command of a cohort and he deserved to feel the ingratitude of bargus who was secretly instigated by the favorite to accuse his patron of a treasonable conspiracy the general was arraigned before the tribunal of arcadius himself and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne to suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign but as this form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary the farther enquiry into the crimes of timasius was delegated to saturninus and procopius the former of consular rank the latter still respected as the fatherinlaw of the emperor valens the appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the blunt honesty of procopius and he yielded with reluctance to the obsequious dexterity of his colleague who pronounced a sentence of condemnation against the unfortunate timasius his immense riches were confiscated in the name of the emperor and for the benefit of the favorite and he was doomed to perpetual exile at oasis a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of libya the great oasis was one of the spots in the sands of libya watered with springs and capable of producing wheat barley and palm trees it was about three days journey from north to south about half a day in breadth and at the distance of about five days march to the west of abydus on the nile see danville description de legypte p             the barren desert which encompasses oasis zosimus l v p  00 has suggested the idea of comparative fertility and even the epithet of the happy island herodot iii     secluded from all human converse the mastergeneral of the roman armies was lost for ever to the world but the circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and contradictory manner it is insinuated that eutropius dispatched a private order for his secret execution the line of claudian in eutrop l i   0 marmaricus claris violatur caedibus hammon evidently alludes to his persuasion of the death of timasius   it was reported that in attempting to escape from oasis he perished in the desert of thirst and hunger and that his dead body was found on the sands of libya sozomen l viii c   he speaks from report   it has been asserted with more confidence that his son syagrius after successfully eluding the pursuit of the agents and emissaries of the court collected a band of african robbers that he rescued timasius from the place of his exile and that both the father and the son disappeared from the knowledge of mankind zosimus l v p  00 yet he seems to suspect that this rumor was spread by the friends of eutropius  but the ungrateful bargus instead of being suffered to possess the reward of guilt was soon afterward circumvented and destroyed by the more powerful villainy of the minister himself who retained sense and spirit enough to abhor the instrument of his own crimes  the public hatred and the despair of individuals a cruel and unjust law of treason a d     sept   continually threatened or seemed to threaten the personal safety of eutropius as well as of the numerous adherents who were attached to his fortune and had been promoted by his venal favor for their mutual defense he contrived the safeguard of a law which violated every principle of humanity and justice see the theodosian code l ix tit    ad legem corneliam de sicariis leg   and the code of justinian l ix tit viii ad legem juliam de majestate leg   the alteration of the title from murder to treason was an improvement of the subtle tribonian godefroy in a formal dissertation which he has inserted in his commentary illustrates this law of arcadius and explains all the difficult passages which had been perverted by the jurisconsults of the darker ages see tom iii p           i it is enacted in the name and by the authority of arcadius that all those who shall conspire either with subjects or with strangers against the lives of any of the persons whom the emperor considers as the members of his own body shall be punished with death and confiscation this species of fictitious and metaphorical treason is extended to protect not only the illustrious officers of the state and army who are admitted into the sacred consistory but likewise the principal domestics of the palace the senators of constantinople the military commanders and the civil magistrates of the provinces a vague and indefinite list which under the successors of constantine included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers ii this extreme severity might perhaps be justified had it been only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from any actual violence in the execution of their office but the whole body of imperial dependents claimed a privilege or rather impunity which screened them in the loosest moments of their lives from the hasty perhaps the justifiable resentment of their fellowcitizens and by a strange perversion of the laws the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private quarrel and to a deliberate conspiracy against the emperor and the empire the edict of arcadius most positively and most absurdly declares that in such cases of treason thoughts and actions ought to be punished with equal severity that the knowledge of a mischievous intention unless it be instantly revealed becomes equally criminal with the intention itself bartolus understands a simple and naked consciousness without any sign of approbation or concurrence for this opinion says baldus he is now roasting in hell for my own part continues the discreet heineccius element jur civil l iv p     i must approve the theory of bartolus but in practice i should incline to the sentiment of baldus yet bartolus was gravely quoted by the lawyers of cardinal richelieu and eutropius was indirectly guilty of the murder of the virtuous de thou  and that those rash men who shall presume to solicit the pardon of traitors shall themselves be branded with public and perpetual infamy iii with regard to the sons of the traitors continues the emperor although they ought to share the punishment since they will probably imitate the guilt of their parents yet by the special effect of our imperial lenity we grant them their lives but at the same time we declare them incapable of inheriting either on the fathers or on the mothers side or of receiving any gift or legacy from the testament either of kinsmen or of strangers stigmatized with hereditary infamy excluded from the hopes of honors or fortune let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt till they shall consider life as a calamity and death as a comfort and relief in such words so well adapted to insult the feelings of mankind did the emperor or rather his favorite eunuch applaud the moderation of a law which transferred the same unjust and inhuman penalties to the children of all those who had seconded or who had not disclosed these fictitious conspiracies some of the noblest regulations of roman jurisprudence have been suffered to expire but this edict a convenient and forcible engine of ministerial tyranny was carefully inserted in the codes of theodosius and justinian and the same maxims have been revived in modern ages to protect the electors of germany and the cardinals of the church of rome godefroy tom iii p    it is however suspected that this law so repugnant to the maxims of germanic freedom has been surreptitiously added to the golden bull   yet these sanguinary laws which spread terror rebellion of tribigild a d     among a disarmed and dispirited people were of too weak a texture to restrain the bold enterprise of tribigild a copious and circumstantial narrative which he might have reserved for more important events is bestowed by zosimus l v p  0       on the revolt of tribigild and gainas see likewise socrates l vi c   and sozomen l viii c   the second book of claudian against eutropius is a sine though imperfect piece of history the ostrogoth the colony of that warlike nation which had been planted by theodosius in one of the most fertile districts of phrygia claudian in eutrop l ii        0 very accurately observes that the ancient name and nation of the phrygians extended very far on every side till their limits were contracted by the colonies of the bithynians of thrace of the greeks and at last of the gauls his description ii          of the fertility of phrygia and of the four rivers that produce gold is just and picturesque  impatiently compared the slow returns of laborious husbandry with the successful rapine and liberal rewards of alaric and their leader resented as a personal affront his own ungracious reception in the palace of constantinople a soft and wealthy province in the heart of the empire was astonished by the sound of war and the faithful vassal who had been disregarded or oppressed was again respected as soon as he resumed the hostile character of a barbarian the vineyards and fruitful fields between

that of the saone and the rhone with this difference however that the smaller of the phrygian rivers is not accelerated but retarded by the larger  were consumed with fire the decayed walls of the cities crumbled into dust at the first stroke of an enemy the trembling inhabitants escaped from a bloody massacre to the shores of the hellespont and a considerable part of asia minor was desolated by the rebellion of tribigild his rapid progress was checked by the resistance of the peasants of pamphylia and the ostrogoths attacked in a narrow pass between the city of selgae selgae a colony of the lacedaemonians had formerly numbered twenty thousand citizens but in the age of zosimus it was reduced to a  or small town see cellarius geograph antiq tom ii p      a deep morass and the craggy clifts of mount taurus were defeated with the loss of their bravest troops but the spirit of their chief was not daunted by misfortune and his army was continually recruited by swarms of barbarians and outlaws who were desirous of exercising the profession of robbery under the more honorable names of war and conquest the rumors of the success of tribigild might for some time be suppressed by fear or disguised by flattery yet they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital every misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful hints and the future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious conjecture whenever tribigild advanced into the inland country the romans were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage of mount taurus and the invasion of syria if he descended toward the sea they imputed and perhaps suggested to the gothic chief the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the harbors of ionia and of extending his depredations along the maritime coast from the mouth of the nile to the port of constantinople the approach of danger and the obstinacy of tribigild who refused all terms of accommodation compelled eutropius to summon a council of war the council of eutropius in claudian may be compared to that of domitian in the fourth satire of juvenal the principal members of the former were juvenes protervi lascivique senes one of them had been a cook a second a woolcomber the language of their original profession exposes their assumed dignity and their trifling conversation about tragedies dancers etc is made still more ridiculous by the importance of the debate  after claiming for himself the privilege of a veteran soldier the eunuch entrusted the guard of thrace and the hellespont to gainas the goth and the command of the asiatic army to his favorite leo two generals who differently but effectually promoted the cause of the rebels leo claudian l ii          has branded him with infamy and zosimus in more temperate language confirms his reproaches l v p  0   who from the bulk of his body and the dullness of his mind was surnamed the ajax of the east had deserted his original trade of a woolcomber to exercise with much less skill and success the military profession and his uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed with an ignorance of real difficulties and a timorous neglect of every favorable opportunity the rashness of the ostrogoths had drawn them into a disadvantageous position between the rivers melas and eurymedon where they were almost besieged by the peasants of pamphylia but the arrival of an imperial army instead of completing their destruction afforded the means of safety and victory tribigild surprised the unguarded camp of the romans in the darkness of the night seduced the faith of the greater part of the barbarian auxiliaries and dissipated without much effort the troops which had been corrupted by the relaxation of discipline and the luxury of the capital the discontent of gainas who had so boldly contrived and executed the death of rufinus was irritated by the fortune of his unworthy successor he accused his own dishonorable patience under the servile reign of an eunuch and the ambitious goth was convicted at least in the public opinion of secretly fomenting the revolt of tribigild with whom he was connected by a domestic as well as by a national alliance the conspiracy of gainas and tribigild which is attested by the greek historian had not reached the ears of claudian who attributes the revolt of the ostrogoths to his own martial spirit and the advice of his wife  when gainas passed the hellespont to unite under his standard the remains of the asiatic troops he skilfully adapted his motions to the wishes of the ostrogoths abandoning by his retreat the country which they desired to invade or facilitating by his approach the desertion of the barbarian auxiliaries to the imperial court he repeatedly magnified the valor the genius the inexhaustible resources of tribigild confessed his own inability to prosecute the war and extorted the permission of negotiating with his invincible adversary the conditions of peace were dictated by the haughty rebel and the peremptory demand of the head of eutropius revealed the author and the design of this hostile conspiracy  the bold satirist who has indulged his discontent fall of eutropius a d     by the partial and passionate censure of the christian emperors violates the dignity rather than the truth of history by comparing the son of theodosius to one of those harmless and simple animals who scarcely feel that they are the property of their shepherd two passions however fear and conjugal affection awakened the languid soul of arcadius he was terrified by the threats of a victorious barbarian and he yielded to the tender eloquence of his wife eudoxia who with a flood of artificial tears presenting her infant children to their father implored his justice for some real or imaginary insult which she imputed to the audacious eunuch this anecdote which philostorgius alone has preserved l xi c   and gothofred dissertat p          is curious and important since it connects the revolt of the goths with the secret intrigues of the palace  the emperors hand was directed to sign the condemnation of eutropius the magic spell which during four years had bound the prince and the people was instantly dissolved and the acclamations that so lately hailed the merit and fortune of the favorite were converted into the clamours of the soldiers and people who reproached his crimes and pressed his immediate execution in this hour of distress and despair his only refuge was in the sanctuary of the church whose privileges he had wisely or profanely attempted to circumscribe and the most eloquent of the saints john chrysostom enjoyed the triumph of protecting a prostrate minister whose choice had raised him to the ecclesiastical throne of constantinople the archbishop ascending the pulpit of the cathedral that he might be distinctly seen and heard by an innumerable crowd of either sex and of every age pronounced a seasonable and pathetic discourse on the forgiveness of injuries and the instability of human greatness the agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch who lay grovelling under the table of the altar exhibited a solemn and instructive spectacle and the orator who was afterward accused of insulting the misfortunes of eutropius labored to excite the contempt that he might assuage the fury of the people see the homily of chrysostom tom iii p          of which the exordium is particularly beautiful socrates l vi c   sozomen l viii c   montfaucon in his life of chrysostom tom xiii p     too hastily supposes

the eunuch to the sanctuary suppliciterque pias humilis prostratus ad aras mitigat iratas voce tremente nurus   the powers of humanity of superstition and of eloquence prevailed the empress eudoxia was restrained by her own prejudices or by those of her subjects from violating the sanctuary of the church and eutropius was tempted to capitulate by the milder arts of persuasion and by an oath that his life should be spared chrysostom in another homily tom iii p     affects to declare that eutropius would not have been taken had he not deserted the church zosimus l v p     on the contrary pretends that his enemies forced him  from the sanctuary yet the promise is an evidence of some treaty and the strong assurance of claudian praefat ad l ii    sed tamen exemplo non feriere tuo may be considered as an evidence of some promise    careless of the dignity of their sovereign the new ministers of the palace immediately published an edict to declare that his late favorite had disgraced the names of consul and patrician to abolish his statues to confiscate his wealth and to inflict a perpetual exile in the island of cyprus cod theod l ix tit xl leg    the date of that law jan    a d

alarm the fears of his enemies nor was he capable of enjoying what yet remained the comforts of peace of solitude and of a happy climate but their implacable revenge still envied him the last moments of a miserable life and eutropius had no sooner touched the shores of cyprus than he was hastily recalled the vain hope of eluding by a change of place the obligation of an oath engaged the empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution from constantinople to the adjacent suburb of chalcedon the consul aurelian pronounced the sentence and the motives of that sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government the crimes which eutropius had committed against the people might have justified his death but he was found guilty of harnessing to his chariot the sacred

their naked necks were exposed by the haughty rebel to the edge of the sword till he condescended to grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite the goths according to the terms of the agreement were immediately transported from asia into europe and their victorious chief who accepted the title of mastergeneral of the roman armies soon filled constantinople with his troops and distributed among his dependents the honors and rewards of the empire in his early youth gainas had passed the danube as a suppliant and a fugitive his elevation had been the work of valor and fortune and his indiscreet or perfidious conduct was the cause of his rapid downfall notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the archbishop he importunately claimed for his arian sectaries the possession of a peculiar church and the pride of the catholics was offended by the public toleration of heresy the pious remonstrances of chrysostom which do not appear in his own writings are strongly urged by theodoret but his insinuation that they were successful is disproved by facts tillemont hist des empercurs tom v     has discovered that the emperor to satisfy the rapacious demands of gainas was obliged to melt the plate of the church of the apostles  every quarter of constantinople was filled with tumult and disorder and the barbarians gazed with such ardour on the rich shops of the jewellers and the tables of the bankers which were covered with gold and silver that it was judged prudent to remove those dangerous temptations from their sight they resented the injurious precaution and some alarming attempts were made during the night to attack and destroy with fire the imperial palace the ecclesiastical historians who sometimes guide and sometimes follow the public opinion most confidently assert that the palace of constantinople was guarded by legions of angels  in this state of july  0 mutual and suspicious hostility the guards and the people of constantinople shut the gates and rose in arms to prevent or to punish the conspiracy of the goths during the absence of gainas his troops were surprised and oppressed seven thousand barbarians perished in this bloody massacre in the fury of the pursuit the catholics uncovered the roof and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood till they overwhelmed their adversaries who had retreated to the church or conventicle of the arians gainas was either innocent of the design or too confident of his success he was astonished by the intelligence that the flower of his army had been ingloriously destroyed that he himself was declared a public enemy and that his countryman fravitta a brave and loyal confederate had assumed the management of the war by sea and land the enterprises of the rebel against the cities of thrace were encountered by a firm and wellordered defense his hungry soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin of the fortifications and gainas who vainly regretted the wealth and luxury of asia embraced a desperate resolution of forcing the passage of the hellespont he was destitute of vessels but the woods of the chrsonesus afforded materials for rafts and his intrepid barbarians did not refuse to trust themselves to the waves but fravitta dec    attentively watched the progress of their undertaking as soon as they had gained the middle of the stream the roman galleys zosimus l v p     mentions these galleys by the name of liburnians and observes that they were as swift without explaining the difference between them as the vessels with fifty oars but that they were far inferior in speed to the triremes which had been long disused yet he reasonably concludes from the testimony of polybius that galleys of a still larger size had been constructed in the punic wars since the establishment of the roman empire over the mediterranean the useless art of building large ships of war had probably been neglected and at length forgotten  impelled by the full force of oars of the current and of a favorable wind rushed forwards in compact order and with irresistible weight and the hellespont was covered with the fragments of the gothic shipwreck after

advanced by rapid marches through the plains of thrace and they were soon delivered from the fear of a pursuit by the vanity of fravitta who instead of extinguishing the war hastened to enjoy the popular applause and to assume the peaceful honors of the consulship but a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate the majesty of the empire and to guard the peace and liberty of scythia the

transported with speed and secrecy in a postchariot from antioch to constantinople the unanimous and unsolicited consent of the court the clergy and the people ratified the choice of the minister and both as a saint and as an orator the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine expectations of the public born of a noble and opulent family in the capital of syria chrysostom had been educated by the care of a tender mother under the tuition of the most skilful masters he studied the art of rhetoric in the school of libanius and that celebrated sophist who soon discovered the talents of his disciple ingenuously confessed that john would have deserved to succeed him had he not been stolen away by the christians his piety soon disposed him to receive the sacrament of baptism to renounce the lucrative and honorable profession of the law and to bury himself in the adjacent desert where he subdued the lusts of the flesh by an austere penance of six years his infirmities compelled him to return to the society of mankind and the authority of meletius devoted his talents to the service of the church but in the midst of his family and afterward on the archiepiscopal throne chrysostom still persevered in the practice of the monastic virtues the ample revenues which his predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury he deligently applied to the establishment of hospitals and the multitudes who were supported by his charity preferred the eloquent and edifying discourses of their archbishop to the amusements of the theater or the circus the monuments of that eloquence which was admired near twenty years at antioch and constantinople have been carefully preserved and the possession of near one thousand sermons or homilies has authorized the critics as i am almost a stranger to the voluminous sermons of chrysostom i have given my confidence to the two most judicious and moderate of the ecclesiastical critics erasmus tom iii p      and dupin bibliotheque ecclesiastique tom iii p    yet the good taste of the former is sometimes vitiated by an excessive love of antiquity and the good sense of the latter is always restrained by prudential considerations of succeeding times to appreciate the genuine merit of chrysostom they unanimously attribute to the christian orator the free command of an elegant and copious language the judgment to conceal the advantages which he derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes of ideas and images to vary and illustrate the most familiar topics the happy art of engaging the passions in the service of virtue and of exposing the folly as well as the turpitude of vice almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic representation  the pastoral labors of the archbishop of constantinople his administration and defects a d       0  provoked and gradually united against him two sorts of enemies the aspiring clergy who envied his success and the obstinate sinners who were offended by his reproofs when chrysostom thundered from the pulpit of st sophia against the degeneracy of the christians his shafts were spent among the crowd without wounding or even marking the character of any individual when he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich poverty might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives but the guilty were still sheltered by their numbers and the reproach itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority and enjoyment but as the pyramid rose toward the summit it insensibly diminished to a point and the magistrates the ministers the favorite eunuchs the ladies of the court the females of constantinople distinguished themselves by their enmity or their attachment to chrysostom three noble and opulent widows marsa castricia and eugraphia were the leaders of the persecution pallad dialog tom xiii p    it was impossible that they should forgive a preacher who reproached their affectation to conceal by the ornaments of dress

much larger share of guilt to divide among a smaller proportion of criminals the personal applications of the audience were anticipated or confirmed by the testimony of their own conscience and the intrepid preacher assumed the dangerous right of exposing both the offense and the offender to the public abhorrence the secret resentment of the court encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of constantinople who were too hastily reformed by the fervent zeal of their archbishop he had condemned from the pulpit the domestic females of the clergy of constantinople who under the name of servants or sisters afforded a perpetual occasion either of sin or of scandal the silent and solitary ascetics who had secluded themselves from the world were entitled to the warmest approbation of chrysostom but he despised and stigmatized as the disgrace of their holy profession the crowd of degenerate monks who from some unworthy motives of pleasure or profit so frequently infested the streets of the capital to the voice of persuasion the archbishop was obliged to add the terrors of authority and his ardour in the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction was not always exempt from passion nor was it always guided by prudence chrysostom was naturally of a choleric disposition sozomen and more especially socrates have defined the real character of chrysostom with a temperate and impartial freedom very offensive to his blind admirers those historians lived in the next generation when party violence was abated and had conversed with many persons intimately acquainted with the virtues and imperfections of the saint  although he struggled according to the precepts of the gospel to love his private enemies he indulged himself in the privilege of hating the enemies of god and of the church and his sentiments were sometimes delivered with too much energy of countenance and expression he still maintained from some considerations of health or abstinence his former habits of taking his repasts alone and this inhospitable custom palladius tom xiii p  0 etc very seriously defends the archbishop   he never tasted wine   the weakness of his stomach required a peculiar diet   business or study or devotion often kept him fasting till sunset   he detested the noise and levity of great dinners   he saved the expense for the use of the poor   he was apprehensive in a capital like constantinople of the envy and reproach of partial invitations  which his enemies imputed to pride contributed at least to nourish the infirmity of a morose and unsocial humor separated from that familiar intercourse which facilitates the knowledge and the dispatch of business he reposed an unsuspecting confidence in his deacon serapion and seldom applied his speculative knowledge of human nature to the particular characters either of his dependents or of his equals conscious of the purity of his intentions and perhaps of the superiority of his genius the archbishop of constantinople extended the jurisdiction of the imperial city that he might enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labors and the conduct which the profane imputed to an ambitious motive appeared to chrysostom himself in the light of a sacred and indispensable duty in his visitation through the asiatic provinces he deposed thirteen bishops of lydia and phrygia and indiscreetly declared that a deep corruption of simony and licentiousness had infected the whole episcopal order chrysostom declares his free opinion tom ix hom iii in act apostol p    that the number of bishops who might be saved bore a very small proportion to those who would be damned  if those bishops were innocent such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a wellgrounded discontent if they were guilty the numerous associates of their

stately church and monastery and their proceedings were continued during fourteen days or sessions a bishop and a deacon accused the archbishop of constantinople but the frivolous or improbable nature of the fortyseven articles which they presented against him may justly be considered as a fair and unexceptionable panegyric four successive summons were signified to chrysostom but he still refused to trust either his person or his reputation in the hands of his implacable enemies who prudently declining the examination of any particular charges condemned his contumacious disobedience and hastily pronounced a sentence of deposition the synod of the oak immediately addressed the emperor to ratify and execute their judgment and charitably insinuated that the penalties of treason might be inflicted on the audacious preacher who had reviled under the name of jezabel the empress eudoxia herself the archbishop was rudely arrested and conducted through the city by one of the imperial messengers who landed him after a short navigation near the entrance of the euxine from whence before the expiration of two days he was gloriously recalled  the first astonishment of his faithful

the gates of the palace and the empress agitated by fear or remorse threw herself at the feet of arcadius and confessed that the public safety could be purchased only by the restoration of chrysostom the bosphorus was covered with innumerable vessels the shores of europe and asia were profusely illuminated and the acclamations of a victorious people accompanied from the port to the cathedral the triumph of the archbishop who too easily consented to resume the exercise of his functions before his sentence had been legally reversed by the authority of an ecclesiastical synod ignorant or careless of the impending danger chrysostom indulged his zeal or perhaps his resentment declaimed with peculiar asperity against female vices and condemned the profane honors which were addressed almost in the precincts of st sophia to the statue of the empress his imprudence tempted his enemies to inflame the haughty spirit of eudoxia by reporting or perhaps inventing the famous exordium of a

eastern prelates who were guided from a distance by the advice of theophilus confirmed the validity without examining the justice of the former sentence and a detachment of barbarian troops was introduced into the city to suppress the emotions of the people on the vigil of easter the solemn administration of baptism was rudely interrupted by the soldiers who alarmed the modesty of the naked catechumens and violated by their presence the awful mysteries of the christian worship arsacius occupied the church of st sophia and the archiepiscopal throne the catholics retreated to the baths of constantine and afterward to the fields where they were still pursued and insulted by the guards the bishops and the magistrates the fatal day of the second and final exile of chrysostom was marked by the conflagration of the cathedral of the senate house and of the adjacent buildings and this calamity was imputed without proof but not without probability to the despair of a persecuted faction we might naturally expect such a charge from zosimus l v p     but it is remarkable enough that it should be confirmed by socrates l vi c    and the paschal chronicle p  0    cicero might claim some merit if his voluntary exile of chrysostom a d  0  june  0 banishment preserved the peace of the republic he displays those specious motives post reditum c       in the language of an orator and a politician  but the submission of chrysostom was the indispensable duty of a christian and a subject instead of listening to his humble prayer that he might be permitted to reside at cyzicus or nicomedia the inflexible empress assigned for his exile the remote and desolate town of cucusus among the ridges of mount taurus in the lesser armenia a secret hope was entertained that the archbishop might perish in a difficult and dangerous march of seventy days in the heat of summer through the provinces of asia minor where he was continually threatened by the hostile attacks of the isaurians and the more implacable fury of the monks yet chrysostom arrived in safety at the place of his confinement and the three years which he spent at cucusus and the neighboring town of arabissus were the last and most glorious of his life his character was consecrated by absence and persecution the faults of his administration were no longer remembered but every tongue repeated the praises of his genius and virtue and the respectful attention of the christian world was fixed on a desert spot among the mountains of taurus from that solitude the archbishop whose active mind was invigorated by misfortunes maintained a strict and frequent correspondence two hundred and fortytwo of the epistles of chrysostom are still extant opera tom iii p          they are addressed to a great variety of persons and show a firmness of mind much superior to that of cicero in his exile the fourteenth epistle contains a curious narrative of the dangers of his journey with the most distant provinces

extended his pastoral care to the missions of persia and scythia negociated by his ambassadors with the roman pontiff and the emperor honorius and boldly appealed from a partial synod to the supreme tribunal of a free and general council the mind of the illustrious exile was still independent but his captive body was exposed to the revenge of the oppressors who continued to abuse the name and authority of arcadius after the exile of chrysostom theophilus published an enormous and horrible volume against him in which he perpetually repeats the polite expressions of hostem humanitatis sacrilegorum principem immundum daemonem he affirms that john chrysostom had delivered his soul to be adulterated by the devil and wishes that some farther punishment adequate if possible to the magnitude of his crimes may be inflicted on him st jerome at the request of his friend theophilus translated this edifying performance from greek into latin see facundus hermian defens pro iii capitul

discontent was equally disposed to attribute to the incapacity of the monarch at length in the thirtyfirst year of his age after a reign if we may abuse that word of thirteen years three months and fifteen days arcadius expired in the palace of constantinople it is impossible to delineate his character since in a period very copiously furnished with historical materials it has not been possible to remark one action that properly belongs to the son of the great theodosius  the historian procopius procopius de bell persic l i c   p   edit louvre has indeed illuminated his supposed testament the mind of the dying emperor with a ray of human prudence or celestial wisdom arcadius considered with anxious foresight the helpless condition of his son theodosius who was no more than seven years of age the dangerous factions of a minority and the aspiring spirit of jezdegerd the persian monarch instead of tempting the allegiance of an ambitious subject by the participation of supreme power he boldly appealed to the magnanimity of a king and placed by a solemn testament the scepter of the east in the hands of jezdegerd himself the royal guardian accepted and discharged this honorable trust with unexampled fidelity and the infancy of theodosius was protected by the arms and councils of persia such is the singular narrative of procopius and his veracity is not disputed by agathias agathias l iv p         although he confesses the prevalence of the tradition he asserts that procopius was the first who had committed it to writing tillemont hist des empereurs tom vi p     argues very sensibly on the merits of this fable his criticism was not warped by any ecclesiastical authority both procopius and agathias are half pagans  while he presumes to dissent from his judgment and to arraign the wisdom of a christian emperor who so rashly though so fortunately committed his son and his dominions to the unknown faith of a stranger a rival and a heathen at the distance of one hundred and fifty years this political question might be debated in the court of justinian but a prudent historian will refuse to examine the propriety till he has ascertained the truth of the testament of arcadius as it stands without a parallel in the history of the world we may justly require that it should be attested by the positive and unanimous evidence of contemporaries the strange novelty of the event which excites our distrust must have attracted their notice and their universal silence annihilates the vain tradition of the succeeding age  the maxims of roman jurisprudence if they administration of anthemius a d  0       could fairly be transferred from private property to public dominion would have adjudged to the emperor honorius the guardianship of his nephew till he had attained at least the fourteenth year of his age but the weakness of honorius and the calamities of his reign disqualified him from prosecuting this natural claim and such was the absolute separation of the two monarchies both in interest and affection that constantinople would have obeyed with less reluctance the orders of the persian than those of the italian court under a prince whose weakness is disguised by the external signs of manhood and discretion the most worthless favorites may secretly dispute the empire of the palace and dictate to submissive provinces the commands of a master whom they direct and despise but the ministers of a child who is incapable of arming them with the sanction of the royal name must acquire and exercise an independent authority the great officers of the state and army who had been appointed before the death of arcadius formed an aristocracy which might have inspired them with the idea of a free republic and the government of the

liberality of an empress ecclesiastical history describes the splendid churches which were built at the expense of pulcheria in all the provinces of the east her charitable foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor the ample donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of monastic societies and the active severity with which she labored to suppress the opposite heresies of nestorius and eutyches such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar favor of the deity and the relics of martyrs as well as the knowledge of future events were communicated in visions and revelations to the imperial saint she was admonished by repeated dreams of the place where the relics of the forty martyrs had been buried the ground had successively belonged to the house and garden

notwithstanding the charitable wishes of dr jortin remarks tom iv p     it is not easy to acquit pulcheria of some share in the pious fraud which must have been transacted when she was more than fiveandthirty years of age  yet the devotion of pulcheria never diverted her indefatigable attention from temporal affairs and she alone among all the descendants of the great theodosius appears to have inherited any share of his manly spirit and abilities the elegant and familiar use which she had acquired both of the greek and latin languages was readily applied to the various occasions of speaking or writing on public business her deliberations were maturely weighed her actions were prompt and decisive and while she moved without noise or ostentation the wheel of government she discreetly attributed to the genius of the emperor the long tranquillity of his reign in the last years of his peaceful life europe was indeed afflicted by the arms of attila but the more extensive provinces of asia still continued to enjoy a profound and permanent repose theodosius the younger was never reduced to the disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a rebellious subject and since we cannot applaud the vigor some praise may be due to the mildness and prosperity of the administration of pulcheria  the roman world was deeply interested in the education and character of theodosius the younger education of its master a regular course of study and exercise was judiciously instituted of the military exercises of riding and shooting with the bow of the liberal studies of grammar rhetoric and philosophy the most skilful masters of the east ambitiously solicited the attention of their royal pupil and several noble youths were introduced into the palace to animate his diligence by the emulation of friendship pulcheria alone discharged the important task of instructing her brother in the arts of government but her precepts may countenance some suspicion of the extent of her capacity or of the purity of her intentions she taught him to maintain a grave and majestic deportment to walk to hold his robes to seat himself on his throne in a manner worthy of a great prince to abstain from laughter to listen with condescension to return suitable answers to assume by turns a serious or a placid countenance in a word to represent with grace and dignity the

voice of truth and the son of arcadius was condemned to pass his perpetual infancy encompassed only by a servile train of women and eunuchs the ample leisure which he acquired by neglecting the essential duties of his high office was filled by idle amusements and unprofitable studies hunting was the only active pursuit that could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace but he most assiduously labored sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving and the elegance with which he transcribed religious books entitled the roman emperor to the singular epithet of calligraphes or a fair writer separated from the world by an impenetrable veil theodosius trusted the persons whom he loved he loved those who were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence and as he never perused the papers that were presented for the royal signature the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his character were frequently perpetrated in his name the emperor himself was chaste temperate liberal and merciful but these qualities which can only deserve the name of virtues when they are supported by courage and regulated by discretion were seldom beneficial and they sometimes proved mischievous to mankind his mind enervated by a royal education was oppressed and degraded by abject superstition he fasted he sung psalms he blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines with which his faith was continually nourished theodosius devoutly worshipped the dead and living saints of the catholic church and he once refused to eat till an insolent monk who had cast an excommunication on his sovereign condescended to heal the spiritual wound which he had inflicted theodoret l v c    the bishop of cyrrhus one of the first men of his age for his learning and piety applauds the obedience of theodosius to the divine laws   the story of a fair and virtuous maiden exalted character and adventures of the empress eudocia a d        0 from a private condition to the imperial throne might be deemed an incredible romance if such a romance had not been verified in the marriage of theodosius the celebrated athenais socrates l vii c    mentions her name athenais the daughter of leontius an athenian sophist her baptism marriage and poetical genius the most ancient account of her history is in john malala part ii p  0    edit venet      and in the paschal chronicle p         those authors had probably seen original pictures of the empress eudocia the modern greeks zonaras cedrenus etc have displayed the love rather than the talent of fiction from nicephorus indeed i have ventured to assume her age the writer of a romance would not have imagined that athenais was near twentyeight years old when she inflamed the heart of a young emperor was educated by her father leontius in the religion and sciences of the greeks and so advantageous was the opinion which the athenian philosopher entertained of his contemporaries that he divided his patrimony between his two sons bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy of one hundred pieces of gold in the lively confidence that her beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion the jealousy and avarice of her brothers soon compelled athenais to seek a refuge at constantinople and with some hopes either of justice or favor to throw herself at the feet of pulcheria that sagacious princess listened to her eloquent complaint and secretly destined the daughter of the philosopher leontius for the future wife of the emperor of the east who had now attained the twentieth year of his age she easily excited the curiosity of her brother by an interesting picture of the charms of athenais large eyes a wellproportioned nose a fair complexion golden locks a slender person a graceful demeanor an understanding improved by study and a virtue tried by distress theodosius concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister was permitted to behold the athenian virgin the modest youth immediately declared his pure and honorable love and the royal nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital and the provinces athenais who was easily persuaded to renounce the errors of paganism received at her baptism the christian name of eudocia but the cautious pulcheria withheld the title of augusta till the wife of theodosius had approved her fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter who espoused fifteen years afterward the emperor of the west the brothers of eudocia obeyed with some anxiety her imperial summons but as she could easily forgive their fortunate unkindness she indulged the tenderness or perhaps the vanity of a sister by promoting them to the rank of consuls and praefects in the luxury of the palace she still cultivated those ingenious arts which had contributed to her greatness and wisely dedicated her talents to the honor of religion and of her husband eudocia composed a poetical paraphrase of the first eight books of the old testament and of the prophecies of daniel and zachariah a cento of the verses of homer applied to the life and miracles of christ the legend of st cyprian and a panegyric on the persian victories of theodosius and her writings which were applauded by a servile and superstitious age have not been disdained by the candor of impartial criticism socrates l vii c    photius p        0 the homeric cento is still extant and has been repeatedly printed but the claim of eudocia to that insipid performance is disputed by the critics see fabricius biblioth graec tom i p     the ionia a miscellaneous dictionary of history and fable was compiled by another empress of the name of eudocia who lived in the eleventh century and the work is still extant in manuscript  the fondness of the emperor was not abated by time and possession and eudocia after the marriage of her daughter was permitted to discharge her grateful vows by a solemn pilgrimage to jerusalem her ostentatious progress through the east may seem inconsistent with the spirit of christian humility she pronounced from a throne of gold and gems an eloquent oration to the senate of antioch declared her royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city bestowed a donative of two hundred pounds of gold to restore the public baths and accepted the statues which were decreed by the gratitude of antioch in the holy land her alms and pious foundations exceeded the munificence of the great helena and though the public treasure might be impoverished by this excessive liberality she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of returning to constantinople with the chains of st peter the right arm of st stephen and an undoubted picture of the virgin painted by st luke baronius annal eccles a d         is copious and florid but he is accused of placing the lies of different ages on the same level of authenticity  but this pilgrimage was the fatal term of the glories of eudocia satiated with empty pomp and unmindful perhaps of her obligations to pulcheria she ambitiously aspired to the government of the eastern empire the palace was distracted by female discord but the victory was at last decided by the superior ascendant of the sister of theodosius the execution of paulinus master of the offices and the disgrace of cyrus praetorian prefect of the east convinced the public that the favor of eudocia was insufficient to protect her most faithful friends and the uncommon beauty of paulinus encouraged the secret rumor that his guilt was that of a successful lover in this short view of the disgrace of eudocia i have imitated the caution of evagrius l i c    and count marcellinus in chron a d   0 and     the two authentic dates assigned by the latter overturn a great part of the greek fictions and the celebrated story of the apple etc is fit only for the arabian nights where something not very unlike it may be found  as soon as the empress perceived that the affection of theodosius was irretrievably lost she requested the permission of retiring to the distant solitude of jerusalem she obtained her request but the jealousy of theodosius or the vindictive spirit of pulcheria pursued her in her last retreat and saturninus count of the domestics was directed to punish with death two ecclesiastics her most favored servants eudocia instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count the furious passions which she indulged on this suspicious occasion seemed to justify the severity of theodosius and the empress ignominiously stripped of the honors of her rank priscus in excerpt legate p    a contemporary and a courtier drily mentions her pagan and christian names without adding any title of honor or respect  was disgraced perhaps unjustly in the eyes of the world the remainder of the life of eudocia about sixteen years was spent in exile and devotion and the approach of age the death of theodosius the misfortunes of her only daughter who was led a captive from rome to carthage and the society of the holy monks of palestine insensibly confirmed the religious temper of her mind after a full experience of the vicissitudes of human life the daughter of the philosopher leontius expired at jerusalem in the sixtyseventh year of her age protesting with her dying breath that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence and friendship for the two pilgrimages of eudocia and her long residence at jerusalem her devotion alms etc see socrates l vii c    and evagrius l i c  0       the paschal chronicle may sometimes deserve regard and in the domestic history of antioch john malala becomes a writer of good authority the abbe guenee in a memoir on the fertility of palestine of which i have only seen an extract calculates the gifts of eudocia at  0    pounds of gold above  00000 pounds sterling   the gentle mind of theodosius was never inflamed the persian war a d     by the ambition of conquest or military renown and the slight alarm of a persian war scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the east the motives of this war were just and honorable in the last year of the reign of jezdegerd the supposed guardian of theodosius a bishop who aspired to the crown of martyrdom destroyed one of the firetemples of susa theodoret l v c    tillemont mem eccles tom xii p          assemanni bibliot oriental tom iii p     tom iv p    theodoret blames the rashness of abdas but extols the constancy of his martyrdom yet i do not clearly understand the casuistry which prohibits our repairing the damage which we have unlawfully committed  his zeal and obstinacy were revenged on his brethren the magi excited a cruel persecution and the intolerant zeal of jezdegerd was imitated by his son vararanes or bahram who soon afterward ascended the throne some christian fugitives who escaped to the roman frontier were sternly demanded and generously refused and the refusal aggravated by commercial disputes soon kindled a war between the rival monarchies the mountains of armenia and the plains of mesopotamia were filled with hostile armies but the operations of two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive or memorable events some engagements were fought some towns were besieged with various and doubtful success and if the romans failed in their attempt to recover the long lost possession of nisibis the persians were repulsed from the walls of a mesopotamian city by the valor of a martial bishop who pointed his thundering engine in the name of st thomas the apostle yet the splendid victories which the incredible speed of the messenger palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of constantinople were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics from these panegyrics the socrates l vii c        0    is the best author for the persian war we may likewise consult the three chronicles the paschal and those of marcellinus and malala historians of the age might borrow their extraordinary and perhaps fabulous tales of the proud challenge of a persian hero who was entangled by the net and dispatched by the sword of areobindus the goth of the ten thousand immortals who were slain in the attack of the roman camp and of the hundred thousand arabs or saracens who were impelled by a panic terror to throw themselves headlong into the euphrates such events may be disbelieved or disregarded but the charity of a bishop acacius of amida whose name might have dignified the saintly calendar shall not be lost in oblivion boldly declaring that vases of gold and silver are useless to a god who neither eats nor drinks the generous prelate sold the plate of the church of amida employed the price in the redemption of seven thousand persian captives supplied their wants with affectionate liberality and dismissed them to their native country to inform the king of the true spirit of the religion which he persecuted the practice of benevolence in the midst of war must always tend to assuage the animosity of contending nations and i wish to persuade myself that acacius contributed to the restoration of peace in the conference which was held on the limits of the two empires the roman ambassadors degraded the personal character of their sovereign by a vain attempt to magnify the extent of his power when they seriously advised the persians to prevent by a timely accommodation the wrath of a monarch who was yet ignorant of this distant war a truce of one hundred years was solemnly ratified and although the revolutions of armenia might threaten the public tranquillity the essential conditions of this treaty were respected near fourscore years by the successors of constantine and artaxerxes  since the roman and parthian standards first armenia divided between the persians and the romans encountered on the banks of the euphrates the kingdom of armenia this account of the ruin and division of the kingdom of armenia is taken from the third book of the armenian history of moses of chorene deficient as he is in every qualification of a good historian his local information his passions and his prejudices are strongly expressive of a native and contemporary procopius de edificiis l iii c     relates the same facts in a very different manner but i have extracted the circumstances the most probable in themselves and the least inconsistent with moses of chorene was alternately oppressed by its formidable protectors and in the course of this history several events which inclined the balance of peace and war have been already related a d        0 a disgraceful treaty had resigned armenia to the ambition of sapor and the scale of persia appeared to preponderate but the royal race of arsaces impatiently submitted to the house of sassan the turbulent nobles asserted or betrayed their hereditary independence and the nation was still attached to the christian princes of constantinople in the beginning of the fifth century armenia was divided by the progress of war and faction the western armenians used the greek language and characters in their religious offices but the use of that hostile tongue was prohibited by the persians in the eastern provinces which were obliged to use the syriac till the invention of the armenian letters by mesrobes in the beginning of the fifth century and the subsequent version of the bible into the armenian language an event which relaxed the connection of the church and nation with constantinople  and the unnatural division precipitated the downfall of that ancient monarchy chosroes the persian vassal reigned over the eastern and most extensive portion of the country while the western province acknowledged the jurisdiction of arsaces and the supremacy of the emperor arcadius after the death of arsaces the romans suppressed the regal government and imposed on their allies the condition of subjects the military command was delegated to the count of the armenian frontier the city of theodosiopolis moses choren l iii c    p  0  and p     procopius de edificiis l iii c   theodosiopolis stands or rather stood about thirtyfive miles to the east of arzeroum the modern capital of turkish armenia see danville geographie ancienne tom ii p     00 was built and fortified in a strong situation on a fertile and lofty ground near the sources of the euphrates and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps whose dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple the less fortunate nobles who lamented the loss of their king and envied the honors of their equals were provoked to negociate their peace and pardon at the persian court and returning with their followers to the palace of artaxata acknowledged chosroes for their lawful sovereign about thirty years afterward artasires the nephew and successor of chosroes fell under the displeasure of the haughty and capricious nobles of armenia and they unanimously desired a persian governor in the room of an unworthy king the answer of the archbishop isaac whose sanction they earnestly solicited is expressive of the character of a superstitious people he deplored the manifest and inexcusable vices of artasires and declared that he should not hesitate to accuse him before the tribunal of a christian emperor who would punish without destroying the sinner our king continued isaac is too much addicted to licentious pleasures but he has been purified in the holy waters of baptism he is a lover of women but he does not adore the fire or the elements he may deserve the reproach of lewdness but he is an undoubted catholic and his faith is pure though his manners are flagitious i will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage of devouring wolves and you would soon repent your rash exchange of the infirmities of a believer for the specious virtues of an heathen moses choren l iii c    p     according to the institution of st gregory the apostle of armenia the archbishop was always of the royal family a circumstance which in some degree corrected the influence of the sacerdotal character and united the mitre with the crown  exasperated by the firmness of isaac the factious nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as the secret adherents of the emperor and absurdly rejoiced in the sentence of condemnation which after a partial hearing was solemnly pronounced by bahram himself the descendants of arsaces were degraded from the royal dignity a branch of the royal house of arsaces still subsisted with the rank and possessions as it should seem of armenian satraps see moses choren l iii c    p      which they had possessed above five hundred and sixty years valarsaces was appointed king of armenia by his brother the parthian monarch immediately after the defeat of antiochus sidetes moses choren l ii c   p    one hundred

dominions of the unfortunate artasires under the new and significant appellation of persarmenia were reduced into the form of a province this usurpation excited the jealousy of the roman government but the rising disputes were soon terminated by an amicable though unequal partition of the ancient kingdom of armenia and a territorial acquisition which augustus might have despised reflected some luster on the declining empire of the younger theodosius  end of the fifth volume
