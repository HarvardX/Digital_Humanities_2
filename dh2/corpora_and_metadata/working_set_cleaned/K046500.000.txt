honorable countess spencer whose approbation and esteem were justly considered by mr garrick as the highest panegyric his talents or conduct could acquire this imperfect tribute to his memory is with great deference inscribed by her ladyships most obedient humble servant  richard brinsley sheridan march   th      if dying excellence deserves a tear if fond remembrance still is cherished here can we persist to bid your sorrows flow for fabled sufferers and delusive woe or with quaint smiles dismiss the plaintive strain point the quick jest  indulge the comic vein  ere yet to buried roscius we assign  one kind regret  one tributary line his fame requires we act a tenderer part  his memory claims the tear you gave his art the general voice the meed of mournful verse the splendid sorrows that adorned his hearse the throng that mourned as their dead favorite passed the graced respect that claimed him to the last while shakespeares image from its hallowed base seemed to prescribe the grave and point the place  nor these  nor all the sad regrets that flow from fond fidelitys domestic woe  so much are garricks praise  so much his due  as on this spot  one tear bestowed by you amid the arts which seek ingenuous fame our toil attempts the most precarious claim to him whose mimic pencil wins the prize obedient fame immortal wreaths supplies whatever of wonder reynolds now may raise raphael still boasts cotemporary praise each dazzling light and gaudier bloom subdued with undiminishd awe his works are viewed even beautys portrait wears a softer prime touched by the tender hand of mellowing time the patient sculptor owns an humbler part a ruder toil and more mechanic art content with slow and timorous stroke to trace the lingering line and mould the tardy grace but once achieved  though barbarous wreck oerthrow the sacred fane and lay its glories low yet shall the sculptured ruin rise to day graced by defect and worshipped in decay the enduring record bears the

guard by whose faint breath his merits must abide unvouchd by proof  to substance unallied even matchless garricks art to heaven resigned no fixed effect no model leaves behind the grace of action  the adapted mien faithful as nature to the varied scene the expressive glance  whose subtle comment draws entranced attention and a mute applause gesture that marks with force and feeling fraught a sense in silence and a will in thought harmonious speech whose pure and liquid tone gives verse a music scarce confessed its own as light from gems assumes a brighter ray and clothed with orient hues transcends the day  passions wild break  and frown that awes the sense and every charm of gentler eloquence  all perishable  like the electric fire but strike the frame  and as they strike expire incense too pure a bodied flame to bear it is fragrance charms the sense and blends with air where then  while sunk in cold decay he lies and pale eclipse for ever veils those eyes  where is the blessed memorial that ensures our garricks fame  whose is the trust  it is yours and o by every charm his art essayed to sooth your cares  by every grief allayed by the hushed wonder which his accents drew by his last parting tear repaid by you by all those thoughts which many a distant night shall mark his memory with a sad delight  still in your hearts dear record bear his name cherish the keen regret that lifts his fame to you it is bequeathed assert the trust and to his worth  it is all you can  be just what more is due from sanctifying time to cheerful wit and many a favored rhyme over his graced urn shall bloom a deathless wreath whose blossomed sweets shall deck the mask beneath for these  when sculptures votive toil shall rear the due memorial of a loss so dear  o lovliest mourner gentle muse be thine the pleasing woe to guard the laurelld shrine as fancy often by superstition led to roam the mansions of the sainted dead has viewed by shadowy eves unfaithful gloom a weeping cherub on a martyrs tomb  so thou sweet muse hang over his sculptured bier with patient woe that loves the lingering tear with thoughts that mourn  nor yet desire relief with meek regret and fond enduring grief with looks that speak  he never shall return  chilling thy tender bosom clasp his urn and with soft sighs disperse the irreverend dust which time may strew upon his sacred bust
